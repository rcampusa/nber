                                          ABSTRACT

This paper takes stock of what we have learned from the “Renaissance” in fiscal research in the
ten years since the financial crisis. I first summarize the new innovations in methodology and
discuss the various strengths and weaknesses of the main approaches. Reviewing the estimates, I
come to the surprising conclusion that the bulk of the estimates for average spending and tax
change multipliers lie in a fairly narrow range, 0.6 to 1 for spending multipliers and -2 to -3 for
tax change multipliers. However, I identify economic circumstances in which multipliers lie
outside those ranges. I conclude by reviewing the debate on whether multipliers were higher on
the stimulus spending in the U.S. and the fiscal consolidations in Europe.

       When the financial crisis hit ten years ago and policy interest rates fell to their near-zero

percent lower bound, policymakers around the world turned to fiscal stimulus packages in order

to prevent their economies from freefalling into another Great Depression. But then, as declining

GDP and tax revenues led to deteriorating government budget deficits and worries about rising

sovereign debt, numerous countries abandoned their fiscal stimulus packages and instead adopted

fiscal consolidation measures. While attempting to forecast the impacts of these various fiscal

programs, policymakers and academics were surprised to learn not only a lack of consensus about

the size of the effects of fiscal policy, but that there had not even been much research on the topic

since the 1960s. A small army of researchers across many countries turned their attention to this

important, but long-neglected, topic.

       This paper takes a snapshot of the state of knowledge about the effects of fiscal policy ten

years after the global financial crisis, during which time important progress has been made on

theory, empirical methods, and data. The theoretical innovations include the analysis of the effects

of sticky prices, hand-to-mouth consumers, lower bounds on policy interest rates, currency unions,

the type of financing, and anticipations on the reactions of macroeconomic variables to fiscal

policy. Contributions in empirical methods include new ways to identify exogenous variation in

policy, standardization of methods for computing multipliers, and the incorporation of state

dependence. On the data front, researchers now have newly constructed historical and cross-

sectional data sets, and are also exploiting the rich new data created by the variety of policymakers’

fiscal responses to the crisis. These advancements offer the potential to estimate the effects of

government spending with more precision and with a better understanding of how the effects

depend on the particular context.




                                                  1
       In 2011, I surveyed the pre-crisis and early crisis literature in the Journal of Economic

Literature. In that paper, which focused only on temporary, deficit-financed increases in

government purchases, I concluded based on the evidence available from US data at that time that

the multiplier was probably between 0.8 to 1.5, but that the data did not reject a range from 0.5 to

2. The current paper refines those estimates and broadens the inquiry to consider the effects of tax

and transfer policy, as well as the effects of fiscal consolidations, in developed countries.

However, attention is still limited to the short- or medium-run effects, because the methods for

estimating long-run effects are quite different.

       My summary of the current state of knowledge about the effects of fiscal policies can be

divided into three categories: government purchases multipliers, tax rate change multipliers, and

multipliers in the wake of the financial crisis.

       For multipliers on general government purchases, the evidence from developed countries

suggests that they are positive but less than or equal to unity, meaning that government purchases

raise GDP but do not stimulate additional private activity and may actually crowd it out. The bulk

of the estimates across the leading methods of estimation and samples lie in a surprisingly narrow

range of 0.6 to 1. However, this range widens once one distinguishes country characteristics, such

as the exchange rate regime, and the type of government spending, such as infrastructure spending.

The evidence for higher spending multipliers during recessions or times of high unemployment is

fragile, and the most robust results suggest multipliers of one or below during these periods. The

evidence for higher government spending multipliers during periods in which monetary policy is

very accommodative, such as zero lower bound periods, is somewhat stronger. Recent time series

estimates for the United States and Japan suggest that multipliers could be 1.5 or higher during




                                                   2
those times. Estimated and calibrated New Keynesian models for the U.S. and Europe also imply

higher multipliers under certain conditions.

    For tax rate change multipliers, the estimates implied by the leading methods do not agree.

Narrative methods for tax rate changes typically yield multiplier estimates that are surprisingly

large and surprisingly uniform across a number of countries. The bulk of the empirical estimates

vary between -2 and -3. In contrast, most calibrated and estimated dynamic stochastic general

equilibrium models imply smaller multipliers, typically below unity for both labor and capital tax

multipliers. Time series evidence, theory, and estimated New Keynesian dynamic stochastic

general equilibrium models all point tax multipliers being greater in magnitude during expansions

than in recessions—that is, these measures suggest that tax multipliers may be procyclical. .

    Fiscal multipliers might be different in the wake of a financial crisis. However, the evidence

for larger national multipliers on the 2009 Obama stimulus package is at best weak. Quantitative

New Keynesian models do not find larger multipliers. Multipliers estimated on cross-state data

appear larger at first, but shrink once they are adjusted to be nationally representative. The latest

studies on multipliers during the fiscal consolidations in Europe suggest that they were not higher

than usual, either.

        This paper begins by reviewing how theory highlights the dependence of the size of the

multipliers on numerous features of the policy and the economy. The next section summarizes

strengths and weaknesses of the leading empirical approaches to identifying exogenous shifts in

fiscal policy. The paper then highlights the innovations of the last ten years in estimating fiscal

multipliers. One interesting finding is that the wide range of multipliers reported earlier narrows

significantly once methods for calculating multipliers are standardized. The following section

reviews the leading estimates of spending and tax multipliers, including those based on aggregate




                                                 3
time series, estimated theoretical models, and subnational units and households. It also discusses

the complexities of drawing aggregate inferences from parameters estimated on household data.

The penultimate section asks what we know about whether multipliers were higher in the wake of

the financial crisis. The final section offers some brief conclusions.



What Does Theory Predict About Fiscal Multipliers?



       If we simply want to know how much GDP changes if we increase government spending

by one dollar or reduce tax rates by one percentage point, why do we need theory? Theory tells

us that there is not one government spending or tax multiplier. Rather, the effect of fiscal changes

on output and other variables potentially depends on: 1) the persistence of the change; 2) the type

of spending or taxes that changed; 3) how the policy was financed; 4) whether it was anticipated;

5) how the policy was distributed across potentially heterogeneous agents; 6) how monetary policy

reacted; 7) the state of the economy when the policy took effect; and 8) other features that

characterize the economy such as level of development, exchange rate regime, and openness.

Because policymakers cannot conduct randomized control trials, virtually all multiplier estimates

are based on time series, narrative, or natural experiment identification using samples determined

by historical happenstance. To understand whether a particular estimate of fiscal effects is suitable

for use in predicting the effects of a proposed policy, one must understand how the current

circumstances differ from those present in the sample used to generate that estimate.

       Most researchers and policymakers had their first exposure to the theoretical effects of

fiscal policy in the Keynesian cross model of undergraduate textbooks, which assumes that GDP

is demand-determined. This model further assumes that the government spending multiplier is the



                                                  4
inverse of one minus the marginal propensity to consume: thus, a marginal propensity to consume

of 0.5 yields a multiplier of two. Because taxes enter the multiplier only through their effect on

disposable income in this model, the tax multipliers are smaller than the spending multipliers.

Expansion of the model to consider the marginal propensity to import, tax rates, and monetary

policy reduces those simple multipliers.

       Neoclassical models with variable labor supply and capital stock also predict positive

spending multipliers and negative (distortionary) tax multipliers, but the mechanism is completely

different from the one at the heart of the traditional Keynesian model. In these models, an increase

in government spending has a negative wealth effect, because the government is extracting

resources from the private sector. This negative wealth effect raises GDP because it causes

households to work more. Distortionary tax rate changes can have potentially large effects in these

models, but contrary to the simple Keynesian model, they work through “supply side” channels.

       The New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models meld the

insights from the traditional Keynesian and neoclassical approaches in a rigorous way. The

standard representative-agent sticky-price New Keynesian model with no financial frictions tends

to produce multipliers below one for government spending. Models that add sticky wages and

workers who are “off their labor supply curves” generate larger multipliers. In the last decade,

representative agent models have been expanded to include heterogeneous agents and financial

market frictions. In these models, either “rule-of-thumb” behavior or wealth held in illiquid assets

leads agents to have much higher marginal propensities to consume than predicted by the

permanent income hypothesis. These features can lead to spending multipliers above one when

spending is deficit financed (e.g. Auclert, Rognlie, and Straub (2018), Table 3). Alternatively, the

models have explored the effects of fiscal policy when monetary policy deviates from the standard




                                                 5
Taylor rule (higher interest rates when        inflation is high and lower interest rates when

unemployment is high) because interest rates are constrained by the zero lower bound. Both of

these extensions result in higher multipliers, often above unity.

       Clearly, when one is trying to estimate the effects of a specific fiscal policy, one must be

aware of which macroeconomic model is being used, along with other factors like persistence of

a path of government spending, how it is financed, and many other characteristics such as the

exchange rate regime.



A Summary of Leading Empirical Approaches



       Numerous empirical approaches have been used to estimate the effects of fiscal policies. I

group these approaches into three broad categories: 1) aggregate country-level time series or panel

estimates; 2) estimated or calibrated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models; and

3) subnational geographic cross-section or panel estimates.

       The first two categories--time series evidence at the national level and estimated/calibrated

dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models—share the advantage that the estimates produced

are directly informative about the national-level multipliers that are the focus of most

policymakers. The time series approach has the advantage of not being tied to a particular

structural model. On the other hand, the DSGE model approach can be used to perform

counterfactuals because it seeks to estimate structural parameters.




                                                 6
           However, these two approaches share some of the same weaknesses. Identification of

macroeconomic parameters is always difficult and the estimation of the aggregate effects of fiscal

policy is no exception. The time series approach requires exogenous variation in policy. The

leading approaches to identifying this exogenous variation are structural vector autoregressions

and natural experiment methods, combined with narrative methods that use historical documents

to create new data series of exogenous changes. Too often, though, the variations that turn out to

be exogenous yield instruments that are not very relevant—that is, they have low correlation with

the fiscal variable they are trying to explain—and the variations that are relevant are not always

exogenous or are anticipated in advance.

           Although many papers using estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models

never mention the word identification, identification is as crucial to this approach as it is to any

other approach seeking to estimate a causal relationship. The DSGE approach identifies the effects

of fiscal policy by using strong assumptions about the theoretical model structure and the time

series processes driving the unobserved shocks. But such estimated DSGE models are not immune

to weak identification (for discussion, see Canova and Sala 2009).

           The third approach of estimating across subnational units, such as states or provinces, is

more similar to applied microeconomics approaches. These approaches typically seek

identification using a natural experiment approach or Bartik-style instrumental variables (which

are based on interacting the distribution of industry shares across locations with national industry

growth rates). 1 These analyses at lower levels of aggregation tend to have much stronger

identification, in the sense that the necessary identifying assumptions are typically more plausible

and the instruments are relevant. Moreover, these approaches can be used on a variety of datasets.

However, this approach does not lead directly macroeconomic estimates. Why? Any cross-

sectional estimating equation includes a constant term, which means that the macroeconomic

effects have been netted out and the parameters estimated are only relative effects. Such

parameters answer the question: if State A is awarded $1 more in defense prime contracts than the

average state, by how much does its employment change relative to the average state? In order to

infer the implied national-level effects from such microeconomic estimates, researchers must then

return to macroeconomic DSGE models, which, as discussed above, incorporate their own

additional identifying assumptions. There is no “applied micro free lunch” for macroeconomists:

identification of macroeconomic effects must always depend on macroeconomic identification

assumptions.

       To summarize, there are several approaches to estimating the effects of fiscal policy. Each

has its strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, some of the estimates are more appropriate for

forecasting the effects of specific policies under certain conditions than others. For these reasons,

it is useful to consider estimates across a range of different approaches.



Research Innovations and Lessons Learned During the Last Ten Years



         Before the financial crisis, only a few isolated researchers studied the macroeconomic

effects of fiscal policy and few conferences brought these researchers together. As a result,

different researchers chose different methods and there was no agreed upon set of best practices.

The situation has changed dramatically since the financial crisis, with many conferences devoted

to the study of fiscal policies and much more interaction among researchers studying fiscal policy.

As a result, the diffusion of knowledge among researchers has been much faster and the literature



                                                  8
has progressed at a very fast pace. In this section, I will highlight some of the new innovations

and the lessons learned from this literature.



Calculating Multipliers in a Dynamic Environment

        One often sees references to the “wide range” of multiplier estimates. The literature has

come to realize that differences in reported multiplier estimates are often due not so much to

differences in identification methods or samples, but to the methods used to construct multiplier

from the raw estimates. In fact, what some researchers call “multipliers” have little to do with the

multipliers of interest to policymakers. This section begins with some insights gained over the last

decade regarding the computation of multipliers. I begin with spending multipliers and then

address a further complication involved with tax multipliers.

        Fiscal policy has dynamic effects on output and government budgets. A typical fiscal plan

will set into motion a path of spending or taxes over time, and then GDP will respond dynamically

to that path. The multiplier must take into account both the multi-year effects of the fiscal plan on

the government budget, in order to count the costs fully, as well as the multi-year effects on GDP,

in order to count the benefits fully.

        Computation of multipliers was not a focus of the research in the decades before the

financial crisis.   Indeed, two decades ago in Ramey and Shapiro (1998) on the effects of

government spending, we did not even mention the word “multiplier.” When describing the

patterns of the responses of GDP to spending and tax shocks, Blanchard and Perotti (2002) used

the word “multiplier,” but the quantities they calculated were not true dynamic multipliers; instead,

Blanchard and Perotti calculated multipliers as the ratio of the output response at a particular

horizon, or at its peak, to the impact effect of the shock on government spending. Many subsequent




                                                 9
papers adopted their method, despite the fact that it did not take into account the multi-year path

of spending or taxes. Mountford and Uhlig (2009) moved the literature forward by introducing

the policy-relevant multipliers, calculated as the present discounted value of the output response

over time divided by the present discounted value of the government spending response over time

to the shock. In most applications, the interest rate used for this present discounted value—

including the use of a zero discount rate—gives nearly identical multipliers because the timing of

the government spending and output responses is very similar. These multipliers are often known

as present value or cumulative multipliers.

       How much do multiplier estimates differ across these various methods of calculating

multipliers? It depends importantly on how much government spending rises after the initial

impact. Here is one illustration of a situation in which it makes a big difference. I estimate a

structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model of the Blanchard and Perotti (2002) type over the

period 1939:1 – 2015:4 using Ramey and Zubairy’s (2018) data set. The model contains five

endogenous macroeconomic variables: government spending, GDP, and federal tax receipts (with

all three deflated by the GDP deflator, divided by population, and in logs), along with the three-

month Treasury bill interest rate and inflation (measured as the log change in the GDP deflator).

Four lags are included in order to model the dynamics. The exogenous shock to government

spending is identified using Blanchard and Perotti’s (2002) method, which assumes that any part

of government spending not forecasted by lags of any of the variables included in the model is an

exogenous shock to government spending.

       Figure 1 shows the estimated impulse responses of the log of the government spending

variable and the log of the GDP variable (notice that the vertical scales are not the same). The

shaded area shows the 95-percent confidence bands. As the graph illustrates, a positive shock to




                                                10
government spending leads both government spending and GDP to jump up on impact, but then

to continue to rise, peaking after about a year. Because the variables are in log form, the impulse

responses show elasticities, not the dollar changes required by multipliers, so multipliers cannot

be read directly from the graphs. The standard practice until recently had been to use an ad hoc

conversion factor. That is, researchers who specified models using logarithms converted the

elasticity estimates, i.e. 𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥(𝑌𝑌)/𝛥𝛥𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐺𝐺), to multipliers, 𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥/𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥, by multiplying the elasticity

estimates by the average of the ratio of GDP to total government spending, 𝑌𝑌/𝐺𝐺, over the sample.

This ratio is 4.78 for the sample in this illustration. I will critique the use of these conversion

factors shortly.

         Figure 2 shows the multipliers calculated three different ways. The highest multiplier is

given by Blanchard-Perotti’s (2002) method for calculating a multiplier, which I will call a quasi-

multiplier. 2 It is calculated as the ratio of the impulse response of output at horizon h to the initial

jump in government spending at horizon 0 (multiplied by the average 𝑌𝑌/𝐺𝐺). Their method, shown

by the dashed line, essentially traces out a renormalized version of the impulse response of output.

In this case, it yields multipliers that peak at 2.2 at quarter 6. The Mountford and Uhlig (2009)

present value cumulative multiplier, shown by the solid line, uses the ratio of the present value of

the integral of impulse response of output to the present value of the integral of the impulse

response of government spending up to each horizon h (again multiplied by the average Y/G

factor). This multiplier varies between 0.7 and 1, depending on the horizon. The discounting uses

the average three-month Treasury bill rate over the sample, 3.6 percent on an annual basis, but

because the timing of the shift the simple cumulative version is almost identical.




2
 Note that the Blanchard-Perotti identification method is distinct from the Blanchard-Perotti method for calculating
multipliers; their method for calculating multipliers could be applied to estimates using any identification method.


                                                         11
       Now let us return to the issues raised by the practice of converting elasticities with the ad

hoc conversion factor, the average of 𝑌𝑌/𝐺𝐺 over the sample. Owyang, Ramey, and Zubairy (2013)

discovered biases that could arise from this practice. In their historical sample, Y/G varied

significantly, from 2 to 24, with a mean of 8. Sims and Wolff (2018a, b) also discovered that this

practice tends to bias multipliers differentially, making them seem much higher during recessions.

The intuition is straightforward: because GDP is cyclical but government spending is not, the

movement of 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 /𝐺𝐺𝑡𝑡 is procylical. However, the practice of using a sample average of 𝑌𝑌/𝐺𝐺 to

convert elasticities to multipliers makes the multipliers appear more countercyclical than they

really are. Owyang Ramey, and Zubairy avoided this problem by using the transformations

employed by Hall (2010) and Barro and Redlick (2011): both the change in government spending

and the change in GDP are divided by lagged GDP. Another transformation that overcomes the

problem is Gordon and Krenn’s (2010) transformation, which divides both government spending

and GDP by a measure of potential GDP.

       To illustrate the effect of moving from a specification in logarithms that requires the ad

hoc conversion factor to one that does not, I re-estimate the model from Figures 1 and 2 using

Gordon and Krenn’s (2010) transformation for government spending, GDP, and taxes, employing

Ramey and Zubairy’s (2018) polynomial trend estimate of potential GDP. The general shape of

the estimated impulse responses (not shown) is very similar to those from the log specification,

but the directly estimated multipliers are different. The solid line with diamonds in Figure 2 shows

the cumulative multiplier estimates based on the impulse responses from this alternative




                                                12
specification. These directly-estimated multipliers, which do not rely on a conversion factor, are

lower and range from 0.8 on impact down to 0.6. 3

        Thus, deceptively small changes in the method of calculation can make a very big

difference in the resulting multipliers. For this application, using Blanchard and Perotti’s (2002)

quasi-multiplier for government spending on estimated elasticities requiring an ad hoc conversion

factor produces a multiplier as high as 2.2. That multiplier falls below 0.8 when the fully dynamic

Mountford and Uhlig (2009) cumulative multiplier is used on estimates based on data using the

Gordon and Krenn (2010) transformation.                Clearly, such differences could have important

consequences for the decisions of policymakers.

        In addition, even the cumulative multipliers do not fully reflect the consequences for the

government budget. If an increase in government spending raises GDP, then we would expect a

rise in tax revenues. Thus, even without an exogenous increase in tax rates, we would expect the

government budget deficit to rise less than the total amount of government spending. This insight

raises a complication when applying these same principles to the computation of tax multipliers,

with one additional complication. While there is strong feedback from GDP to tax revenue, there

is little feedback from GDP to government spending. As a result, the negative effect of a tax cut

on tax revenue is tempered by the feedback from the expansionary effect on output. Indeed,

Mertens and Ravn (2013) were not able to compute a multiplier for corporate tax cuts because

their large positive impact on GDP resulted in no net effect on tax revenues. Because of the

presence of these “top of the Laffer curve” effects in some applications, most papers report

multipliers using the tax changes measured as the legislative forecasts of the expected cumulative



3
 This bias also affects the multipliers I reported in Ramey (2011a). The cumulative multipliers based on the
elasticity estimates and conversion factor were 1.2. However, in Ramey (2013), I found evidence that private
spending fell, which is inconsistent with a multiplier above 1.


                                                        13
effect on tax revenues, not accounting for dynamic feedback from any potential induced GDP

changes.



The Importance of Fiscal Foresight

       An important innovation in the fiscal literature in the last decade is the recognition that

many changes in government spending and taxes are announced in advance. In Ramey (2011a), I

showed the importance of anticipations for estimating the effects of government spending shocks,

particularly those involving military spending. For example, the responses of key variables such

as consumption could change signs if researchers ignored the fact that many changes in

government spending are anticipated by at least several quarters. A number of papers also show

that “shocks” identified in standard ways are predicted by professional forecasts of government

spending. On the tax front, House and Shapiro (2006) and Mertens and Ravn (2012) demonstrated

the importance of distinguishing between changes in taxes implemented soon after legislation and

changes in taxes implemented with a lag after legislation or phased in slowly. Both papers showed

that while unanticipated tax cuts have expansionary effects on output, phased-in tax cuts depress

output during the phase-in period because firms and consumers delay their activity until tax rates

are lower. Leeper, Walker, and Yang (2013) derived the econometric biases that arise when there

is this type of fiscal foresight. As a result of this work, most of the literature tries to address

anticipation whenever feasible, either by constructing measures of news (from narratives or bond

spreads) or by including professional forecasts of government spending to mitigate the problem.



Improvements in Fiscal Shock Identification




                                                14
        Any analysis that seeks to measure a causal effect must confront identification issues. An

example of the problem that arises here is that if governments increase spending in response to a

recession, then the simple correlation between government spending and GDP will confound the

positive causal effect of government spending on GDP with the negative causal effect of GDP on

government spending. In the past, the standard macro approach used to tease out the exogenous

rise in government spending was a structural vector autoregression (SVAR). In most applications,

this approach is based on the assumption that the exogenous part of government spending was the

part of government spending not forecasted by lagged values of spending, GDP, and taxes.

Alternatively, to identify exogenous movements in taxes, Blanchard and Perotti (2002) used

external estimates of the tax revenue elasticity to income, which allowed identification of the

component of taxes that was not induced by movements in GDP. Several papers have highlighted

potential problems with these widely-used methods. First as discussed above, failing to account

for fiscal foresight could lead to biased estimates. Second, the tax multiplier estimates were very

sensitive to the value of the external tax elasticity estimate used (for example, Mertens and Ravn

2014; Caldara and Kamps 2017). These concerns led to the development of other identification

methods using natural experiments and narrative methods. As a result, the standard SVAR

identification approach is no longer the first resort in the literature on fiscal multipliers.

        In fact, long before structural vector autoregression methods were used, Hall (1980) and

Barro (1981) used natural experiment methods to assess the effects of exogenous increases in

government spending. Arguing that changes in US defense spending are typically driven by wars

rather than the current state of the economy, they used war-induced government spending to

estimate causal effects of government spending in US historical data. Ramey and Shapiro (1998)

and numerous other follow-up papers built on treating wars as a natural experiment. This method




                                                   15
that works well for US data, but it does not export well to other countries. Most countries either

do not have the substantial fluctuations in defense spending experienced by the United States or

they have large variations that are accompanied by war-related destruction of the capital stock,

which leads to confounding effects.

       Other examples of recent fiscal research that use natural experiment methods abound. For

example, Acconcia, Corsetti, and Simonelli (2014) used the central government response to Mafia

infiltration as an exogenous change in government spending in Italian provinces. Many of the

analyses of the Obama stimulus allocation of funds across states used natural experiment methods.

Two analysis of marginal propensities to spend out of the temporary rebates of 2001 and 2008

exploited the randomized timing of the mailing of checks to households (Johnson, Parker, and

Souleles 2006; Parker, Souleles, Johnson, and McClelland’s 2013). The application of these

methods has shed significant light on the effects of fiscal policy, particularly at the local and

household level.

       Romer and Romer (2010) pioneered the use of narrative methods to identify tax changes

that are exogenous to the state of the economy. For the post-World War II US economy, they read

legislative records to identify whether tax changes were due either to inherited deficits or to beliefs

about their ability to promote long-term growth. Their method is easily exported to other countries

and it has now become the standard method for assessing the effects of tax changes across a wide

range of countries (for example, Guajardo, Leigh, and Pescatori 2014). Mertens and Ravn (2012)

improved their measure by splitting their series into anticipated and unanticipated tax changes, so

that the effects of fiscal foresight could be addressed. Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi (forthcoming)

has added to the narrative analysis of fiscal consolidations by creating narrative series of fiscal




                                                  16
plans. As they emphasize, most fiscal consolidations involve multi-year plans and those effects

should be studied as a whole rather than as independent year-by-year isolated changes.

       An additional innovation in the identification of fiscal shocks has been the recognition of

the importance of instrument “relevance”—that is, whether the proposed instrument is actually

correlated with the variable it is supposed to instrument.        While early alarms about weak

instruments were raised for macro studies by Nelson and Startz (1990) and for microeconomic

studies by Bound, Baker, and Jaeger (1995), most macroeconomists began to pay attention to the

issue only in the last five to ten years. The structural vector autoregression methodology hid the

fact that the estimation of multipliers was actually an instrumental variables estimation. Ramey

(2016) and Ramey and Zubairy (2018) showed that cumulative multipliers could be estimated in

a one-step instrumental variables method based on local projects: cumulative GDP up to horizon

h is regressed on cumulative government spending up to horizon h, using an SVAR shock or a

narrative variable as an instrument. However, that recognition highlighted a widespread problem:

many of the exogenous measures of fiscal policy are not very relevant instruments, at all or in

some subsamples. For example, the military news variable I first introduced in Ramey (2011a) is

a weak instrument for the post-1954 period, as are the alternative measures of defense news of

Fisher and Peters (2010) and Ben Zeev and Pappa (2017). In contrast, the Blanchard and Perotti

(2002) shock is a strong instrument by its nature, particularly at short horizons, since it is simply

the one-step ahead forecast error of government spending.



       In sum, research on the effects of fiscal policy has made significant strides in methodology.

The literature now exploits many new datasets. It has imported some innovations from the applied

microeconomics literature, and has extended them in important ways that account for anticipations




                                                 17
and dynamics. Moreover, those estimates are now converted to multipliers defined in a way that

is relevant for policymakers.



A Summary of Estimates of Spending and Tax Multipliers



        This section summarizes the actual estimates of fiscal multipliers obtained from the

leading methods. I begin with estimates based on aggregate data. I first review the estimated

multipliers on government purchases, initially averages and then by state-dependence, and then

move on to the effects of tax changes and transfer payments. I then discuss estimates of the effects

of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the fiscal consolidations in Europe.



Government Spending Multipliers Based on Aggregate Data

       Table 1 shows a sampling of estimates of government spending multipliers, grouped by

method. Panel A shows estimates based on a variety of time series implementations and for a

number of countries. Virtually all estimates shown are based on present value or undiscounted

cumulative multipliers; in some cases, I updated the original estimates to apply best practices. As

shown in Figure 2, the cumulative multipliers usually do not vary greatly across horizons up to

five years, so there is little difference between average or peak multipliers. Panel B shows

estimates based on New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. On balance,

the estimated multipliers are not very different across the two leading methods for identifying

government spending shocks in time series, nor for estimated New Keynesian dynamic stochastic

general equilibrium models. The estimates show that for a variety of samples, identification

methods, and countries, most of the estimates are around one or below. A few estimates are



                                                18
noticeably above one, such as the Ben Zeev and Pappa (2017) estimate, but they tend to be less

precise and are not statistically different from one. 4

           Not shown in the table are numerous multiplier estimates based on key features of a

country. For example, Iltzetzki, Mendoza, Vegh (2010) estimate how multipliers change across

various important features, such as whether an economy has fixed or flexible exchange rates. They

find multipliers that vary between 0.1 on impact to 1.4 long-run (with a 90-percent confidence

interval from around 0.75 to 2.1) for fixed exchange rates and from 0.1 to -0.7 for flexible exchange

rates. Thus, the range of estimated multipliers may become much wider when one begins to

distinguish by key country characteristics.

           The results shown in Table 1 are for total government spending or government

consumption. Earlier work by Aschauer (1989), Pereira and Flores de Frutos (1999), and others

found high returns to public investment. There is surprisingly little recent aggregate evidence on

multipliers for public investment. As one example, Iltzetzki, Mendoza, Vegh (2010) found

multipliers for public investment that ranged between 0.4 in the short-run to 1.6 in the long-run in

their panel of countries.

           Even if government spending multipliers are probably one or below on average, might they

be higher during bad economic times? The key states studied by recent papers are the size of fiscal

multipliers during recessions or periods of excess slack (typically measured by unemployment

rates), constraints on the monetary policy accommodation (such as the zero lower bound), and the

ratio of public debt to GDP.

           Consider first multipliers during recessions or periods of slack.                     Auerbach and

Gorodnichenko (2012), who conducted the pioneering study on this question, used a nonlinear



4
    These estimates are based on Ramey’s (2016) analysis using Ben Zeev and Pappa’s estimated news series.


                                                         19
time series model in which the parameters changed across expansions and recessions. They

reported a multiplier of 2.2 in recessions and -0.3 in expansions (based on some simplifying

assumptions about the state of the economy not changing after the shock). Various other studies

have found high multipliers during recessions (for example, Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2013;

Fazzari, Morley, and Panovski 2015; Caggiano et al. 2015). However, subsequent research has

found many of the state dependent results to be very fragile to small changes in specification or to

improvements in the methods for computing the multipliers from the basic estimates (Alloza 2017;

Owyang et al. 2013; Ramey and Zubairy 2018, and associated online appendix). The more robust

methods generally fail to produce multipliers above one during recessions or times of slack.

       Perhaps these empirical results should not be surprising, given some other results of theory

and quantitative models. The only theoretical models that predict countercyclical markups are

ones that include significant frictions. For example, Michaillat (2014) presents a stylized model

with labor market frictions and finds that the aggregate employment effect of government hiring

is countercyclical. However, the multipliers are always below one. Canzoneri et al. (2016) present

a model with financial frictions that does generate sizeable, though fleeting, multipliers during

recessions. They find significantly higher impact multipliers during recessions, near two, but the

cumulative multipliers fall below one after only a few quarters. Standard new Keynesian models

do not predict higher multipliers during recessions. Indeed, Sims and Wolff (2018a) employ a

medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model with high-order terms in the approximations and find

that this otherwise standard model implies mildly procyclical multipliers.

       The situation is different with respect to periods when interest rates are near the zero lower

bound or when monetary policy accommodates government spending increases (such as during

World War II in the United States) Numerous New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general




                                                20
equilibrium models show that multipliers can be higher than one when monetary policy is

constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates. At the zero lower bound, an increase in

government spending provides extra stimulus through by increasing expected inflation, which

lowers the real interest rate (Farhi and Werning 2016). Calibrated models such as the ones

analyzed by Christiano et al. (2011) and Coenen et al. (2012) can produce multipliers that range

between 2 and 3 when the period of monetary accommodation is sufficiently long. Some recent

empirical work has found some evidence of higher multipliers, ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 at the zero

lower bound for Japan (Miyamoto et al. 2018) and around 1.5 for historical samples in the U.S.

(Ramey and Zubairy 2018).

        Finally, there is evidence that government spending multipliers may be negatively related

to the public debt-to-GDP ratio. For example, Iltzetzki et al. (2013) find that countries with a

government debt-to-GDP ratio above 60 percent have an impact multiplier of 0 and a long-run

multiplier of -3 (estimated less precisely but still statistically below 0).

        In summary, most estimates of government spending multipliers for general categories of

government spending for averages over samples are in the range of 0.6 to 0.8, or perhaps up to 1.

The evidence for multipliers above one during recessions or times of slack is typically not robust.

However, some initial explorations suggest that government spending multipliers could be higher

at times when monetary policy accommodates fiscal policy, such as during periods at the zero

lower bound of interest rates or wartime.



Tax and Transfer Multipliers based on Aggregate Data

        I now to turn to the leading estimates of tax and transfer multipliers at the aggregate level.

Table 2 shows the estimates from time series and dynamic stochastic models general equilibrium




                                                   21
estimates for tax rate changes. In contrast to government spending multipliers which vary only a

small amount across horizons, many estimates of tax multipliers start out low on impact but then

build. Thus, I report the cumulative multipliers for the horizon where they peak. I should also

note that most of the multipliers are calculated without allowing feedback from induced output

changes to revenue but several (noted in the table) allow for the dynamic feedback.

       Most of the time series estimates based on narrative methods of identification are quite

high, generally between -2 and -3. These narrative-based estimates are striking not only for their

magnitudes, but also for their uniformity across countries and even across various methods of

estimation. These estimates are much higher (in absolute value) than the tax multipliers reported

by Blanchard and Perotti (2002). As discussed above, those estimates were based both on their

assumed elasticity of tax revenue to output and on their unusual way of computing multipliers.

Barro and Redlick (2011) estimate multipliers around -1.1. It may be that their use of various

approximations and constraints on dynamics account for their smaller estimate. On the other hand,

Mountford and Uhlig’s (2009) estimates using sign restrictions are -5.

       In contrast, the quantitative model estimates are much lower. Panel B of Table 2 shows

that most quantitative model estimates yield multipliers that are below 1 in absolute value. Thus,

there is a conflict between the time series estimates and the New Keynesian estimates.

       There is a small literature on whether tax multipliers differ by the state of the economy. So

far, this literature offers fairly uniform answers. Eskandari (2015) and Demirel (2016) find, using

the Romer and Romer (2010) narrative tax shocks, that tax multipliers are greater during times of

low unemployment than times of high unemployment. Alesina, Azzalini, Favero, Giavazzi, and

Miano (2018) also find higher multipliers in expansions using their narrative of fiscal plans across

OECD countries. These results are consistent with the one New Keynesian analysis of this issue




                                                22
using the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium approach. Sims and Wolff (2018b) obtain

estimates of tax multipliers that are procyclical: tor example, their capital tax multiplier is 1 in

recessions and almost 2 in expansions.




       There has been very little work on the aggregate effects of transfers. Romer and Romer

(2016) used changes in Social Security benefit increases to study the effects on macroeconomic

variables.   They found that permanent increases in benefits led to a roughly equal rise in

consumption in the short-run, but the effect dissipated quickly. Temporary increases in benefits

had no significant effect on aggregate consumption. Coenen et al. (2012) studied general transfers

and directed transfers across the various New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equillibirum

models used at policy institutions. They found that general transfers had multipliers between 0.2

and 0.6, with the higher ones occurring with monetary accommodation. In contrast, targeted

transfers (to households that were financially constrained) yielded multipliers as high as 2 in some

models when there was monetary accommodation.

       In sum, most time series estimates of tax rate change multipliers indicate that they are very

large, at least -2 to -3. This contrasts with the results from estimated New Keynesian dynamic

stochastic general equilibrium, where the multipliers are typically below 1 and never higher than

1.5. There is not much aggregate time series evidence for sizeable multipliers for temporary

transfers, though calibrated New Keynesian models suggest they can be high if they are targeted

and if monetary policy is accommodative.




                                                23
Multiplier Estimates based on Subnational Data

       One of the important innovations in the fiscal multiplier literature, as discussed earlier in

this paper, has been the application of applied microeconomics-type identification methods to the

estimation of parameters of use for macroeconomics. These include studies of panels or cross-

sections of US states or provinces in other countries, as well as household-level estimates of

marginal propensities to spend out of temporary transfers.

       Chodorow-Reich (forthcoming) summarizes the panel and cross-section multipliers from

individual studies, so I refer the reader to his tables. Many of the subnational multipliers for

government purchases, temporary tax rebates, and transfers lie between 1.5 to 2. Thus, they tend

to be higher than the aggregate-level estimates of multipliers.

       As noted earlier, subnational multipliers are not the same as aggregate multipliers. The

relationship between subnational multipliers and aggregate multipliers depends on many features,

including how the spending is financed, whether there are spillovers across regions, whether there

is a currency union, and whether the aggregate economy is at the zero lower bound. For discussion

of a number of the theoretical considerations issues involved in drawing implications from

subnational multiplier estimates to aggregate estimates, see Nakamura and Steinsson (2014), Farhi

and Werning (2016), and Chodorow-Reich (forthcoming). In some instances, the subnational

multipliers are expected to be higher than the aggregate multipliers, whereas in other instances the

they are expected to be lower. There is no general rule. Dupor and Guerrero (2017) conduct an

empirical investigation in which they directly compare estimates based on a state-level panel to

those obtained when the state data are aggregated to the national level. They obtain similar

multiplier estimates across the two data sets, though quite low, between 0 and 0.5.




                                                24
Multipliers in the Wake of the Financial Crisis

       A number of researchers and commentators have argued that the effects of the stimulus

from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the subsequent fiscal

consolidations in European countries were much larger than indicated by multipliers during

average times. A common theme is that the high unemployment rates and lower bound on interest

rates combined to raise the multipliers. But as shown in the previous sections, there is no robust

evidence of higher multipliers during recessions or times of slack, for either spending or taxes. In

fact, all studies of state dependence for tax multipliers find higher multipliers during expansions.

However, there is evidence from historical periods in the United States and from Japan, as well as

from New Keynesian models, that multipliers can be higher than one during periods of monetary

accommodation such as the zero lower bound on interest rates. Thus, it is possible that multipliers

could have been higher after the financial crisis.

       Consider first the fiscal consolidations in Europe. Blanchard and Leigh (2013, 2014)

presented evidence that countries that implemented bigger fiscal consolidations grew more slowly

than forecasted by the IMF and other organizations. They concluded that the models used by

forecasters assumed values of multipliers that were too small. Górnicka et al. (2018) gathered data

on the forecasters’ assumed values of multipliers and found that they were very low, around 0.25.

They then calculated that the “true” multipliers were higher, though they never exceeded one.

       The conclusions of Górnicka et al. (2018) are consistent with some other analyses of the

size of multipliers in the European fiscal consolidations. For example, Alesina, Favero, and

Giavazzi (forthcoming) use their narrative data set of fiscal consolidation plans across OECD

countries to study whether fiscal multipliers were greater in the immediate post-financial crisis




                                                  25
years. They find no evidence that multipliers were greater. At this point, the evidence does not

suggest that multipliers were larger than normal for the fiscal consolidations in Europe.

       The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 was the leading stimulus

program in the US economy. This program was a mix of spending and transfers to states and

individuals. As Table 3 shows, none of the New Keynesian DSGE models finds multipliers above

1 for this program, with the exception of one experiment by Coenen et al. (2012) that included two

years of monetary accommodation. While interest rates were indeed at the zero lower bound

during those years, Swanson and Williams (2014) present evidence that yields on one-year and

two-year treasury bills were unconstrained from 2008 to 2010, “suggesting that monetary policy

and fiscal policy were about as effective as usual during this period.”

       In contrast, the cross-state estimates of the effects of the American Recovery and

Reinvestment Act are typically much higher.          Chodorow-Reich (forthcoming) presents an

extremely valuable standardization and synthesis of the leading estimates of the effects of the

stimulus act on job creation across US states. This literature emphasizes employment effects,

mainly because the employment data have less measurement error than gross state product. These

estimates are based on strong applied microeconomic methods. His cross-state natural experiment

estimates indicate multipliers from 1.7 to 2 for gross state product and $50,000 per job-year

created. Building on Farhi and Werning’s (2016) theoretical analysis, Chodorow-Reich

(forthcoming) argues that these subnational multipliers are lower bounds on the national

multipliers during a liquidity trap. Thus, he argues that the multiplier from the American Recovery

and Reinvestment Act was at least 2.

       But there is reason to suspect that the state-level estimates of the effects of the American

Recovery and Reinvestment Act presented by Chodorow-Reich (forthcoming) are probably




                                                26
overestimates for the national-level multipliers. His cross-state estimates answer one question:

“How much extra employment was induced in the average state by each $1 of ARRA spending by

the federal government?” But the question relevant for the aggregate effects is a different one:

“How much extra aggregate employment was generated by each $1 of government spending

induced by ARRA spending by the federal government?” Chodorow-Reich uses per capita values

of spending and employment, so his cross-state estimates give equal weight to North Dakota and

California, which is fine for answering the first cross-state question. But if there is heterogeneity

in the treatment effects, however, the estimates will not give estimates that are nationally

representative. 5 Thus, the data need to be weighted by population or in some other way to obtain

nationally representative results. A second issue is that Chodorow-Reich’s measure of spending

is federal ARRA spending, which again is appropriate for measuring the first cross-state question.

However, ARRA spending stimulated state and local spending more than dollar for dollar (Leduc

and Wilson 2017)           Thus, multipliers that use only the ARRA transfers to the states will

overestimate the multiplier per dollar spent across all levels of government.

        Table 4 shows the effects of adjusting the employment response estimates to make them

more suitable for answering the question about aggregate effects of federal government spending.

The first row shows Chodorow-Reich’s (forthcoming) preferred estimates, which use all three of

the leading American Recovery and Reinvestment Act instruments.6 The estimates are for job-

years created for each $100,000 of ARRA spending. The estimate of 2.01 implies that each

$100,000 of ARRA spending creates two job-years of employment. The second row of Table 4




5
  Most of the literature using cross-sectional estimates has used per capita estimates and has not weighted the
estimates. However, Dupor and Mehkari (2016) started weighting the estimates and discovered that weighted
estimates of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 are much lower than unweighted estimates.

  These three instruments are based on either Medicaid formulas alone, Department of Transportation formulas
alone, or a combination of multiple agency formulas.


                                                        27
shows the results of my re-estimating Chodorow-Reich’s model (using his replication files) but

weighting by initial state population (in December 2008) to make them representative of national

data. The point estimate falls to 1.15 and the standard error is higher at 0.72. The third row of

Table 4 shows the estimates when spending across the levels of government are substituted for the

ARRA spending. Here, I use the Chodorow-Reich combination of instruments and I weight by

initial state population. The jobs multiplier estimate is now 0.89 with a standard error of 0.45.

Chodorow-Reich’s method for converting jobs multipliers to output multipliers is nearly one-for-

one, so the 0.89 estimate also implies an output multiplier around 0.9. Thus, once the cross-state

estimates are made nationally representative and include all spending, they look very much like

the aggregate estimates and lie below unity.

       Two important caveats about these adjusted estimates are in order. First, reweighting by

population gives very large influence to just a few of the 50 states. Second, the great instrument

relevance in Chodorow-Reich’s analysis disappears once I add state and local spending to

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act spending. In other words, the instruments that are so

good at explaining ARRA spending are not very good at explaining total government spending in

the state. Thus, it appears that the natural experiments exploited by the ARRA literature are rich

enough to answer questions about the effects of ARRA spending on a cross-state basis, but not to

answer questions about the aggregate effects of government spending induced by the ARRA.

       In sum, a number of commentators and researchers have argued that multipliers may have

been higher than usual after the financial crisis. I interpret most of the evidence at this point as

suggesingt that they were not higher than usual.



Conclusion



                                                28
       The fiscal literature has made tremendous progress in the ten years since the start of the

global financial crisis. The range of estimates for average multipliers has been reduced

considerably, particularly for government purchases.         On average, government purchases

multipliers are likely to be between 0.6 and 1. Narrative-based times series estimates point to tax

rate change multipliers between -2 and -3, though these are significantly greater in magnitude than

those predicted by DSGE models. However, there is still ongoing debate about specific contexts,

such as the size of multipliers during “bad” times and the effects of other characteristics, such as

exchange rate regimes.

       Across industrialized countries, most of the temporary stimulus packages enacted from

2007 to 2009 in response to the global financial crisis took the form of transfer payments or lump-

sum tax rebates (Oh and Reis (2012)). Policymakers were “flying blind” in that they had little

research to guide them at that time. Had they known then some the results now emerging from

the literature, they might have fashioned the stimulus packages differently, perhaps relying more

on tax rate cuts and less on expenditures.

       I believe the literature would benefit from progress in three main areas. First, the literature

needs to catch up to the current policy discussions by focusing more on the short-run and long-run

effects of infrastructure investment.   The few studies at the aggregate and subnational levels

suggest that these multipliers can be very large in some contexts (e.g. Leduc and Wilson (2013)).

Second, researchers need to be careful about their implementation decisions. Seemingly small

changes, such as how multipliers are actually calculated, can make a big difference. Finally,

researchers should continue to innovate along the lines they have pursued in the last ten years,

exploiting new data sets, extending theoretical models, and improving estimation techniques. As



                                                 29
part of this innovation, researchers need to think more about the link between micro estimates and

aggregate effects.
