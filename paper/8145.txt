      This paper reexamines the cartel problem by studying the

private discussions within one cartel.          While we find much that is

in accord with George Stigler’s (1964) basic insight that firms

would structure an agreement conscious of their later incentive to

cheat on it, we also uncover puzzles for established theory, and

identify elements that a richer theory should encompass, especially

regarding the role of communication in collusion.

      Our window into the inner workings of a cartel is a remarkable

series of notes on the weekly meetings of the Sugar Institute.

This trade association was formed in December 1927, in the wake of

several years of falling margins and excess capacity, by fourteen

firms comprising nearly all the cane sugar refining capacity in the

United States.      It operated until 1936, when the Supreme Court

ruled its practices illegal.

      Among the top executives in regular attendance at the meetings

was Louis V. Placé, Vice President of McCahan, a mid-size refinery

in Philadelphia.     Placé, who was "in charge of all activities of

the company except production and raw sugar purchases",1 wrote over

500   pages   of   single   spaced   detailed    notes   on   the   Board   of

Directors, Executive Committee, and Enforcement Committee meetings

from January 1929 through mid-1930.             He also reported on the

informal gatherings that followed them, and private conversations

with other refiner representatives and Institute personnel.2 Since

the memos circulated among only some six McCahan executives, they


                                      2
are extremely candid.         Under cross-examination at the trial, Placé

claimed to have regularly destroyed them upon receiving the much

less revealing official minutes.3                 Placé’s own notes catch the

President of American in an act of perjury,4 and reveal both the

refiners’ legal strategy, and their political machinations.5

     For economists, Place's notes are a unique information trove

on cartel behavior.         Participants in a modern cartel are unlikely

to   create    such     detailed     and        contemporaneous   documents    of

decision-making,      due     to   legal       concerns.    Moreover,   although

antitrust agencies can subpoena firm records and interview market

participants, strict confidentiality rules keep what they learn

from academic research, except by way of the rare trial.

     Placé’s memos serve us in two ways.              First, they are a record

of the communication among the refiners. Here are announcements of

impending actions that firms did not wish misconstrued as market

stealing,     charges    of    cheating,         threats   of   retaliation   and

deliberations over cooperative actions that were jointly profitable

but singly unprofitable.

     Second, the memos reveal the reasoning behind firms’ actions.

This is a type of evidence that economists have tended to shy away

from.   Milton Friedman (1953) would judge a theory solely by its

predicted outcomes.         But we agree with Alan Blinder (1993) that a

firm's explanation of its conduct is also proof, since a theory

describes the “chain of reasoning” which motivates the firm.


                                           3
Indeed, participants’ beliefs are an integral part of many game

theoretic models.          Furthermore, because like Ariel Rubinstein

(1992) we view "a model [as] an approximation of [the players']

perception and not an approximation of an objective description of

reality", we think it valuable to document how colluding firms

viewed their environment.

      The Sugar Institute never directly fixed prices nor allocated

market shares.      There is no indication or legal finding of either.6

Instead, it fixed rules.        These rules, whose main principles were

stated in its Code of Ethics7 and whose details were promulgated in

successive Code Interpretations, covered every conceivable aspect

of the distribution and marketing of sugar other than the basis

price   itself.       In    this    way,   the   refiners      eliminated   the

differential treatment of customers and harmonized contractual

practices, thus facilitating the detection of secret price cuts.

      In his seminal work on collusion, Stigler (1964)                identified

the ability both to detect price-cutting and to retaliate against

it as the primary requirements of successful collusion.                However,

he emphasized detection.           In contrast, more recent work, from

Edward J. Green and Robert Porter (1984) on, has concentrated on

the   nature   of    optimal   retaliation,      and   taken    the   detection

probability as parametric.         Studying the Sugar Institute refocuses

our attention on detection, in revealing how firms may enhance it

by altering their environment through both specific rules and


                                       4
institutional structure, including communication.                 The costs of

such a strategy in foregone profits from price discrimination and

cost efficiencies are made clear as well.

       We find the current formal theory of collusion wanting in

three    respects.         First,    the   theory   ignores    the   inevitable

incompleteness of collusive agreements. Conclusions about the role

of   renegotiations        are   especially    misleading     because   of   this

neglect.     In contrast, we show that the meetings embodied a

governance structure for the agreement, ensuring its adaptation to

(typically endogenous) changing circumstances.              Second, the theory

provides no role for rich communication within the agreement.                  We

show the crucial role provided by ex-ante notification and ex-post

determination of fault at the weekly meetings.8

       Finally, as Margaret C. Levenstein (1997) has shown, the

theory incorrectly predicts that cheating (which should not even

occur in equilibrium!) will always be met by competitive, or sub-

competitive, conditions.            We see such harsh punishments only in

response to massive cheating.              Occasional incidents of cheating

were    typically    not    retaliated     against.    Open    violations,     or

consistent patterns of cheating in a single dimension were matched

in degree and kind. We argue that the contractual arrangements for

sales agents help explain the limited retaliation.

       Section I presents evidence that the Institute raised margins

and profits.    This establishes that the collusive efforts were at


                                           5
least partially successful, and so merit further investigation.

Section II details the collusive mechanism, rule fixing, and the

benefits   and   costs   it   entailed.    Section   III   interprets   the

Institute as an incomplete collusive agreement.        Sections IV and V

explore how ex-ante notification and ex-post determination of fault

supported the agreement, while Section VI documents firms’ response

to its violation.        Section VII shows that the firms did not

transfer market shares or infer cheating from variations in them,

as existing theories predict.       Section VIII concludes.



I Performance

     How successful was the Sugar Institute?          Table 1 lists some

relevant yearly statistics.         As David Genesove and Wallace P.

Mullin (1997, 1998) showed, the simple production technology of

cane sugar refining affords direct measures of marginal cost and so

of the price-cost margin as well.         To produce a pound of refined

sugar, one needs 1.075 pounds of raw sugar, the price of which

constitutes most of the cost of refining.       Column (2) presents the

"proper margin", the difference between the price of refined and

1.075 times the price of raw.       Column (3) subtracts an additional

60 cents per hundred pounds, which represents all non-raw sugar

variable costs of refining.9         The establishment of the Sugar

Institute in December 1927 is coincident with an increase of the

margin of about 20 to 25 cents per hundred pounds over the


                                     6
preceding three years.   As column (4) shows, this increase is a

more than doubling of the Lerner Index.   Of course, the use of list

prices runs into the obvious difficulty that the Institute was

established in response to the pervasiveness of secret price cuts.

However, any bias only strengthens our conclusion:   so long as the

Sugar Institute eliminated or at the very least did not exacerbate

the secret concessions, the increase in the list price provides a

lower bound for the increase in the actual price.

     An increase in the price cost margin indicates only that

collusion was enhanced. How close that is to fully collusive

pricing depends on the elasticity of the relevant demand curve. In

our earlier work, we show that the elasticity of demand for cane

sugar during the 1890-1914 period was about 1.75.        That would

indicate a monopoly Lerner Index of 57 percent, far above the

margins under the Sugar Institute.   This discrepancy is explained

in part by the post-War growth of beet sugar, which would have

increased the demand elasticity for cane, and in part by the desire

to deter both foreign and domestic entrants. A more realistic

benchmark for monopoly pricing would be eleven percent.    This was

the margin in 1892, when both the margin and American’s market

share reached their greatest level (the latter at 92 percent of the

market). By that measure, the refiners managed to raise the Lerner

Index to about three-quarters of its monopoly level.

     The quantity series, though less dramatic, is also consistent


                                7
with an increase in market power.         Column (5) shows that the output

of the Atlantic refiners fell with the establishment of the Sugar

Institute.   The decrease in output is small, as sugar demand is

relatively inelastic.    Output continued to fall in the latter part

of the Sugar Institute period.        The decline is undoubtedly due to

the Great Depression, although it is much less than the 24 percent

fall in total industrial output.          The relative stability of sugar

production is consistent with Christina D. Romer's (1990) finding

that the onset of the Great Depression was associated with much

sharper cutbacks in purchases of durables than of non-durables. It

is also due to low prices for raw sugar, itself a consequence of

rising subsidies in producer nations and the 1934 reduction in the

tariff on Cuban raw sugars (Bill Albert and Adrian Graves, 1988,

p.9).

     As one would expect, rivals outside of the collusive agreement

responded to the price increase by increasing their own output.

Column (8) shows an increase in imports of refined sugar, which

originated   almost   entirely   in    Cuba.     Coca-Cola,   the   largest

purchaser of refined sugar, was among those firms that shifted

entirely to foreign suppliers.10          Previously a negligible flow of

less than half a percent of total U.S. consumption, foreign refined

sugar increased to 6 percent in the first year of the Sugar

Institute and continued to increase until it reached almost 15

percent in 1933, after which it was reduced by legislative fiat in


                                      8
the Sugar Act of 1934 to 11 percent.             The share of beet sugar

production (column (7)), whose producers lay outside of the Sugar

Institute as well, also rose, from an average share of 15.4 percent

in the four years before the Sugar Institute, to an average of 17.7

percent in the first four years of the Institute before the Sugar

Act, although the year to year variability here is such that one

can not clearly attribute the rise to the Institute’s formation.

     Prices, profit margins and the like are all measures of market

power.   They tell us the degree to which collusion is successful.

They say nothing about how it is achieved.             For that, we must

consider the actual mechanism of collusion, that is, the Sugar

Institute - its rules, its meetings and the means by which it

ensured compliance with those rules.



II Collusion by Rules

     The Sugar Institute system combined implicit collusion on

price with explicit collusion on business practices.             The latter

complemented the former, the ultimate goal, by making price cuts

more transparent.     In this section, we outline the agreement on

business practices.       In the next three sections, we explore how,

through communication, explicit collusion sustained the agreement.

     Rule number one of the Sugar Institute was the requirement of

"open    prices     and     publicly       announced   terms",    and    so

nondiscriminatory pricing. The attendant provisions that prices be


                                       9
posted on the refiners' bulletin boards, that the Institute be

notified of all changes both in price and methods of pricing, and

that price changes be announced no later than 3:00 p.m. merely

continued existing industry practice.

     The remaining rules primarily consisted of restrictions on

contractual practices between the refiners and downstream firms -

brokers, wholesalers and retailers -, and among downstream firms

themselves.   The breadth and detail of the restrictions were

remarkable.    For   example,   the    Institute   disallowed   quantity

discounts, allowances for the return of sugar bags, long term

contracts and certain types of credit arrangements.        It required

refiners to report it all sales of damaged sugar.         It drew up a

list of permissible consignment points - cities where refiners

stored sugar on their own account.     The Institute went so far as to

forbid certain downstream activities, namely brokerage and storage,

being combined within the same firm! Enforcement of this last rule

engaged the Institute in private investigation and auditing.

     The stated aim of these rules was to eliminate discriminatory

pricing.   This claim was repeated as part of the refiners' legal

defense, but why it would have been in their interest to do so was

never explained. The defendants noted that this ensured compliance

with the Clayton Act's prohibition on price discrimination, but

were silent on why compliance required collective action.

     To the economist, the Institute's rules smack of facilitating


                                  10
practices.    Collusive agreements are constantly in danger of being

undermined by secret price cuts.            Since a collusive agreement

results in a price above any firm's individually optimal price,

participant firms have an individual incentive to undercut this

price slightly and receive a larger share of industry demand and

profits.     A firm that cheats will want to undercut secretly in

order to avoid retaliation from other producers.                 Anything that

makes   detection    of   a   secret   price    cut   more   likely     enhances

collusion.     At least if they are adhered to, the requirements of

"open prices and publicly announced terms" clearly make cheating

more evident.    Complex, differentiated contractual terms may hide

price cuts under other names, and so restrictions on contracting

practices    would   serve    a   similar      role   to   the   open    pricing

requirement.    Thus, the Sugar Institute was primarily a mechanism

to increase the probability of detection of secret price cuts,

thereby facilitating collusion.

     The refiners worked to enhance detection and not reduce

reaction time, because the industry's long standing "moves" system,

in effect even before the establishment of the Sugar Institute,

already made the effective reaction lag nearly zero.                Under this

system, announced price decreases took effect immediately, while

price increases took effect only after a day had passed.                That gave

buyers, who purchased a month's worth of sugar at a time, the

incentive to refrain from purchasing immediately after a price


                                       11
decrease until other, perhaps preferred, firms matched it (which

they always did) and perhaps to benefit from a further fall in

price.   In practice, firms' reactions often came in minutes, and a

day proved long enough for all reactions to be registered and for

the price to settle.   So price competition preceded trade.   Thus by

decreasing its publicly announced price a firm could not hope to

`steal the market'.    Only secret discounts could steal customers

away from other firms.

     The Sugar Institute rules were so wide ranging and detailed,

because virtually every contractual term could mask a price cut.

We consider five of these rules.

     Water Damaged or Frozen Sugar.   It seems reasonable that such

sugar sell at a discount.   But a refiner could ship undamaged sugar

to a favored customer, invoice it for damaged sugar, and claim, if

questioned later, that the sugar was damaged.      So for each such

sale, the rules required “full details of amount, location, reason

and price to be circulated by the Institute.”11

     Likewise, favorable credit terms secretly extended to buyers

could substitute for a price cut.        A long standing industry

practice granted a two percent discount for cash payment.        But

refiners would vary the length of the grace period necessary to

qualify for the discount.    The Institute forbade this.

     Storage rates.    Prior to the Institute’s ban, many brokers

also operated warehouses that stored sugar for customers.     Acting


                                 12
on behalf of a refiner with whom they had a long-term relationship,

the broker could substitute a discount on the storage payment for

a cut in the price of refined itself.           The refiner would then

compensate the broker by routing an un-intermediated purchase offer

through the broker, for example.12

     Delivery Time (Contract Enforcement).       Customers did not have

to take delivery immediately, but could spread out deliveries

against a contract over 30 or more days.        Allowing favored buyers

to take delivery beyond the contracted date not only saved them

storage and interest payments, it also constituted a preferred

price if the basis price rose in the meanwhile.         So the Institute

insisted that delivery dates be enforced.

     Freight rates offered yet another way of giving a price cut,

although only on rates not regulated by the Interstate Commerce

Commission (ICC). For that reason, the Sugar Institute discouraged

use of private water charters by requiring every such shipment to

be registered.    It also asked the charters to quote uniform rates

for all customers, and even demanded a written commitment from

shippers not to rebate freight to customers.13 When the lower water

rates proved too tempting to both refiners and their brokers, the

refiners moved to delivered pricing, as described in Section III.

     Colluding in this manner was not costless.        By adopting these

restrictions,    the   firms   forewent   additional   profits   from   the

differential treatment of customers.14       These lost profits, which


                                    13
a    monopolist     would   have   earned,   derived     not   only   from   price

discrimination, but also efficiencies of various kinds, especially

in shipping.           When large buyers in Buffalo asked to receive

delivery by water barge (technically more convenient for the

buyers), even if charged at the much higher railroad rate, the

Institute refused for fear of creating the opportunity for granting

discounts.15      On a larger scale, the move to delivered pricing led

to refiners replacing brokers in the transportation of sugar by

water barge.16         Presumably, the original integration configuration

was the more efficient one. The refiners also ran the risk of

backward integration by their large customers thus denied quantity

discounts, as A&P threatened to do.17

       The prohibition of long-term contracts, and tolling contracts,

where the buyer financed the raw sugar purchase, clearly also meant

lost efficiencies.18         The requirement that all purchased sugar be

delivered within 30 days led to a secondary market, where "second

hand sugar", offered by customers who had over bought, sold at a

discount ranging between 5 and 20 cents.            Any transaction costs in

buying and selling would make that development a social loss.

       Placé,     in     particular,   was   prepared     to    forego   certain

efficiencies from the allocation of production according to cost.

He    so   feared      different   prices,   that   he   did   not    want   local

differences in loading or shipping costs to lead to differential

rates.      “Those enjoying more economical loading conditions can


                                        14
pocket the profits”, he wrote in a letter to the Institute.19

       Coordinated action via a trade association was not obviously

illegal.    Indeed, there were numerous “open price” associations at

the time,20 many inspired by Arthur Jerome Eddy's 1912 book The New

Competition and promoted by the Federal Trade Commission.                But a

series of Supreme Court decisions in the early 1920s had left the

legal status of trade association activities unclear.              Also, the

Sugar Institute’s activities were clearly on the edge of the

permissible.21    Indeed, its members were extremely conscious of the

legal consequences of their deliberations.22           They had the initial

Code   of   Ethics   vetted   by   the    Department    of    Justice,   which

nonetheless later prosecuted the refiners, obtaining a 1936 Supreme

Court decision outlawing most of the Institute's practices.



II.A An Alternative Hypothesis:          Quality Suppression

       There is an alternative, yet still collusive, explanation for

the    contractual   restrictions.        Many   of   these    rules   can   be

understood as limitations on either quality or within firm variety,

for contractual harmonization typically involved choosing the lower

`quality' level.      The grace period for payment was set at seven,

and not at fourteen days, the number of consignment points were cut

by half,23 etc.      In this interpretation, the rules were meant to

shut down non-price competition and so were directly collusive,

instead of merely facilitating collusion.


                                     15
     There      was    undoubtedly       some        suppression    of     non-price

competition involved, but at best this explanation is incomplete.

First, it fails to account for many of the rules.                    These include

the prohibition on quantity discounts, the refusal to deal with

warehouse-affiliated         brokers    or    shippers      that   did   not   openly

announce their rates, as well as other transportation policies.

The rules on prior notification discussed in Section IV below are

particularly difficult to interpret in this manner.                      Second, the

number of different sugar grades itself was not restricted.                      This

was so even though the proliferation of grades was costly to the

smaller refineries through lost economies of scale in packaging.24

Third, and most persuasively, the alternative argument does not

capture   the    intermediate      goal       of     eliminating    discriminatory

pricing. The Institute's Code of Ethics has as its first principle

that "all discrimination between customers should be abolished."

This goal is a central theme not only throughout the published Code

but also in the notes on the private meetings.

     Nonetheless,      we    do   not   reject       this   argument     completely.

Rather,   we    view   the    suppression       of    non-price    competition     as

complementary to contractual harmonization.                    Both quality and

variety are often over provided from the industry's point of view.

If one is already choosing, and enforcing, one single contractual

standard among many, one might as well limit non-price competition

along the way.


                                         16
III Incomplete Collusive Agreements

      "Although    [oligopoly]        is    often    thought      of   as   a   market

structure problem, it becomes a contracting problem when it is

phrased in terms of the comparative efficacy of cartel agreements."

(Oliver Williamson, 1996, p. 8)



      The unavoidable conclusion from reading the Placé memoranda is

that the initial agreement was incomplete, in the sense used in the

theory of the firm.       Collusive agreements are incomplete for the

usual reason that it is impossible to anticipate, enumerate and

work through all contingencies. Indeed, the need to "fill in gaps"

in the initial agreement was explicitly recognized by the refiners

in writing to the Court that the Code of Ethics was not and “could

not   be,    self-operative.     ...       [I]t   required   interpretation       and

administration and consultation and the collection of information,

[which] the Institute was set up to provide”.25

      The weekly meetings allowed the refiners to “complete the

contract” in several different ways.                  Least important was the

opportunity to adapt to changing external circumstances, for the

technology and demand of refined sugar barely changed over the

period of the Institute.          Aside from the rare mention of a new

demand      substitute,   such   as    liquid       sugar,   or    a   small    scale

innovation like bagging refined sugar in paper lined raw sugar

bags, such issues do not arise in the Placé memoranda.26


                                           17
     The    meetings     also    allowed   the     refiners     to    perfect    the

agreement under unchanging external conditions.                      This included

addressing minor questions left unclear by the Code and subsequent

amendments.        Can damaged sugar be sold under a price guarantee?

No. Is it “permissible to store in the warehouse of a broker who

does not handle sugar?” Yes.        May one entertain a broker?           Yes.    Do

30 day contracts end on the 30th day after the start of the

contract, or on the same day of the next month?                 The former.      Are

contracts to be considered filled by telephone or telegraphic

order, or only if invoiced?         The latter.27

     More importantly, certain rules were found to be unworkable,

and had to be modified.          The original Institute policy required

refiners to charge the ICC regulated all-rail rate, regardless of

the actual transportation mode used.          Removing the discretion from

refiners to set their own tariffs meant that refiners' greater

market     power    in   their   hinterlands       were    leveraged      to    more

competitive markets, such as the Great Lakes, where all refiners

marketed their sugars.28          However the availability of cheaper,

albeit slower, water, or combined rail and water, routes offered

too great an arbitrage opportunity to others.                 So the rules were

changed    to   permit   differential      rates   under    a   limited    set    of

circumstances, for “inconsiderable” quantities.                 This new regime

proved unworkable, in part because refiners themselves were tempted

by these routes, which facilitated secret price concessions both on


                                      18
and off the routes.        So the refiners switched to a system of

delivered prices coupled with a refusal to sell f.o.b. refinery.

This move to delivered pricing, delayed for over a year out of

fear of the anti-trust authorities, was ostensibly accomplished by

the independent actions of the refiners, given the dubious legality

of the Institute taking such a step.      But the Placé memos show the

move to be a coordinated act that required several meetings over a

single week, in which suitable rates were discussed and a leader

emerged among the firms.29

     Perhaps the most important adaptation function lay in closing

unintended loopholes. The Institute was constantly regulating some

new practice, as the elimination of one method of secret price

concession would give rise to a new, albeit less effective, one -

much in the same way as taxpayers’ or firms’ response to tax or

government   regulations    will   give   rise   to   new   rules.   Thus

initially, only storage in a warehouse owned by a customer was

prohibited. But as Institute regulations foreclosed that and other

avenues for giving secret concessions, refiners began storing in

broker-affiliated warehouses, and the rule had to be changed to

prohibit storage there as well.

     These decisions were formalized by issuing a series of Code

Interpretations, which possessed a quasi-judicial character, an

analogy not lost on Institute members.       When C.&H. questioned the

legality of enforcing adherence to the Interpretations, since only


                                   19
the Code itself had been approved by the Department of Justice, the

Institute Counsel deemed the former "absolutely indispensable. Even

national laws must be `interpreted' by the Courts because it is

impossible to foresee, at the time of writing the law, all the

circumstances to which it will apply.             In the same way the Code

must be interpreted in the light of particular circumstances."30

       Legal imagery permeates the Placé memoranda. The participants

spoke of evidence, as we shall see, and precedent.                 A decision on

rates to cities served by the New York Canal was later taken as

applicable, “[o]n the same principle”, to rates throughout the

Great Lakes region.31 Inquiries about the operation of a public

warehouse for sugar were deemed "covered by the decision in the

Bridgeman Russell case."32

       Given the centrality of rules in this collusive mechanism, one

should perhaps not be surprised by the imagery.              But the legality

also   had    real   effects.      Legal    principles    help   `complete   the

contract’ by extending one decision to cover many subsequent

incidents,     as    well   as   minimizing   disputes.      They    also   allow

participants to anticipate others’ response.              One might also argue

that    the    legal    approach     delayed,    and     perhaps     restricted,

retaliation against violations of the agreement, as we shall see.



IV Prior Notification

       Prior notification of impending actions was an integral part


                                       20
of the Sugar Institute mechanism.            Institute rules required a firm

to notify other members before selling damaged sugar, introducing

new private brands, and changing any terms of trade.                    While in

practice the reports on damaged sugar sales took place shortly

afterwards,33 the rule on private brands - sugar marketed through

a grocery chain with the latter’s label, often at a discount - was

clearly followed.34

      We see numerous examples of notification of future changes in

shipping tariffs or policies more generally in the Placé memos.

For example, when Revere, a Boston refiner, considered reducing its

rail shipments rates from the rail rate to the water rate, it first

told the Institute.       Arbuckle preceded its public announcement of

its   decrease   in     freight    rates     by   a   private    announcement   to

Institute members.       And C&H informed the Institute of its probable

intention to spread the price guarantee to other states.35

      But notification was used even when it was not explicitly

required   by     the     agreement.       Arbuckle      Brothers    anticipated

(preempted?)     opposition       by   announcing      that   some   grocers    had

advertised its brand and that it wanted "to go on record as stating

that such ads are at the expense of the grocers".36

      Prior notification served two purposes.                   First, it was an

attempt to eliminate the retaliatory lag in the non-price domain.

As such, it was complementary to the rule of “open announcement”

of prices and other terms of trade to buyers, which was directed at


                                        21
shortening the detection lag.       It is well known theoretically that

full collusion is possible when firms can respond to others’

deviations before consumers act,37 and the combination of frequent

meetings and prior notification allowed firms to do so.

     The notification rule operated on the higher level of a two

level agreement.        At the lower level was a precise agreement

comprised    of    codes,   amendments    and   resolutions   that    detailed

permissible actions, such as described in Section II.                     At the

higher level was an understanding of adherence to these lower level

rules.      This   meta-understanding      permitted   refiners      to   remove

themselves from the lower level rules.           But they were expected to

notify the other members of their intention to do so beforehand.

     Of course, notification must be timely to be effective.                  In

its Brief to the Supreme Court, the Department of Justice cited an

Institute rule that notification be given at least 15 days before

taking any action that violated a Board of Directors’ decision.

However, we have no independent verification of that claim.

     Notification can also be in the individual interest of a firm.

Consider an action which is privately profitable once other firms

have responded to it, but which will take market share away from

other firms if unanticipated by them.            Taking market share away

from rivals risks retaliation.       In the price domain, for example,

a decrease from above the monopoly price, if anticipated and

matched, will leave the price cutter (and its rival) better off


                                     22
than before; but if unanticipated and thus unmatched, the decrease

will give the initiating firm the whole of the market, and though

temporarily more profitable, thus risk a retaliatory price war.38

     The Placé memos contain an explicit recognition of this

function.   The Godchaux representative



     praised the attitude of Savannah who, when faced with the

     necessity of changing their method of doing business in

     order to meet competition last Fall, did not rush through

     an announcement [to the public].     Instead, they waited

     for a Board meeting at which they explained conditions as

     they found them and discussed with other refiners the

     necessity for action on their part.     Their subsequent

     announcements, because understood, did not cause any

     upheavals.   Other refiners recently have not followed

     this policy with the result that, when revolutionary

     announcements are made, retaliatory announcement are made

     by other refiners thereby plunging the industry into

     deplorable and expensive practices.39



As we shall see, notification also preceded retaliatory action.

Deferring action until notification was possible carried a cost of

retaliatory delay, at the benefit of reduced misunderstandings.

     Notice that all the cases considered here concern an easing of


                                23
the terms of trade.     In the usual example of notification, the

Ethyl case40, prior announcement was made of an intended toughening

of sale conditions - a nominal price increase in an inflationary

environment.   That gave firms an opportunity to see if other firms

would follow them, or not.      In that case, notification served as a

coordinating mechanism for an action that, when taken by all firms,

would benefit them, but if taken by one firm alone, would harm it.



V Ex-Post Determination

     The   Sugar   Institute    meetings   also   provided   a   forum   for

accusation and rebuttal.       For example, in March of 1929, American

charged Federal with secretly cutting prices by loading barges

without charge.    American argued that



     [F.O.B.] meant that the sugar must be placed within reach

     of the tackle of either the ship or the barge.          Several

     people    testified   ...      that   this    had   been     the

     interpretation in the past and that all loading and

     unloading charges had always been construed as being for

     account of the vessel.      [Federal] took the position that

     F.O.B. means literally "free on board" and the condition

     visualized by [American] could be correctly described as

     "F.A.S." meaning free alongside."41




                                    24
     Reading this, one is led to ask why the firms bother arguing

at all.   If one firm thinks that the other has cheated, why not

just retaliate?     Why the need to prove the point?

     There are two reasons to first investigate.        First, there may

have been no intention to break the agreement. Perhaps Federal did

not mean to capture additional market share by loading the barges,

and thought that other firms were acting as it did.             As in the

Green and Porter model (1984), the evidence for cheating is never

unambiguous, although here it is a misunderstanding - an "`honest

mistake' by rivals concerning the nature of the `agreement'" (David

Kreps, 1990, p. 529) - not a drop in industry demand, that

confounds.   A    similar   difference   of   opinion   arose   about   the

deadline for payment of sugar shipped by barge from New Orleans.42

     Other times, the confounding factor was indeed a change in

external factors.    Thus the failure to force delivery on customers

at the end of 30 days was variously determined to be due not to

cheating, but to the difficulty of obtaining barges, vacuum pans

and other unforeseen events.      The accusation could be factually

wrong: a concession on one barrel of caked sugar was wrongly

reported as a concession on a much larger amount of powdered sugar

by a Sugar Institute investigator.43     Or a firm employee or direct

broker may simply have made an error in invoicing or shipping.44

     Unlike in Green and Porter (1984), there is a mechanism here -

the Sugar Institute's meetings - by which firms can first judge


                                  25
whether cheating has in fact occurred before taking action.            The

Sugar Institute served as a court in which an accused firm might

prove its innocence, in some cases on factual, in others on

logical, grounds.     In doing so, the Institute raised the signal to

noise ratio of indicators of cheating, to use a more prosaic

metaphor.

     A second reason not to retaliate immediately is the need to

first garner support among the other firms.         If the accusing firm

acts alone, it may stand accused of cheating itself, and be subject

to retaliation.       Such was the case for Godchaux in retaliating

against Savannah, as described in Section VI below.

     As a result, accusing firms could not rely on their own

beliefs alone, but required evidence. Evidence had to be not only

observable, but legally verifiable as well - to use the language of

contract    theory.     Placé   informs   his   readers   (fellow   McCahan

executives) of an accusation that Godchaux was selling sugars to

Edgar.     This was a violation of Institute regulations because

Edgar, a large, prominent, and aggressive, Detroit brokerage firm,

was engaged in storage as well.            An invoice uncovered by an

Institute investigator that appeared to document a sale was offered

as evidence.    Placé examined the invoice after the meeting.



     I am afraid that [the investigators] are off on the wrong

     track... [T]his invoice is merely part of Godchaux's


                                    26
       bookkeeping method...I do not doubt that the 20 cars are

       eventually to be merchandised by Edgar but ... [Godchaux]

       is    too   clever    to   commit     a    faux   pas   such    as   [the

       investigator] thought he had uncovered.45



With   the    invoice   no    longer   probative,        all    the   refiners     were

notified of the "the error which apparently had been made."46



VI Cheating and Retaliation

       In   the    theory   of    implicit       collusion,    the    response     to   a

deviation is



       simple in the extreme. A deviation by player i is always

       treated the same way regardless of the nature of the

       deviation,     the    period    in        which   it    occurred,    the

       particular path in progress, or the point on the path at

       which the defection occurred.                 There is no need to

       "tailor the punishment to fit the crime" (David Pearce,

       1992, p. 140).47



       What we observe is quite different.                     Firms did cheat. A

Detroit chain store received a secret price concession when it

switched from National to Spreckels.                Spreckels overpaid truckers

who then worked a few hours "free" for certain customers. Arbuckle


                                           27
knowingly sold to a dummy corporation that fronted for Edgar.48 All

this was done secretly, then uncovered by the Institute.

     Cheating was particularly bad in the South.          Godchaux broke

Institute regulations twice over in accepting a contract with a

price guarantee for delivery by water barge, whose movements it

agreed not to trace.    Texas City accepted a 42 day contract - an

offense serious enough that the owner offered to fire his top three

executives over it.       That same refiner later absorbed storage

charges through a dummy corporation.         Colonial offered a six cent

rebate to large buyers.    And in Tampa, post-dated checks were used

to give credit.49

     Yet, outside of the South, neither in prices nor in rules were

these   individual   violations   met   by    reversion   to   competitive

conditions a la Green and Porter (1984), let alone sub-competitive

conditions, a la Dilip Abreu et al. (1986).          This is especially

noteworthy as the industry did experience sub-competitive prices a

generation earlier (Genesove and Mullin, 1997). Rather, deviations

were either ignored or matched.

     Typically, when a specific incident of cheating was uncovered,

fault was determined, the refiner confessed or attempted to justify

it50- or more likely, blamed the broker51 - and then halted the

practice.   There the matter would end.      One can conjecture that one

refiner’s cheating would encourage another’s, but by the nature of

such a process it is impossible to connect one incident to a


                                  28
particular predecessor.

     Where the cheating continued over a longer period, or there

was an open violation of the agreement, the response was typically

to match the practice.        This is most evident in transportation

pricing.   When one firm openly lowered its rate for rail shipments

to the lower water barge rate, other firms would respond by

lowering their rail rates to the same level.52          When the Pacific

refiners gave a freight allowance on certain contracts, American

announced that it would match it.53 The punishment was indeed

"tailored to fit the crime".

     Matching was not only in degree but also in kind.                  In

responding to a violation, rival firms have at their discretion not

only the extent of retaliation, but the instrument as well.           For

example, in response to the invoicing of a rail shipment at the

lower   barge   rate,   in   contradiction   to   the   Institute   rules,

retaliation need not be restricted to transportation pricing, but

in principle could include payment length, consignment policy,

sugar grades, and even price. Indeed, just as Douglas Bernheim and

Michael Whinston (1990) have shown that, where there is multimarket

conduct, collusion can be enhanced when punishment encompasses all

markets, so one would expect that collusion would be enhanced by

punishing a deviator with all possible instruments at hand.

     It is surprising, then, to observe that the response to a

deviation was generally restricted to the instrument of violation.


                                    29
When,      for   example,      Southern      refiners    failed      to   prevent      the

diversion of shipments from states in which price was guaranteed

during shipment to where it was not, C.&H. introduced a guarantee

for Texan shipments and threatened to extend it to other Western

states.54    Likewise, when McCahan concluded that some refiners were

not uniformly enforcing the contract time limits, Placé first

threatened not to enforce McCahan’s terms either55 and then, with

others,     carried      out   his     threat.      Likewise,     Arbuckle       Brothers

threatened       to    "meet    secret       competition     by     openly   accepting

contracts for delivery ... over an indefinite delayed period."56

After several price moves over a period of months resulted in mixed

success in contract enforcement, the Institute proposed that each

refiner inform the trade that henceforth any sugar remaining on a

contract     would      be   shipped    to    customers      in   bulk    bags    on   the

contract’s expiration date. Savannah, although agreeing to send out

the letter, refused to enforce it, on the grounds that Hershey had

in   the    past      done   the   same.          Colonial   then    conditioned       its

enforcement on that of Savannah and C.&H.57                   In yet another case,

when    Arbuckle       Brothers      temporarily       stopped      adhering     to    the

Institute’s sugar standards, National and Penn stopped as well.58

       This restricted pattern of retaliation is also present in the

enforcement of the separation of brokerage and storage activities

downstream.        Arbuckle Brothers threatened that if there were any

further shipments to brokers who doubled as warehouse operators,


                                             30
then it would begin supplying Edgar again.59

     Matching was actually institutionalized in the enforcement of

the 30 day delivery rule, which firms continually broke by granting

extensions on the grounds of production schedules and transport

availability.   To deal with this problem, the Institute required

refiners to report their quantity of undelivered contracts for each

price move.60   These weekly reports were circulated to all members

and discussed at a dedicated weekly meeting.    A large balance of

undelivered contracts revealed a firm as unlikely to meet the

contract due date, either because of capacity constraints in

production or transportation, or because the high balances signaled

an unwillingness to pressure customers to take delivery.     Other

refiners could then match by adjusting, or threatening to adjust,

their own contract enforcement.       This matching was eventually

further institutionalized by a short-lived understanding “that all

refiners will be free to spread their own deliveries over the same

number of days as the most delayed refiner will require”, which

agreement was “not to be announced to the trade”.61

     These reports both sped up retaliatory matching and made it

more routine.    In their absence, a firm would not know precisely

how well others were forcing delivery until after the due date had

passed.   Retaliation could only then be through refusal to enforce

future contracts, or, like C&H before joining the Institute, on

other contractual terms.62    The reports permitted quick, nearly


                                 31
contemporaneous responses, precisely tailored to the violation.

      Where    retaliation    did   take    the   form   of   a    reversion,   or

threatened reversion, to competitive conditions, or worse, it was

only in response to large scale cheating in several dimensions.

This only occurred in the South, which was the periphery of the

market.      As early as June 1929, an Institute investigator reported

the   Code     of   Ethics    as    “dead    in    the    water"      in   Texas.

Compartmentalization broke down there.            C&H would not discuss any

single issue, but insisted that given the conditions, it would only

discuss all of them together.63 Arguing that Texan refiners "have

been guilty of many different violations of the Code",                     C.&H.

threatened to "request the entire suspension of the Code of Ethics

in the Texas territory so that all refiners may be in position to

fight fire with fire."64

      Elsewhere in the South, Savannah was dissuaded from resigning

from the Institute, so that it might deal with the "unethical"

competition from the Cuban refiner Hershey, by a resolution which

authorized members “to `meet the competition of Hershey', provided

that the specific competitor and the exact territorial limits are

announced to the Institute."65 Thus the Institute agreed to suspend

the collusive agreement, so long as prior notification was given.66

      The last example illustrates again how Institute membership

stymied   firms     from     immediately     responding       to    competition.

Retaliation was to be at the discretion of the Institute as a whole


                                      32
only.     When in November 1929, Godchaux withdrew its authorization

for the Institute to audit its stocks until Colonial ceased its

storing its sugar in buyer affiliated warehouses, and withholding

contract enforcement and other statistics67, the other refiners

disapproved; according to them, Godchaux was



        taking   a   very   arbitrary   position.   Irrespective   of

        Colonial's activities, Godchaux has no right to secretly

     indulge in unethical practices themselves ... If Godchaux

     desires to meet Colonial competition it must be done

     openly, as Savannah did in Southeastern territory.68



     Our comments in this and the previous section paint a very

different picture of the response to a deviation than that imagined

in the formal theory.        Instead of meeting a single deviation with

immediate massive retaliation, there may be an attempt to determine

if it was indeed a conscious effort to break the agreement, or

rather a misunderstanding, or the product of external factors.

Threats may also precede any retaliation, in part to ensure it is

not misconstrued as a deviation, in part to allow the deviator to

back down.       Retaliation when, and if, it comes is limited to the

kind of violation and is typically to match it.

     Thus the refiners had chosen the opposite end of the tradeoff

between Type I and Type II errors to that of the Green and Porter


                                        33
(1984) equilibrium. There, firms accept that they will punish when

cheating does not occur in order that cheating never occur; here,

firms accept some cheating so as not to punish inappropriately.

Collusion     was     nonetheless    (imperfectly)      sustained,     because

wholesale cheating was retaliated against massively.

     One reason to desist from full scale retaliation stems from

the vertical contractual arrangements in the industry.               Issues of

internal    firm    organization    apparently     dictated   that   the   most

efficient contract between a firm and its sales agents entailed

brokerage, with brokers often dealing exclusively with specific

refiners.69    Brokers faced high powered incentives, with a fixed

percentage commission earned on every sale.

     This system was at odds with the collusive agreement in two

respects.     First, an exclusive broker had an incentive to “steal”

a customer from another firm through secret concessions.                     Of

course, because refiners made a positive profit on every sale, this

would benefit the refiner as well.            But being one of many, instead

of one of fifteen, a broker’s incentive to deviate much exceeded a

refiner’s.         Viewed   from   the   refiners’   perspective,    brokers’

cheating added noise to demand, and so provided an opportunity for

firms to cheat by hiding behind their brokers, much like demand

shocks in Green and Porter.          Collectively through the Institute,

the refiners sought brokers’ adherence to the agreement through

blacklisting deviators (although refiners tended to protect their


                                         34
own), and instilling a culture of adherence to the codes.

     Not only did the system make deviations more prevalent, it

made punishment more costly.     It is easy to see that continual

transitions between a “collusive” phase and a “punishment” phase

would be difficult to enact in such an environment.     One cannot

easily ask selling agents to one day adhere to one set of rules,

the next to another, and the day after to return to the first set

of rules, especially when the first set of rules stands in the way

of their (individual) profit opportunities.

     Apparently, the tension between the desire of selling agents

to increase sales and the firm’s desire to abide by the agreement

was felt inside the firm, as legally defined, as well.      Arguing

that “the matter of contract enforcement cannot be left in the

hands of the Sales Department”, one firm announced that it had

established “an entirely separate department to handle contract

enforcement and enforcement will be accomplished without allowing

the prejudices and desires of the Sales department to interfere.”

     Finally, we ask: Why matching? Matching in price (where sales

are made before rivals can respond) will not deter undercutting, of

course, but the method can be effective for deviations in discrete

choices, such as for rules.   Robert Axelrod’s (1984) demonstration

of the robustness of a matching, or `tit for tat’, strategy in

computer simulations of the Prisoners’ Dilemma is well known.70

Less well known is subsequent work showing the robustness of the


                                 35
`generous tit for tat’ strategy (Axelrod, 1997, p.36-7) in which a

percentage of deviations are assumed to be `mistakes’, and so are

forgiven - as seems to have occurred here.         An additional appeal of

matching must have been that it was consistent with the ethic of

non-discrimination and symmetry that underlay the Code of Ethics.

      Could   what   we   have    labeled   as     deviation    followed    by

retaliation by matching be better thought of as a move to a new

equilibrium, in which one firm leads, and the others follow in an

optimal response, however grudgingly? There is some appeal to this

interpretation, at least when the violation was done openly.               But

the larger point remains.          We do not see the use of massive

retaliation to protect the original equilibrium, which the Folk

Theorems of implicit collusion would suggest could be sustained by

such response, and would be, when collusion is less than perfect.



VII   What Firms Did Not Do: Inference from Market Shares and Market

Allocation

      Since in the Green and Porter model and its offshoots cheating

is inferred from an increase in a firm’s market share, it is

natural to ask, as some readers of earlier drafts of this paper

have, whether refiners used such information to police the accord.

Market   share   information     was   available   to   them,   although    at

somewhat low frequency (Genesove and Mullin, 1999), but was rarely

used in that fashion.          The one such inference in the Placé


                                       36
memoranda is the observation that Arbuckle had not been obtaining

its “proper quota of business”, apparently because brokers regarded

it as “too strict” in enforcing contracts.           The possibility that

American’s advertising is at fault instead is dismissed, since

other refiners’ sales had not fallen.             Half a year later, the

Arbuckle representative blamed its low share on its not being “as

liberal    in   meeting   competition    as   McCahan”   had   been.   Placé

retorted that the “premise” was wrong.71

     In Green and Porter (1984), a fall in market share, whatever

the reason, leads to a price war.             In the Placé memoranda, the

reason for the decline is crucial.        In a rather dramatic incident,

the president of C&H, not yet a member of the Institute, threatened

to “break the price” if, upon returning to San Francisco, he were

to discover that its sales had been low because of the failure of

Eastern refiners to enforce the 30 day limit.

     In Dilip Abreu et al. (1990), Drew Fudenberg et al. (1994) and

Athey and Kyle Bagwell (2000), a firm that registers a decrease in

market share is compensated with additional market share in future

periods.    There are a couple of discussions along these lines in

the memoranda.      Colonial having stated that “it will consider

itself at liberty `to meet the competition’ as it meets it .. The

consensus of opinion was that Colonial ha[d] suffered such a large

decrease in distribution that some means must be found to allow

them to catch up.”72       Because at this point the memoranda become


                                    37
quite spotty in their coverage of the meetings, we do not know why

Colonial’s sales had declined, and do not know whether “some means”

was found and acted upon (we suspect not).       Elsewhere, Placé hears

that    American   is   forbidding   second   hand   sugars   from    being

transferred to Boston, presumably to stop Revere, the local Boston

refiner, from dropping its price.

       Note, however, that as we pointed out in Section II, there was

no easy mechanism for reallocating market shares.

       There are thus imperfect echoes of these models of collusion

under imperfect public information in the memoranda, but they are

rare.     These four incidents are the only such ones in nearly a

hundred meetings over the eighteen month period.        Market share is

a noisy indicator of cheating; and with direct evidence available,

the refiners evidently preferred to rely on that instead.

       Throughout the course of the Institute’s life there were calls

for a stronger agreement that would go beyond rules to exercise

control over production.       Indeed, that was the members initial

purpose in organizing, before their counsel told them they could

not do so.    Nonetheless, twice American proposed a market sharing

scheme.     In April 1929, it suggested a “formula” holding each

refiner’s output to its capacity under “War-time `control’ plus 50

percent of any subsequent increase in capacity.”         The issue “was

discussed at great length but no decision was arrived at”.           Then on

August 29 of that year, having waited for the official meeting to


                                     38
adjourn, the American representative proposed a specific market

share    for   each   firm   (with   a   decrease   in   every   share   except

American’s).     For neither proposal was any enforcement mechanism

offered, and, in fact, nothing came of either, so that almost a

year later, one participant complained “that, in spite of all the

pretty speeches which have been made on [self-regulation], there is

no evidence of this principle being put into practice.”                  He was

answered that ”unfortunately, the Institute’s attorney does not

allow discussion of this subject on a basis which could bring

actual results.”73

     A couple of refiners called for consolidating the industry.

The C.&H. president spoke of removing two or three refiners.74

Spreckels called for “three or at most four companies control[ling]

all the refineries of the country.”75           But there were no mergers or

acquisitions during this period.

        Calls for coordinated market withdrawals were left unfulfilled

as well.       C.&H. prepared a map "to show that, if the Western

territory is not invaded by Atlantic Coast and Gulf refiners,

Western producers would be able to distribute these products

without coming south or east."76              But the eastern refiners were

hardly prepared to cede the important market of Chicago.                  Placé

demanded a “deliberate plan for the curtailment of the operation of

the [then non-member] C.&H.”, and in response the Institute decided

to ask the Hawaiian planters to sell a larger part of their raw


                                         39
sugar to the Eastern refiners, rather than C.&H.    But there is no

further mention of this, and C.&H.'s production was not cut back.77

     These are the only discussions of stronger collusive schemes

in Placé.    The Sugar Institute was at the edge of allowable

behavior, “pioneers” at the “frontier”, as its counsel was to say

on the eve of the trial, “beyond anything” the courts had approved,

although not necessarily yet forbidden.78 Through its communicative

organs it could do much better than simply inferring cheating from

public information. To collude more explicitly, would clearly have

been illegal. To merge was impossible, given the government’s 1910

anti-trust suit against American.    Unfortunately for the refiners,

the Court would decide that their practices were also illegal, and

push back the “frontier”.



VII Conclusion

     We have emphasized the Sugar Institute's role as a mechanism

for governance and a forum for communication among the refiners.

However, it fulfilled two additional functions. The more important

of the two was its role as a neutral party among the firms.    That

allowed the Institute to audit them. It also collected information

while protecting its confidentiality, aggregating self-reported

firm-level statistics into industry totals that were then reported

back to the firms. Genesove and Mullin (1999) considers this role,

and so we have not pursued it here.


                                40
      There was an additional, strategic value to the embodiment of

the collusive agreement in an institution outside of the individual

firms.   In their bargaining with brokers or buyers, the refiners

sometimes used the Institute as a scapegoat.              More formally, firms

could commit to policies by having them formalized as Institute

rules.   However, this manoeuver was limited by the Institute's

counsel's warning that such claims would paint the Institute as a

consolidation and thus risk anti-trust prosecution.

      It is useful to compare what we have learned here about

communication with a number of recent theoretical papers that have

explored the issue.

      We have stressed the adaptation value of frequent meetings.

It could be argued that such flexibility would come at the cost of

less credible punishment schemes, for frequent meetings might allow

firms to renegotiate their way out of punishments. The theoretical

literature     on    renegotiation       is    inconclusive,   although     Barbara

McCutcheon (1997) has argued that the ability of colluding firms to

meet once an initial agreement has been reached would constrain the

agreement.      Certainly, that would help explain why retaliation

seems so weak in this market.

      However,       we   think   that    renegotiation    was   not   a    serious

impediment to collusion.          Clearly, the refiners did not see it as

so.   In choosing to have weekly meetings, the refiners obviously

valued   the        adaptation    function       higher   than   any       risk   of


                                          41
renegotiation of punishment.              The meetings continued at that

frequency, or higher at least until mid-1930, when the Placé memos

end.    No one ever suggested less frequent meetings.

       Also, we see no evidence of renegotiation out of punishment.

The threats we document are never retracted.           Nor   do we see firms

bargain out of any punishment.        Of course, the possibility that a

punishment might be renegotiated might nonetheless determine the

structure of the agreement; in theoretical terms, one can always

construct a non-renegotiated equilibrium from the path of any

renegotiation-proof equilibrium.           But, (a) we have already noted

that in meeting so frequently the refiners must have been either

unaware or unconcerned with the possibility of renegotiation, and

(b) that theoretical conclusion presupposes an environment in which

all contingencies are foreseen.       This non-renegotiated equilibrium

is more properly seen as an artifact of the models, in the same

sense that the models predict that there will be no cheating in

equilibrium.    McCutcheon herself acknowledges that her model lacks

"incomplete contracting, imperfect monitoring, and meetings in

equilibrium" - all features of the Sugar Institute.

       In   their   recent   paper   on    price   collusion   with   private

information, Athey et al. (2000) touch on certain issues that we

have emphasized here.        Thus they note that in the pursuit of a

workable collusive agreement, firms will often choose to give up

cost efficiencies.      We stressed the same point in Section II, but


                                      42
it is important to understand the difference between our paper and

theirs.     The foregone efficiencies in their model are privately

observed; whereas those we document here - delivering sugar by

water rather than rail, for example - are publicly known, and so,

as the authors themselves note in their conclusion, their collusive

scheme could easily and profitably accommodate them.                     Thus a

different explanation for the foregone efficiencies is required.

We   have   offered     the   explanation    that   exploitation    of    these

efficiencies would threaten the homogeneity of business practices

that made pricing transparent.

      In their conclusion, Athey et al. (2000) argue that their

model could rationalize a hypothetical situation in which one firm

openly lowers its price drastically and yet evokes no response.

They cite an earlier draft of this paper as providing support, in

the non-price domain, for such occurrences.             We think this is a

mistaken application of their model, for the cheating we describe

in Section VI are clearly “off-equilibrium”.                 They are taken

secretly, and typically uncovered only by the Institute’s costly

investigation.

      We    have   found   the   current    theories   of   collusion    to   be

inadequate for representing what transpired in the Sugar Institute.

Existing theory has little to say about communication in collusion,

and those models that exist do not capture the richness of the

content     of   that   communication.       Furthermore,    the   nature     of


                                      43
retaliation for cheating is much more restrained than that imagined

by the existing theories.   We have also argued that the internal

organization of the firms, more specifically, the selling agents’

high powered incentives, help explain the limited retaliation.

Nonetheless, one should not lose sight of the overall success of

Stigler’s original insight in capturing the essentials of collusion

in this market. The Sugar Institute and its rules were constructed

by firms in pursuit of the common goal of collusion but each well

aware of their individual, ex post incentive to undermine the

agreement once in place.

2.The Placé memoranda are deposited in the Rionda Family Archives

at the University of Florida, Gainesville (see Carl Van Ness,

1995).   We supplement them with the voluminous trial record.           Both

sources are described in David Genesove and Wallace Mullin (1999).

3.Paragraph 7712, Volume VI, Supplemental Transcript of the Record.

4.He actively participated at a meeting in which the move to

delivered pricing was coordinated (Placé, 4/18/29) but denied that

the refiners ever discussed it (Defendants Fact Brief, p. 212.).


                                      52
The memos also show Arbuckle Brothers shipping to a bootlegger

(Placé, 2/20,/30: 6).

5.Placé, 1/29/29, 2/15/29, 5/11/29. In the last case, the refiners

discuss asking the beet sugar refiners association to petition the

government to regulate transportation pricing in the sugar cane

refining industry.

6.The anti-trust authorities realized this early on (Harry A.

Babcock, 1930, p. 14).

7.This is reproduced in the appendix of Genesove and Mullin (1999).

8.Recent work that uses communication as a technical device to form

public histories to solve for the equilibrium does not demonstrate

the need for communication (Olivier Compte (1998) and Michihiro

Kandori and Hitoshi Matsushima (1998)).     Also, the messages in

these models are simply retrospective reports of the private

information, i.e., firm outputs, and miss the richness that we

describe below.   Laurits R. Christensen and Richard E. Caves(1997)

and Maura P. Doyle and Christopher M. Snyder (1999) show how firms

coordinate through public announcements of intended capacities and

production, respectively.

9.This is 26 cents (per hundred pounds) in 1898 dollars, the value

used in the earlier studies. These costs remained remarkably stable

as well. McCahan's internal documents indicate these costs amounted

to 63.6 cents per hundred pounds in 1927 (Placé correspondence,

December 12, 1932 letter to Manuel E. Rionda.)   The corresponding



                                 53
industry average in 1927 was 55.3 cents. (Brief for the Defendants

on the Facts, p. 455, in District Court Record).                  The economic

significance of these differences across firms or time is slight.

10.James Fly to O'Brien, February 26, 1932, DOJ Correspondence,

Case   File   No.   60-104-13.      Foreign       refiners   attributed   their

increased exports to the higher U.S. margins brought by the Sugar

Institute     (Walter   L.   Rice   to    James    Fly,   May   16,   1932,   DOJ

Correspondence, Case File No. 60-104-13).

12.Placé, August 2, 1929.

13.Placé, 4/4/29, 4/11/29, 2/20/30, 2/27/30.              For similar reasons,

trucking posed continual problems for the Institute.

14.In his ruling, the District Court Judge stated the matter

succinctly: "the refiners preferred to have all sugar sold in any

given trade areas at precisely the same prices and terms rather

than to effect economies in its sale and distribution."               Andrew R.

Dick (1996) notes that in colluding via a common sale agency, some

U.S. export cartels must forego marketing specialized to the needs

of individual firms' products.

15.Placé (June) 06/13/29.

16.Between 1928 and 1931, barge shipments by refiners increased by

400 percent, while those by customers fell by two-thirds.               "Denies

15, 1928, p. 1. Michael Katz (1987) shows how price discrimination

can deter backward integration by large downstream buyers (indeed

chain stores in his example).        The successful backward integration

of   Arbuckle Brothers from sugar packaging to refining in 1898

after American refused it a quantity discount would have lent some

credibility to A. & P.'s threat (Genesove and Mullin, 1997).

20.There   were   150    such   associations        in   1921,   (Federal      Trade

Commission     Survey,    cited    by     Simon    Whitney,      1935,    p.    40).

Ironically, over 400 open price associations were operating under

the National Recovery Administration at the time of the Supreme

Court decision (F. M. Scherer and David Ross, p. 348).

21.See American Column and Lumber Co. et al. v. United States, 257

U.S. 377 (1921); United States v. American Linseed Oil               et al., 262

22.American,    the   largest     firm,      was   particularly    wary    of   any

discussions of prices.          Upon the reading of a broker's letter

complaining about non-uniformity in the previous week's price

announcement, its representative complained that "such a letter


                                        55
should never have been read at a meeting of the Institute and

should never have been placed on the agenda." (Placé, December 19,

1929.)   See also Placé, July 18, 1929: 6 and March 13, 1930.   The

initial Department of Justice report on the Institute noted that

"If we may deduce anything from the invitation issued by the

Institute to the Department of Justice to send a representative to

attend its meetings, no discussion of price takes place at them"

[NARA DOJ 60-104-13, Box 421, Contents of Bundle, December 1, 1928,

p. 20]. The refiners did discuss fixing brokerage rates (12/12/29;

1/30/30).

23.Whitney, December 1, 1928, in DOJ Correspondence.

24.This is evident from a series of letters between Placé, who was

in charge of marketing, and the production manager, e.g. Letter

from Kavanagh to Placé, July 24, 1930,    Placé Correspondence --

Costs and Melts, R.G. IV -S. G. 3 Series 151 - Box 1.           The

Institute's Standardization Committee concerned itself only with

defining a few of the widely available commercial grades, and

monitoring the refiners' accurate labeling of their own sugars for

sale (a logical complement to the `open prices' rule). It was not

particularly successful.

institutions to an executive, legislature and judiciary, though he

makes no mention of legal imagery in their discussions.

33.Placé, 2/20/30, p.6.

34.For example, Federal announced to its fellow refiners that it

might consider packing "private brands" but would take no action

without notifying the Institute.         Later, Imperial objected to the

large   number   of   private   brands     offered   by   Texas   City,   and

threatened to "meet the competition."           Three months after this

threat, Imperial announced to the Institute that it would indeed

pack private brands, at which time Texas City complained that it

had discontinued two of its private brands. (Placé 08/02/29,

38.Notification is desirable even when the rival firms are left

worse off after they match the price cutter, as when a low cost

firm undercuts an initial price that is equal to a high cost firm's

monopoly price (Robert H. Gertner, 1994).   Also, compare Margaret

Slade (1992), in which price wars are seen as transitions to the

new equilibrium when privately observable costs change.

“off-schedule” deviations are also treated the same.

48.Placé, 05/16/1929: 22. 3/13/30.     The Arbuckle representative

volunteered the information to prove a point. Upon hearing it, one

of the National representatives "jumped to his feet and in an

excited tone of voice asked the Institute to elect another chairman

as he refuses to be a member of an organization whose members

brazenly admit the violation of its regulations.       I caught an

                                58
exchange      of   glances   between    [him   and   the   other   National

representative] and the former immediately calmed down.             It was

evident that the National had [done the same]."

non-raw sugar component of variable cost per pound. Column (4) presents the ratio
of that margin to the price of refined sugar. Column (5) shows the output of the
Atlantic refiners, in millions of pounds.      Column (6) shows the sum of the
variable profits of the Atlantic refiners, in millions of dollars. Columns (7)
and (8) present the annual shares of domestic beet sugar production and imported
