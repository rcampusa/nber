Global Liquidity Trap

                                                ABSTRACT

In this paper we consider a two-country New Open Economy Macroeconomics model, and analyze
the optimal monetary policy when countries cooperate in the face of a "global liquidity trap" – i.e.,D
situation where the two countries are simultaneously caught in liquidity traps. Compared to the closed
economy case, a notable feature of the optimal policy in the face of a global liquidity trap is its international
dependence. Whether or not a country's nominal interest rate is hitting the zero bound affects the target
inflation rate of the other country. The direction of the effect depends on whether goods produced
in the two countries are Edgeworth complements or substitutes. We also compare several classes of
simple interest-rate rules. Our finding is that targeting the price level yields higher welfare than targeting
the inflation rate, and that it is desirable to let the policy rate of each country respond not only to its
own price level and output gap, but also to those in the other country.

1    Introduction

The world economy now faces the largest economic downturn since World War II. To pre-

vent further economic deterioration, most central banks in developed economies, including

the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, have reduced policy interest rates to

unprecedentedly low levels, acting promptly and in unison. The liquidity trap is no longer

an extreme event only for one country, but has become an international concern that needs

to be solved through international monetary cooperation. Figure 1 shows nominal interest

rates from year 2008 to 2009 in several advanced countries. All nominal interest rates

exhibit drastic decreases from their levels in 2008.

    In this paper we investigate how monetary authorities of di¤erent countries should

coordinate with each other when they …nd themselves simultaneously caught into a liquidity

traps; that is, how they should coordinate policy measures in the case of a global liquidity

trap. For this purpose, we consider a two-country version of the model of Eggertsson and

Woodford (2003), and study the optimal monetary policy coordination in an environment

where the zero lower bound for the nominal interest rate binds in both countries.

    We start by asking under what conditions countries in an open economy separately

might fall into a liquidity trap. We assume producer currency pricing and complete in-

ternational asset markets. Then, if the nominal interest rate never hits the zero bound,

the optimal policy is given by setting the producer price index (PPI) in‡ation rate to be

zero for each country at all times, as in previous studies such as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler

(2001) and Benigno and Benigno (2003). Under such a policy, the nominal interest rate

in each country is set equal to the real interest rate associated with its own PPI. Thus we

can de…ne the “natural rate of interest” for each country as the PPI-based real interest

rate in the equilibrium with zero PPI in‡ation. The …rst best can be attained as long

as the natural rate of interest de…ned in this way is positive for each country. However,

once a country’s natural rate becomes negative, its nominal interest rate will hit the zero

bound and its economy will fall into a liquidity trap. Thanks to complete international

asset markets, every household in every country has access to the same set of assets at



                                              2
the same prices. Nevertheless monetary authorities in di¤erent countries will face di¤er-

ent real interest rates, because PPIs will vary if countries produce di¤erent goods. This

explains why it is possible for countries to fall separately into liquidity traps even though

international asset markets are complete.

       We then show that the optimal monetary policy in the case of a global liquidity trap

exhibits two notable features: history dependence and international dependence. The im-

portance of the history dependence in the conduct of monetary policy during a liquidity

trap has been noted in previous studies on the closed economy.1 The adverse e¤ect of

the liquidity trap can be mitigated if the monetary authority commits to generate some

in‡ation and stimulate production in the future. Such a mechanism is also at work in a

global liquidity trap.

       The international dependence of the optimal monetary policy discussed in this paper is

a new feature of interdependence that arises in a global liquidity trap. In open economies,

countries are naturally interrelated through trades in goods and services. In the context

of optimal monetary policy, several aspects of such interdependence across countries have

been analyzed in previous studies such as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001) and Benigno

and Benigno (2003). One of our main …ndings is that a global liquidity trap brings about

a new form of interdependence in the optimal monetary policy in open economies. In our

model, if the nominal interest rate never hits the zero bound, the optimal policy could

be implemented by a purely inward-looking in‡ation-targeting policy in which the target

in‡ation rate for each country depends only on its own output gap.2 This is no longer

the case once the possibility that the zero bound binds is taken into account. The target

in‡ation rate for each country necessarily depends on conditions in the other country.

   1
       Examples on previous work on the closed economy include, among others, Eggertsson and Woodford
(2003), Jung, Teranishi, and Watanabe (2005), and Adam and Billi (2006, 2007). As discussed in Eggertsson
and Woodford (2003), there could be …scal policies to ease the adverse e¤ect of liquidity trap. In the current
paper, however, we focus on the outcomes the monetary policy can bring about taking the …scal policies as
given.
   2
       This has been shown previously, for instance, by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001). In other word, even
if the two countries trade goods each other, international dependence is obtained only in the liquidity trap.



                                                       3
   In this sense, the global liquidity trap introduces a new form of international dependence

in the optimal monetary policy, which is what we shed light on in this paper. The direction

to which the international dependence works depends on whether goods produced in the

two countries are Edgeworth complements or substitutes. For instance, suppose that they

are substitutes. Then if one country is in a liquidity trap, it exerts downward pressure on

the target in‡ation rate in the other country. In addition, a country pursuing an in‡ationary

policy in order to extricate itself from a liquidity trap will exert upward pressure on the

other country’s in‡ation target. If goods produced in di¤erent countries are complements,

the e¤ects work in opposite directions.

   We then examine if the optimal monetary policy can be approximated by a simple

interest-rate rule. For a closed economy where there is no possibility of a liquidity trap,

Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) show that the optimal policy is replicated fairly well by

the class of interest-rate rules that respond only to the in‡ation rate. Taking the liquidity

trap into consideration, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) argue that a simple price-level

targeting policy performs well for the closed economy. Our question here is whether such

a similarly simple monetary policy rule can be identi…ed in our model of a global liquidity

trap. What we …nd, in line with Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), is that an interest-

rate rule with a price-level target performs much better than the corresponding rule with

an in‡ation target. Furthermore, improved performance is obtained when we allow the

interest-rate rule for each country to depend on the other country’s price level and output

gap. This is because such a rule helps to capture, at least to some extent, the international

dependence that a desirable policy should possess when faced with a global liquidity trap.

   The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the existing literature on

liquidity traps. Section 3 describes our two-country NOEM model and derives the world-

loss function. In section 4, we analyze the optimal policy coordination problem, and show

that history and international dependences are crucial features of the optimal policy when

the zero bound may bind. We also present a numerical example, which allows further

investigation into the properties of the optimal policy. Section 5 considers simple interest-

rate rules, and examines how well they can approximate the optimal policy in the face of


                                             4
a global liquidity trap. Section 6 concludes.


2    A Brief Survey of the Related Literature

The BOJ’s adoption of what was e¤ectively a zero interest rate policy in the late 1990s

renewed interest in the liquidity trap. For the case of the closed economy, the properties

of the optimal (or at least desirable) monetary policy under such circumstances have been

investigated, for instance, by Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Eggertsson and Woodford

(2003), Jung, Teranishi, and Watanabe (2005), Kato and Nishiyama (2005), Adam and Billi

(2006, 2007), and Nakov (2008).

    Reifschneider and Williams (2000) examine how to conduct monetary policy when the

non-negativity condition for the nominal interest rate may bind using the FRBUS model.

In order to mitigate the de‡ationary impact of a liquidity trap, they show that it is desirable

for the monetary authority to commit to maintain a zero interest rate for some periods

even after the adverse shock that triggered the liquidity trap has disappeared. They did

not derive the optimal monetary policy in their model, but later studies show that such

history dependence is indeed one of its important characteristics.

    Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Jung, Teranishi, and Watanabe (2005) derive

the optimal monetary policy in a standard New Keynesian model. As suggested by Reif-

schneider and Williams (2000), they show that the optimal policy possesses the history-

dependence property that the nominal interest rate remains zero for a while even after the

adverse shock itself disappears. The commitment to such a policy ameliorates the de‡a-

tionary pressure in earlier periods where the the adverse shock exists, because it raises the

expected in‡ation rate and lowers the real interest rate. Their models have been extended

to di¤erent stochastic environments by Kato and Nishiyama (2005), Adam and Billi (2006)

and Nakov (2008). The basic message that history dependence is the key feature of the

optimal monetary policy in the face of a liquidity trap is unchanged in these extensions.

    Coenen and Wieland (2003), Svensson (2001), and Nakajima (2008) study a liquidity

trap in open economies. Coenen and Wieland (2003) and Svensson (2001) emphasize the

importance of raising the expected rate of in‡ation in an open economy context, and explore

                                                5
its implications for the nominal exchange rate. Nakajima (2008) analyzes the optimal

monetary policy in a two-country version of the model of Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).

These studies, however, restrict attention to a “local liquidity trap,” where there is only

one country in the liquidity trap. The contribution of our paper is to extend the enquiry

to encompass a global liquidity trap, where two countries are simultaneously caught in

liquidity traps.

    The optimal policies in the face of, respectively, global and local liquidity traps turn

out to be di¤erent not only during periods when both countries are stuck in liquidity traps,

but also in other periods when one country has successfully escaped. This is because we

are considering the optimal policy commitment. Even in an environment where only one

country remains in a liquidity trap, the optimal policy committed to is di¤erent depending

on whether the commitment was made in a period when both countries were caught in a

liquidity trap, or when one country had already escaped the liquidity trap. In this sense,

the optimal policy problem in the face of a global liquidity trap is a distinct problem, for

which we provide new insights from both analytical and computational viewpoints.


3     The Model

3.1   Households

The model economy is an open-economy version of the sticky-price model developed by

Woodford (2003), and closely related to the ones considered by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler

(2001), and Benigno and Benigno (2003), among others.

    The world economy consists of two countries; the home country (H), and the foreign

country (F ). The size of population in country j 2 fH; F g is nj , where nH + nF = 1. A

set of di¤erentiated products are produced in each country and they are traded between

the two countries. Let Nj denote the set of those products. We assume that NH = [0; nH ],

and NF = (nH ; 1].

    In each country identical households reside, who consume di¤erentiated commodities,

supply di¤erentiated labor, and own …rms in their country. Monetary policy is set by the



                                             6
monetary authority in each country. Details of monetary policy are discussed later.


3.1.1   Preferences

A representative household in the home country H has preferences given by

                                   nj Nj

where pt (i), i 2 Nj , j 2 fH; F g, is the price of good i produced in country j quoted

in the home currency. The price indexes in the foreign country, Pt , Pj;t , j = H; F , are

de…ned similarly by individual good prices, pt (i), i 2 Nj , j 2 fH; F g, quoted in the foreign

currency.

    We assume that the law of one price holds:


                                            pt (i) = Et pt (i);


for all i 2 Nj , j 2 fH; F g, where Et is the nominal exchange rate, de…ned as the price of

foreign currency in terms of home currency. It follows that Pj;t = Et Pj;t , j = H; F , and

Pt = Et Pt .


3.1.2    Utility maximization

We assume worldwide complete …nancial markets. The ‡ow budget constraint for the home

household is
                                                     Z
                Pt Ct + Et [Qt;t+1 Wt+1 ] = Wt +                  wt (i)`t (i) +   t (i)   di + Tt ;   (5)
                                                         NH

where Et is the conditional expectation operator, Qt;t+1 is the stochastic discount factor

between dates t and t + 1 for nominal payo¤s in the home country, Wt+1 is the portfolio

of one-period state-contingent bonds, wt (i) is the date-t nominal wage rate for type i 2

NH labor,      t (i)   is the date-t nominal pro…ts from sales of good i 2 NH , and Tt is the

nominal lump-sum transfer from the home government. Given the initial asset holding,

W0 , the home household maximizes its lifetime utility as expressed in equation (1) subject

to equation (5).



                                                     8
    The ‡ow budget constraint for the foreign household is expressed analogously as:
                                                   Z
       Et Pt Ct + Et [Qt;t+1 Et+1 Wt+1 ] = Et Wt +   Et wt (i)`t (i) + t (i) di + Tt ;
                                                            NF

where Wt+1 is the portfolio of state-contingent bonds in the foreign currency, wt (i) is the

nominal wage rate for type i 2 NF labor,            t (i)   is the nominal pro…t from sales of good

i 2 NF , and Tt is the nominal lump-sum transfer from the foreign government. Given

the initial asset holding W0 , the utility maximization problem for the foreign household is

de…ned as for the home household.

corresponding notation for other derivatives. As we shall see, policy makers’stabilization

3.1.3    Equilibrium shares of consumption

Under the standard assumption that the representative households of the two countries are

equally wealthy in the initial period, their equilibrium consumption levels are identical for

all t:

                           CH;t = CH;t ;       CF;t = CF;t ;        Ct = Ct :

                                                    9
   Let yt (i), i 2 NH , and yt (i), i 2 NF , denote the aggregate supply of home and foreign

goods, respectively:


        yt (i) = nH ct (i) + nF ct (i);         i 2 NH ;               yt (i) = nH ct (i) + nF ct (i);             i 2 NF :


The corresponding production indexes for home and foreign goods are

                                  nH                   nF

It follows that

3.2     Aggregate supply

3.2.1     Technology

For simplicity, we assume that the technology to produce each good is linear in labor:


                                      yt (i) = At nH `t (i);                     i 2 NH ;

                                      yt (i) = At nF `t (i);                     i 2 NF ;


where At and At represent country-speci…c technology shocks.

   For later use, it is convenient to de…ne random variables                                    t   and   t   by


                             t        (1 + !) ln At ;                   t          (1 + !) ln At ;


and also functions v(y; ) and v (y ;                    ) by
                                                                        1+!

                                 v(y; )                                          = v~                ;
                                                   1+!            nH                    nH A

                             v (y ;       )                                      = v~                 :
                                                   1+!            nF                    nF A

Thus, v(y; ) and v (y ;               ) measure the disutility of producing y and y in the home and

foreign countries, respectively, when their technology shocks are                                  and      . Note that

The …rst-order conditions (8) and (9) can then be rewritten as

3.3    New Keynesian aggregate supply relations

Now suppose that goods prices are adjusted at random intervals as in Calvo (1983). Let

  be the probability that each good price remains unchanged in each period. We assume

that this probability is identical in the two countries.

   Consider the price adjustment in the home country. Suppose that the price of good

i 2 NH can be adjusted at date t. The supplier of that good chooses pt (i) to maximize its

expected discounted pro…ts:
                     1
                                         (                                                                )
                     X                                                  wT (i) YH;T            pt (i)
                            T t
                Et                Qt;T        (1        )pt (i)                                                :
                                                                         AT     nH             PH;T
                     T =t

The …rst-order condition for pro…t maximization is written as
       1
                     (                                                                                         )
       X               YH;T pt (i)     1
                                           vy [yT (i); T ]                                            pt (i)
            T t
    Et          Qt;T                                        (1                                      )              = 0:    (14)

       T =t

It follows that all producers that change their prices at date t choose the same price.

   Log-linearizing equation (14) and the corresponding equation for the foreign country

lead to the “New Keynesian” aggregate-supply relations:


                              H;t    =       H xH;t   +         HF nF xF;t     + Et   H;t+1 ;                              (15)

                               F;t   =       HF nH xH;t         +     F xF;t   + Et   F;t+1 :                              (16)


Here   H;t     ln PH;t      ln PH;t      1   and      F;t           ln PF;t     ln PF;t    1   are the in‡ation rates for

3.4     Welfare approximation

When the two countries coordinate their policies, our welfare criterion for evaluating these

is the average lifetime utility of the representative agents in the two countries:
                      1
                      X                        Z                  Z
                           t
  nH U0 +nF U0 = E0            u(YH;t ; YF;t )     v yt (i); t di      v yt (i); t di : (18)
                            t=0                                NH                                      NF

Speci…cally, we shall work with a quadratic loss function derived from a second-order ap-

proximation of (18) following Woodford (2003) and Benigno and Woodford (2005), among

others.

   Consider a non-stochastic steady state with zero in‡ation, and assume for simplicity

that      =         = 0. Then, as shown in the Appendix, a second-order approximation of the

world welfare (18) around the zero-in‡ation steady state is given by
                                                                           1
                                                                           X
                                                                                   t

where     0   and    1   are constants independent of policy, and Lt is a quadratic measure of the

world-welfare loss given by

Thus, up to a second-order approximation, our welfare criterion is given by the expected

loss function:
                                                               1

                                                               13
where       is the period in which policies are evaluated4 .

       Our welfare measure clearly shows that what must be stabilized are the PPI in‡ation

rates,     H;t   and    F;t ,   rather than the consumer price index (CPI) in‡ation rates,          t   and   t

de…ned as        t     ln Pt      ln Pt   1   and   t   ln Pt   ln Pt   1.   An equivalent result is shown by

Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001) as well as by Benigno and Benigno (2003), in di¤erent

contexts.


3.5       Real interest rates in open economies

In an economy where a single good is produced and consumed, it is straightforward to de…ne

the real interest rate. If di¤erent commodities are produced and consumed, it becomes less

obvious how to de…ne the real interest rate. In the standard closed-economy New Keynesian

model, a variety of di¤erentiated commodities are produced and consumed, but there is still

no ambiguity in the de…nition of the real interest rate, because every household consumes

the same basket of goods, which also coincides with the basket of goods produced in the

economy. There the CPI-based real interest rate coincides with the PPI-based real interest

rate.

       Since the real interest rate is de…ned unambiguously in the closed economy, so is the

“natural rate of interest”: it is de…ned as the real interest rate in the ‡exible-price equi-

librium. With sticky prices, to a …rst-order approximation, the in‡ation rate is completely

eliminated if the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and the natural rate of in-

terest are all equalized. As discussed by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), however, if the

natural interest rate becomes negative, the zero lower bound condition for the nominal

interest rate binds in the optimal policy problem, and it is no longer possible to completely

stabilize the in‡ation rate.

       The corresponding notions in the open economy framework are less clear, however,

   4
       As indicated by the quadratic world-welfare loss (19) a là Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), our model
abstracts from the other possible avenue through which de‡ation impairs the economy than price disper-
sions. Those include debt-de‡ation which may be important during the great recession. If the welfare loss
associated with debt-de‡ation is also considered, the zero lower bound policy could last longer than that
proposed in the current model.


                                                           14
even in our speci…cation where representative individuals in the two countries consume

exactly the same basket of goods in equilibrium and both have access to the complete

set of state-contingent claims at the same prices. The reason is that the two countries

produce di¤erent baskets of goods. It follows that each country has a distinct PPI-based

real interest rate, which is also di¤erent from the CPI-based real interest rate. Thus, the

question of which real interest rate should be relevant to the monetary authority is now

non-trivial. Naturally, the answer depends on its chosen objective. Here, the objective of

the monetary authority is to minimize the expected world-welfare loss function (21), and

thus to stabilize the PPI in‡ation rates,            H;t   and   F;t .   It follows that the relevant real

interest rates are the PPI-based rates.

       Let RH;t be the gross real interest rate associated with the home-produced composite

good YH :
                                                                              1

                                RH;t      Et                                      :
                                                  uH (YH;t ; YF;t )
Similarly, let RF;t be the gross real interest rate associated with the foreign-produced

composite good YF :
                                                                             1

       Given that the PPI in‡ation rates are the ones to be stabilized, the relevant natural

rates of interest are also PPI-based: these are de…ned as the PPI-based real interest rates

that obtain in equilibrium when prices in both countries are assumed to be ‡exible:

   Following convention, the dynamic IS relations are obtained by log-linearizing the Euler

equations and taking the conditional expectation. Here, since the PPIs are the in‡ation

rates that the monetary authorities should watch, the relevant Euler equations are (6)-(7),

and hence the corresponding IS relations become:

where iH;t and iF;t are the logs of the gross nominal interest rates. Note that equations (24)

and (25) coincide with equations (26) and (27), respectively, because rH;t = iH;t Et                   H;t+1

and rF;t = iF;t Et      F;t+1 .   The zero bounds for the nominal interest rates are

   A competitive equilibrium attains the …rst best outcome (up to a …rst-order approxi-

mation) if

                                        H;t   =   F;t   = xH;t = xF;t = 0;

at all dates and under all contingencies. Given equations (26) and (27), the nominal interest

rates in such an equilibrium are equal to the PPI-based natural rates of interest:

                                                 n
                                         ij;t = rj;t ;          j = H; F:



                                                           16
In this sense, our de…nition of the natural rates of interest, equations (22) and (23), is

a natural extension of the one used by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) for the closed

economy.

        The fact that the natural rates of interest relevant to welfare are those based on the PPI

in‡ation rate as in equations (22)-(23) explains why it is possible for the two countries to fall

separately into liquidity traps even though the international asset market is complete. Here,

representative agents in the two countries trade the complete set of state contingent claims

at the same prices. For any given basket of goods, therefore, both the corresponding real

interest rate and the corresponding natural rate of interest are identical for individuals in

di¤erent countries. Thus the situation where just one of the countries is caught in a liquidity

trap does not arise because agents in di¤erent countries face di¤erent real interest rates;

rather, it arises because the two monetary authorities are watching di¤erent real interest

rates and hence di¤erent natural rates of interest. Optimal monetary policy requires the

monetary authority in each country to control the real interest rate based on the PPI; it

does so by choosing a policy interest rate that takes into account the natural rate of interest

de…ned in terms of that country’s PPI, as shown in equations (24)-(25).

         Trap

4.1        Optimal Monetary Policy in the face of a Global Liquidity Trap

In this section we analyze the equilibrium when policy is optimal and coordinated with the

optimal policy coordination.6 Speci…cally, suppose that, at some date , the two monetary

authorities coordinate with each other and choose their policies with perfect commitment

    6
        Existing studies on optimal monetary policy in open economies, such as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001)
and Benigno and Benigno (2003), investigate the Nash equilibrium along with the cooperative equilibrium.
In this paper, we focus on the latter equilibrium because the examination of the Nash equilibrium gives a
substantially di¤erent welfare measure.
    In the Nash equilibrium, the optimal policy interest rate in the home country is chosen so as to maximize
the utility of representative agents in the home country H given by equation (1). Thus, an optimizer in the
home country no longer considers the welfare of representative agents in the foreign country.


                                                        17
in order to achieve an equilibrium that maximizes world welfare. The equilibrium in this

case is obtained by solving the Ramsey problem, that is, by minimizing the world-welfare

loss function (21) subject to the constraints (15), (16), (26), (27), (28), and (29). This

equilibrium is referred to as the Ramsey equilibrium.

       Consider …rst the case in which the zero bound conditions for the nominal interest rates,

equations (28) and (29), never bind. Then the Ramsey equilibrium can be implemented

by the following targeting rules:

                                                   1
                                        H;t   +        (xH;t      xH;t      1)   = 0;                   (30)
                                                   1
                                         F;t   +       (xF;t      xF;t      1)   = 0:                   (31)

These rules are inward looking in the sense that the monetary authority in each country

only needs to look at the in‡ation rate and the output gap in its own country. Thus, as

long as the zero bound conditions for the nominal interest rates do not bind, world welfare

is maximized by a purely inward-looking policy.7 This point has been previously made,

for instance, by Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001). Note that this inward-looking feature

of the optimal monetary policy does not depend on the value of .

       However, the optimal monetary policy can no longer be described by inward-looking

  Benigno and Benigno (2003) show that a quadratic measure of welfare includes linear terms for con-
sumption and output. They conclude that the elimination of these linear terms requires the assumption
of perfect price stability through the game theoretic strategies of the two central banks. In the face of a
liquidity trap, however, perfect price stability cannot be attained. The linear term in the welfare measure
makes the optimal monetary policy analysis impossible.
  Alternatively, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2001) propose treating the foreign variables as given constants.
This allows the following form of loss function to be derived:

                                               1
                                               X       t1         2          2
                                       Lt                      H xH;t   +    H;t   :
                                               t=0
                                                        2
While this quadratic measure of the welfare loss contains only home variables, comparison between the
Nash equilibrium and the cooperative equilibrium involves a new di¢ culty because the sum of the quadratic
measures of welfare loss in the two countries does not coincide with equation (19).
   7
       Our assumption of producer currency pricing is also crucial for this result. As shown by Devereux and
Engel (2003), under local currency pricing, the optimal monetary policy aims at stabilizing the nominal
exchange rate and therefore takes foreign variables into consideration. Investigation of the optimal monetary
policy under local currency pricing is left for our future research.

rules if the zero lower bound conditions bind with a positive probability. Even with the

producer currency pricing, foreign variables must be included in the domestic targeting

rule. The degree of in‡uence from foreign variables is determined by                                                . Denoting the

Lagrange multipliers associated with inequalities (28) and (29) by                                      H;t     and       F;t ,   the …rst

order conditions under a commitment policy yield the following targeting rules:

                                                 1
                                      H;t   +        (xH;t    xH;t       1)   = zH;t ;                                                  (32)

       Comparing the targeting rules (30)-(31) and (32)-(33), we see that when the zero bound

binds, the e¤ect is summarized by the term zt = (zH;t ; zF;t ). Suppose that country j 2

fH; F g is in a liquidity trap in some period t^, so that                       j;t^ >       0. Then it a¤ects zt for three

periods: t = t^; t^ + 1; t^ + 2, as shown by equation (35). If                                H;t   =   F;t     = 0 for all t, the

optimal targeting rules (32)-(33) reduce to the inward-looking rules (30)-(31).

       To understand better the e¤ect of a liquidity trap on the optimal policy, Figure 2 plots

how zH and zF respond to a one-time increase in                          H     for di¤erent values of                     in equation

(34). Speci…cally it shows how zH;t and zF;t vary when                                 H;t   = 0 for all t 6= 1 and               H;1   =1

with      F;t   = 0 for all t.8 Let us look at the top panel, which shows how the optimal targeting

rule for the home country is a¤ected when the home country falls into a liquidity trap in

period 1. In the period that the zero bound binds, the monetary authority has to allow for

de‡ation and a negative output gap, so that the targeting rule shifts downward: zH;1 < 0.

However, such a downward shift in the targeting rule is alleviated by promising an upward

   8
       The parameter values used to plot the …gure are summarized in Table 1, which is discussed in Section
4.2.


                                                             19
shift in the targeting rule in the future, zH;2 > 0. In other words, a country caught in a

liquidity trap can reduce the damage it sustains if the monetary authority commits itself

to generating some in‡ation and positive output gaps in the future. This feature of the

optimal monetary policy is the history dependence that is emphasized in previous studies

on the closed economy, such as Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Jung, Teranishi, and

Watanabe (2005).

       The possibility of a global liquidity trap adds an additional feature to the optimal

policy: international dependence. Mathematically, such interdependence can be seen by

the fact that the country-speci…c Lagrange multipliers on the zero bound constraints,                             H;t

and       F;t ,   each a¤ect both zH;t and zF;t as shown in equation (34) provided that                        6= 1.9

For instance, if the home country is in a liquidity trap in period t, then                       H;t   > 0; this will

a¤ect not only the home country’s targeting rule (32), but also the foreign country’s rule

(33) through its in‡uence on zH;t and zF;t . The optimal rate of in‡ation for each country

is a¤ected by whether or not the other country is caught in a liquidity trap. Economic

e¢ ciency is no longer attained simply by ‘keeping one’s house in order.’

       The lower panel of Figure 2 shows how a liquidity trap in the home country a¤ects

the optimal targeting rule for the foreign country. The direction of the e¤ect depends

on whether            is greater or less than unity. This follows from the fact that the source

of the international dependence in our model is the dependence of the marginal utility

from consuming the composite good produced in one country on the consumption of the

composite good produced in the other country. When                             > 1, however, home goods and

foreign goods are Edgeworth substitutes, i.e., uHF = uF H < 0. The marginal utility of

the consumption of the composite good produced in one country is a¤ected in the same

direction by the consumption of the composite good produced in either country, becasue

uHH < 0 and uF F < 0. Thus, in this case, a shift of the optimal targeting rule in one

country is transmitted into a shift of the optimal targeting rule in the other country in the

   9
       It is clear from equation (34) that if   = 1, then   j   only a¤ects zj for each j = H; F . Thus, the targeting
rules (32)-(33) do not exhibit the form of international dependence discussed here. In what follows, whenever
we emphasize the international dependence of the optimal monetary policy, we are implicitly assuming that
  6= 1.

                                                            20
same direction. This can be seen in the …gure that             H;t     a¤ects zF;t and zH;t in the same

direction when    = 2. To the contrary, when              < 1, home goods and foreign goods are

Edgeworth complements: uHF = uF H > 0. Thus, the marginal utility of the consumption

of goods produced in each country is a¤ected in the opposite directions by the consumption

of goods produced in the two countries. As a result, the optimal targeting rule in the two

countries shift in the opposite directions. This is consistent with the …gure in the case of

  = 0:5.

   A further insight into how monetary policy should be conducted in a global liquidity

trap is obtained by looking at the dynamic IS curves (26)-(27) with the zero bound condi-

tions (28)-(29). First, suppose that the natural rate of interest associated with the home
                                 n
good is negative in period t0 , rH;t  < 0, so that the home country is in a liquidity trap:
                                    0



                                 0 = iH;t0 = rH;t0 + Et0      H;t0 +1 ;


where rH;t0 denotes the real interest rate associated with the home good as de…ned in

equation (24).

   The optimal policy attempts to relax the degree to which the zero constraint binds.

There are several ways to do this. One way is for the monetary authority in the home

country to commit to future stimulation of the home economy once the natural rate returns

to a positive level. Such a commitment makes Et0          H;t0 +1    > 0 and Et0 (xH;t0 +1   xH;t0 ) > 0.

Both of these would o¤set at least partially the depressing e¤ect of the negative shock

to the home natural rate. Additionally, if the foreign monetary authority also commits to

achieve (   1)Et0 (xF;t0 +1    xF;t0 ) > 0, then the zero constraint for the home country would

be relaxed further. Thus, if     > 1 (respectively, if      < 1), a future expansion (contraction)

of the foreign economy helps alleviate the severity of the current liquidity trap for the home

economy. In this way, policy commitment by each of the two monetary authorities acts to

reduce the welfare loss associated with the home country’s liquidity trap.

   Next suppose that the natural rate in the home country returns to a positive level in

period t1 > t0 . The IS curve for the foreign country is

                                    iF;t1 = rF;t1 + Et1    F;t1 +1 ;


                                                21
where rF;t1 denotes the real interest rate associated with the foreign good de…ned in (25).

Given the home monetary authority’s policy commitment, the home economy experiences

a temporary boom in period t1 , xH;t1 > 0, which implies that Et1 (xH;t1 +1              xH;t1 ) < 0.

From the perspective of the foreign monetary authority, if               > 1 ( < 1) this constitutes

a negative (positive) shock to the real interest rate rF;t1 . Thus, for             > 1 (for   < 1),

the foreign monetary authority tends to lower (raise) iF;t when the home natural rate,

rH;t , becomes positive. Notice also that such a response by the foreign monetary authority

tends to raise (lower) xF;t1 when          > 1 ( < 1); this is consistent with the foreign monetary

authority’s commitment to generate (               1)Et0 (xF;t0 +1   xF;t0 ) > 0 during periods when

the home country is in the liquidity trap.


4.2       Numerical example

In order to further analyze the properties of the optimal policy, let us consider a numerical

example, which extends the closed-economy experiment of Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)

to our open-economy environment. The parameters assumed here are summarized in Table

1. Suppose that in the initial period t = 0, the world economy is in the steady state where
                                 1
the natural rate is rn =              , and the in‡ation rates and the output gaps are all zero:

 H    =    F   = xH = xF = 0. Then, in period t = 1, the natural rates of interest in both

countries drop unexpectedly to a negative level rn < 0. These negative natural rate shocks

are temporary, and we assume that the natural rates evolve according to the following
                         n = r n = r n ; (ii) if r n = r n , then
stochastic process: (i) rH;1  F;1                 H;t

                                       < rn ;       with probability pt ;
                          n
                         rH;t+1      =
                                       : rn ;       with probability 1      pt ;

where pt = p for 1       t       S    1 and pt = 1 for t                n = r n , then
                                                           S; (iii) if rF;t

                          n
                         rF;t+1      =
                                       : rn ;       with probability 1      qt ;

where qt = q for 1           t                                    n = r n , then r n
                                 S and qt = 1 for t > S; (iv) if rj;t                      n
                                                                                  j;t+1 = r with

probability one, for j = H; F and for all t > 1.            Here, S is a large positive integer that


                                                    22
determines the maximal number of periods for which a country’s natural rate may remain

negative.

     Let TH and TF be the stopping times de…ned respectively as the last periods in which
 n = r n and r n = r n . The probability that (T ; T ) = (
rH;t                                                                                                             1 p(1

described by a set of stochastic processes fiH;t ; iF;t ;                                    1
                                                                  H;t ;   F;t ; xH;t ; xF;t gt=1 ,   each of which is

adapted to the …ltration generated by the stopping times (TH ; TF ). The optimal monetary

policy chooses this set of stochastic processes so as to solve the Ramsey problem described in

the previous subsection. The details of the numerical algorithm are given in the Appendix.

In what follows, we examine equilibrium paths under the optimal policy associated with

particular realizations of the stopping times (TH ; TF ).

     Let us begin with the symmetric case: TH = TF , that is, the case in which the natural

rates of both economies return to the normal level r in the same period. Figure 3 plots

the paths of the nominal interest rates iH;t and iF;t , the in‡ation rates                      H;t   and       F;t ,   and
                                                                           n and r n
the output gaps xH;t and xF;t for the case of TH = TF = 15 (that is, both rH;t    F;t

become positive again when t = 16). It is clear that the optimal policy exhibits the kind

of history dependence discussed in the previous subsection. The nominal interest rate in

each country remains set to zero for two more periods (t = 16; 17) after its natural rate

becomes positive. Correspondingly, the in‡ation rate and the output gap in each country

become positive in period 16. As discussed in the previous subsection, such a commitment

alleviates the contractionary e¤ects from negative natural rates r in earlier periods. With

the symmetric realization of the shocks, however, it is di¢ cult to tell the extent to which

the optimal policy shows international dependence. It is more easily seen for cases when

the realizations of the shocks are asymmetric.
                                                                          n
     Figure 4 depicts the case where TH = 15 and TF = 10 (that is, where rH;t      n
                                                                              and rF;t

return to r when t = 16 and t = 11, respectively). Again, the history dependence is

evident: the nominal interest rate in each country remains set to zero for a while even

after its natural rate returns to normal; and in each economy both in‡ation rate and

output gap are positive in the period its natural rate shifts from rn to rn . Furthermore,


                                                         23
the international dependence of the optimal policy can also be clearly seen. For instance,

look at what happens to the foreign country’s nominal interest rate iF;t after the home

country’s natural rate returns to rn (i.e., t = 16; 17). The home country’s output gap

increases temporarily in period 16, as a result of which its expected growth rate from t to

t + 1 is negative for t = 16; 17. Given that our example has        = 2, the negative growth
                                                                            n de…ned in
of the home output gap works as a negative shock on the real interest rate rF;t

equation (25). This is why the foreign nominal interest rate iF;t declines for the periods

t = 16; 17. Analogously, the negative expected growth rate implied by the foreign output

gap in the period when the foreign natural rate returns to rn (t = 11) acts as a negative

shock on the real interest rate rH;t de…ned in equation (24). In that period, however,

the home country is still caught in a liquidity trap and the home nominal interest rate

cannot be lowered further. Instead, the e¤ect of this negative shock on rH;t is mostly seen

in the shape of a decline in the home output gap in period 11. Yet another form of the

international dependence appears in the term Et (xF;t+1     xF;t ) in equation (24) for periods

t              n returns to r n in period 11, the foreign output gap rises at …rst, and then
    TH . When rF;t

declines for a few periods (t = 12; 13 in Figure 3). After this, the foreign output gap starts

to increase gradually (for t = 14; 15; 16 in the …gure). Although quantitatively small, this

behavior of the foreign output gap for t = 14; 15; 16 is enough to yield Et (xF;t+1   xF;t ) > 0

during those periods, which helps to alleviate the severity of the liquidity trap that the

home country is caught in.

    Variation in the Ramsey equilibrium path across di¤erent realizations of the shocks is

illustrated in Figure 5. There, the paths of the nominal interest rates under the optimal

policy are plotted for the cases where TF = 10 but TH varies from 12 to 17. These paths

are interpreted in the same way as in the previous …gure: The optimal policy is seen to be

characterized primarily by international dependence and history dependence.

    The next two …gures demonstrate how the Ramsey equilibrium depends on the prob-

abilities of the natural rates returning to normal, p and q. In Figure 6, we continue to

assume that p = q as in the previous …gures, but allow the value to vary. Speci…cally,

we plot the paths of the nominal interest rates under the optimal policy when TH = 15


                                              24
and TF = 10 and it is assumed that p = q 2 f0:15; 0:2; 0:25; 0:3g. It can be seen that, as

probabilities p and q get smaller, the history dependence e¤ect becomes more marked: that

is, the optimal monetary policy requires commitment to a lower interest rate for longer

periods. The international dependence e¤ect is also magni…ed by a smaller value of p and

q (notice the larger drop in iF;t after t = 16). This is because a larger degree of history

dependence ampli…es the boom in a country when its natural rate returns to normal, and

this in turn increases the impact on the real interest rate in the other country.

    In Figure 7, we consider the case of asymmetric probabilities: p 6= q. We …x q = 0:25

and let p vary from 0.2 to 0.275. To focus on the asymmetry of the probabilities, we look

at the equilibrium path for a symmetric realization of the shocks, TH = TF = 10. The

…gure demonstrates that a lower value of p leads to a larger degree of history dependence

in the home monetary policy and also a larger degree of international dependence from the

perspective of the foreign monetary policy.


5    Simple Monetary-Policy Rules

In this section we examine the extent to which the optimal monetary policy can be approx-

imated by a “simple”interest-rate rule. In the case of a closed economy with no possibility

of falling into a liquidity trap, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) show that the optimal

policy is replicated fairly well by the class of interest-rate rules that respond only to the

in‡ation rate. In the liquidity trap case, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) argue that a

simple price-level targeting policy performs well for the closed economy. Our question is

whether a similarly simple such monetary policy rule can be identi…ed for our model of a

global liquidity trap. For this purpose, we restrict attention to classes of simple interest-

rate rules where nominal interest rates respond to some combination of in‡ation rates, price

levels, output gaps, and nominal exchange rates. We will see that a simple interest-rate

rule that includes both the foreign price level and the output gap in addition to those of

the home country can improve welfare. Among the various rules we consider, this is the

one that best captures the key features of the optimal monetary policy analyzed in the

previous section.

                                              25
       We start with the case where the nominal interest rate in each country is set to respond

only to domestic variables. Speci…cally, consider the following two classes of interest rate

rule: the interest rate rule with in‡ation targets:

                                    ~{H;t =      (     H;t       H;t )   +    x xH;t   + r;
                                                                                                                   (36)
                                     ~{F;t =           F;t       F;t     +    x xF;t   + r;

and the interest rate rule with price-level targets:

                                 ~{H;t =    p   ln PH;t      ln P H;t +          x xH;t   + r;
                                                                                                                   (37)
                                  ~{F;t =   p   ln PF;t      ln P F;t +          x xF;t   + r:

In what follows we assume that the target in‡ation rates in the interest-rate rules (36) are

zero:      H;t   =   F;t   = 0; and that the target price levels in the interest-rate rules (37) are

the date-0 price levels: P H;t = PH;0 and P F;t = PF;0 . Due to the zero bound on nominal

interest rates, the actual rates set by the monetary authorities are

                            iH;t = maxf~{H;t ; 0g;           and             iF;t = maxf~{F;t ; 0g:

                                      n and r n , follow the stochastic process described in
       Given that the natural rates, rH;t    F;t

the previous section, we compare the expected world-welfare loss (21) evaluated in period

1 under alternative policy rules. For the interest-rate rules (36)-(37), we restrict the policy

parameters so that 1:1                          5, 0         x           5, and 1:1              p    5.10 Furthermore,

this parameter space is discretized with a grid size of 0.5, when searching for the optimal

parameter con…guration.

       Table 2 shows the optimal con…guration of parameters for each class of interest-rate

rules and the associated world-welfare losses (21). They are normalized by the world-

welfare loss for the optimal monetary policy. In the table, the label “ITR” denotes the

interest-rate rule with in‡ation targets and “PLTR” denotes the interest-rate rule with

price-level targets.

       The second row of Table 2 shows that the best in‡ation-targeting rule puts a zero

weight on the output gap. This is similar to what Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2007) …nd in

  10
       This restriction acts to guarantee determinacy.


                                                             26
a closed-economy model without a liquidity trap. The fourth row indicates that a price-

level targeting rule ought also to place some weight on the output gap. For comparison, the

…rst and third rows of Table 2 provide the world-welfare losses under some conventional

parameter con…gurations: speci…cally,                    = 1:5 and    x   = 0:5 for the interest-rate rule

with in‡ation targets, and          p   = 1:5 and    x   = 0:5 for the interest-rate rule with price-level

targets.

       In terms of welfare, the interest-rate rule with price-level targets performs far better

than the in‡ation-targeting rule, as is shown in the fourth row of Table 2. The reason is

that the in‡ation-targeting rule does not provide any history dependence, a key element in

mitigating the severity of a liquidity trap. In contrast, with price-level targets, the nominal

interest rate in each country is gradually adjusted to its steady-state level after the natural

rate regains its steady-state value. This enables it to generate history dependence. This

property of the policy with price-level targets is in line with the …ndings of Eggertsson and

Woodford (2003) for the closed economy model with a liquidity trap.

       Now let us look at the case where the home country adopts an interest-rate rule with

in‡ation targets but the foreign country adopts an interest-rate rule with price-level tar-

gets.11 The …fth row of Table 2 shows the substantial deterioration in world welfare in this

case compared to when both countries adopt an interest-rate rule with price-level targets.

The clear implication is that the two monetary authorities should jointly commit to an

interest-rate rule with price-level targets when faced with a global liquidity trap. A single

country’s commitment to a history dependent policy is not enough.

       We next examine if including foreign variables in the domestic policy rule improves

welfare. For this purpose, we augment the interest-rate rule with price-level targets with

foreign variables as follows:

         ~{H;t =    p   ln PH;t   ln P H +    pa    ln PF;t    ln P F +     x xH;t   +   xa xF;t   + r;
                                                                                                          (38)
          ~{F;t =   p   ln PF;t   ln P F +    pa    ln PH;t    ln P H +     x xF;t +     xa xH;t + r;


  11
       This may be viewed as a situation where one country commits to its policy but in the other policy
remains discretionary. For the de…nition of discretionary policy in a liquidity trap, see Jung, Teranishi, and
Watanabe (2005).


                                                         27
where we restrict the policy parameters so that 0                                   xa        5 and 0         pa      5. Following

these rules, a country lowers its policy rate when the other country experiences a downturn,

i.e., a negative output gap and a price level lower than the target level. Thus, these rules

capture international dependence. The sixth row of Table 2 shows how augmenting the

policy rule in this way improves welfare.

       We can interpret the augmented rules (38) in terms of the nominal exchange rate. Note

that it follows from the household’s …rst-order conditions (10) that the nominal exchange

rate Et satis…es
                                                              PH;t nF YH;t
                                                      Et =                 :
                                                              PF;t nH YF;t
De…ne the log deviation of the nominal exchange rate, Etn , as
                                                                        n
                                                                P H nF YH;t
                                                      Etn =             n ;
                                                                P F nH YF;t
and let      t   denote the exchange rate gap, i.e.,                  t    ln Et         ln Etn . It follows that

                            t   = ln PH;t        ln P H          ln PF;t       ln P F + xH;t              xF;t :

Given this, we can rewrite equations (38) as

                  ~{H;t =        p   ex     ln PH;t       ln P H +             pa   +    ex     ln PF;t      ln P F

                                     +(     x       ex ) xH;t   +(    xa   +    ex ) xF;t     +   ex t   + r;

                  ~{F;t =        p   ex         ln PF;t   ln P F +             pa   +    ex     ln PH;t      ln P H

                                     +(     x       ex ) xF;t   +(    xa   +    ex ) xH;t         ex t   + r;

where       ex   is a positive parameter. Thus, the welfare gain from augmenting the rule can be

interpreted as the bene…t of letting the policy rate respond to the nominal exchange rate.

This helps the policy rule to capture the features of desirable policy in a global liquidity

trap, namely, history dependence and international dependence.12

  12
       Here, since both of the two countries are under the liquidity trap, the exchange rate peg to another
country’s currency for escaping from a liquidity trap, so called foolproof way in Svensson (2001), is not
relevant policy. Consequently, two central banks create in‡ation expectation by the commitment to the
zero interest rate. Alternatively, if one country is out of a liquidity trap, then foolproof way could work as
shown in Coenen and Wieland (2003).


                                                                 28
6     Concluding Remarks

In this paper we consider a two-country New Open Economy Macroeconomics model, and

analyze the optimal monetary policy when monetary authorities cooperate in the face of a

global liquidity trap — that is, a situation where both countries are caught simultaneously

in liquidity traps. Compared to the closed economy case, the most notable feature of the

optimal policy in the global liquidity trap is its international dependence. Whether or not

a country’s nominal interest rate is hitting the zero bound a¤ects the target in‡ation rate

in the other country. The direction of the e¤ect depends on whether goods produced in the

two countries are Edgeworth complements or substitutes. We also compare several classes

of simple interest-rate rules. Our …nding is that targeting the price level yields higher

welfare than targeting the in‡ation rate, and that it is desirable to let the policy rate of

each country respond not only to its own price level and output gap, but also to those in

the other country.

     The model considered in this paper is of course very stylized, and the robustness of

our …ndings needs to be tested under alternative assumptions. For instance, our current

analysis is restricted to the case where the monetary authorities in the two countries coor-

dinate their monetary policy choices with each other so as to maximize world welfare. An

alternative assumption would be that the monetary authorities set their respective policies

in a non-cooperative way. Another extension of potential interest would be to consider how

the results would be a¤ected if we adopted local currency pricing, rather than producer

currency pricing as at present. In addition, while the current paper focuses on the interest

rate policy, incorporating other possible policy measures, such as quantitative easing and

credit easing, is also important. These extensions are left for future research.

A       Welfare approximation

Here we follow Woodford (2003) and Benigno and Woodford (2005) to derive an approxi-

mate world welfare criterion. We assume that the monetary authorities in the two countries

cooperate to maximize aggregate utility.

    Given that preferences of the home and foreign household are given by equations (1)

and (4), respectively, the level of average expected utility between the two countries is

given by
                            1
                            X                                      Z                                          Z
                                     t
    nH U0 + nF U0 = E0                    u(YH;t ; YF;t )                      v yt (i);         t   di                 v yt (i);    t    di :
                            t=0                                      NH                                            NF

The cost minimization of the home household leads to the following derived demands:
                                                                       1
                                                         Pj;t
                                Cj;t = nH Ct                               ;         j = H; F;
                                                         Pt
                                               1          pt (i)
                                ct (i) =          Cj;t                         ;        j = H; F:
                                               nj         Pj;t

The derived demands of the foreign household are similarly given. Using these conditions,

we obtain

where      H   and   F   are the measures of price dispersion de…ned by
                                            Z               (1+!)

Then the world welfare measure is given by

   Now, …x a non-stochastic steady state with zero in‡ation. In what follows, a bar over

a variable denotes its steady state value, and a hat indicates the log-deviation from the

steady-state value. Following Benigno and Woodford (2005), we take a second-order ap-
                                                                                                       1=2      1=2

   For simplicity, we follow Woodford (2003) and assume that                                 and         are small to

delete the linear terms in equation (40), nH Y^H;t + nF                         Y^F;t . Let Yje , j = H; F , denote

Then, let xej      ln Yje     ln Yj ;, j = H; F , denote the e¢ cient levels of the output gaps, where

B      Numerical Algorithm for Stochastic Simulation

Suppose that the natural rates of the two countries follows the stochastic process as de-

scribed in the main text, and consider the Ramsey problem in period                                                           = 1 of mini-

mizing the world welfare function (21) subject to the constraints (15), (16), (26), (27),

(28), and (29). Let             t        (    H;t ;   F;t )   be the multipliers for constraints (15) and (16), and

 t     (   H;t ;   F;t )   be the multiplier associated with constraints (26), (27), (28), and (29).

Then the Lagrangian for the Ramsey problem can be formed as:

       Remember that (TH ; TF ) 2 f1; : : : ; Sg2 are the stopping times describing the last peri-

       In principle, it is possible to have other phases, for instance, the one where rH < 0 and iH > 0. With
our parameter con…guration, however, we have con…rmed in our numerical solution that these nine phases
are the only possible ones that occur in the Ramsey equilibrium.


                                                                      44

of periods in which phases (2,2), (2,3), and (3,2) occur given realized values of TH and

TF , respectively. Here, k1;2 (TF ), k2;1 (TH ), k2;2 (TH ; TF ), k2;3 (TH ; TF ), and k3;2 (TH ; TF )

are all non-negative integers. Our numerical algorithm is to …nd a collection of functions

    Figure A1 displays the time paths of nominal interest rates iH;t and iF;t , in‡ation rates

 H;t   and   F;t ,   and output gaps xH;t and xF;t in the two countries from the top when adverse

shocks in the two countries last until TH = TF = 10. Figure A2 displays the time paths

of nominal interest rates, in‡ation rates, and output gaps in the two countries when a

shock to natural rate of interest lasts longer in the domestic than in the foreign country at

TH = 15 and TF = 10. We can see that the case with deterministic shocks are similar to

the case with stochastic shocks.
