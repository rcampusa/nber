                                         ABSTRACT

The 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) is the most
important reform of personal bankruptcy in the United States in recent years. This legislation
overhauled eligibility requirements and increased monetary costs of filing for bankruptcy. Using
administrative credit file data from a nationally representative panel, we quantify the effects of
the reform on bankruptcy, insolvency, and foreclosure, we explore the mechanism generating
these responses and examine the consequences for households. We find that the reform caused a
50% permanent drop in Chapter 7 filings, a 25%permanent rise in insolvency, but had no effect
on Chapter 13 filings. Exploiting the cross-district variation in filing costs resulting from the
reform, we show that these responses are driven by liquidity constraints associated with the
higher monetary cost of filing for bankruptcy. We show that insolvency is associated with worse
outcomes than bankruptcy, in terms of access to credit and credit scores, suggesting that
BAPCPA may have removed an important form of relief for financially distressed borrowers.

1       Introduction
Personal bankruptcy is a form of social insurance offering relief to individuals who are un-
able to repay previously contracted debt.1 As most forms of social insurance, the debt
discharge offered under bankruptcy may generate moral hazard, raising important positive
and normative questions on the effects of personal bankruptcy on household indebtedness
and delinquency behavior, as well as on the optimal design of the institution of personal
bankruptcy.
    This paper seeks to contribute to our understanding of personal bankruptcy by examin-
ing the response to the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act
(BAPCPA), the most comprehensive reform of personal bankruptcy regulation since the
Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. The 2005 reform overhauled filing requirements and sub-
stantially increased the monetary cost of filing for bankruptcy. We treat it as a natural
experiment to assess the impact of changes in eligibility requirements and monetary filing
costs on bankruptcy and related outcomes. Such assessment provides valuable insights into
the trade-off between the social insurance provided by personal bankruptcy and the moral
hazard associated with any such insurance. Importantly, we are the first to study responses
to the reform other than bankruptcy filings, which allows us to quantify the patterns of sub-
stitution of individuals between outcomes such as bankruptcy filing, insolvency, foreclosure
or resolution of insolvency.
    We find that the reform caused a 50% permanent drop in Chapter 7 filings, a 25%
permanent rise in insolvency, but had no effect on Chapter 13 filings. Exploiting the cross-
district variation in filing costs, we show that these responses are consistent with liquidity
constraints associated with the higher monetary cost of filing for bankruptcy excluding lower
income households from filing. We show that the decline in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings is
primarily associated with a rise in insolvency, and that insolvency is associated with worse
outcomes than bankruptcy, in terms of access to credit and credit scores, suggesting that
BAPCPA may have removed an important form of relief for financially distressed borrowers.
    BAPCPA’s main provisions were to introduce an income test requiring Chapter 7 filers
to have income below their state’s median, effectively removing the possibility of choosing
the filing chapter. It mandated a fixed 5 year repayment plan for most Chapter 13 filers and
increased refiling restrictions for both chapters. The new law also increased the monetary
cost of filing in a variety of ways. It raised court filing fees and mandated that filers at-
    1
     Some of the common circumstances leading to bankruptcy include loss of income due to unemployment or
illness, medical bills, divorce, unplanned children. See Chakravarty and Rhee (1999) and Livshits, MacGee,
and Tertilt (2007) for more detail.


                                                    1
tend compulsory credit counseling classes at their own expense. It also increased reporting
requirements in bankruptcy petitions and made bankruptcy attorneys personally liable for
inaccuracies in information reported to the court in the bankruptcy petition. These changes
led to a sizable rise in attorney fees for bankruptcy cases. The mean rise in attorney fees was
35% for Chapter 7 filers, from a mean value of $697 dollars pre-reform to $975 post-reform.
For Chapter 13 filers, the mean rise in attorney fees was 29%, from a mean value of $1,910
pre-reform to $2,531 post reform.2 Previous evidence suggests that liquidity constraints play
a sizable role in the decision to file for bankruptcy. For example, borrowers tend to file on
paydays (Mann and Porter (2009)) and when they receive tax rebates checks (Gross, No-
towidigdo, and Wang (2012)). Additionally, borrowers who file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
pre-reform were documented to have extremely low incomes (Sullivan, Warren, and West-
brook (1994), Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook (2006)), so that the magnitude of the rise
in filings costs associated with the reform would be a significant impediment to filing for
bankruptcy.
     Our analysis is based on anonymous administrative credit report data from a nationally
representative panel of U.S. individuals from 1999 to 2013, provided by the Federal Re-
serve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax. These data allow us to observe
bankruptcy filings by chapter and the changing characteristics of who file for bankruptcy, as
well as the behavior of financially distressed individuals who post-2005 decide not to file. A
large literature following BAPCPA’s introduction studies its effects on the bankruptcy filing
rate and on the characteristics of those who file for bankruptcy, based mainly on surveys of
filers or bankruptcy courts records.3 Our analysis is the first to shed light the individuals
who no longer file for bankruptcy post-reform, and in particular their foreclosure and insol-
vency behavior, as well as their access to credit and credit score, in comparison to those who
do file. We provide four sets of results.
     First, we show that, controlling for a comprehensive set of court district level economic
and regulatory variables, BAPCPA is associated with a large drop in Chapter 7 bankruptcy
filings (50 log points), no change in Chapter 13 filings, and a rise in the fraction of individuals
who are insolvent, who are 120 plus days delinquent but do not file for bankruptcy (25 log
points). We also show that the response to the rise in attorney fees associated with the
reform is stronger for individuals with income below their state’s median, confirming the
   2
    See Jones (2008), Lupica (2012), White (2007).
   3
    In a leading study, Lawless et al. (2008) use the 2007 Consumer Bankruptcy Project to document the
changes in the characteristics of bankrupts when compared with data from similar studies in 1981, 1991 and
2001. They find that the the 2005 reform did not change the income composition of bankrupts but increased
their in-bankruptcy debt and the length of time before filing.


                                                    2
hypothesis that the rise in filing costs, not the income test for Chapter 7 eligibility, was the
main mechanism through which reform affected bankruptcy behavior.
    Second, we examine how the district level decline in Chapter 7 filing rates is related to
Chapter 13 filings, foreclosures, insolvency and resolution of insolvency. We find a strong
substitution from Chapter 7 filing to insolvency, but no impact on the rate at which insolvent
borrowers become current. The effect of the median estimated drop in flows into Chapter 7
bankruptcy can account for a 27.5% increase in flows to foreclosure (out of and estimated
33%) and a 2.65% increase in the persistence of insolvency (out of an estimated 3.5%). This
indicates that individuals who are not filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection remain
insolvent. We find essentially no impact of substitution from Chapter 13 filing to insolvency
and foreclosure, and no substitution from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, which suggests that
the reform was not effective in channeling individuals from Chapter 7 to 13. Thus, the
individuals who no longer file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy post-reform experience a form of
persistent and severe financial distress.
    Third, we exploit the geographical variation in attorney fees, which account for about
75% of the total cost of filing for bankruptcy (see Lupica (2012)), pre- and post-reform to
quantify the role of the monetary filing cost on bankruptcy filings.4 We find that larger
changes in attorney fees are strongly negatively related to Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings,
but not to Chapter 13 filings. Our estimates imply that moving from the 25th to the 75th
percentile of the fee distribution increases the drop in the flows from a new insolvency to a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy by 18 log points. A crucial difference between Chapter 7 and Chapter
13 attorney fees is that fees for Chapter 7 have to be paid up-front, while fees for Chapter 13
can be paid in installments during the bankruptcy discharge period. Since the fees for both
chapters increased by similar magnitudes post-reform, this suggests that the up-front nature
of the filing cost for Chapter 7 bankruptcy plays a crucial role in discouraging potential filers,
supporting the interpretation that these individuals are liquidity constrained.5
    Finally, since our analysis indicates a shift from Chapter 7 bankruptcy to persistent in-
solvency after BAPCPA, it is important to determine whether this change is consequential.
To this end, we examine access to credit and credit scores for financially distressed individ-
uals, distinguishing between whether they file for bankruptcy or not. We consider cohorts
   4
      Even though the 2005 reform is a federal law, both the initial level of the fees and the change associated
with the reform exhibit sizable variation across U.S. bankruptcy court districts. We show that this variation
is unrelated to district level behavior, and exploit it using a difference-in-difference specification in order to
quantify the effects of the fee changes.
    5
      It would be difficult for filers to borrow to finance Chapter 7 filing costs, since debts is contracted close
enough to filing date are considered fraudulent, due to lack of intent to repay, and cannot be discharged.



                                                        3
of newly insolvent individuals, comparing those who file for Chapter 7 and or Chapter 13
bankruptcy in the 8 quarters after the new insolvency and those who don’t. We then examine
the behavior of several financial indicators for a 2 year window around that new insolvency.
Individuals who file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy open new unsecured lines of credit and auto
loans at a higher rate after filing than individuals who don’t file, or file for Chapter 13
bankruptcy.6 For mortgage originations both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filers display an
advantage relative to non-filers, with the gap growing post-reform. Since, as we show, the
number of inquiries is very similar across the two groups, these findings indicate a difference
in access to credit for these two groups, rather than demand for credit. This pattern is also
reflected in the behavior of credit scores. Within the same cohort of newly insolvent individ-
uals, we find that those who will eventually go bankrupt initially have lower credit scores,
suggesting that they are negatively selected. However, these individuals experience a sharp
boost in their credit score after they file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, whereas credit scores
recover at a much slower pace for individuals who remain insolvent or file for Chapter 13
bankruptcy. We conclude that, while both insolvency and bankruptcy are forms of default,
the debt discharge associated with Chapter 7 bankruptcy outweighs the potentially negative
signal associated with a bankruptcy flag and leaves filers with better access to credit than
individuals who become insolvent in similar circumstances.
    Our analysis has wide-ranging implications for the design of policies regulating consumer
credit and bankruptcy, as well as for theoretical modeling of consumer default. Our results
suggests that BAPCPA may have contributed to increasing the size of a class of financially
distressed borrowers who are not able to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy or to cure their
insolvencies. We attribute this effect to liquidity constraints associated with the cost of filing
for bankruptcy, which were made more severe by BAPCPA following the rise in filings costs.
This is consistent with prior work on the role of liquidity constraints in bankruptcy filing
decisions, such as Mann and Porter (2009) and Gross, Notowidigdo, and Wang (2012), and
more generally with evidence on binding liquidity constraints.7 Our findings suggest that any
policies affecting the monetary cost of filing for bankruptcy will impact disproportionately
low income liquidity constrained borrowers, who could benefit most from the relief offered
by bankruptcy.
    Viewing bankruptcy in the broader sphere of social insurance programs, our results sug-
gest that the personal bankruptcy procedure in its current form would benefit from reform.

     The fraction of Chapter 7 with new unsecured debt originations in approximately 25% higher than the
fraction for Chapter 13 filers and non filers. The difference for auto loans is about 100%.

If we interpret the monetary costs associated with bankruptcy filing from a costly state ver-
ification perspective– as in Townsend (1979) and related literature– it is natural to assume
that these costs should be borne by the filer to provide incentives. However, this framework
does not allow for binding liquidity constraints on the filer and is thus inadequate, as cur-
rently formulated, to provide realistic policy prescriptions.8 Moreover, for other programs
in which verification of the state is required, such as disability insurance, the applicant does
not incur in any direct monetary expenses to determine eligibility.
    Standard models of household default with idiosyncratic risk in income or expenditure
assume that bankruptcy prevents future access to credit, do not incorporate liquidity con-
straints associated with bankruptcy filing, and do not allow for a delinquent state, in which
no debt relief is possible and access to credit is severely curtailed. (See for example Chat-
terjee et al. (2007), Livshits, MacGee, and Tertilt (2007) and Mitman (2016).) Our analysis
suggests that incorporating monetary costs of bankruptcy, liquidity constraints, informal de-
fault without debt relief, and endogenous credit access after bankruptcy, would significantly
affect the quantitative predictions of these models for debt and delinquency behavior, and
allow them to offer a more accurate assessment of the welfare implications of incomplete
insurance.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a short overview of
the bankruptcy law in the U.S., including the changes implied by the 2005 reform. Section
3 reports our estimates of transition probabilities into various delinquency states. Section
4 describes our cross-district regression analysis. Section 5 examines the implications for
access to credit and scores of the inability to file for bankruptcy. Section 6 concludes.


2       The 2005 Bankruptcy Reform
In the United States, households in financial distress can resolve their insolvency by filing for
bankruptcy protection, which grants them immediate relief from collection efforts, including
direct communication, lawsuits and wage garnishment orders. Most unsecured debt is dis-
chargeable, excluding taxes, alimony and child support obligations, student loans and debt
obtained by fraud. There are two main bankruptcy filing chapters: 7 and 13.
    Chapter 7, often called ‘straight bankruptcy’ or ‘fresh start,’ is the most commonly used
bankruptcy procedure - up to 2005 a remarkably stable 70% of bankruptcies were filed under
    8
     Grochulski (2010) presents a private information environment in which bankruptcy with an income test
is used to implement the constrained efficient allocation. There is no fee for bankruptcy filing and liquidity
constraints are not considered.



                                                      5
Chapter 7. Under this chapter, all of filers’ assets above certain exemption levels are used to
satisfy unsecured creditors.9 The remaining debt is discharged, and debtors are not required
to use future income for debt repayment, but they carry a bankruptcy flag on their credit
report for 10 years after filing. Pre-2005, Chapter 7 bankrupts were not allowed to re-file
another Chapter 7 case for 6 years.
    Under Chapter 13, filers keep all of their assets, but must use their future income to repay
part of their unsecured debt.10 Before the 2005 reform, filers could choose whether to file
under Chapter 7 or 13 (see White (2007)), and for Chapter 13, they would propose their own
repayment plans lasting 3-5 years, with the restriction that the total proposed repayment
could not be lower than the value of their non-exempt assets under Chapter 7. A Chapter
13 bankruptcy is considered discharged after the debt repayment plan has been completed,
and Chapter 13 bankruptcy flag stays on the credit record for 7 years after discharge. Prior
to BAPCA, there were no limits to re-filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
    Since the introduction of the current bankruptcy law in 1978, both unsecured debt levels
and bankruptcy rates have been rapidly rising over time. This trend gave rise to numerous
studies on the sources of the rise,11 and generated an active policy discussion on the efficiency
of theexisting law. That discussion resulted in the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA). BAPCPA was signed by president George W. Bush
on April 20, 2005 and applied to bankruptcy cases filed on or after October 17, 2005. It
introduced several major changes to bankruptcy regulation which increased the burden,
financial and otherwise, of filing for bankruptcy protection.
    Among the most notable new provisions, BAPCPA introduced an income test to deter-
mine eligibility for filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Specifically, to be eligible to file for
Chapter 7, an individual’s income must be below the state median adjusted for family size.
Individuals who fail the income test can still file if (i) their monthly income net of allow-
able expenses calculated according to IRS rules is less than $166.67 per month or (ii) their
net monthly income multiplied by 60 is less than 25 percent of their unsecured debt. As
an exception to that rule, individuals with business income can always file for Chapter 7.
BAPCPA imposed some restrictions on the homestead exemption. First, a petitioner who
   9
     Asset exemptions are determined at the state level. Exempt assets may include clothing, furniture, ‘tools
of trade’, a vehicle up to some value. Additionally, most states have homestead exemptions, which protect
equity in the house up to a state-level specified limit.
  10
     More debts are dischargeable under Chapter 13 than Chapter 7, including some car loans and debts
incurred by fraud or cash advances shortly before filing (the so called ‘super discharge’).

and Tertilt (2010).

moves to a new state within two years from filing must use the exemption level of the original
state. Second, if a home is purchased within 1,215 days of filing, the homestead exemption
is capped at $125,000. Finally, any additional equity converted from a non-exempt asset
within 1,215 prior to filing is not exempt. Under BAPCPA, Chapter 13 filers lost the ability
to propose their own repayment plans. Payment plans now last 5 years and are based on
a notion of disposable income, that is income net of necessary expenses, which depend on
family size and possibly work related expenses (see White (2007)). The reform also increased
the refiling limits from 6 to 8 years for for Chapter 7 and from 0 to 2 years for Chapter 13.
    BAPCPA also significantly increased the documentation burden for both chapters. Filers
must submit detailed financial information with their petition, to prove their inability to
pay and document good faith attempts at paying back. Bankruptcy lawyers must certify the
accuracy of the information, and are held liable for the accuracy of claims. In addition, the
new law requires debtors to enroll in a credit counseling class before they file and a financial
management course before their debts are discharged.
    The sum of these provisions resulted in a significant rise in the cost of filing for bankruptcy.
The total out-of-pocket cost of filing for bankruptcy increased from pre-reform means of
$600 for Chapter 7 and $1600 for Chapter 13 to post-reform means of $2,500 and $3,500,
respectively.12 In our study, we focus on attorney fees and their increase associated with
the reform. Attorney fees comprise 75% of the total monetary cost of filing for Chapter 7
bankruptcy and 90% of the cost of filing for Chapter 13 (Lupica (2012)), and rose on average
by 35% and 29%, respectively, after the reform.


3        The Effects of BAPCA over Time
We use the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax Data,
which is an anonymous longitudinal panel of individuals, comprising a 5% random sample
of all individuals who have a credit report with Equifax. The data is quarterly, starting in
1999:Q1 and ending in 2013:Q3 and is described in detail in Lee and van der Klaauw (2010).
In our analysis, we use a 1% sample, which includes information for approximately 2.5 million
individuals in each quarter. The data contains over 600 variables, including bankruptcy and
foreclosure, mortgage status, detailed delinquencies, various types of debt, with number of
accounts and balances. Apart from the financial information, the data contains individual
descriptors such as age, ZIP code and credit score. The variables included in our analysis
  12
       See White (2007), also consistent with findings in Lupica (2012).

    The goal of our analysis is to shed light on the mechanism leading to the aggregate
response to BAPCPA and the resulting implications for household balance sheets and access
to credit. Figure 1 presents the aggregate filing rate from bankruptcy court data. The filing
rate for both chapters dropped following the reform, and the drop was larger and more
persistent for Chapter 7. In this section, we aim to isolate the effects of the reform on
bankruptcy filing rates, and other related outcomes such as delinquencies and foreclosures.

    To examine the path to bankruptcy filing, we estimate the probability of transition from
a new delinquency or new insolvency to a mutually exclusive set of states. We call an
account delinquent if it is 30, 60 or 90 days late and insolvent if it 120 days or more late,
derogatory or in charge-off. A delinquency is new if it occurs after a least 8 prior quarters of
no delinquencies, insolvencies, bankruptcies or foreclosures. An insolvency is new if it occurs
after at least 8 quarters of no insolvencies, bankruptcies or foreclosures. New or outstanding
delinquencies may appear in the last 8 quarters before a new insolvency. New delinquencies
and new insolvencies are designed to capture the onset of a new spell of financial distress.
We are interested in the resolution of spells of financial distress as these could be caused by
events unforeseen at the time debt was contracted, such as job loss, disability, divorce and so
  13
    We also supplement our analysis with similar data from the Experian credit bureau. These data corre-
sponds to a representative panel of 1 million borrowers for the time period 2004Q1 to 2012Q4.

                                                              8
on. The debt relief offered by bankruptcy is supposed to offer insurance against such events,
rather than deal with chronic insolvency. And indeed, approximately 37% of new Chapter 7
and 13 filers experience a new delinquency, and 55% display new insolvency in the 2 quarters
preceding the filing. Considering borrowers who do not experience adverse credit events for
two prior years is a way to identify spells of financial distress in the absence of information
on changes in income or unanticipated changes in expenditures. By contrast, the stock of
borrowers who is delinquent or insolvent may include a sizable fraction who are persistently
in that state, because of poor financial planning skills, or other behaviors.14
     Figure 2 displays the quarterly transition rates into a new delinquency and a new in-
solvency for the sample population. Approximately, 0.8% of the population becomes newly
delinquent in each quarter in our sample, and approximately 0.6% of the overall population
becomes newly insolvent in each quarter. Most importantly, these fractions are stable over
time but for mild business cycle fluctuations and do not exhibit substantial changes after
BAPCPA was enacted and implemented. This behavior suggests that selection into insol-
vency and delinquency has not changed systematically in response to the reform. In the
Online Appendix, we report estimates of the changes in new delinquency rates in various
periods around the reform using individual level data, and confirm that indeed selection into
new spells of financial distress did not significantly change in response to BAPCPA.
     Newly delinquent and newly insolvent individuals can transition to the following set
of outcomes: Current, if there are no delinquencies or any insolvencies their record for that
quarter, with no bankruptcy or foreclosure flags; Delinquent or Insolvent, as defined above,15
or Bankrupt, if they display a bankruptcy flag, which is activated by a new bankruptcy
filing, where we distinguish between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. An individual can also be
in Foreclosure if she displays a foreclosure flag.16
     We estimate the 1 and 4 quarter ahead transition probabilities from a new delinquency
and new insolvency to any of the outcome states for each quarter in the sample. We also
control for available district level economic indicators, which are the unemployment rate,
personal disposable income and an index of house prices. The regression specification is as
follows:
  14
     Based on Experian Data for 2004-2011, 44.96% of all borrowers ever experience a 90 day or more past
due delinquency.
  15
     Student debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, and is excluded from the analysis.
  16
     The foreclosure flag is activated by a new foreclosure record on the borrower’s credit file, and lasts for
7 years from its first appearance.

where yit is the transition of interest in district i at quarter t, rescaled by its pre-reform
mean, βs(t) capture time effects, relative to base period 0, Is(t) is an indicator for period
s (year or quarter), γi denote district effects, and Xit denotes the district level economic
indicators in logs, as well as the 4 quarter change in these variables. The estimated βs(t)
coefficients capture the timing and magnitude of any response to the reform. They are also
able to detect the presence of any pre-existing trends in the transitions of interest. The first
year in the sample is 2002, and the corresponding value of βs(0) is set to zero, so that all
other estimates can be interpreted as changes from the 2002 value. We report the estimates
of the time effects for the yearly specification below, starting from the transitions from a
new insolvency.
    Figure 3 reports estimates of the 1 quarter ahead time effects for the transitions from
a new insolvency. Several interesting patterns emerge. First, the transition into Chapter 7
bankruptcy, displayed in panel (a), shows a sizable and permanent drop. The magnitude
of the drop is approximately equal to 50% relative to the pre-reform period for 2006-2009,


                                                             10
and rises to 100% for 2010-2012. In 2004 and 2005, an anticipation effect is clearly visible,
as transitions into Chapter 7 filings rise by about 10%. Second, the transition from a
new insolvency to Chapter 13 filing or to Current, displayed in panels panels (b) and (d)
respectively, do not seem to be affected by the reform. By contrast, the transition from a
new insolvency to insolvency without foreclosure, which captures changes in the persistence
of insolvency, rises by approximately 10% after 2005, though most of the rise occurs from
2009 onwards, as can be seen in panel (c).

    The patterns of transition from a new delinquency are very similar to those for a new
insolvency. Figure 4 displays the estimated time effects for the 1 period ahead transition
from a new delinquency to a new insolvency. This transition starts rising in 2005. It is 20%
higher than pre-reform levels in 2006 and reaches a peak of 50% higher to the pre-reform
level in 2009, when it stabilizes. This pattern is consistent with the notion that after the

                                                                                       11
implementation of BAPCPA financially distressed borrowers are more likely to experience
a transition to a more severe form of distress, which may in part due to the reduction in
Chapter 7 filing rates.

     To determine the exact timing of the response to BAPCPA, figure 5 reports the estimated
quarterly βs(t) s in a 4 year window centered around the quarter in which the reform was
enacted. The drop in Chapter 7 filing transitions occurs exactly in the quarter of which the
reform was implemented, which suggests that the change in Chapter 7 transition rates were
indeed associated with the reform.
     Figure 6 displays the estimates for the transition from a new insolvency to foreclosure.
This transition exhibits an upward trend throughout the sample period, and does not show
a detectable response to the 2005 bankruptcy reform. Filing for Chapter 13 stays foreclosure
proceedings, however, there seems to be no relation between the time path of transition into
foreclosure and the time path of transition into Chapter 13 filing.
     The fact that the transition into Chapter 13 bankruptcy does not significantly respond to
the reform is consistent with evidence that the ratio of Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 bankruptcies
has risen post reform (see Han and Li (2011) and Zhu (2011)), and suggests that the effect
on this ratio is driven by the response of Chapter 7 filings, not by a response of Chapter 13
filings. In Section 4.1, we show that there is no evidence of substitution between Chapter and
Chapter 13 filing. Moreover, in Section 4, we show that there is no link between the change
in Chapter 13 attorney fees and the decline in Chapter 13 filings across districts. Because

a major difference between these two fees is that Chapter 7 fees have to be paid up-front
and Chapter 13 fees can be paid in installments, we take this as evidence supporting our
hypothesis that the reduction of bankruptcy filings following BAPCPA was due to liquidity
constraints.


3.1    Effects by credit score
In this section, we provide further evidence of the effects of the reform by focusing on subsets
of individuals according to their credit score 1 year prior to the observed new insolvency.
We then allocate individuals to credit score quartiles and estimate the time effects in (1)
for each sub-population. The results are presented in figure 7. The effects of the reform are

                                                                13
exclusively driven by the response of individuals at the bottom of the credit score distribution
1 year prior to new insolvency (panels (a) and (b)), with no effects for the top credit scores
(panels (c) and (d)). In fact, the second quartile exhibits the most dramatic drop in flows
to Chapter 7, with the initial drop exceeding 50% and getting bigger over time.

Panel/Equifax Data.

    The variation in the response to the reform by recent credit score are important because
the credit score is strongly positively related to income. We illustrate this connection using
supplementary income data, merged with the Equifax panel, for 11 thousand individuals
for the year 2009. For these borrowers, we observe their payroll income in 2009 and their
credit record for their entire sample period. The sample for which income data is available
is nationally representative. In Appendix B, we show that the income distribution in this
payroll data set is very similar to CPS data on labor income by age.17 To quantify the
relation between credit score and income, we regress the Equifax Risk Score on income and
age, their interaction and state fixed effects. More details on the specification are described
  17
    We also compare the income distribution by state in our sample to data in the American Community
Survey and find that the distributions match quite closely.


                                                                             14
in Appendix B. The estimation results are summarized graphically in figure 10. There is
a positive relation between credit score and income at all ages, but the relation is steeper
for younger borrowers. For 25 year olds, an increase in income from $35,000 to $50,000
is associated with an increase in the credit score from 640 to 659. For a 40 year old, and
increase in income from $50,000 to $75,000 is associated with an increase in the credit score
from 674 to 702.
     The positive relation between income and credit score implies that most of the individuals
at the bottom half of the credit score distribution will most likely have also incomes below
the sample median. Since these borrowers are likely to pass the income test for Chapter 7
filing introduced by BAPCPA, the reduction in Chapter 7 filings for borrowers with credit
scores below the median displayed in figure 7 is driven by a different mechanism. In the next
section we explore the role of liquidity constraints associated with the rising monetary costs
of filing as a potential factor.


4    Mechanism Behind the Response
The introduction of BAPCPA and the resulting increase in the documentation requirements
and filing fees, together with the debtor education expenses, gave rise to a significant in-
crease in the monetary filing costs for households. It also increased the costs for attorneys
representing bankruptcy petitioners, which raised attorney fees. Attorney fees comprise ap-
proximately 75% of total direct access costs for Chapter 7 and 90% for Chapter 13 both pre-
and post-reform and are the biggest component of filing costs. Based on a comprehensive
study of filing fees, Lupica (2012) reports an average increase in attorney fees of 35% for
Chapter 7 filers and of 29% for Chapter 13 filers. Behind these average increases, there is
significant district level variation. For example, for Chapter 7 filers, the 90th percentile of
the cost change is 61% while the 10th percentile is 17%. In this section, we take attorney fees
as a proxy for bankruptcy costs and exploit their variation across court districts in order to
provide further evidence of the effects of BAPCPA on bankruptcy decisions, and specifically
on the role of liquidity constraints in shaping the response to the reform.
    For Chapter 7, we use attorney fees for no asset cases, which account for approximately
90% of all filings (see Lupica (2012)). Table 1 presents descriptive statistics on the distri-
bution of Chapter 7 attorney fess and their change after BAPCPA. These costs exhibit a
large cross-district variation both prior and after the bankruptcy reform. The pre-reform
range for Chapter 7 attorney fees was $356 (Tennessee Middle) to $1920 (Florida Southern),
while the post-reform range was $543 (Illinois Central) to $1530 (Arizona). As argued in

                                              15
Lupica (2012), even controlling for state characteristics and filers’ characteristics, BAPCPA
had a significant effect on attorney fees changes across districts. The cross-district average
Chapter 7 attorney fee pre-reform was $697 and went up to $975 post-reform.
   A similar pattern of cost increases can be seen for Chapter 13 filings, which are reported
in Table 2. Since Chapter 13 cases are more complicated and usually involve working with
the filer for several years to oversee the repayment plan process, the level of the costs is much
higher than for Chapter 7. The percentage increase in Chapter 13 fees post-BAPCPA is 29%
on average, with a wide cross-district dispersion, as for Chapter 7. The correlation between
the change in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 attorney fees associated with the reform is only
0.046, which suggests that the geographical dispersion of these changes differs substantially
across the two chapters.

    A rise in filing fees would be expected to decrease the incentive to file for bankruptcy
for both chapters, especially since the benefits of filing have been reduced by the reform,

                                                16
by stricter homestead exemption requirements for Chapter 7 and by less flexibility in the
design of the payment plan for Chapter 13, among other factors. One important difference
between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 attorney fees is that Chapter 7 fees have to be paid
up-front, while Chapter 13 fees can be paid in installments over the course of the payment
plan approved by the bankruptcy court. Therefore, the rise in Chapter 7 attorney fees could
potentially prevent filing for borrowers who do not have sufficient cash on hand, even with
a favorable cost-benefit analysis. For Chapter 13, the only criterion that would affect filing
decisions post-reform is the change in costs and benefits of filing.
    To quantify the effects of the change in attorney fees of filing behavior, we adopt a two
step procedure. In the first step, we estimate the district-level effect of the reform, based on
the following specification:

                               yit = Di + Di × Itpost + φXit + t ,                           (2)

where y is the log of an outcome of interest, i denotes court districts and Itpost is an indicator
variable for the post-reform period, that is t ≥ 2005Q4. District level fixed effects correspond
to Di and Xit contains district level time varying economic controls, as in specification (1).
The estimated value for the interaction between the district fixed effect and the post-reform
indicator ∆i = Di × I post corresponds to the average post-reform log change in outcome y
for district i.
    We then relate the estimated ∆i s to the post-reform change in attorney fees, with the
following regression specification:

                               ∆i = α0 + α1 log (cpost
                                                  i    /cpre
                                                         i ) + µi ,                           (3)

where ci is the average attorney fee in district i. Table 3 reports the estimated coefficient
α1 , for transitions from new insolvency to Chapter 7 and 13, at 1 quarter and 4 quarter
horizon. The estimates for Chapter 7 indicate a strong negative relationship between the
change in fees and the change in mean Chapter 7 flows from insolvency across districts. The
estimated coefficient at the 1 quarter horizon implies that the mean change in Chapter 7 fees
is associated with a reduction of Chapter 7 flows from a new insolvency of 15.6% relative
to pre-reform mean. This amounts to 30% of the estimated mean drop in Chapter 7 flows,
which is 54%, and 67% of the standard deviation of the change in flows to Chapter 7, which
is 24%. A similar patter is estimated for the 4 quarter ahead horizon.
    The corresponding estimates for Chapter 13 suggests that there is no relation between


                                               17
the rise in attorney fees and the change in the flows from new insolvency to Chapter 13 filing
associated with the reform. Since the fees for Chapter 13 increased by similar magnitudes
to fees for Chapter 7, this suggests that liquidity constraints driven by the upfront nature
of Chapter 7 attorney fees may explain the difference in response. This pattern is also
consistent with the reduction of the flows from a new insolvency to Chapter 7 filing being
concentrated in the bottom half of the credit score distribution, as shown in Section 3.1.

    For robustness, we also conduct the analysis of the conditional transitions with an ex-
panded set of district level time varying economic and demographic controls. In addition to
IRS personal income, Corelogic house price index, and the unemployment rate used in the
main analysis, we also include the following variables as controls: share white, share black,
share with less than 9th grade, share 9th-12th grade, share high school graduates, share some
college, share associate’s degree, share bachelors degree, and the share of urban population,
obtained from the Census. We find that the results are broadly consistent with our main
analysis and we omit them for brevity.

Results by credit score Based on our findings on the variation in the aggregate decline
in Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings by credit score, we revisit this relation at the district level.
To do so, we repeat the two step estimation procedure for quantifying the effects of the
change in attorney fees on the change in the transitions from new insolvency to Chapter 7
filings for subpopulations based on 4 quarter lagged credit scores. The resulting estimates
are reported in Table 4. The estimates confirm that most of the effects on the reform via
the change in attorney fees are concentrated at the bottom of the credit score distribution.
An increase in attorney fees of 1 log points reduces the 1 quarter ahead transition from a

                                                 18
new insolvency to Chapter 7 filing by 0.33 log points for borrowers in the first quartile of
the credit score distribution, and by 0.36 log points for borrowers in the second quartile.
These coefficients are significant at the 1% level and are similar to the coefficients for the
transition at the 4 quarter horizon. For borrowers with credit score above the median there
is no significant change in the transition to Chapter 7 filing. These findings, together with
the results in Section 3.1, reinforce the hypothesis that the driving force behind the responses
are liquidity constraints.

Results by time period We also examine the variation in the response to the reform
across different sub-periods. The year following the reform corresponds to the last phase of
a large increase in household borrowing at particularly low interest rates that started in 2001.
The low interest payments may have reduced the need to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. By
contrast, mortgage default rates started rising dramatically at the end of 2006 (see Albanesi,
Giorgi, and Nosal (2017)), which would affect the incentives to file for both Chapter 7
and Chapter 13 bankruptcy, as discussed in Section 2. To address these considerations,
we examine the response to the reform in two separate time periods: (i) the pre-recession
period of 2005Q4-2007Q3 and (ii) the credit slump period of 2007Q4-2011Q1. We re-estimate
both stages of our regression for each time period. The results are reported in Table 5.
Not surprisingly, though there is a very significant negative relation between the change in
attorney fees and the change in the transition even in the pre-recession period, the magnitude
is relative small, with only a 0.18 decline in the flow into Chapter 7 filing for a 1 log point
increase in the attorney fees. For the credit slump period, the decline in the transition from
a new insolvency to Chapter 7 filing is 0.51 for every log point increase in attorney fees. In
both time periods, there is no relation between the change in Chapter 13 attorney fees and
the the change in the transition into Chapter 13 filing.

    These findings suggest that there is a strong negative relation between the change
in Chapter 7 fees and the change in the transition from a new insolvency to Chapter 7
bankruptcy, consistent with the notion that borrowers entering a spell of financial distress
are less likely to resolve it by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

Unconditional Transitions In the Online Appendix, we also examine the relation be-
tween the change in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filing fees and the change in the rate at
which borrowers experience a new delinquency, a new Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy
and a new foreclosure. New here corresponds to an occurrence of the event after 4 quarters
without any delinquencies, foreclosures and bankruptcies for new delinquencies, or 4 quarters
without any bankruptcies of foreclosures before the bankruptcy or foreclosure. While these
unconditional transitions are not the main focus of our analysis, they provide important
corroborating evidence for the impact of the change in attorney fees on default behavior in
response to the reform.
    We estimate district level BAPCPA induced changes in the rates at which these events
occur and then relate them to the change in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 attorney fees, and
also examine the substitution from Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy to other out-
comes. We find that changes in Chapter 7 bankruptcy rates after BAPCPA are negatively
related to increases in Chapter 7 attorney fees for positive values of the change, and nega-
tive otherwise.18 The magnitude of the effect is sizable, with the a change in fees from the
  18
    The non-monotonicity of the relation between the change in fees and the change in default outcomes
is due to the fact that we estimate a non-linear relation between these two variables. More details of the
specification can be found in the Online Appendix.

median to the 90th percentile corresponding approximately to a 1 percentage decline in the
Chapter 7 bankruptcy rate. By contrast, there is a positive relation between the change in
Chapter 13 filing fees and the change in Chapter 13 bankruptcy rates at the district level
for values of the change lower than 0.42 and negative otherwise, though the magnitude is
approximately half as the estimates for Chapter 7. There is no relation between the change
in Chapter 7 (13) bankruptcy rates and the change in Chapter 13 (7) fees. We also find that
new delinquencies in the Pre-Recession phase increase with the change in Chapter 7 fees
for changes smaller than approximately 0.35 log points and decrease for higher changes The
change in new delinquency rates is negatively related to the change in Chapter 13 fees for the
Credit Slump period. The magnitude of these relations based on the estimates is negligible,
confirming the notion that the incidence of new delinquencies did not substantially respond
to BAPCPA.
    Taken together, these results confirm that a rise in Chapter 7 fees is associated with a
decline in Chapter 7 bankruptcies. For changes in Chapter 13 fees that are small enough
Chapter 13 bankruptcies respond positively to a change in Chapter 13 fees, but negatively
for higher changes. This is consistent with the notion that Chapter 13 filers are typically
positively selected relative to Chapter 7 filers, and Chapter 13 filings are less sensitive to
cost.

Exogeneity of the change in attorney fees One concern with using the filing fees as
explanatory variables for the change in bankruptcy filing rates in response to BAPCPA is that
the change in fees associated with the reform may be jointly endogenous with the bankruptcy
rate or its change, or related to other state level characteristics. To address this concern,
we examine the relation of the filing costs and their changes with state level regulation, pre-
reform economic indicators, and pre-reform bankruptcy, insolvency and foreclosure behavior
at the district level to detect possible endogeneity of the change in attorney fees.19
    The results are presented in Table 6. The top panel reports estimates for the relation
between post-reform attorney fees and district level economic indicators. There is a positive
and significant relation between post-reform fees and personal disposable income and house
  19
     We have had conversations with several bankruptcy attorneys from different bankruptcy court districts
about the determination of attorney fees. These practitioners agreed on the fact that the level and change
in attorney fees in a particular district is driven by the bankruptcy court’s objective to enable bankruptcy
attorneys to remain in the practice in the face of changing operating costs, as well as as to maintain filing
affordable for borrowers. In small bankruptcy court districts with a limited number of bankruptcy attorneys,
the attorneys may have direct influence on the setting of fees. In very large court districts, with many
attorneys the process is more arms length. Judicial culture and custom may have very persistent effect on
the level of permissible fees and the frequency with which they are adjusted over time.


                                                     21
prices, suggesting the attorney fees are increasing with household income and wealth at
the district level. This may be driven by the cost of doing business, since house prices
are typically positively related to rental rates, which is a large component of expenditures
for law practices. There is no relation between the change in attorney fees and income or
housing values, or any relation between the unemployment rate and the post-reform level of
the change in attorney fees.
    The middle panel considers some important regulatory variables that vary at the state
level. We consider the homestead exemption, the maximum wage garnishment limit, whether
foreclosures are judicial or not, and whether there is recourse for mortgage lenders in fore-
closure. The homestead exemption is clearly an important determinant for Chapter 7 filing,
as shown in Fay, Hurst, and White (2002). Additionally the incentive to file for Chapter
7 bankruptcy may depend on the ability of lenders to garnish the borrowers’ income. The
foreclosure variables are more relevant for potential Chapter 13 filers, however, via the home-
stead exemption, they may affect the incentive to file for Chapter 7 and possibly influence
attorney fees. A higher level of the homestead exemption and a higher garnishment limit
are significantly positively related to post-reform Chapter 7 attorney fees, but not related to
the change in fees around the reform. Recourse states have significantly lower post-reform
Chapter 7 attorney fees, but there is no relation between recourse and the change in fees.
Judicial foreclosure is not related with post-reform fees in any significant way, however, it
is negatively related to the change in fees, suggesting that states with judicial foreclosures
experience a smaller rise in attorney fees.
    The bottom panel considers the relation between pre-reform behavior and the level and
change in Chapter 7 filing fees. We find no relation with district level pre-reform filing
bankruptcy filing rates, insolvency rates or foreclosure rates. While these findings do not
categorically exclude endogeneity of attorney fees and their change in response to the re-
form, the estimates do not suggest that attorney fees are jointly endogenous with variables
that could potentially influence filing decisions and filing costs. Based on these results, we
maintain that the post-BAPCPA level and change in Chapter 7 attorney fees is plausibly
exogenous.


4.1    Substitution from Bankruptcy
In the previous section, we show that the reform was associated with a decline in the
transition to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The drop in flows from new insolvency to Chapter
7 bankruptcy must be associated with a rise in transition to other outcomes, such as insol-

vency, Chapter 13 filing or returning to current. Below, we quantify these substitution effects,
by using a regression approach similar to the one used in the previous section. Specifically,
we run the same first stage regression as in (2) in order to capture the district-specific mean
change in flows associated with the reform. In the second step of our estimation procedure,
we regress the district mean effects for other outcome states, {βiins→y } estimated in the first



                                              23
stage, on the district dummies estimated for flows into Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings:

                               βiins→y = γ0 + γ1 βiins→bank7 + νi .                         (4)

The estimated coefficient γ1 captures the direction and statistical strength of the relation
between the change in the transition into Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the other transitions
of interest, after controlling for the effect of the economic indicators on these transitions.

Substitution to Insolvency Our analysis indicates that the most robust pattern in the
data is a substitution from Chapter 7 filing to Insolvency. Starting from a new insolvency,
the mean drop in transition to Chapter 7 is associated with an increase in the transition
to insolvency by 2.3 percentage points at the 1 quarter horizon and 7 percentage points at
the 4 quarter horizon, reported in panel A in Table 7. These effects are very large when
compared to the cross sectional standard deviation of the change in the transitions from a
new insolvency to insolvency, that is β ins→ins , which in the previous section was estimated
to be 3.2% at the 1 quarter horizon and 5.5% at the 4 quarter horizon. The rate at which
newly insolvent individuals transition to insolvency measures the persistence of insolvency,
therefore, these results are consistent with the notion that the decline in the rate at which
newly insolvent individuals file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy translates in an increase in the
persistence of insolvency. Panel B in Table 7 reports estimates for the substitution from
Chapter 7 filing to insolvency at the 4 quarter horizon for different time periods following the
reform. The magnitude of substitution to insolvency corresponding to a decline in Chapter
7 is higher in the pre-recession period. This may be driven by the fact that the relatively
good economic conditions in that period made it less costly not to file for bankruptcy for
distressed borrowers.
    We also consider the extent of the substitution from a Chapter 7 filing to insolvency by
4 quarter lagged credit score. Table 8 reports the corresponding estimates for transitions at
the 4 quarter horizon, for the entire post-reform period and by sub-period. For the entire
post-reform period, the negative relation between the transition into Chapter 7 filing and
the transition to insolvency from a new insolvency is significant and sizable for the first 3
quartiles of the 4 quarter lagged credit score distribution, with a 1 log point reduction in the
transition into Chapter 7 filing associated with approximately a 5 percentage point rise in
the transition to insolvency for borrowers with credit score below the median. Considering
the estimates by sub-period, the patterns are similar but the magnitude of the substitution
into insolvency is larger, averaging 7.8 percentage points for the pre-recession period and

Substitution to Other Outcomes We also consider the substitution from Chapter 7
filing to all other outcomes, and report the corresponding estimates in Table 9. We first
consider the transition from a new insolvency to being current. The estimates suggest
that a 1 log point decline in the transition from a new insolvency to Chapter 7 filing is

                                                    25
associated with a 10 percentage point rise in the transition from new insolvency to current
at the 4 quarter horizon, with the coefficient significant at the 5% level. For the 1 quarter
horizon, there is also a negative relation between the transition to Chapter 7 filing and to
being current, but this is much smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant. The
difference in the estimates for the 1 quarter ahead and 4 quarter ahead horizons is intuitive,
as one would expect that over a longer time period it should be easier to cure an insolvency
for a distressed borrower.
    Turning to the transition from a new insolvency to foreclosure, we find that there is a
small positive relation with the transition to Chapter 7. At the 1 quarter horizon, a 1 log
point decline in the transition from a new insolvency to Chapter 7 filing is associated with
a 1 percentage point decline in the transition to foreclosure, though this estimate is only
significant at the 10% level. The magnitude is larger at the 4 quarter horizon, where the
estimated coefficient implies a 2.5 percentage point decline in transitions to foreclosure and
is significant at the 5% level. We also find a positive relation between the change in the
transition to Chapter 7 filing and the change in the transition to Chapter 13 filing. The
magnitude of the estimated coefficients is large, with a 1 log point decline in the transition
from a new insolvency to Chapter 7 filing associated with a decline in the transition to
Chapter 13 filing by over 1 log point at both the 1 and 4 quarter horizon, with the estimated
coefficients significant at the 5% level.
    The positive relation between the transition from a new insolvency to Chapter 7 filing
and the transition to foreclosure and Chapter 13 filing may be a consequence of the rise in
the transitions to current. This pattern is consistent with the notion that the decline in
Chapter 7 filing, by increasing the transition into current, reduces the demand for Chapter
13 filing and the incidence of foreclosures after a new insolvency. Based on these results,
BAPCPA did not steer potential Chapter 7 filers to Chapter 13, as found in Cornwell and
Xu (2014). This difference in findings may be due to the fact that Cornwell and Xu (2014)
rely on state level variation in the homestead exemption as the main mechanism through
which BAPCPA could have induced a shift from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13. Additionally,
we do not find that the decline in bankruptcy filings following BAPCPA is associated with
a rise in foreclosures rates, as in Mitman (2016). Our analysis accounts for the state level
variation in the homestead exemptions, but incorporates the district level variation in the
change in attorney fees, which seems to be a stronger determinant of the incentive to file
for Chapter 7. Additionally, our results are not consistent with the notion that BAPCPA
may have led to a rise in foreclosures, as argued by White and Zhu (2010). Their results
suggest that a decline in Chapter 13 filing following BAPCPA may be associated with a rise

                                             26
in foreclosures. However, we find that BAPCPA had no effect on either Chapter 13 filings or
foreclosures following a new insolvency in the aggregate, and the rise in the transition from
new insolvency to current associated with the reform may be responsible for the positive
relation between the change in Chapter 7 filing and the change in Chapter 13 filing and
foreclosure following a new insolvency at the court district level.

Unconditional Transitions The Online Appendix also reports a substitution analysis
for unconditional transitions. We find very strong evidence of substitution from Chapter 7
bankruptcy for the unconditional transitions. Specifically, for new delinquency rates, we find
a significant negative relation between the change in Chapter 7 filing rates and the change in
Chapter 13 filing rates for the entire Post-Reform period and the Credit Slump period. The
elasticity is about twice as large for Chapter 13 than for Chapter 7. We also find a positive
relation between the change in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies and foreclosures,
which is also consistent with the conditional transitions. These results broadly confirm a
substitution from Chapter 7 bankruptcies to insolvency post BAPCPA, and the positive
relation between the change in Chapter 7 and the change in Chapter 13 and foreclosures.
In addition, we find substitution from Chapter 13 to new delinquency in the unconditional
transitions, which is not present for the conditional transitions.

5     Insolvency, Bankruptcy and Access to Credit
Our analysis shows a sizable substitution from Chapter 7 bankruptcy to insolvency without
foreclosure from a new insolvency, and a rise of the persistence of insolvency without foreclo-
sure. We now compare the effects of Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing on access
to credit and credit score, and compare them to those of borrowers who remain insolvent
but do not file for bankruptcy. We consider all borrowers who experience a new insolvency
in a given quarter, and then distinguish among that group borrowers who file for Chapter 7
and Chapter 13 bankruptcy in the 8 quarters after the new insolvency, from those who do
not file for bankruptcy over that period.
     We first examine the differences in access to credit. Panels A to C in figure 8 display the
fraction of individuals with at least one new unsecured line of credit, auto loan or mortgage
origination in quarters 5-8 after the new insolvency for those who do not file and in quarters
1-4 after filing for those who file for Chapter 7 and for Chapter 13. This choice of time periods
is motivated by the fact that borrowers with a new insolvency who file for bankruptcy in the
8 quarters following the new insolvency typically do so between 2 and 6 quarters after the
new insolvency. Given this pattern, our choice of time horizon implies that we are comparing
filers and non filers at approximately the same time. Clearly, borrowers who file for Chapter 7
bankruptcy originate new unsecured lines of credit and auto loans at higher rates after filing
than borrowers who do not file and become newly insolvent in the same quarter, Except
at the height of the Great Recession, Chapter 7 filers have an approximately 30% higher
probability of displaying a new unsecured origination relative to individuals who don’t file,
and a 60% higher probability of obtaining a new auto origination 4 quarters after filing, when
compared to individuals who do not file. For these two products, Chapter 7 filers are also
considerably more successful than Chapter 13 filers. Indeed, the fraction of new unsecured
originations and auto loans for Chapter 13 filers is very similar to non-filers. Borrowers
who file for bankruptcy in the 8 quarters after a new insolvency are also more successful
than non-filers in obtaining a new mortgage origination. However, in this case, Chapter
13 filers display a substantially higher new mortgage origination rate than Chapter 7 filers,
especially after 2005. Before 2005, the probability of obtaining a new mortgage origination
for bankruptcy filers of either chapter was approximately 50% higher than for individuals
who become newly insolvent in the same quarter but do not file for bankruptcy. After 2005,
it is approximately double for Chapter 7 filers, relative to non filers, and four times as larger
for Chapter 13 filers relative to non filers. The higher rate of mortgage originations for
Chapter 13 filers relative to Chapter 7 filers after 2005 may be due to the fact that, after


                                               28
the income eligibility requirement was introduced for Chapter 7 bankruptcy by BAPCPA,
the pool of Chapter 13 filers has higher average income, thus making it easier for them to
obtain mortgage credit. Additionally, Chapter 13 bankruptcy is particularly beneficial for

    The difference in the fraction of new originations for insolvent borrowers by filing status
may be driven by differences in access to credit (supply) or by differences in the demand
for credit. To explore this question, Panel D in figure 8 displays the average number of
new hard inquiries for unsecured, auto and mortgage loans for borrowers who become newly
insolvent in the same quarter, based on whether they file for bankruptcy in the subsequent
8 quarters. Hard inquiries are a good indicator for credit demand, as they are recorded in
credit files after a borrower initiated loan application. Pre-BAPCPA, the average number
of new inquiries for filers in the 4 quarter after filing was approximately 0.9, irrespective
of bankruptcy chapter. It was approximately 10 percentage points lower for non-filers in
quarters 5-8 after the new insolvency. Post-BAPCPA the difference in the average number
of new inquiries for filers and non-filers virtually disappears. This suggests that the the
average number of new hard inquiries does not vary substantially by filing status, which
is consistent with similar demand for credit across the three groups. It follows that the
variation in the fraction with new originations by filing status is mostly driven by differences
in the supply of credit.20
    To conclude, we examine the variation in credit scores by filing status, at the time of the
new insolvency occurs and in an 8 quarter window following the new insolvency. Panel A
in figure 9 compares credit scores at the time of the new insolvency by filing status in the
8 quarter after the new insolvency. Borrowers who eventually file for bankruptcy display a
lower credit scores when the new insolvency occurs, irrespective of the filing chapter. This
is not surprising, as we would expect insolvent borrowers who file for bankruptcy to be more
financially distressed than borrowers who choose not to file. Four quarters after the new
insolvency, this ranking still prevails, even if credit scores have increased for both groups.
However, as show in panel B of figure 9, the pattern changes after filing. Even if credit scores
for non-filers are approximately 50 points higher 8 quarters after the new insolvency relative
to 4 quarters after, credit scores for those who file for Chapter 7 are substantially higher 4
quarters after filing and this difference increases after BAPCPA. The pre-reform difference
between credit scores 4 quarters after filing for Chapter 7 and non-filers 4 quarters after
  20
     These results are consistent with Jagtiani and Li (2014), who study credit access after Chapter 7 and
Chapter 13 bankruptcy in detail. Specifically, Jagtiani and Li (2014) find that Chapter 13 filers are much
less likely to receive new credit cards than Chapter 7 filers, even after controlling for borrower characteristics
and local economic environment. They also find that Chapter 13 filers end up with a slightly larger credit
limit amount than Chapter 7 filers overall, because they are able to maintain more of their old credit from
before bankruptcy filing. Chapter 13 filers may be at a disadvantage given their substantial recidivism in
delinquency. As shown in Norberg and Velkey (2007) and Eraslan et al. (2014), only 33% of all Chapter 13
filers successfully complete the court mandated repayment plan. Moreover, 30-33% of Chapter 13 filers whose
bankruptcy was discharged or dismissed filed again at least once. Even for those who emerged successfully
from their cases through discharge, the refiling rate exceeds 20%.


                                                       30
the new insolvency is approximately 50 points, and it shrinks to 15 points at quarters after
the new insolvency for non-filers. Post-reform, these differences grow to approximately 125
and 50 points respectively. Chapter 13 filers, on the other hand, do not display significantly
higher credit scores than non-filers. The credit score for non-filers 4 quarter after the new
insolvency is virtually the same as the credit score for Chapter 13 filers 4 quarters after filing
until mid-2007. Subsequently, the credit score 4 quarters after filing for Chapter 13 becomes
very similar to the credit score for non filers 8 quarters after the new insolvency. The credit
score advantage for Chapter 7 filers relative to non-filers and Chapter 13 filers rises after
BAPCPA, suggesting positive selection of borrowers who file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
the post-reform period compared to the pre-reform period. This post-reform change in the
selection pattern for insolvent borrowers who file for Chapter 7 and those who do not file
or file for Chapter 13 is consistent with binding liquidity constraints preventing the more
financially distressed and lower income potential filers for Chapter 7 being excluded due to
liquidity constraints.

because it provides debt discharge and stays collections, foreclosures, wage garnishment and
other court actions against the borrower, but also because it allows filers more access to new
lines of credit. Additionally, our results show that Chapter 7 offers the most effective relief
and is clearly a better outcome than insolvency for most filers. Moreover, the fact that we

                                                                                     31
show evidence of liquidity constraints restricting access to Chapter 7 bankruptcy for potential
filers contradicts the notion in Ausubel and Dawsey (2004) that marginal households would
be indifferent between bankruptcy and insolvency.
     Our results also clearly contradict the widely held view that bankruptcy is associated with
exclusion from credit markets. This view is incorporated in virtually all models of personal
bankruptcy. Based on our findings, realistic models of household credit should include sepa-
rately both an informal default option, associated with no debt relief and curtailed access to
credit, and a bankruptcy option, associated with both debt relief and access to credit. They
should also incorporate monetary costs of filing for bankruptcy and liquidity constraints.
This additional richness will allow these models to offer a more adequate assessment of the
impact of income and expenditure shocks on default behavior and welfare implications of
incomplete insurance, as well as the consequences of policies introduced to ameliorate this
incompleteness.


6    Conclusion
One of the main goals of personal bankruptcy is to provide incentive compatible insurance
against unplanned loss of income or large expenditure shocks. Our finding that bankruptcy
filings have declined mostly for low income, possibly liquidity constrained individuals, re-
sulting in a substantial rise in the rate and persistence of insolvency, suggests that BAPCPA
may have curtailed access to this form of insurance for these households. It also suggests that
the income means test that was introduced to ameliorate possible moral hazard associated
with Chapter 7 bankruptcy may not have been effective.
     We also show that insolvency is associated with a high degree of financial distress in
comparison to bankruptcy, suggesting that insolvency would not be the preferred choice for
most individuals, contrary to the notion proposed in Ausubel and Dawsey (2004). This
consequence of BAPCPA is potentially welfare reducing for households. However, since the
recovery rates for creditors from insolvent loans should be higher than on bankrupt loans,
this could have induced banks and credit card companies to expand access and improve
conditions for personal loans. Simkovic (2009) finds that BAPCPA reduced credit card
company losses and increased their profits. However, he finds little evidence that credit
conditions for consumers improved. Taken together, these findings suggest the main effect
of the 2005 bankruptcy reform was to shift financially stressed individuals from Chapter 7
bankruptcy to insolvency.

A      Consumer Credit Panel Data and Variables

Transition Matrices

    Our transition matrices include 14 possible states: seven debt states for individuals who
are not in foreclosure, and seven debt states for individuals who are in foreclosure. We define
the seven debt states and foreclosure as follows:
    1. Delinquent: An individual is delinquent if they have at least one loan in their
CCP report in that quarter that is 30, 60, or 90 days past due (crtr attr13, crtr attr14,
or crtr attr15), while not having any loans that are 120+ days past due, severely deroga-
tory, or bankrupt (crtr attr16, crtr attr17, or crtr attr18). Also, at least one of crtr attr16,
crtr attr17, or crtr attr18 must be non-missing, and the individual must not be in a state of
bankruptcy.
    2. Insolvent: An individual is insolvent if they have at least one loan in their CCP report
in that quarter that is 120+ days past due, severely derogatory, or bankrupt (crtr attr16,
crtr attr17, or crtr attr18), while not having any loans that are 30, 60, or 90 days past due
(crtr attr13, crtr attr14, or crtr attr15). Also, at least one of crtr attr13, crtr attr14, or
crtr attr15 must be non-missing, and the individual must not be in a state of bankruptcy.
    3. Both: An individual is both delinquent and insolvent if they both have at least one loan
in their CCP report in that quarter that is 30, 60, or 90 days past due (crtr attr13, crtr attr14,
or crtr attr15) and have at least one loan in their CCP report in that quarter that is 120+
days past due, severely derogatory, or bankrupt (crtr attr16, crtr attr17, or crtr attr18).
Also, at least one of crtr attr13, crtr attr14, or crtr attr15 and one of crtr attr16, crtr attr17,
or crtr attr18 must be non-missing, and the individual must not be in a state of bankruptcy.
    4. Current: An individual is current if she is neither delinquent nor insolvent, that is if
she has no loans that are 30, 60, 90 or 120+ days past due, severely derogatory, or bankrupt
(crtr attr13, crtr attr14, crtr attr15, crtr attr16, crtr attr17, or crtr attr18). Also, at least
one of crtr attr13, crtr attr14, or crtr attr15 and one of crtr attr16, crtr attr17, or crtr attr18
must be non-missing, and the individual must not be in a state of bankruptcy.
    5. Missing: An individual’s debt status is missing if the number of loans in their CCP
report in that quarter that are 30, 60, or 90 days past due (crtr attr13, crtr attr14, or
crtr attr15) are all not reported, or the number of loans that are 120+ days past due, severely
derogatory, or bankrupt (crtr attr16, crtr attr17, or crtr attr18) are all not reported. Non-
reporting occurs when Equifax does not receive enough information from the respective
financial institutions to generate its credit trend variables.
    6. Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: There are two scenarios in which an individual is identified
as being in the state of Chapter 7 bankruptcy. First, if the individual experiences Chapter
7 bankruptcy commencement (see below), then that individual is marked as being in a
state of Chapter 7 bankruptcy for ten years after the date of their foreclosure. Second, if the
individual enters the dataset for the first time marked with the bankruptcy flag (cust attr290)


                                                36
coded ”Chapter 7 discharged” (which almost exclusively occurs at the datasets 1999 Q1
truncation), that individual is marked as being in the state of Chapter7 bankruptcy until
the flag (which is supposed to stay on for ten years after the bankruptcy’s commencement)
turns off. We define the commencement of Chapter 7 bankruptcy as the following pattern in
cust attr290: the individual is marked as having filed for Chapter 7 in the present quarter.
   7. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy: There are two scenarios in which an individual is identified
as being in the state of Chapter 13 bankruptcy. First, if the individual experiences Chapter
13 bankruptcy commencement (see below), then that individual is marked as being in a state
of Chapter 13 bankruptcy for ten years after the date of their foreclosure. Second, if the
individual enters the dataset for the first time marked with the bankruptcy flag (cust attr291)
coded ”Chapter 13 discharged” (which almost exclusively occurs at the datasets 1999 Q1
truncation), that individual is marked as being in the state of Chapter13 bankruptcy until
the flag turns off. We define the commencement of Chapter 13 bankruptcy as the following
pattern in cust attr291: the individual is marked as having filed for Chapter 13 in the present
quarter.
    8. Foreclosure: There are two scenarios in which an individual is marked as being in the
state of foreclosure. First, if the individual forecloses on a home (that is, if cma attr3905
switches from off (”0”) to on (”1” or ”7”)), then that individual is marked as being in a state
of foreclosure for seven years after the date of their foreclosure. Second, if the individual
enters the dataset for the first time while under foreclosure (which almost exclusively occurs
at the datasets 1999 Q1 truncation), that individual is marked as being in the state of
foreclosure until the flag (which is supposed to stay on for seven years after the date of the
foreclosure) turns off.

Regressions

    The variable of interest in our regression analysis is the ”average attorney fee by district
for discharged no-asset Chapter 7 cases adjusted for inflation (including converted cases),”
Table A-23 of Lupica (2011). The other covariates include:
    1. Income: Annual county-level income data for 3,142 counties are drawn from the
Internal Revenue Services (IRS) Statistics of Income program, which annually aggregates
household-level adjusted gross income as reported on US tax forms. We calculate income at
the district level as the weighted average of the average income in counties covered by that
district, using the CCP district populations as weights.
    2. Unemployment Rate: Annual county-level unemployment data are drawn from the
Bureau of Labor Statisticss (BLS) Local Area Unemployment Statistics program. The unem-
ployment data are reported on a monthly basis, and they cover a total of 3,145 counties. We
calculate the unemployment rate at the district level as the weighted average of the average
unemployment rate in counties covered by that district, using the CCP district populations
as weights.
   3. House Price Index: House Price Index (HPI) values are drawn at the zip code level
from the CoreLogic HPI. The CoreLogic HPI uses repeat sales transactions to track changes

                                              37
in sale prices for homes over time, with the January 2000 baseline receiving a value of 100,
and it is the most comprehensive monthly house price index available. The CoreLogic data
cover a total of 6739 zip codes (representing 58 percent of the total U.S. population) in all
50 states and the District of Columbia. We calculate the HPI at the district level as the
weighted average of the average HPI in zip codes covered by that district, using the CCP
district populations as weights.
    4. Wage Garnishment: Wage garnishment laws specify the amount of an individual’s
wage that may not be garnished by judgment creditors to repay debt. States either adopt
federal wage garnishment restrictions–the lesser of (a) 75 percent of the employee’s disposable
earnings or (b) 30 times the federal minimum wage–or adopt their own stricter restrictions.
We calculate our proxied wage garnishment covariate by estimating the wage level protected
from wage garnishment under two scenarios, the minimum wage scenario and the average
wage scenario. Under the minimum wage scenario, states are bound either by a multiple
of the minimum wage or, in states that only designate a percentage of total income, by
that percentage of estimated average income, where estimated average income is the 40-hour
minimum wage over 0.298, the average ratio between 40-hour minimum wage and average
income (drawn from the IRS’s Statistics of Income program) across states. Under the average
wage scenario, states are bound by either the designated percentage of their average wage
or, in states that only specify a minimum wage, by the the designated multiple of estiamted
minimum wage, calculated as the average wage times 0.298. These methods rank states very
similarly. We take the minimum of the two estimates as our wage garnishment covariate.
   5. Judicial State Indicator: An indicator for whether the state requires that all foreclo-
sures be judicial (where judicial states are coded as 1).
   6. Recourse State Indicator: An indicator for whether the state is a recourse state
regarding mortgages (where recourse states are coded as 1).
    7. Homestead Exemption: Homestead exemption laws specify the maximum value of
primary residences that are generally shielded from debt repayment to judgment creditors.
We use homestead exemption values collected in Table 1 of Rohlin and Ross (2013), extrap-
olating the exemption from 1999 to 2005 Q2 as the 2004 exemption and the exemption from
2005Q3 to 2013 as the 2006 exemption.


B     Income Data and Imputation
In this section, we describe the supplementary payroll data used for the income imputation
procedure. This data is merged with our credit panel data, allowing us to map individuals’
incomes for 2009 to their credit files.
    The Equifax Workforce Solutions data provided by Equifax is a nationally-representative
random sample of individuals containing employment and payroll verification information
provided directly from the employers. The information provided for each employee includes
the last three years of total income, the date of first hire, tenure, and for the current year
status (part time/full time), weekly hours, pay rate and pay frequency.

Income Measure Description There are various income measures provided in the
Worknumber data. For each year of data available variables are given for the total 12-
month base, bonus, overtime, and commission compensation in year t, t − 1, and t − 2. This
information however is only available for a little over 13 of the sample. The other measure
of income, which is widely available across the sample, is rate of pay and pay frequency.
We therefore impute total income using a simple rate × frequency approach to account for
the lack of representation found in the sample regarding the total 12-month income vari-
ables. This yields about 11,000 observations for 2009. The sample of records is nationally
representative, both in terms of geographical and age distribution.

Comparison with the CPS To gauge the accuracy of the income measure in our data, we
performed a simple comparison with the income levels reported in the Consumer Population
Survey. We present results based on income quintiles in Table 10.

B.1      Relationship between credit score and income
To quantify the relation between credit score and income, we regress the Equifax Risk Score
on income and age, their interaction and state fixed effects:
                        2
si,2009 = ω+αyi,2009 +βyi,2009 +γai,2009 +δa2i,2009 +ηyi,2009 ×ai,2009 +νyi,2009
                                                                          2
                                                                                 ×a2i,2009 +Ii,state +εi ,

where i denotes individual borrowers, s denotes the credit score, y denotes labor income, a
denotes age and Ii,state is a state fixed effect. The estimation results are reported in Table
11. The implied relation between credit score and income by age is plotted in figure 10.
