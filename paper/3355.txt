    MARKET POWER, ECONOMIC PROFITABILITY AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH MEASUREMENT:
                        AN INTEGRATED STRUCTURAL APPROACH



                                       ABSTRACT

      The purpose of this paper is to treat scale economies, profit-maximizing

markups,   economic   profitability, capacity utilization and productivity growth

within an integrated structural model, and to assess their interactions

empirically using annual two-digit U.S. manufacturing data. Attention is

focused on error biases in measuring productivity using traditional accounting

procedures. An important conjecture by Robert Hall, that the coexistence of

normal economic profits and positive markups of price over marginal cost imply

the existence of substantial scale economies and excess capacity, is then

examined using this structure.

      The empirical results suggest that markups in most U.S. manufacturing

firms have increased over time, and tend tn hR count.rcyclicl. However,

procyclical capacity utilization and scale economies tnd ;o offset the short

run profit potential from markup behavior. As a result, oi average economic

profits are normal, but declining profitability is prevalent in mos:

industries since the early l970s. Also, although cost and revenue shares tend

to be approximately equal, the error biases in standard productivity growth

measures resulting from input fixity and scale economies are substantial,

particularly over business cycles.

I. Introduction

      In   the last few years, macroeconomists and students of industrial

organization have reexamined relationships among scale economies, markups,

economic profitability and productivity growth. Paul Romer (1986] has

emphasized the importance of increasing returns for productivity growth at the

aggregate industry or economy level. Empirical evidence supporting this has

been presented by Robert Hall [1986,l988a,1988b], who reported both

significant increasing returns and markups of price over marginal Cost in

various U.S. industries. Hall also finds that economic profits are

approximately normal, suggesting an industrial structure along the classic

lines of monopolistic competition. Related evidence on the cyclical nature of

markups, suggesting some procyclicality of markup behavior, has been presented

by Domowitz, Hubbard and Petersen (1987, 1988].

      Analysis of the cyclical characteristics of Robert Solow's [19581

productivity residiiial provided the basis for these empirical studies. The

resulting framework is limited, however, by its dependence on a number of

necessarily restrictive assumptions'. Each study therefore focuses on a

particular issue, with little acknowledgment of linkages among different

results and hypotheses. The purpose of this paper is to extend this type of

analysis to treat scale economies, profit-maximizing markups, economic

profitability, capacity utilization and productivity growth within an

integrated theoretical structural model, to assess their interactions

empirically using detailed two-digit U.S. manufacturing data, and to examine

the generality of findings reported in the earlier studies.

     More specifically, using the "new industrial economics" approach

outlined by Timothy resnahan [1988] in which marginal cost and therefore




 1These are outlined somewhat further in Section IV of this paper.
                                     Page 2

markups are unobserved but estimated econometrically, I specify an integrated

cost and demand structure for each industry. The structure is quite general

in that (i) markups and returns to scale are permitted to vary over time (they

are not constant parameters); (ii) variable and quasi-fixed inputs are

distinguished (by explicit recognition of adjustment costs) thereby allowing

short- and long-run impacts to differ; (iii) quasi-fixity of both capital and

labor is incorporated (to accommodate labor hoarding as well as slow

adjustment of capital); (iv) input substitution is not constrained a priori (a

generalized Leontief restricted cost function is employed and gross output

rather than value-added is used as a measure of output); (v) nonstatic

expectations are allowed for (through an instrumental variable estimation

procedure); and (vi) the effects of supply and demand "shocks" are directly

represented (by specifying and estimating industry-specific cost, input demand

and output demand functions). Resulting estimated economic performance

indexes therefore reflect the existence of these characteristics of

production.

      Although measures of scale economies, markups and economic profitability

by industry are of interest in their own right, this general specification

allows their linkages as well as their impacts on productivity growth to be

formalized and measured. In particular, in this paper I focus on implications

of these phenomena and their interactions for the measurement and

interpretation of multifactor productivity growth in U.S. industries.

      Building on my earlier work (Morrison (1986,1989a,l989b,l990]) that

dealt with differences between primal- (revenue) and cost-based specifications

of productivity growth2. I consider theoretically and empirically the "error

biases" that result in traditional primal aultifactor productivity growth

measurement by failing to take into account properly the effects of markups.




 2Thjs work formalized a framework sketched out by Zvi Griliches [19671.
                                    Page 3

input fixities, and scale economies. The structural framework used for this

analysis facilitates empirical assessment of the important conjecture made by

Hall, that since economic profits are normal in most industries and yet

markups are considerable, then scale economies and excess capacity must be

substantial.

      The data I use are similar to those used by Hall, although my focus is

on manufacturing rather than on all 1-digit industries. I estimate structural

equations for seventeen 2-digit U.S. industries, and aggregated durable,

nondurable and total manufacturing industries. The data on which the

estimation is based are annual data from 1950 to 1986 from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics on prices and quantities of gross output, and capital, labor,

intermediate material, energy and purchased services inputs.

      I begin my analysis in Section II by outlining fundamental theoretical

results linking productivity growth, markups, scale economies and capacity

utilization. Then in Section III I compare the generality of the framework

motivated by these results with those used in previous literature on

productivity growth, stressing implications for error biases in measuring such

growth. In Sections IV and V I outline the contributions of the structural

model for empirical implementation, and present empirical results.

      My principal empirical findings are that markups have been

countercyclical and have an upward trend for most industries, and that excess

capacity and the potential to exploit scale economies have tended to expand

over time. In terms of economic profitability, these characteristics of cost

and demand tend to offset each other. resulting in approximately normal

profits on average, although declining profitability since 1973 is prevalent

for a number of (especially durable manufacturing) industries. These

empirical results are consistent with Hall's conjectures. Moreover, they

imply that cost and revenue shares, and therefore standard primal and cost-
                                        Page 4

 based measures of multifactor productivity growth, are by coincidence rather

 similar on average. However, I find that these traditional measures of

 productivity growth may be misleading due to inappropriate assumptions and

 error biases resulting from input fixities and scale economies.



 II. Fundamental Results Used for the Analysis

      To motivate formally the theoretical linkages among productivity growth,

markups, scale economies and capacity utilization, I will rely primarily on

three results. These results can be combined and employed directly to

motivate the use of estimated cost and demand elasticities that relax the

standard restrictive assumptions. This allows generalization and refinement

of productivity growth measures, and determination of how various

characteristics of technology and market structure are related. The three

results can be sumearized and integrated as follows.

      First, I will initially base the analysis of productivity change on the

traditional output-side specification of productivity growth motivated by the

technical change literature introduced by Solow (19581:

where Y and Py are output quantity and price, Vj and pj are corresponding

input measures,       denotes a time derivative, and Sj is the revenue share

Pjvj/pyY. With perfect competition, instantaneous adjustment and constant

returns to scale, this is equivalent (except for a change in sign) to the

cost-sid,   specification3

        The residual measure of technical progress, representing the growth in

output that cannot be attributed to increases in inputs (la), or, conversely,

the diminution of costs not explained by changes in input prices (lb), has

been denoted the Solow residual. It is often constructed using only value-

added output, and thus only capital and labor inputs. Although Hall uses the

value-added approach, more generally this multifactor productivity measure can

include other inputs affecting production of gross output, such as energy and

intermediate   materials. In this study I employ            this more complete

specification   of    input changes, thereby permitting, for example, the

assessment of substitution of labor for energy after en.rgy price increases.

        Secondly, I   will exploit information on      the relationship between costs

and revenues incorporated in the cost and output shares            used in   the

productivity growth computations.        If perfect competition, instantaneous

adjustment (full utilization) and constant returns to scale (CRTS) prevail.,

pyY—C. In this case revenu, and cost shares           are    identical and thus    primal and
cost   productivity measures are equivalent (as in (la) and (Ib)). However, if

any of these restrictions are invalid, differences between revenues and Costs

will occur. For example, this can arise because imperfect              competition implies
p.,'MC (where MC—ÔC/8Y represents marginal         Cost),   or because   nonconstant
returns   to scale or   fixity   cause AC1'MC (where ACC/Y denotes        average cost).
have   shown elsewhere (Morrison      (l989b1) that recognizing these differences
results   in the relation

                                                               — C•ADJ



          This adaptation relies on two elasticity expressions. The cost

 elasticity y —            3m     C(Y, .)/äln Y — MC.Y/C is defined in terms of the total

 cost function C—C(p,Y,t). The inverse demand elasticity c —

 [3py(Y,.)/8y].y/p              is based on the inverse demand function p—py(Y,p), where p

 is a vector of shift variables for the output demand function. Equation (2)

 therefore explicitly captures the dependence of revenue on both the cost- (or

 supply-) and demand-side elasticities through the adjustment factor

ADJecy/(l+epy).

         Although the ECYMC•Y/C equality holds by definition, the equality of

the inverse demand elasticity Epy and the markup of output price over marginal

cost requires some additional motivation. Essentially this relationship

emerges because, for any level of output produced, assuming the profit

maximization condition MR—MC holds (where MR is marginal revenue), the markup

         can be
py/MC              written as py/MR —
                                                 py/(py-*.Y.öp.j(Y,.)/8y) —     l/(l+c).   Thus, when

market power exists from any factor affecting the shape of the demand curve

facing a firm, such as product differentiation in the context of monopolistic

competition, po and the pyY-.C equality must accordingly be adapted.

         Thirdly, a result based on the c elasticity can be used to interpret

equation (2) further: the cost elasticity with respect to output y
— 81n C/81n Y — (8C/8Y)Y/C—I4C/AC differs from one if either nonconstant

returns (long run fixities) or short run fixities exist. Specifically, I have

shown    elsewhere      (in Morrison [l989b]) that c is a combination of the impacts

of long run returns to scale and capacity utilization, such that


                                                     MC•Y C*

                                         Page 7



         This equality depends on the definitions of (the inverse of) returns to

scale £y (where L denotes long run), and a cost-side measure of Capacity

utilization 1• Development of these measures requires a representation of

the cost function explicitly incorporating fixed inputs, C(p,Y,t)

—
    G(p,Y,t,z)+Zkpkxk,   where C(•) is a variable Cost function and x a vector of

K quasi-fixed inputs xk having cx ante rental (market) prices          Based on

this representation the associated shadow cost function C*_G(p,Y,t,x)+kZkxk

can be defined, where Zk is the shadow value of xk, 8G/8Xk. This forms the

basis for defining a1y as           — (MC.Y)/C*4 (where MC—aC/aY—8G/aY), and CtJ

as CU—C*/C —     (l-)      (where Ck —   [8C(•)/8xkJ.xk/C — (pk+ÔG()/öxklxk/C).5
         Intuitively, equation (3) indicates that the change in costs as output

varies is a combination of the potential economies of scale implied by the

sloped long run average coat curve (cost changes associated with long run

returns to scale) and the constraints faced from input fixity that are

reflected in the slope of the short run coat curve (cost changes arising from

potential returns to variable inputs in the short run). When long run

constant returns to scale exist, y—l and all cost changes are associated

with short run returns to inputs. When instantaneous adjustment prevails,

     —
         (pK-Zk)xk/C — 0, and cost changes result only from movements along the
long run cost curve. This full equilibrium condition is equivalent to saying

that CU—l; capacity (defined in terms of all fixed inputs) is fully utilized.

         Putting the second and third results together shows that:




     therefore represents the proportional change in output possible from a
given percentage change in costs. If this exceeds one, long run average
costs decline with a scale expansion so there is potential for
proportionately greater output than cost increases.
'C*/C represents capacity utilization since utilization fluctuations arising
from fixity of factors imply the marginal valuation (Zk) deviates from the
market price (pit) for any fixed factor xk. This expression assumes
homotheticity of Y(.), as was shown in Morrison (1986], although a
comparable version can be generated for nonhomothetic cases.

An important implication of this expression is that when Ep'.,'O from product

differentiation or c'l due to either scale economies or fixity, the

equivalence of (la) and (ib) is destroyed. This results both because (1) the

assumptions on which these measures are constructed are invalid, so

corrections must be made to measure technical change appropriately, and (ii)

because the primal (but not the cost) measure includes all returns to cost and

market characteristics, so a decomposition may be carried out to identify

these impacts separately. This latter deviation arises from (4) because it

shows that revenue pY (and therefore the revenue shares appearing in (la))

embodies returns to all characteristics of the production process that cause

pyY,C -   - fixity,   scale economies and market power. However, costs C (and thus

the shares in cost) include only cx ante returns to inputs so (lb) captures

the effect of technical change independent of these other effects.

      These implications highlight that adapting productivity growth measures

to recognize generally neglected characteristics of the technology and the

market provides insights into why observed productivity growth fluctuations

might occur, and how one might identify their underlying components. For

example, if markups are increasing over time, it follows that standard primal

productivity growth measures based on (la) will be increasingly downward

biased over time. Technical change advances in this case will be understated

because some growth in output will inadvertently be attributed to increases in

the price of a unit of output. Similar errors arise if invalid assumptions of

CRTS and instantaneous adjustment (cy—l) are made. These are, however,

somewhat more complex to untangle because not only biases but also
                                     Page 9

dacompositions are implied.   Adaptations to deal with these measurement

issues will be formalized further in the next section.

      Another useful point arising from consideration of (4) is that if

approximately normal profits are observed for a firm or industry, then pyYmC,

which in turn means AJ_y/(l+py)_i'Cy.CUC/(1+Epy)ml. This provides a
useful context in which to assess the Hall [1986] contentions that capacity

utilization and returns to scale may attenuate the profitability arising from

market power. Using (4), in essense this means that the cost characteristics

reflected in     must counteract the markup py/MC. This could occur since if

short or long run fixities (excess capacity) exist, y<l, and since markups

imply that py/MC—(l/spy)>l, it follows that the ratio of these two factors

could be approximately one.

      The observation of apparent normal profits not only suggests that the

levels of the markup, capacity utilization and returns to scale measures must

be such that this condition holds, but also that if ty   declines   (due either

to decreases in capacity utilization or increases in potential returns to

scale), this will support a larger markup without increasing overall

profitability. This has significant implications for the cyclical behavior of

markups. If CRTS prevails, for example, increases in capacity utilization

will be associated with decreases in markups, meaning countercyclical markups

will be observed. Hall's [1986] conJecture about the relationship between

markups and excess capacity therefore directly implies countercyclical

markups.6 This tendency could, of course, be counteracted by changes in scale

economies if the RTS assumption is invalid.7




   somewhat different argument for countercyclical markups, motivated by
industrial organization theory, has been presented by Rotemberg and Saloner
 1986].
 See Morrison [1988b,1989a] for further analysis of how this might happen
when capacity is overutilized.
                                       Page 10

        Issues motivated by consideration of (1) and (4) thus have important

implications for the correct measurement of "true productivity or technical

change, and for analysis of the interactions among cost and demand

characteristics of the production process. To pursue these implications

further, however, the theory underlying adaptation of traditional productivity

growth measures for these characteristics must     be   formalized, and an

empirically implementable model must be developed to allow estimation of the

appropriate elasticities. These steps are pursued in the next two sections.



III. The Imnlications of These Relationshioa for Productivity Crowth

       Recognizing the impacts of the different cost and market characteristics

--   markups, scale and fixity -- has somewhat varied implications for
productivity growth measurement. For example, correcting for imperfect

competition simply requires recognizing that the denominators of the revenue

and cost shares differ due to pyY'MC•Y—C (given c—l). Since appropriate

measurement of aggregate input growth requires weighting input changes by cost

shares, adapting for this necessitates an error bias correction to change the

share-weights. Correcting for scale economies implies that the deviation

between MC and AC must be accomodated; this is accomplished as an error bias

correction to change the denominator of the weights on both output and input

changes. This also implies a decomposition of the primal measure to isolate

true   technical   change from the combined productivity impact of technical

change and scale economies. Allowing for th. impact of fixities from

requires one additional step; the numerator of both the primal and Cost share-

weights for the quasi-fixed inputs, as well as the denominator of the cost

shares must be adapted.

        More specifically, the deviation between (la) and (ib) arising from

imperfect competition occurs only because (l+cpy)l implies pyYC; no
                                       Page 11

assumptions are imbedded in the construction of these expressions affecting

the cost measures or the numerators of the shares. Thus, reconciling (la) and

(ib) requires recognizing that (l+py)—MC/pyC/pyY. so Sj_Mj(l+py)8 and

£yt_ctpyjMj(vj/'j). This expression appropriately measures the input
shares in terms of Costs rather than revenue. Therefore, correcting the

computation for markups requires computing eMyt_eCt_syt.epy.EjMjxj/xj.,

where cpy"EMj(xj/x) may be considered the "error bias" in the usual primal
measurement of productivity growth, and H stands for the "Markup correction".

The bias therefore depends on the cost shares, the inverse demand elasticity

(or markup), and the growth rates of the inputs.

          If scale economies or changes in capacity utilization also exist, the

restrictive assumption that       ,—l must also be relaxed for measurement and

interpretation of productivity growth. The additional complexity of adapting

productivity growth measures for            since this affects the weight on

output growth and the numerator as veil as the denominator of the shares,

motivates the division of the refinement of the productivity growth

measurement framework into two parts - -   a   decomposition in addition to the

error bias correction.

          To correct for error biases arising from         it must be recognized

that (lb) is based on the assumption that the cost function can be written as

a unit cost function AC-C/Y—c(p,t) so i—l and din c/dt —        din   (C/Y)/dt

—   din   C/dt.din Y/dt. However, if        this is not valid; the average cost

derivative becomes din C/dt-y(dln Y/dt). Appiication of equation (lb) is

therefore incorrect unless this adaptation is made.

          More formaiiy, to correct for 1yi owing to scale economies, as shown

in Morrison [1989bJ, the residual ECt must be adjusted to

                                                                     Ct


where R represents "adjusted for Returns to scale", and the last term is the

error bias in traditional measures when CRTS is assumed inappropriately. The

adaptation in (5) reflects that             — MC•Y/C — MC•Y/AC.Y — MC/AC.     Thus, the

adjustment by eç restates the change in output in terms of its correct

marginal value. The impact of the bias depends on the extent of potential

scale economies and the output growth rate.

         If instead yi'l because cv'° due to fixity and therefore non-optimal

capacity utilization, this implies that the valuation of the quasi-fixed inputs

at their market prices Pk is erroneous; valuation should instead be in terms of

the shadow value, Zk, reflecting the true marginal product of xk. This implies

an adjustment for the numerator of the share weight on quasi-fixed input

changes as well as for the denominator on weights of all inputs and output.

        This occurs because (lb) depends on instantaneous adjustment through the

use of Shephard's lemma to substitute v1, the cost minimizing demand for input

i for 8C/8pj. which assumes marginal products always reflect market prices for

all inputs. If any input k (xk) is quasi-fixed, however, this is not valid

because the firm will not be able to choose instantaneously a cost minimizing

demand for xk; valuation of the changes in quasi-fixed inputs should be at the

shadow   value Zk   instead of Pk and input shares should be measured in terms of

C*. A4aptation      of the   weight on   output   changes arises in this case also,

because variable and total costs do not           change proportionately with output in
the   short run even if long run CRTS prevails. Non-optimal use of the fixed

inputs implies c —      l-Eke — C*/C ' 1.
                                          Page 13

                               Yxk
where    F represents "adjusted for Fixity".9 As before, the last term in this

expression can be thought of as an error bias occurring in this case if

instantaneous adjustment is assumed when subequilibrium (not being able to

reach a full equilibrium because of fixity) really exists; the bias now depends

in part on the relative growth rates of output and the quasi-fixed inputs.

         Generating a fully adjusted measure of technical change from the cost

side, incorporating both fixity and returns to scale, requires combining (5)

and (6) as in Morrison [l989b]. This measure, denoted             (where T represents

the "Total adjustment") accomodatas the full error bias in the standard £ct

measure, Similarly, constructing a fully adjusted primal measure to obtain

      requires recognizing quasi-fixity, and thus valuing the     fixed   inputs in

the         computation at their shadow values.
         Once these adaptations of standard productivity growth   measures are made

to correct for invalid assumptions of CRTS and instantaneous adjustment, the
relationship between the primal measure of productivity growth and a pure
technical change measur, can be expressed in terms of a decomposition.
         This decomposition is analogous to the treatment of returns to scale
motivated by Ohta [1975]. Ohta showed that the Cyt1Ct equality must be
adapted to 'yt ECt/CCY (or eTyt_ eTc,'ey in our notation, to account for
corrections of the standard measures) when nonconstant returns to scale (NCRTS-)




 9This    is developed in more detail in Morrison [1989b1.
                                        Page 14

exist so MC'AC and pyY—MC.Y,AC.Y—C. This implies that the primal productivity

growth measure can be divided into a component capturing technical change only

and one reflecting the cost changes arising from returns to scale, where by

definition          is the inverse of returns to scale.

        Morrison (1986) shoved that an equivalent adjustment is implied when

Ey,l due to short run fixity. When both exist neither Ey, showing scale

economies, or CU, indicating utilization of fixed inputs, are equal to one;

thus, y—yCU,'l.            The associated decomposition of the output-side measure
-   - including   returns to all cost and demand characteristics -   - isolates
technical change independently from the characteristics captured in the

deviation of         from one, since it separately identifies the different

characteristics that cause pyY'C from equation (4).

        It should be emphasized that whether the cost or primal productivity

growth measure (ETct or ETyt) is the appropriate measure for analysis depends

on the context and desired interpretation. The point of the decomposition is

to highlight the distinct factors reflected in primal productivity growth

measures. In some circumstances one might want to identify technical change

independently of other factors, in which case eTc would be the relevant

measure, but in others returns to scale might be thought of as an important

determinant of overall "efficiency or productivity", implying that Ty would

be a preferable measure for analysis. The decomposition simply accomplishes

the desirable goal (for interpretive purposes) of identifying the individual

contributions of technical change and     other   factors affecting economic

performance.

        It is also important to note that both the error bias adjustments to

correct for erroneous     assumptions, and   the decomposition to isolate the

different components of the primal     productivity   growth measure, may   be   used to

help explain" fluctuations in standard       productivity   growth measures. The
                                      Page 15

first adaptation is a pure correction, however, whereas the other facilitates

interpretation in terms of the technical determinants of economic performance.



IV.   Towards an Emoirical Itinlementation: A grief Review of Recent Literature

        In order to implement the productivity growth framework developed in the

last   section, and to evaluate the magnitude of and relationships among the

different components generally captured in productivity growth measures, a

model is required to separately identify and .easure the corresponding

components. Previous contributions by, among others, Hall [1986,1988aJ, and

Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson [1987,19881 provided steps in this direction.

However, the underlying framework used in these     studies is   insufficient for a

full analysis since it relies on an incomplee. p.cificstion of the underlying

cost and demand relations. Thus it does not distinguish the independent

impacts of different cost and demand   characteristics     on economic performance.

        In particular, as indicated in Section I, measurement of markups, scale

economies and utilization fluctuations can be accomplished by estimating

certain coat and demand elasticities, including the inverse elasticity of

output demand (reflecting markup behavior), the long run elasticity of cost

with rsspect to output changes (capturing returns     to   scale), and the shadow

value of fixed factors, or alternatively the short run cost elasticity with

respect to output (revealing the impacts of fixity or utilization changes).

Measurement of these elasticities, however, requires a complete specification

of   the production technology and demand   structure facing the firm, a   goal which
was not pursued in the initial   Hall study or the subsequent related literature.

       Hall [l986,l988a1 used the original development of the Solow [19581

residual to motivate his analysis, and measured the markup as a constant

parameter using simple parametric methods. Little scope for analysis of the

interactions among different components of the production structure exists in
                                    Page 16

this framework, however, since the relationship between the constant markup and

the cost characteristics cannot be assessed. In addition, the determinants (or

even the trends in) the markup are not specified, so the simplicity of the

model limits interpretation of the measured markups. Estimation of only one

deviation from the usual maintained assumptions is possible; estimating markups

precludes consideration of scale economies, and characterizing returns to scale

requires somehow first imputing cost from revenue shares. Problems are also

evident from the empirical results generated using Hall's procedures. Both the

markup and returns to scale measures reported by Hall [1989,1988a,b] are

extremely large and implausible for some industries10, and the reasons for this

are not apparent.

      Doiaovitz, Hubbard and Peterson [1987,19881 included other variables,

allowed the markup to vary, and based their analysis on an industrial

organization perspective that suggested markups would vary in response to

variables like concentration ratios. However, this framework is still based on

a fairly simple extension of the Solow residual equation", and does not allow

independent representation of cost characteristics such as capacity utilization

and returns to scale. For example, the cyclicality of markups was established

by them using a simple regression of markup indexes on published capacity

utilization measures.

      In Morrison [1989a,bJ I instead employed a production theory approach

based on estimation of cost and demand functions. The econometric treatment

allows computation of a number of indexes and elasticities reflecting not only

the level and pattern of markups, capacity utilization, returns to scale and

other indicators, but also their dependence on exogenous demand and supply

(cost) variables facing the firm.



 °The results found for the chemical, petroleum and printing and publishing
 industries are particularly problematic in the manufacturing sector,
 although those for food and paper also imply that the unit price is more
 than three times the associated marginal cost.
                                             Page 17

         The framework, although more complex to specify and estimate, provides a

far richer structure in which to assess the different cost and demand

characteristics facing the firm than those relying only on the Solow equation.

It allows, for example, direct estimation of shadow values for fixed inputs,

since it is based on an explicit characterization of the variable cost function

C(.). The corresponding measures of capacity utilization and scale economies

can therefore be easily constructed. Similarly, an inverse demand equation

Py() is incorporated, thereby facilitating direct estimation of the inverse

demand elasticity.

         The usefulness of this more structural framework is also demonstrated by

the results generated using the model; for example, markup, returns to scale

and capacity utilization measures for the U.S, Canadian and Japanese

manufacturing sectors, and for various Canadian manufacturing industries

reported in Morrison (l988b,l989a] respectively are reasonable, and the

measured utilization indexes are quite closely correlated to published

estimates.

        The basic building blocks of my structural model              are   a Generalized

Leontief restricted cost function and a similarly constructed output demand

function. The NCRTS Generalized Leontief cost function has the form


7) G(Y,t,z,x,p) —                         Pj5 + EiZm 5im              +                 7ams

Pj index the   prices   of variable inputs (energy, E, intermediate materials, Pt,

and   purchased services, PS), 5m'           depict the remaining arguments (Y, t, X
and AL), t is a time counter, and         the    inclusion of Ax (AX      and   AL) allows for
internal costs   of   adjustment on     capital    and labor.   The corresponding inverse

demand   function for output is specified as

where   h indexes the components of the vector of shift variables p of py(Y,p),

including here consumption expenditures, EXP, a price index for imported

goods, p, the interest rate, r, a price index for consumption goods, Pcpi'

and UN is unemployment.11

        These two     functions   are used to construct a system of estimating

equations     including (i) the cost function (7) plus variable input demand

equations     for   E, N and PS derived from Shephard's Lemma (vj_aC/apj); (ii)       a
short   run   price   setting equation MR—MC   using   the expressions for marginal

revenue (I—py+(ôpy/aY).Y) and marginal cost (MC.-8G/8Y); (iii) two Euler

equations to reflect adjustment paths of the two quasi-fixed inputs; and, to

complete the system, (iv) the output demand equation.12

        Once the parameters of this model are estimated, the determinants of

costs (C.-G(.)+Ekp1xk)     and    demand (py(•)), and thus the derivatives underlying
the elasticities representing        markups, scale economies, and capacity

utilization, are explicitly determined. These indexes may therefore be

constructed for evaluation and comparison, and adaptation of traditional

productivity growth measures. The results of such procedures are reported in

the next section.

V. Emoirical Evidence on Markups.     Fixities      and Productivity Growth Patterns



Va. Data and Estimation

        Estimation of this model was carried out using U.S. manufacturing data

for   1952-1986 for a number   of manufacturing      industries. The sectors

considered include food and     kindred    products (P0) •    textiles   (TX), apparel and

other textile products (AP), paper and allied products(PA), printing and

publishing    (PP), chemicals and allied products (CM), petroleum and coal

products (PC), rubber and miscellaneous plastics (RB), lumber and wood (LW),

furniture and fixtures (FM), clay and glass (CL), primary metals (PM),

fabricated metal products (FM), machinery (MC), electric and electronic

equipment (EL), instruments and related products (IN), and transportation

equipment (TQ). In addition, a total manufacturing category (Ma), constructed

by   aggregating the individual sectors using       Divisia   indexes, was estimated for

comparison.

       These data are based on series for prices and quantities of            output,
capital,   labor, energy,   intermediate   materials and purchased       services
developed and used by the Bureau of Labor        Statistics    Division of Productivity

and Technology.13    The capital data were, however, reconstructed           to   generate

an cx ante measure more closely related to the procedures used by Berndt                and
Wood [l984j) Such a recalculation is required because the residual" method

of capital measurement in the BLS    data    generates an cx post measure of capital




 13The data, including detailed data       for
                                         the capital components, were
 graciously provided by Michael Harper at the Bureau of Labor Statistics
 fLS).
  "This was accomplished by taking the components of the capital stock used
 by the BLS and reaggregating using the Moody Baa bond yield instead of the
 internal rate of return (ignoring the cx post capital gains component). In
 addition, the capital stock data used here do not include inventories or
 land, which might be thought to affect production and productivity
 differently than non-residential structures and producers' durable
 equipment.
                                    Page 20

quasi-rents including any returns not reflected in the other input measures.

Use of such an cx      measure would be inappropriate, for it includes effects

of returns to scale and market power, as well as the quasi-rents accruing to

capital.

      The model was estimated for each industry separately, using three stage

least squares to incorporate the endogeneity of output quantity and price, and

to allow for the possibility of nonstatic expectations on input prices as

suggested by Pindyck and P.otemberg (1983]. The instruments employed included

lagged values of the exogenous variables facing the firm, as well as the world

oil price, defense spending, and the political party variables relied on in

the Hall studies. The results were quite robust to different specifications

of instruments.15

      The estimated model for each of the manufacturing industries can be used

to generate a large number of indexes, elasticities, and other parameter

transformations. Since space constraints prohibit detailed analysis of the

different sectors, I concentrate here only on the overall evidence of markups,

scale economies and input fixity, and their effects on productivity growth and

economic profitability. A wealth of additional analyses and comparisons can

be made, however, from perusal and manipulation of the numbers provided in the

Tables. The interested reader can therefore pursue the analysis substantially

further.16




 151n particular, including or omitting the Hall instruments had little
 fect on the estimated indexes.
   The results are presented in the text for all industries in terms of
 average annual growth rates computed from the relevant indexes. More
 complete indexes (from 1960) are presented in the Appendix. Some additional
 results about correlations and other indexes computed are comeented on
 below. Computations of certain measures underlying these comeents can be
 made directly from the presented indexes. Other results, such as the shadow
 valu, ratios underlying the     measures, require direct computation using
 the estimated parameter values. ?urther information about these indexes and
 the parameter estimates are available upon request from the author.

Vb. Productivity Growth

      Traditional multifactor productivity growth indexes Lyt based on the

K,L,E,M,PS division of inputs are presented in terms of average annual growth

rates (AAGR) in Table 1, and in their full form (from 1960 to 1986) in the

Appendix Table lA. These measures are computed using standard primal-side

measurement techniques, ignoring the potential existence of markups, input

fixity and returns to scale.

     The AACR reflect the existence of a post-1973 productivity growth

slowdown, even though the dramatic stagnation isediate1y after 1973 seen in

the full indexes is somewhat masked by including the most recent years in the
                                    Page 22

annual average computations. The industries which show a negative growth rate

in the post-1973 period are printing and publishing (PP), primary metals (PM)

and petroleum and coal refining (PC). The latter two of these are capital-

and energy-intensive industries which might be thought to be heavily affected

by energy price shocks. This tendency is evident overall; from the full

indexes it appears the industries hardest hit in the mid-l970s included PM,

FM, MC, Q, PA, and RA, all of which are capital intensive. These industries

are also those, however, that experienced relatively intense international

competition. Interestingly, the only industry to exihibit an increase in

productivity growth over this period was MC, which includes the computer

industry.17

      The traditional productivity growth indexes appear considerably pro-

cyclical, with, for example, declines appearing in most industries around

1970, 1974-75 and 1982-83. One indication of the extent of these fluctuations

is the standard deviation, which for each industry indicates the deviations of

these productivity growth rates from their mean rate. These measures are

rather large, particularly for durable goods industries and those nondurable

goods industries mentioned above as suffering from productivity growth

stagnation and declines.

      The fluctuations observed, however, are less systematic it might

initially appear, particularly given the emphasis on these relationships in

the recent studies by Hall. The correlations of these indexes with indexes

reflecting cyclical trends are not very significant. In particular, when this

productivity growth measure is correlated with either a standard published

capacity utilization measure (the Federal Reserve   Board   index for




 17Se.iconductors are included in EL, which also experienced very strong
 productivity growth over this period, particularly in the late l970s. The
 relatively strong performance of the MC industry is driven largely by the
 enormous productivity growth experienced in 1984-86.

manufacturing, FRB) or the CU measure resulting from estimation of my model,

the correlations tend to be primarily positive but generally statistically

insignificant. Similarly, simple correlations of multifactor productivity

growth carried out using the Hall variables --         the   world oil price (WOP),

defense spending (DEF) and political party in power, were largely

insignificant at standard confidence levels.18

        For example, using a one-tailed test of the hypothesis that the

covariance of the productivity residual and WOP was positive, marginal

significance levels under five percent were only found          for   the AP, CM, PC, KB,

CL and FM industries. For DEF this was the case for PA, GM, PC, CL, MC and

TQ. Hall's results also, however, inferred limited correlation patterns.

This was especially true      for   DE?, which was only correlated at the five

percent level with the productivity growth measure for one manufacturing

sector, FM.     For   WOP more correlation was found; the residuals for the FO, PA,

GM,   PC, CL and EL industries were correlated with WOP at this level of

significance. If my results were based on a two-tailed test (a standard t-

test   of the significance of the     slope   coefficient), the only significant

correlations remaining would be that of the PC productivity residual with both

instruments, and of the CM     measure with DEF. For Hall, no significant
correlations at this level would occur for DEF, and          FO and EL would become
marginal   or drop out for WOP.
       It should be noted that my results differ from Hall's for a number of
reasons. One disparity      is the   inclusion of intermediate materials, purchased
services and energy costs, and therefore their substitution with capital and
labor, in my productivity growth measure. This suggests that using VOP as an

instrument may not be     very appropriate. One     indication that the    correlation




18The one     outlier
                  for this was PC (petroleum and coal refining) which is

measures may suffer from some endogeneity is that many of the manufacturing

sectors for which correlations with WOP were found use energy as either as an

energy or material input. Thus the observed correlations could reflect the

treatment of these inputs.

       The cyclical fluctuations in productivity that do exist, although not

pervasive in terms of statistical significance, influence the interpretation

of changes in economic performance.        Thus, it is useful to see to what extent

these variations might be smoothed, and in this sense explained", by taking

into account cyclically related markup, capacity utilization, and returns to

scale characteristics. These characteristics, and the associated adaptations

of traditional productivity growth measures, will now be considered in turn.




Vc. Markups

       It has been argued that markup behavior might be expected to be

cyclical, although controversy remains about whether they are pro- or counter-

cyclical.'9 Hall's treatments of the markup do not allow for cyclicality to

exist, since in his empirical analysis the markup is simply estimated as a

constant parameter. However, his general hypothesis about excess capacity

counteracting markups implicitly suggests that increasing markups would be

accoimsodated by additional excess capacity, leading to countercyclicality of

markups. Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson more directly address this issue by

allowing for   vari.bl. markups   and   assessing the correlation   of the markup

measure   with a published measure   of capacity utilization (as mentioned above).

and   find som.   evidence of procyclicality.




 t9See Morrison (1988b,1989a] for further elaboration of cyclicality of
 markups and its determinants.
                                    Page 25

      In this study, the cyclicality and determinants of the markup   are
directly incorporated into the model.20 One indication of the cyclicality

implied for markup behavior, motivated by the Domowitz, Hubbard and Peterson

studies, is a correlation of the markup index with a capacity utilization

measure. The relationship of the markup index with other exogenous factors

affecting aggregate output in the economy, such as Hall's world oil price and

defense spending variables, may also provide some evidence of cyclicality,

since output changes largely drive utilization variations.

      The estimated markup indexes implied by my modal are presented in Table

2 in terms of annual averages, and in Appendix Table 2A in their full form.

As found by Hall, significant markups do appear to exist, although the

estimates of the markups are intuitively more reasonable than those based on

the simpler framework of the Hall studies.21 The year-to-year variations are

also important; although the standard deviations are not large (especially

relative to mean markups), clear tendencies do emerge.

      A secular increase in markups over time is evident, although significant

year-to-year variations occur. This tendency is more clearly apparent from

the year-to-year changes appearing in Table 2A than from the overall averages.

although it is not as pervasive as found in studies such as in Morrison

[l989a,bJ. The only industries experiencing a clear downward trend in markups

are AP, LW, PC and PM; this is consistent with intuition given the




      should be noted that the impacts of labor hoarding, adjustment costs
 and other similar characteristics that might affect productivity growth are
 reflected in these estimates as well as those for the cost elasticity,
 discussed in further detail in Section Vd. below.

21This is particularly true for the CM, P0, PC and PP industries, for which
the Hall estimates are clear outliers (with markup ratios of 20.112, 5.291,
-139.478 and 14.263, respectively). The estimates here are also comparable
to those found using different data in Morrison (1989) where pooled total
manufacturing data for the U.S. • Canada and Japan were used for estimation,
and in Morrison (1989aJ which is based on data for Canadian manufacturing
industries.

intensifying international competition in the apparel, lumber and primary

metals markets, and the rise in costs of crude materials in the petroleum

refining industry which has provided downward pressures on profit margins.

Some other industries facing increasing international competition such as CL

and PM (and to a lesser extent TX and TQ) appear from the averages to be quite

constant. Interestingly, markups in high-technology industries such as CM,

EL, MC and IN all increased for 1960-73 to 1973-86.

      In general, markups appear to decline during recessions and in that

sense seem procyclical. For example for all industries the 1973 and 1979 OPEC

shocks are reflected in a downturn in the markup ratio. However, from

correlations of the markup with the economic measure of-capacity utilization,

     the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of countercyclicality of markups.

The correlations of the reported markups with CU (and the full cost

elasticity y) are negative throughout except for the primary metals industry

(PM),22 and are all statistically significant at the one percent level. For

total manufacturing (MA), for example, the correlation23 is -0.419 with a

standard error of .088 The correlations with the published FR3 capacity

utilization for manufacturing are somewhat more ambiguous, though; although

the correlations are generally negative, they tend to be very small and

largely insignificant.




 22The positive correlation of    and capacity utilization was also found for
 Canada in Morrison (l989aJ. -In the Canadian study P0 (and to a lesser
 extent TQ) were also found to be procyclical. The evidence of
 countercyclicality in nondurable manufacturing in the U.S. found here is
 largely dependent on the correlation for TO which is a large proportion of
 total nondurabl. manufacturing; the different result is likely the result of
 a quite different composition of this industry in Canada. In addition.

 23These computations were carried out similarly to Hall. using a simple
 regression of the markup index en the capacity utilization index and a
 constant, and the significance assessed in terms of the t-statisvic on the
 slope coefficient.

      Correlations of markups with defense spending were often positive,

suggesting indicating that expansion due to increased government expenditures

has a different effect on markup behavior than a general increase in output.

Correlations of markups with the world oil price variable, however, weakly

support the conclusion of countercyclical markups since increases in this

variable tend to be closely associated with recessions; the correlations were

primarily positive but often insignificant

      Countercycality of markups has a well defined impact on productivity

growth patterns through the error bias cpy•jMj(xj/xj). Since EMyt_ect

  ytpyZjMj(Xj/Xj), and an increase (in absolute value) in Epy implies a

larger markup, an upward trend in the markup will compensate to some extent

for a downward trend in the productivity growth rate (as long as inputs in

general are increasing). Since this occurs for both secular and cyclical

markup fluctuations, countercyclical markups imply that cost-based measures of

productivity growth reveal higher levels and less cyclicality of productivity

growth.

      This correction for demand characteristics can, however, be misleading

if cost characteristics such as scale economies exist that should also be

accommodated in the measures, particularly given the offsetting cyclical

patterns of the indicators. Additional insights about fluctuations in

traditionally measured productivity growth can therefore be obtained by

considering the     impact   of explicitly relaxing the assumptions of constant

returns   to   scale and instantaneous adjustment - -   incorporating   fixity.



Vd. The Cost Elasticity, s, and its Components

      The cost elasticity s reflects a combination of both short and long

run fixity, captured as downward sloping short- or long-run average cost

curves. This fixity was recognized in the Hall studies as a potential
                                          Page 28

determinant of cyclical swings in measured productivity growth, but was

developed in the context of long run returns to scale and the effect measured

as a constant parameter. Using my model the effects of short run fixity

(capacity utilization) or long run returns to scale (scale economies) may

independently be distinguished, and the varying cyclical behavior of such

measures incorporated. This distinction is particularly important for

providing an assessment of Hall's contention that markups coexist with normal

profits owing to excess capacity.

         In particular, capacity utilization, which is one component of Ey,               is
by definition procyclical. Similarly, if scale economies exist, output

expansion from upward swings in the cycle cause average Cost declines, so this

component    of       will   also tend to be procyclical. This procyclicality

suggests that increased profitability from countercyclical markups tends to be

offset    by excess capacity and the existence of scale economies; the Hall
correction to change      revenu,   to cost shares will     therefore   affect measured

productivity      growth less than if only markups were taken into account. The
remaining effect of error bias corrections to accomodate the deviation of
from    one is not obvious a priori since the       bias depends not only on the
measure of s, but also on the relative growth rates               of output and quasi-

fixed    inputs. However, in general procyclical variations in                 will result

in    corrections incorporating           to smooth the productivity growth measure,
since this procyclicality implies greater output than input changes.
        The measured    cost elasticity £     is presented    in terms   of   annual
averages    in   the second panel of Table 2, and in full index form in Appendix

Table    3A. These measures suggest short and        long   run   scale economies exist and

are   quite substantial in a numb.r     of   industries. Scale economies also appear
to be increasing, especially in industries which tend to be more capital

intensive and have experienced productivity growth stagnation, such as PA, CM,

and PM.

      One interesting exception to this is the MC industry, which, as

mentioned above, includes the computer manufacturing sector. Although

productivity growth in this industry has been strong and actually increasing,

scale economies have also risen substantially. Note also that this industry

experienced one of the largest jumps in markups during this period, as did CM,

where scale economies also expanded. This is in sharp contrast to PM, where a

(more modest) increase in scale economies occurred along with a decline in

markups. This suggests declining profitability as well as productivity

performance, due perhaps to a decline in relative efficiency and increased

international competition. To a lesser extent this is true also for A?.

      The procyclicality of the y measure is evident from the more complete

indexes in Table 3A, where, for example, declines are evident for most

industries in the downturns of 1969-70, 1974-75 and 1982-83. To a large

extent cyclical movements in     are driven by utilization fluctuations, since

potential scale economies appear to be increasing over time rather smoothly.

In turn, the capacity utilization patterns appearing in the CU indexes result

primarily from changes in capital utilization, although labor hoarding24, and

thus procyclicality from changes in work effort, are also evident from

fluctuations in the shadow value of labor.

     More specifically, the independent effects of short and long run

fixities can be distinguished from the equality               The two

components of y are presented as annual averages in Table 3, and graphically

for total manufacturing in Figure la. The CU numbers in Table 3 show that




 24This could be interpreted as reflecting changes in work effort, which will
 tend to be procyclical, as mentioned by Hall.

capacity utilization has been declining in every industry but PC and LW.25

They also suggest excess capacity virtually everywhere, although

overutilization of capacity appears in the CM industry throughout the time

period, and in the early years for the textile industry.26 The excess

capacity has been driven primarily, especially in the post-1973 period, by a

low shadow value of capital relative to its market price; in most industries a

decline in the ZK/PK ratio and an increase in ZilPL has occurred post-1973

Note also that the levels of CUc are less than .9 in the PP, RB, LW, FN, CL

and PM industries, indicating that the cost consequences of short-run excess

capacity are often greater than lOZ.

      The bottom panel of Table 3 indicates, however, that scale economies

seem to be driving the evidence of a low and declining y even more than CU.

In particular, long run returns to scale (the inverse of       are very

substantial and increasing, especially in the nondurable industries such as

TX, AP, PA and CM. Excess capacity therefore exists even in the long run.

Precisely why long-run scale economies are increasing over time in all

industries except CL and FM is a fascinating topic for further research.

        does not explicitly include the impact of adjustment costs, but only
 of the fixity itself. The following adaptation of the productivity growth
 measure also ignores this modification. This was simply neglected for the
 sake of brevity, however; as in Morrison (l989bJ the direct adaptation for
 adjustment costs has a negligible effect on the results.
 26This is in contrast to indexes measured by B.rndt md Morrison [1981] and
 others for total manufacturing in the U.S. This likely arises because of
 the explicit recognition of fixity arising from both capital and labor
 stocks (from adjustment costs), a more complete specification of inputs, and
 incorporation of nonatatic expectations through the estimation process.
 This last point is elaborated in Morrison (1985].

 in Table 4 and Figure lb. ADJ tends to be close to one, suggesting that

 revenues approximately equal economic costs, and that economic profits are

 therefore roughly zero on average.

      Although short     rw profits or losses   are possible        in this model, profit-

maximizing markup   behavior   does not result in high     profitability         since its

countercyclical pattern is accomaodated by procyclicality of the output-cost

elasticity.    Thus the Hall assertion   concerning     the   relationship between
                                       Page 32

markups and capacity utilization, which implies monopolistically competitive

markets are predominant in the U.S., is not only possible theoretically but is

borne Out empirically by my results. Essentially, managers' pricing responses

balance the technical and market economic fluctuations encountered, but do not

allow for excess profitability on average.

      The annual average ADJ measures presented in Table 4 suggest that this

balancing act has increasingly resulted in revenues falling short of covering

all costs of production, including appropriate returns to capital, in U.S.

manufacturing industries.27 Although for total manufacturing normal profits

were approximated on average for the 1960 to 1986 period, a decline in

profitability in the post-1973 period is evident for all industries except

pc.28 In particular, although before 1973 only six industries had negative

economic profits, post-1973 the number of such industries more than doubled to

thirteen. Only four industries experienced a positive economic profit post-

1973 (FO, PP, CM and PC), with TO, and PC being the most profitable.

      It is interesting to conjecture that these nondurable manufacturing

industries were perhaps subject to less intense competition than most of the

other industries during this period of international expansion of markets.

Other industries, even the MC industry which performed better than other

durable industries but still fell short of normal profits by lX on average,

tended to be more internationally competitive as well as more energy and

capital intensive.

      Overall, these   numbers are   dramatic confirmation of much recent

discussion   on the apparent declines in competitiveness of U.S. durable goods

and textiles industries. It should be noted, however, that the post-1973




 27P.ecall that the interest rate used in the cx ante opportunity cost of
 gPital is the Moody Baa bond yield.
   Note that realized capital gains on equipment and structural assets are
 not included in the opportunity cost of capital measure here. These gains
 could possibly add to the profitability implied here.
                                     Page 33

 decline in profitability was reversing toward the end of my sample; more

 complete indexes show increasing profitability after 1982, with positive

 economic profits by the end of the sample for the MC industry.

       Little variation of the ADJ factor is apparent, but there is a clear

downward trend and some procyclicality in the ratio of returns to costs. This

is evident from Figure lb. which illustrates that y has a relatively greater

impact on AN than the markup ratio; markups are not keeping pace with changes

in technical factors and competition, so AN is declining. This suggests some

pattern in the difference between cost and revenue shares.      Although the Hall

correction to measure input shares in terms of costs instead of revenues will

have little impact, since AN closely approximates one, a measure based on

Cost shares will tend to show a somewhat smaller decline in productivity

growth over time,

      It appears, therefore, that the greatest explanatory clout for

productivity growth fluctuations arise from error bias corrections. This

seems to be the case from my measures; true technical change is smaller and

less volatile than usually measured because of erroneous assumptions about

returns to scale and fixity imbedded in the measurement process. I will now

turn to this final result.



Vf. The Corrected Technical Change Measure

      Productivity growth indexes resulting from adapting standard measures

for short and long rm fixity are presented in Table 5. Note that these

measures implicitly already incorporate adjustments for markups, since they

are based on cost-side computations. The first panel of Table 5 includes the

impacts of technical change, returns to scale and utilization

(eTyt_(TCt/ICY_ETCt/(LCy.CU) and therefore represents a primal-side measure

of total productivity growth with error biases removed and the influence of

markups omitted. The second panel isolates the impact of technical change

(eTct), provided by a decomposition of the full measure.

        A comparison of the indexes in Tables 1 and 5 indicate that correcting

for error biases resulting from markups and input fixity is quantitatively

important. In general productivity growth appears lover than reflected in the

traditional measure for the 1960-73 period, but often is higher after 1973.

Thus, the difference between the pre- and post-1973 periods is substantially

reduced. For example, for total manufacturing, unadjusted growth rates for

1960-73 and 1973-86 are 1.610 and 0.489, while corresponding fixity-adjusted

values are 0.973 and 0.528. This reflects less of a productivity growth

slowdown than is generally perceived, and thereby suggests a partial

 explanation" of the usually measured slowdown. The entries in Table 5 also

suggest that true efficiency growth in some industries, especially in PP, CM,

PC, PM and IN, has been very limited even from the early years of the sample.

        A further decline in the apparent growth of technical change, especially

for earlier years, appears when the impacts of scale economies are removed.

This can be seen by comparing the top and bottom panels of Table 5. However,

in some industries, notably CL, PM and FN, standard productivity growth

measures understate technical change. It is also the case that indications of

negative productivity growth are attenuated with this adjustment; some of the

declines attributed to productivity change therefore appear to be due to

diminished    output demand    and therefore the potential to take advantage of

scale   economies.
        In   total,   corrections to standard productivity growth measures tend to
somewhat reduce secular and cyclical fluctuations in productivity growth
measures. This tendency        to   "smooth" the productivity growth measure is
corroborated by an      examination   of the year-to-year fluctuations reported in
Appendix Table 4A, and the graph of ey (traditionally measured), Tct and
                                       Page 35

cTy for total manufacturing in Figure lc. The smoothing of fluctuations is

evident even though standard deviations for the total productivity growth

measure eTy increase for some industries relative to the standard primal

measure. It is also consistent with a reduced statistical significance found

to correlations of these productivity residuals with the capacity utilization,

world oil price and defense spending indexes (except for the MC industry).

      In summary, the Hall-inspired correction of           for markups by adapting

revenue into cost shares does not significantly affect the evidence of

productivity growth, because the offsetting impacts of markups and utilization

and scale imply approximate equivalence of cost and revenue shares. However,

corrections of productivity growth measures for error biases due to erroneous

assumptions about returns to scale and fixity do provide insights into the

"explanations" of productivity growth fluctuations.



VI. Concludina Remarks

      The issues addressed in this paper about the determinants of

productivity growth fluctuations •-     in particular   the effects of markups and

fixities •-   are based on a somewhat different perspective than recent studies
such as those by Robert Hall. The analysis here is developed in terms of a

full structural model allowing formalization and measurement of the

relationships among productivity growth, profit-maximizing markup behavior,

capacity utilization and scale economies. Such a framework permits

consideration of whether these cost and revenue components, usually ignored in

productivity growth analysis, are in some sense "responsible" for cyclical

fluctuations and secular downturns in productivity growth.

      The first "cause" evaluated is the markup     of   price over marginal cost.

Markup   indexes   embodying a cyclical component have been constructed for a

number   of U.S.   manufacturing sectors. The patterns of these profit-maximizing
                                        Page 36

markups tended to reveal increases in markups over time and in cyclical

downturns -• markups appear to be countercyclical. As a result, the

traditional primal productivity growth measure, developed in terms of revenue

shares and thus implicitly based on the assumption of perfect competition,

exacerbates declines over time and in recessionary periods. Thus, adaptation

of the measure to be in terms of Cost shares provides some "explanatory power

for productivity performance variation, in terms of smoothing observed

fluctuations.

         However, fixities in both the short and long run also have an impact          on
observed   economic performance. Within my model, short run fixities are

represented in terms of changes in capacity utilization, and          long   run

"fixities" are reflected as scale economies. Although           capacity   utilization is

by definition procyclical, I find it also appears to have an upward secular

trend. On the other hand, the capability of taking advantage of scale

economies seems to be increasing over time. This is consistent with

intuition, for in order to obtain normal      economic profits, the existence of
increasing excess capacity and scale economies must        be   offset by increasing

markups. My empirical results confirm this counteracting effect in U.S.

manufacturing industries; I find that economic profits on average have been

zero, but have   exhibited   a downward trend over time.

      Together, these forces tend to offset the smoothing effect of adjusting

primal   productivity growth measures   for markups   by measuring coat instead of
revenue shares. However,     incorporating   these characteristics still
contributes   in an important  way to "explaining" fluctuations in productivity
growth   in terms of error biases. Corrections of erroneous assumptions made in
traditional computations have a significant smoothing impact on observed
trends in productivity growth and technical change.
                                    Page 31

     The framework used here for productivity growth measurement is based on

a consistent treatment of interactions among productivity growth, markups and

short and long run fixities, and thereby facilitates detailed analyses of

economic performance and fluctuations. The conjectures of Robert Hall which

form the motivation for this study are largely confirmed, in the sense that

markups are significant, and tend to be counteracted by excess capacity and

returns to scale, resulting in approximately normal   profits.   However, the

full structural framework of this paper is necessary for assessing empirically

the validity of such conjectures; in the Hall model restrictive assumptions

preclude such an analysis.
