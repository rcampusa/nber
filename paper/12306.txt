The European Union and the United States operate different variants of market capitalism. The EU
model uses social dialogue institutions to help determine economic outcomes, particularly in the
labor market, whereas the US relies more on market forces. The theory of competitive markets
provides a powerful framework for analyzing market driven economies and for assessing the
conditions under which unfettered markets yield desirable outcomes. But there is no comparable
framework for analyzing institution driven economies. This paper argues that models of efficient
bargaining/the Coase Theorem offer the best framework for analyzing social dialogue economies and
for identifying policies and institutional reforms to improve their functioning.

        “Collective bargaining and social dialogue were designed into the European
project from the very beginning.” John Monks, European Trade Unions Congress
Secretary, May 2004

       The European Union and the United States operate different variants of market

capitalism. Both systems base economic transactions on private property and rule of law.

Both have open economies with sound monetary and macro-economic policies. Where

the EU and US differ is in the role of institutions in affecting outcomes, particularly in

the labor market.

       The EU relies on collective bargaining between employer associations and trade

unions to determine wages and employment and on social dialogue between the “social

partners” of labor and capital, often working in concert with government, to choose

social and economic policies. The US relies on firms and individual workers to determine

employment and wages in competitive markets. The EU has high taxes that provide a

strong social safety net for workers. The US has lower taxes and a weak safety net for

workers. The differences are sufficiently large to have generated a “war of the models”

about how best to organize a market economy (Freeman, 1998).

       From the 1960s through the 1970s oil shock and productivity slowdown, the rapid

growth and low unemployment of Western European economies led some analysts to

generalize that neo-corporatist centralized bargaining wage systems work better than

more market based systems (Bruno and Sachs, 1984). In the 1980s Japan’s rapid

economic growth and export success directed attention at the virtues of Japanese

institutions. During his visit to Harvard in 1986/7 Enzio Tarantelli and I debated whether

the Japanese economy was more aligned to the EU institution-affected system than to
                                                                                                        4
more market-driven US.1 But Japan went into a bad economic decade while US

performance improved. From the 1990s through the mid 2000s, the rapid growth and low

unemployment in the US shifted sentiment in favor of more market driven variants of

capitalist economies.2

        Regardless of whether more market-driven or institution influenced economies do

better in a given period of time, there is generally a wide range of economic outcomes

within each group. In the 1990s the US performed well in productivity and employment

but Canada, with much the same economic system, had an horrific economic record.

From the 1990s through the mid 2000s several smaller EU economies --Ireland,

Denmark, Austria, and to some extent the Netherlands -- performed better than Germany

and France, among others. Supporters of the EU system often cite the smaller successes

as evidence that social dialogue economies can deliver economic efficiency as well as

economic security and desirable distributions of income.

        When market economies run into trouble, the natural response of economists has

traditionally been to seek out imperfections in the market and to suggest ways to

eliminate those imperfections. This response builds on the powerful framework that

economic theory provides for analyzing real market economies. The model of a perfectly

functioning competitive system gives economists and policy-makers a benchmark for

measuring real world divergences from the ideal and directs attention at reforms designed

to bring the real world closer to the competitive ideal.

    1
      The modest unionization rates, company level unions, use of bonuses related to profits, and
    limited political role of unions suggested that Japan was closer to the US than to the EU system.
    But the Shunto offensive, coordination of wage settlements, lifetime employment, lead bank
    system, industrial concentration, and protection of small firms in the service sector suggested
    that Japan was closer to the EU than to the US.
    2
      For instance, in 2004, 4.9% of the German labor force had been unemployed for over a year,
                                                                                              5
       When EU economies have gotten into trouble, the economists’ response is often

the same: to identify market imperfections and seek ways to eliminate them. But this

seems less appropriate in a social dialogue economy than in a market-dominated

economy. Why not seek out imperfections in the social dialogue institutions and search

for ways to improve institutional interventions? One reason why economists do not

pursue this approach is that we lack a well-specified model of the ideal institution driven

economy to benchmark real world divergences from the ideal.

       In the world of ideas and in policy discourse the absence of a social dialogue

model creates an uneven playing field for assessing the two capitalist models and

improving their performances.

        EU social dialogue model, where art thou?

       This paper begins the search for such a model. Section I documents the

differences between the EU’s social dialogue and collective bargaining system and the

US’s market driven economy. Section II presents my principal theme: that efficient

bargaining models and the Coase theorem offer the best framework for developing the

missing social dialogue model. Section III assesses evidence on efficient bargaining

from laboratory experiments. Section IV considers the implications from game theory

analyses of bargaining for developing an efficient social dialogue system. There is a

short conclusion.

I The Two Economic Systems

       Exhibit 1 gives a capsule summary of the differences between the EU and US

economic systems. The exhibit shows that the EU relies on collective bargaining to set


    compared to 0.7% of the US labor force. OECD, Employment Outlook, 2005, table A and G
                                                                                                      6
wages and working conditions to a far greater extent than does the US. In the EU 77

percent of workers3 were covered by agreements in 2000, many through mandatory

extension of contracts to firms outside the bargaining group. In the US bargaining covers

only 13 percent of workers, and most collective bargaining contracts are at the firm level.

Although EU centralized bargaining allows for “wages drift” (by which firms deviate

from the agreement due to their particular circumstances), and although most EU

countries have devolved some bargaining to firms or plants, the difference in reliance on

institutions in wage-setting with the US remains stark. The 2003 Global Competitiveness

Report gave the US the 3rd highest rank in terms of having wages set by the company vs

by institutions and while the median ranking for EU countries was 68 out of 80 countries

in the listing (World Economic Forum, 2003, table 10.19).

         The US and EU also differ greatly in the rules that govern “ownership” of jobs.

The US has employment at will, which allows firms to lay off or fire workers at their

discretion with no legally mandated severance pay. During a strike, the employer can

replace strikers and need not re-employ them after the dispute. By contrast, EU

employment protection legislation gives some ownership of jobs to workers. The

OECD’s index of employment protection legislation, which gives higher scores to

countries with greater protection, gave the US a score of 0.7 compared to a score of 2.3

for EU countries in 2003.4 Strikers in the EU have a right to return to their job after a

labor dispute.

          In the product market the US has fewer regulations governing business activity

and makes it easier to form and end businesses than the EU. It takes 64 days to form a

business in the EU compared to 7 days in the US. The OECD index of regulations,

which codes countries from 0 to 2 in three different areas of regulations, gave the US in

2003 a 1 in product market regulations, 1.1 in administrative regulations, and 1.3 in

economic regulations compared to 1.4, 1.5, and 2.0 in these three areas for the EU.5

          Finally, the US has a more limited welfare state than EU countries. In the US the

primary source of economic security is working; unemployment benefits are modest and

of limited duration; and income support for single parent families is limited. The US

offers health care insurance through employers or private purchase; government

provision is limited to the elderly and poor. While state and local governments funds

primary and secondary education, a large proportion of higher education is paid by

students and their families and by private donations.

           By contrast, the welfare state is the EU’s primary source of economic security.

All EU countries offer high replacement rates for unemployed persons for long periods.

All have some form of national health insurance. Many provide housing assistance for

workers who lose their job and offer other benefits so that loss of a job does not devastate

their living standards. In addition to providing free primary and secondary education, the

EU provides low tuition higher education through state support of universities.

          To fund the wider role of government in 2004 governments in the EU received

48% of GDP compared to the US government receipts of 32% of GDP6.

Social dialogue vs market lobbying

            The EU uses social dialogue institutions to bring the voices of business and

labor into social and economic policy-making. Most EU countries encourage dialogue at

workplaces through mandated works councils. Depending on the country, from 25% to

50% of workers are represented by elected works councils, and almost all workers in

middle to large establishments have the option to establish a council at their workplace.

The EU social charter requires EU-level councils for larger firms.

           By contrast, US labor law discourages firms from setting up systems of dialogue

with workers outside of collective bargaining. Section 8a of the US’s Labor-

Management Relations Act forbids firms from establishing non-union systems of

collective representation for fear that companies will create company-dominated

organizations to avoid genuine worker organizations. Many firms have employee

involvement committees but these committees are legally allowed to deal only with

issues that concern the firm such as productivity rather than with worker concerns such as

pay, benefits or working conditions.

           At the national level, the EU relies on social dialogue committees to ascertain the

views of labor and management on diverse issues. The US relies on a very different

mechanism for interest groups to contribute to national policy-making – lobbying in

which the groups that fund political campaigns meet with legislators to argue for their

views.

           Exhibit 2 contrasts the EU social dialogue system with the US lobbying system.

The upper panel gives the EU’s own description of its system, as reported at the 2005 EU

social dialogue summit. While the description focuses on dialogue at the EU level, it

notes that “ the European social dialogue complements the national practices of social

dialogue, which exist in most Member States”. Indeed, it is at the national level where

social partnership arrangements are particularly important and where collective

bargaining occurs. When an EU government deviates from the consultative model, as the

De Villepin government did in France in 2006 when it enacted a new youth labor law

without consultation, it risks enraging the groups that were not consulted – in this case,

students and unions, whose protests forced the government to withdraw the law.

       The lower panel describes the US lobbying system. It is a market-based system

built on the US mode of funding political campaigns through private contributions.

Lobbyists buy access to candidates through their contributions and use that access to

present their case for/against legislation in private closed-door meetings. The opinion

polls summarized in the exhibit show that in the 1990s-2000s the most Americans

believed that political lobbyists had too much power and bribed members of Congress

regularly, and that as a result most citizens were concerned about the corruption this

engendered in Washington.

       There is an extensive social science literature on lobbying activities and on the

impact of campaign contributions on legislator’s decision, but no comparable analysis of

the operation of social dialogue committees.

        EU social dialogue model, where art thou?

II. The Social Dialogue Model and Efficient Bargaining

       The main theme of this paper is that the theory of efficient bargaining and Coase

Theorem provide the best framework for answering the “where art thou?” question.

       The notion of efficient bargaining has a distinguished pedigree in economics. In
                                                                                               10
chapter 7 of the Theory of Wages (first edition, 1932), John Hicks argued that

collective bargaining should produce agreement rather than impasse in most situations.

After all, most strikes lower the joint output of capital and labor and thus make no

rational sense. He asserted that “the majority of actual strikes are doubtless the result of

faulty negotiation” (Hicks, 146). Efficient bargaining between employers and unions

ought to yield the same patterns of outcomes that the efficient market hypothesis predicts

for financial markets: randomness. Labor specialists should be no more able to predict

strikes from public information than financial specialists can predict financial returns

from such information.

        In 1946 Wassily Leontief applied the efficient bargaining model to the

“guaranteed annual wage” that the US United Automobile Workers negotiated with

General Motors. In this contract the Automobile Workers insisted that GM pay for at

least a minimal number of hours of work from the existing work force. Leontief

interpreted this as bargaining over employment as well as wages and pointed out that

through such a strategy the union could shift distribution to labor while maintaining the

presumably efficient pre-union wage employment and output.

       In 1986 Mancur Olson argued that “all-encompassing” unions – those that

represent all workers – should internalize the externalities associated with inefficient

bargains and produce more efficient outcomes than unions that represent only some

workers in a country. In 1988 Lars Calmfors and John Driffill further developed the

notion that centralized or coordinated bargaining yields outcomes comparable to

competitive markets while industry level bargaining yields less efficient outcomes.

       But the most influential analysis of efficient bargaining lies outside of labor
                                                                                                       11
economics. This is the Coase theorem on property rights and externalities, which has

generated a huge literature in law and economics (Coase, 1960). The theorem holds that,

absent transactions costs, the clear allocation property rights/decision-making power

suffices to assure efficient outcomes. The reason is that, regardless of who owns what,

economic agents should bargain to the most efficient point of production and then divide

the maximum output. They ought to leave no money on the table. The prediction that

efficiency depends solely on clear property rights suggests that economies with

egalitarian rules governing distribution can be as efficient with more unequal income

distributions.7

But real world bargaining is not efficient

       “Using the Coase theorem as the starting point for the analysis of EU economies
is more Chicago than Chicago. Bargainers often do not reach efficient solutions.” (Ed
Lazear, commenting on the theme of this essay)

        The criticism is right. There are many cases of real world bargaining that falls

short of efficient agreements. In labor economics, the most widely studied failure of

efficient bargaining is in strike behavior. In contrast to Hicks’ prediction that strikes

should have no predictable pattern across time or space, strikes are pro-cyclical, occur

frequently in some sectors and firms and not in others, are more common in some

countries than in others, and occur in narrow time periods. Striking is less common in

sectors where the costs to labor and capital are largest but occurs sometimes even when

both sides end up as big losers. Game theory, models of asymmetric information,

detailed models of negotiations – whatever economists have thrown at the problem –

7
  Medema and Zerbe (1999, p 838) note that some versions of the Coase theorem add a stronger claim: that
the final allocation of resources will itself be invariant to the assignment of property rights. Since the
redistributions associated with social dialogue economies are highly likely to affect the allocation of
                                                                                           12
have failed to put a rational efficient market interpretation onto the strike data.

         Labor economists have also examined the prediction that efficient union-

management negotiations should alter pay but maintain employment and output. Given

that most collective contracts have some form of “management rights” clause that

reserves control over hiring to the firm, the claim that the union determines employment

seems on the face of it unrealistic. In the few cases where unions have negotiated

employment as well as pay, the outcome has often been featherbedding rather than

efficient work arrangements (for example, musicians sitting in a studio with recorded

music in the early days of radio). Since US unions raise compensation and unionized

firms/sectors/workplaces tend to have lower employment growth than their non-union

counterparts, most economists reject the notion that collective bargaining produces

employment off the demand curve in an efficient way.

         In a similar vein, studies of productivity among sectors and firms find that

competitive pressures can induce producers to raise productivity so greatly that they

almost certainly had previously unexploited opportunities to increase efficiency – what

Leibenstein (1966) called X-efficiency. Galdon-Sanchez and Schmitz (2002) have

documented a particularly striking example of this in the recovery of US and Canadian

iron ore producers from the collapse of steel production in their home markets in the

1980s. The iron ore producers raised their productivity massively compared to otherwise

comparable iron ore producers operating in markets that had little or no increase in

competitive pressures. The intensified competitive pressure led the firms to reform work

and staffing rules that they could readily have done before they faced great competitive


resources as well as the distribution, I deal solely with the efficiency proposition.

pressures.

Empirical studies of the Coase Theorem

       Law and economics analyses of the Coase theorem in diverse other settings also

give a mixed picture of its real world applicability. Steven Medema and Richard Zerbe

(1999) reviewed studies of the effect on agricultural production of the property right to

control animal trespassing on farmlands. Two studies found efficient outcomes but both

attributed the outcomes to social pressures/norms to keep animals off farm lands rather

than to efficient bargaining between farmers and ranchers. The third study rejected the

efficiency outcome. In 1989 John Donohue examined the 1980s Illinois employment

experiment, which paid bonuses to workers or to firms to encourage the unemployed to

find employment quickly from the perspective of the theorem. One variant of the

experiment paid the bonuses to unemployed workers who found a new job quickly.

Another variant paid the bonuses to the firms for hiring unemployed workers quickly.

The Coase Theorem predicts that the property right to the bonus ought not affect the

employment outcome. But the payments to workers led to greater employment and

bonus receipt than did the payments to firms. Whether the Coase theorem failed because

transactions costs were higher than the experiment envisaged as some critics of

Donohue’s work argued (see Medema and Zerba, 869-871), or because of some other

form of non-optimizing behavior, the important conclusion is that in this real world

example, the allocation of property rights affected efficiency.

       Studies of divorce laws, where the state changes the law from requiring both sides

to agree to a divorce (so that the side most eager for the divorce would pay more to the

other side to accept it) to allowing one side to insist upon the divorce, have also found the
                                                                                           14
Coase Theorem wanting. Peters (1992) reported that changes in divorce laws from

mutual to unilateral divorce had effects consistent with the theorem: a change in the

division of family assets but no change in the frequency of divorce. But ensuing work,

summarized in Allen (2006), has found that rates of divorce rise when the law moves

from mutual divorce to unilateral divorce, contrary to efficient bargaining. Wolfers’

(2006) analysis offers further evidence and analysis of the problems with the Coase

Theorem in this setting.

       The most widely studied Coase theorem prediction relevant to EU labor problems

relates to employment protection laws (EPL). The Coase theorem predicts that EPL will

not affect aggregate outcomes but will alter the distribution of income. Many policy

analysts dismiss the prediction and argue that weaker EPL laws would reduce

unemployment, but empirical analyses find no such consistent effect. The OECD (2004)

review of studies of EPL concluded that “the numerous empirical studies of this issue

lead to conflicting results, and (notes further that) moreover their robustness has been

questioned.” Baker et al’s (2005) analysis showing that empirical results vary greatly

with modest variation in the models, countries, time period, and measures used to assess

the impact of EPL is more consistent with EPL having no effect on the volume of

employment or unemployment than with the belief that it has effects.

       This does not mean the EPL does not impact labor market outcomes. Stronger

EPL regulations are associated with lower flows of labor from employment into

unemployment, which benefits older workers, and with lower flows from unemployment

to employment, which generally harms younger workers and other new entrants to the job

market (OECD, 2004). What is important is that the effects are on the distribution of
                                                                                                       15
employment rather or more than on the volume of employment or unemployment,

consistent with the Coase theorem.

        Still, the EPL studies aside, the bulk of empirical work in labor and in law and

economics indicates that the efficient bargaining model does not fit reality well. Does this

make Coase theorem style thinking irrelevant for assessing social dialogue economic

systems?

        I think not. Empirical analyses of market driven economies show that real

markets often fall short of 100% efficiency, but the competitive model still provides a

valuable framework for analysing market performance. In finance the efficient market

hypothesis is a useful first approximation and benchmark, even though researchers have

uncovered numerous empirical regularities that reject the model. By analogy, the efficient

bargaining/Coase theorem model can still be a valuable ideal for illuminating social

dialogue systems even though the world does not evince efficient bargaining as a general

rule.

III. Laboratory experiments and behavioral economics

        Another way to judge the relevance of efficient bargaining models to real

situations is through laboratory experiments. The bulk of experiments in which efficient

production requires cooperation among people – the prisoner’s dilemma8; public goods

games9– shows that people attain efficient or near efficient solutions in many cases even

without formal side agreements. For example, tit for tat behavior tends to dominate



8
  The prisoner’s dilemma is the most widely studied cooperation game. Efficient production requires that
the two participants choose to cooperate even though there is an incentive to defect. See Wikipedia
9
  In public goods games subjects invest money in a public pot whose value increases, often with higher
returns the greater the amount invested, and keep the money they did not invest in the pot plus an even
share of the money in the pot. See Wikipedia
                                                                                           16
prisoner’s dilemma games, producing efficient outcomes. And while participants in

public goods games rarely contribute 100% to the pot, they almost never contribute the

0% that theory predicts. If people approach efficient solutions without side agreements,

perhaps a modicum of bargaining would bring them even closer.

       The experiments on the Coase theorem by Elizabeth Hoffman and Matthew

Spitzer highlight the strength and weakness of the theorem. Their experiments assigned a

number to each of two participants, one of which could be cashed in for real money. A

coin toss gave the property right/power to determine which number gets cashed in to one

of participants. Without bargaining the person who won the toss would presumably select

their number for that is the most that they can get. They should do this even if the second

party has a larger number, producing a socially inefficient outcome from the perspective

of the pair. But bargaining ought to yield the efficient outcomes. The person with the

power to determine which number cashes in ought to pick the highest number subject to a

side arrangement in which they obtain more money than they could earn from cashing in

their own number (arguably, the entire reward less some minimal payment to the second

party, who would otherwise get nothing).

       Hoffman and Spitzer found that over 90% of the sets of bargainers brought the

higher number to the experimenter for an efficient allocation. But the bargainers

distributed the rewards in a manner inconsistent with rational bargaining. They tended to

divide the money equally even though that meant that the party with the property right

majority of pairs chose the joint maximum but only 60% bargained for more than they

would have gotten by selecting their own number.

       In sum, these experiments yielded efficient outcomes, but they also found that

participants got to the efficient outcome through decision processes far from the self-

interested economic rationality that underlie the Coase Theorem.

       Stewart Schwab’s (1988) experiment used a more complicated bargaining design

that failed to produce efficient solutions. In Schwab’s experiment students were divided

into union and management teams that bargained over 3 items: wages, vacation days --

which benefited workers more than they cost management up to15 days but which after

15 days cost management more than their worth to workers, and a contract clause that

allowed the firm to move work from the union plant to a non-union plant. In half of the

experiments, the work clause produced more value to the management team than to the

union team. In the other half, keeping the clause out of the contract meant more to the

union. A fully efficient bargain required that the parties agree to 15 days of vacation and

adopt the transfer clause in the first variant and reject the clause in the second variant.

The wage ($1 benefit to workers = $1 cost of the firm) gave the parties an easily

transferable way to redistribute output from the optimal solution. But Schwab found that

“neither item was bargained to a fully efficient result”(p 251). The contracts produced an

average of 11 days of vacation pay and the optimal solution for the transfer clause in

2/3rds of the cases. The bargaining left money on the table.

       Surprisingly, even though bargainers did not reach optimal efficiency, the

experiment validated the prediction of the Coase theorem that changes in property rights

do not affect allocation. In one variant of the experiment the firm had the initial property
                                                                                               18
right to transfer the work. In another variant the union had the initial right to forbid the

transfer. The two property rights regimes produced contracts with similar outcomes

(approximately 2/3rds efficient) while giving a greater share of the joint output to the

party with the property right.

       Thus, like the “real world” assessments, laboratory experiments give a mixed

picture of Coase theorem/efficient bargaining. Bargaining pairs sometimes reach

efficiency and sometimes not. Distributive outcomes are sometimes consistent with the

model and sometimes not. These findings raise what is arguably the critical stumbling

block for the theme of this essay: whether actual behavior diverges so much from rational

optimizing as to invalidate the use of efficient bargaining/Coase Theorem models as

benchmarks for analyzing EU social dialogue economies.

behavioral economics and efficient bargaining

       A large growing body of evidence from psychology and behavioral economics

shows that people make decisions in ways that deviate substantially from the rational

optimization that economists have historically assumed. Some of these forms of non-

rational optimizing behavior make attainment of efficient outcomes more likely – notably

the tendencies for cooperation and for fair distribution of outcomes – but others call into

question the entire notion of efficient bargaining to a social optimum.

       As an example of the latter, consider the evidence that possession of a good

raises a person’s valuation of it – “the endowment effect” on preferences. The

endowment effects experiments show that random assignment of items to people (such as

coffee mugs of a given color) raises their valuation of the item and thus leads them to ask

for more money to give up the item than they would be willing to pay for it had it not
                                                                                             19
been in their possession (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1990). When willingness to

accept payment diverges from willingness to pay for the same item the volume of trade

will be below what the Coase theorem would predict for reasons beyond transactions

costs. Two economies with different initial distributions of property rights would have

different social optimum.

       A second example of behavioral findings that challenge any efficient bargaining

analysis is the evidence that individuals choose “default” options in savings behavior for

long periods even when other options dominate the default (Beshears et al, 2006). Since

the transaction cost of shifting to a higher return option are nominally modest, the

implication is that there are large internal transactions costs that deter rational choice. If

a person does not efficiently bargain with themself to make the sensible decision, it

seems unrealistic that they can bargain efficiently with others, per any efficient

bargaining model.

       Without gainsaying the importance of these and related findings from behavioral

economics on how people really make decisions, I reject the strong claim that this

evidence by itself invalidates the use of efficient bargaining/Coase Theorem models as

ideals for social dialogue systems.

       One reason why the findings do not invalidate the efficient bargaining ideal is that

markets can be efficient even when bargainers make decisions in ways that diverge

greatly from economic rationality. Markets based on “zero intelligence agents” –

computer code that chooses randomly among options – give efficient or near efficient

outcomes when the agents face budget constraints and/or operate under exit and entry

conditions (Gode and Sunder). The agents that make bad decisions lose their position in
                                                                                              20
the market over time while those who randomly drew good decisions increase their

share of the market. In a bargaining situation, the pair of bargainers that reach efficient

outcomes, even by chance, will expand their market presence, leading to an evolution

toward efficient outcomes.

       Another reason is that people may make more rational decisions when they

represent others in collective bargaining or social dialogue settings than when they act on

their own behalf. For instance, I would expect that pension fund managers who may

follow some low return default in their own savings behavior would search carefully for

the best returns for the fund as part of their job. Similarly, someone who might take a

high risk in a personal investment would choose lower risk options when representing

widows and pensioners. Indeed, while society does not care how someone invests their

own funds, it places “fiduciary responsibility” on those investing on behalf of others,

which means that they ought to be able to give rational explanations for their decisions.

If my expectations are correct, some behavioral anomalies in private decision-making

will not generalize to settings where decisions are part of someone’s social role.

       Finally, collective bargaining and social dialogue usually involve group decision-

making, which can also produce decisions that differ from what people make on their

own. Studies of group judgment show that under some circumstances groups make better

use of information than individuals. This is the “wisdom of crowds” that improves

estimates of parameters and that reduces variation in those estimates (Surowiecki, 2004).

But other studies show that group decision-making can lead to erroneous decisions,

which members of the group hold with high confidence (Sunstein).

       Sunstein gives a telling example of erroneous group decision-making in an
                                                                                              21
experimental setting. Participants are asked to estimate whether the experimenter is

using a Red urn, which has 60% red balls, or a Black urn, which has 60% black balls. The

experimenter selects balls from the chosen urn and gives one ball to each person. If each

person independently guesses the urn from which the experimenter selected the balls,

they would guess the urn whose color they had drawn; and the group would choose the

urn with the color of the majority of the balls. Thus, if 3 of 5 persons draw black balls,

the group would choose the black urn. But if individuals vote seriatim on the urn (and do

not give the color of the ball they drew), the group can go astray. If the first two people

drew red and guessed red, and the others drew black, the group might unanimously

choose the red urn. The third person might be swayed by the two preceding guesses and

guess red as well even though she drew black. The fourth, who also drew black, might

also guess red, on the grounds that 3 of 4 draws were red. The fifth would presumably

make the same choice. This “information cascade” leads the group to choose red without

dissent.

       Reviewing the literature on group judgments, Sunstein concludes that “group

polarization can be heightened, diminished, and possibly even eliminated with seemingly

small alterations in institutional arrangements” (p 45). This suggests that whether groups

behave in a more economically rational way than individuals may depend critically on

the arrangement and framing of group interactions.

IV Game Theory and Institutional Design

       The argument that analyses of efficient bargaining/Coase theorem offer the most

promising road toward the missing EU social dialogue model directs attention not only at

empirical analyses of actual bargaining situations but also at theoretical investigations of
                                                                                                          22
bargaining situations by rational (or other) decision-makers and of institutional designs

that can produce efficient outcomes. Game theory provides a rich set of models on

conditions for efficient bargaining and the Coase theorem. The associated

implementation theory (Jackson, 2001) examines ways to design institutions so that the

parties reach or approximate efficient equilibrium. Although researchers in these areas

have not directed their investigations toward EU social dialogue systems, the work offers

potentially useful insight toward the “holy grail” social dialogue model.

         What does the game theory/implementation theory say about bargaining and

social dialogue activities?

         First, the analyses show that the institutional structure of a bargaining game

matters critically as to whether it yields a socially efficient outcome. Using different

modelling structures Anderlini and Felli (2001) and Dixit and Olson (2000) find that even

modest transactions costs for participating in a bargaining or dialogue system can readily

lead to inefficient equilibrium.10 Since there are always some transactions costs in any

negotiation, the implication is that the Coase theorem is non-robust to these costs. In a

similar vein Jackson (2001) stresses that particular mechanisms for implementing

decision-making can have huge effects on strategic behavior and social outcomes. These

analyses also highlight a tension between bargaining systems that allow participants to

reach undesirable equilibrium (giving them an incentive to avoid those decisions) and

systems in which renegotiation allow participants to escape disaster but which reduce the



10
  Anderlini and Felli use an alternating offer model of negotiation where the bargainers pay a transactions
fee at each stage and show that strategic “hold up” conditions can produce situations where the parties
never come to a profitable agreement. Dixit and Olson model a public goods game in which free rider
considerations induce many people to opt out of the bargaining process, which leads to failure to produce
the good.
                                                                                                                 23
disincentive to make poor decisions in the first place.

          From one perspective, the dependence of results on institutional detail is

disappointing, since it suggests that small differences in design can have large effects on

the success or failure of social dialogue systems. But this is not a surprising result given

the dependence of outcomes on the specifics of game structures broadly (Kreps, 1990).

Optimistically, it suggests that experimentation or tinkering with a system has the

potential for improving outcomes. It also suggests that EU policies that require

bargaining or dialogue may help achieve efficient outcomes.

         Second, studies that examine the characteristics of bargainers and bargaining

situations show that homogeneous groups, with similar endowments and abilities,

operating under stable power relations, are more likely to reach efficient bargains than

others (Rajan and Zingales (2000)). Inequality reduces the chance for attaining

efficiency because it increases the incentive for the poor or less productive to use their

resources for rent-seeking rather than to contribute to social output. Stable relations

increase the chance of reaching efficient bargains because parties can be secure that gains

from an efficient contract accruing to the other side will not change their relative power

in the future. For example, if 80% of an expected gain from an efficiency enhancing

economic reform goes to business and business can use this gain to campaign for laws

that may restrict union power in the future, unions may refuse to go along with the

reform, even though it raises the income of business and workers 11

         These considerations suggest that EU countries, particularly the smaller ones, are

11
  Taking a different approach, Hirshleifer (1995) stresses the importance of the technology of conflict in
leading parties to allocate different fractions of their resources to fighting over distribution as opposed to
producing more output, and shows that under some technologies some resources will always be spent on
                                                                                             24
reasonably well-suited to reaching socially efficient outcomes through bargaining.

Income inequality is modest compared to the US. Populations are relatively

homogenous. And society, including the business community, accepts the legitimacy of

labor organizations. The development of EU wide institutions has, moreover, given an

additional layer of security to the social partners.

         Third, analyses show that the ability of participants to make side payments can

affect outcomes substantially. Commitment to make compensating transfers raises the

chances of attaining the efficient outcome. In situations where one of the parties loses

from an agreement, the ability of the winner to commit to the transfer is necessary for the

agreement. But transfers themselves can be inefficient, reducing the value of the bargain,

for instance by reducing the incentive of workers and firms in declining industries to shift

to more productive activities (Dixit and Londregan, 1995). This appears to be

agricultural policy in both the US and EU.

         Surprisingly, however, the side contracting or transfers that lie at the heart of

efficient bargaining do not always improve efficiency, even in a world of complete

information and zero transactions cost. Jackson and Wilkie (2005) show that parties can

use side contracts to manipulate the payoff from bargaining so as to redistribute incomes

to themselves at the cost of efficiency. They suggest that side payments work better

when only one player makes them (for instance where someone pays another party to

reduce pollution) than in situations where many participants make side payments (say in

encouraging public goods production). They also show that side payments are more

likely to support efficient strategies when three or more players are involved in decision-


rent-seeking.
                                                                                            25
making. The implication is that tripartite bargaining – capital, labor, and government,

may be particularly fruitful, at least in some circumstances. The 1987 Irish social pact in

which unions accepted small wage increases, so that firms had incentives to expand

production, while the government compensated workers with tax reductions may be a

case in point. The Pact and succeeding Irish agreements contributed to Ireland’s recovery

from economic basket-case in the 1980s to Celtic wonder-economy in the 1990s-2000s.

       Fourth, information is an important determinant of the likelihood of attaining

efficient outcomes. Complete information with each party knowing the other’ situation is

no guarantee of efficiency, but its absence – private information in which parties know

only their own benefits/costs – increases the chance of inefficient results. Bargaining

over an indivisible item – say greater authority for the firm to set working hours that will

raise output -- can result in inefficiencies when each agent privately knows their

valuation but is uncertain about the valuation the other party places on it (Myerson and

Satterthwaite). In this case there is an incentive to use private information strategically to

gain a larger share of income, which can lead to an agreement that fails to maximize

joint surplus or to no agreement at all. Mckelvey and Page (2002) show that the outcome

in such circumstances will be tilted toward the party who initially has the property rights

rather than being independent of the initial property rights, per the Coase Theorem.

       The bottom line of the game theory/implementation theory analyses of bargaining

is that the way society – government or social partners – design a social dialogue or

bargaining system is likely to affect economic outcomes.

V. Conclusion

       This paper has argued that efficient bargaining/Coase Theorem models offer the
                                                                                           26
best starting point for analyzing EU social dialogue economies. Since the evidence

shows that these models fit the economic world at best loosely, they are most sensibly

viewed as benchmarks comparable to the perfectly functioning competitive model used to

benchmark market-driven economies. If the representative agent hypothesis is correct,

participants in social dialogue systems may be less prone to anomalous decision-making

than laboratory experiments find for individuals acting on their own behalf. On the other

hand, if deviations from rational self-interest favor cooperative behavior, as experimental

studies indicate, social dialogue systems where decision-makers diverge from economic

rationality may reach efficiency more readily than game theoretic models suggest.

       Overall, this review of laboratory and theoretic analyses relevant to understanding

social dialogue economies suggests the virtue of a research programme that examines

design factors that lead parties to efficient solutions, not only on the assumption of

rational strategic behavior but also on potentially more realistic assumptions about how

people make decisions. In any case, whatever the true social dialogue theory turns out to

be, it should help level the playing field in the “war of the models” between the EU and

US economies and it should direct attention at ways to improve the efficacy of social

dialogue institutions Given Enzio Tarantelli’s comittment to social dialogue as a way for

Italy to resolve its economic problems in the 1980s, I would guess that were he with us

today, he would look favorably upon these areas of research and be contributing to them.

            Exhibit 2: EU Social Dialogue from workplace to national policy

European Social Dialogue (Social Dialogue Summit, Brussels, Sept 2005)
European social dialogue is the discussions between employee and employer representative
organisations (the social partners). These can take the form of consultations, negotiations and
joint actions undertaken by the social partner organisations.
At European level, social dialogue takes two main forms - bipartite dialogue between the
European employers and trade union organisations, and tripartite dialogue involving
interaction between the social partners and the public authorities.
These are the essential means by which the social partners help define European social
standards, and play a vital role in the governance of the Union. European-level social
dialogue has received strong institutional recognition in the EC Treaty and in the conclusions
to a number of key European Council meetings, notably those of Laeken and Barcelona.
Combining the values of responsibility, solidarity and participation, the European social
dialogue complements the national practices of social dialogue, which exist in most Member
States.


US Lobbying
         As of mid 2005, the US had nearly 35,000 registered lobbyists for Congress alone.
Lobbyists in the US target the Senate, the House of Representatives, and state legislatures.
They may also represent their clients'or organizations'interests in dealings with federal,
state, or local executive branch agencies or the courts. Lobbyists sometimes also write
legislation. Since 1998, 43 percent of the 198 members of Congress who left government to
join private life have registered to lobby. Former lawmakers are hired as lobbyists because
of their relationships with their former colleagues as well as other contacts. In 2006, 273
former members of Congress or heads of federal agency were lobbyists.


Attitudes of Americans toward lobbying:
   75% believe political lobbyists have too much power, 1994-2001 (Harris)
   81% believe it is common for lobbyists to bribe members of Congress, 2006 (Pew)
   91% concerned about corruption in Washington, 2006 (Fox)
