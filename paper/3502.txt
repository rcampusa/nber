from   the market to the individual       transaction.       Behavior   surh as verttcal

with sompicion as anticompetitive,         was explained as an efficient respnnse

                                                                            the

       A   small literature    has developed    that explains various forms of

                                                                   transactions

between individoat buyers and sellers am efficient responses to this

so-called      "hold-up" problem,"    rather than as monopolistic behavior.2 The

two are hardly motually exclusive,          however,    but attempts to disentangle

them are difficult.       The role of contractual arrangements
                                                               ——           while

               in many markets   for commodities      and industrialproducts -— has

nut receoved much attention          in empirical    work.

       Two fundamental problems must be overcome             in order to distinguish

the new approach from market power as           a   motivation for observed long—term

linkages     between buyers and sellers.        First, the transactions-cost
                                                       associatedwith                  a
nypothescm im not easily falsifiable because it is not

particular formal model.         The second fundamental problem with the ap-

proach     m   that although it suggests       some testable    hypotheaea, the neces-

sary data on individual        transactions are almost never publicly available.

Empirical      work ham reqoired laborious surveys or extraction of provisions

from individual       contractm1
          Thos paper takes advantage       of a large, detailed data set on con-

 tracts between U.S. natural gas producers and
                                               pipelines             signed during the

 1951's.    Hany factsrs may mstivate long-term contracting.4          Considerations

 of  transartioss costs and the potential for spportunism in the bilateral
 relationship are probably most important in explaining the use of
 longterm contracts between producers end pipelines. When a market in
 characterized by smell -numbers bargaining, trade organized through spot
 exchange    is    prone to frequent and    costly renegotiation.5 In the natural
 gas    industry, the wellhead producer and pipeline         face this problem.       (We
 discuss contracting                  in more detail later.)
                          procedure                               In addition, once
 the initial gas well
                      development coats are sunk, a pipeline            feces   the

temptation to appropriate some of the rents from production unless the

producer     has an alternativemeans of sale.6           The pipeline itself is a
form of spenifir capital.        Since it is beat operated near full rapacity,
a long—termcontract                                      is in the buyer's interest
                           "guaranteeing supplies"
as well.
     The natural gas indostry provides an ideal laboratory for ezamina—
tion of both "transaction—cost" and "market-power" models because of the
relatively small number of buyers and sellers in each market, and bereuoe
of the specific upfront capital investments required on the part of both
sellers,    in the form of natural gas wells, and buyers, in the form of

pipeline connections.        Pricing in field markets is the outcome of bilat-
eral oegnniationn;      there is no organized market place, nor any "market

price."

        Inntead,    the buyer (pipeline rompany) end       seller (producer) negoti-
ate a    long—term rnntrart that      specifies the     initial price to be   paid for
gas    delivery,    the quantity to   be   delivered,   and the escalator provisions
that determine      the amount paid over the life of the contract.              The

initial price, referred to hereafter          simply as "the price," provides a

floor on the value of the contract          to the producer        Although prices were

rigid downward, they could rise through the presence               in some contractm of

"definite price escalators"          (increases   of   a   fixed amount per year) and

"indefinite price escalators"          (increases   depending on market conditions).

In addition,      "redetermination"     clauses permitted      renegotiation    of the

terms of    the   contract at   predetermined     intervals

     Below we present a model of the bilateral bargainingprocess in

natural gas field markets under uncertainty.                This model enables us to

identify    the initial price as the nutcome of the bargaining over a fixed

payment    from pipeline to producer,       and observed      price-escalator    provi-

sions as a means of making the contract             responsiveat the margin to

changes in the valuation        of gas over the term of the agreement.            These

changes are uncertain because future movements                in sarginal cost and

downstream demand are not known when a contract is signed.

     The objective nf our empirical work is to consider the relative

imparts of transaction-specific          and market-power considerations         on.

long—term contractingis         a   means of approximatingefficiencyin an

envirorment of small—numbers         bargaining, uncertainty, and immsbile

capital    is difficult to reject because the transactions-cost model is
often quite general and not formalized. We therefore  focus on the
central element of the theory —— the emphasis nn conditions characteriz-
ing the transactingparties           and the transaction itself, rather than the

market —— as thc determinants          of observed prices and contract          terms.

         The   contract terms    we seek   to predict on the basis of traoosction-
 and market-specific informationare, however, both price and the presence
 of anindefinite price escalator in the contract. Although several
indefinite escalators are in use in gas contracts today (e.g., indexation
to petroleum prices and the price level), the chief indefinite escalator
during the period of our data was the moat-favored-nation       provi- ()
oioo. An tify clause in a contract raises the contract price to the level
of the      initial price agreed to by the pipeline       in any contracts signed

later in nearby areas.7           In addition to being in wide use, the     ?ffN

provision      is particularly appropriate for distinguishingbetween market—

power and transaction—coat          theories   of contracting.    Under the latter, an

fearful of being at a disadvantage in contract negotiations can protect
themselves by providing that future bargaining outcomes will apply to
them   eo well.        This feature is important.     Joakow in particular has

empbooioed the potential          relationship   between the degree of asset speci-

ficity      in a transaction and the length of the contract         between the buyer

and seller.6       That relationship       raises the question   of how price   is

modified over the rouroe of the contract as demand and coat conditions

       br   prinripal empiriral      findings    are two.    First, we fond some

evidence    of monopsony     potntial in determining initial             contract prices,


though boyer and      seller size (both absolutely          and wothin     partirular

The prvcsions are most often used by small producers                     (those with few


contracts1      to ensure    flexible marginal    compensation in periods of growing

demand.     These findings     are common to reduced-form price and               WN   equa-

tions,     and to a joint estimation.

       The paper is organized       as follows.     We develop      a    simple model of

producer-pipeline   contracting in section HA, Section lIE relates the
key   features of the model to the observed contracting process in the gas
market.     A detailed review of natural gas field markets in the 1950s (the

variables     on contract prices is allowed to vary according to whether the

 Public policy discussions       of the structure of natural gas contracts           and

 social dssirabilityof wellhsad          price regulation require an analysis of
 whether contracts are designed to facilitate the
                                                  exercising of market

 power by one or both parties or to approximate auction-market
                                                                               efficiency
 in the presence of transactions costs.            Unlike other natural resource

markets (e.g., the oil market), which tend to be characterized
                                                               by both
 spot and contract    trades, gas sales have occurred                            under
                                                               overwhelmingly

 long-term contracts.        Other commodity markets lark the fundamentally

bilateral     relatiosabip    at the producer level, since buyers and sellers

are not linked by immobile        capital.

      Our basic framework draws on the implicit contracting models}a
Pipeline technology, rolled-in-pricing}° and final demand for natural

gas   are   summarized in a revenue function R(Q) , which gives             dollar net
revenue to the pipeline (sales less operating costs) as                a   function of the
intake Q of    gas from the wellhead.        Let   C(Q)   represent the wellhead
producer's opportunity       cost of producing Q.         In the absence of market
imperfections,    marginal    efficiency would be assured, and R'(Q) =           C'(Q).
      In natural gas field markets, hovever, the cost of locating alterna-

tive suppliers    or parchaaers     is often prohibitive.       The contracts that

ariae from the resulting bilateral bargainingproblem serve at least in

part to distribute rents betveen the pipe line and the producer.                  The
contract    specifies a payment B(Q) from            pipeline    to producer as a   function

of output in each period of the contract.

        There is, of course,           substantial uncertainty over circumstances


prevailing over the duration of the contract.                 Such uncertainty arises

from demand shocks -- because of fluctuations in economic activity or
                                                                      -— and supply shocks
             changes in the prices of alternative             fuels
exogenous

—- chonges in opportunity costs of production.                   Demand shocks are cap-

tured    in a random variable o SO that the revenue function becoses R(Q,o).

On the supply side, shocks are characterized by a random variable                    ,   so

that the cost function is C(Q,).

        Both pipelines       and producers are assumed to be risk-neutral,13

maximizing expected profits,              given by

             n = R(Q,o)

 depend on the outcomes of the supply and demand shocks.             Not all vari-
 ables affecting        the contract may be anticipatedby the
                                                              transacting

       The distribution of rents, a signifirent
                                                component of the bargaining

 problem,  is not specified by the efficiency conditions. The
                                                               shape of the

 payment function B is determinedby efficiency conditions; however, the

 level of payment is not without further
                                         assumptions.             In general, ideal
 contracts    conditioned       only on output (to avoid the monitoring problems

 discussed    above) do not exist, because the payment function          is "lacking

 in instruments" to target
                           efficiencyunder all potential realizations of
 o and   .
      Absent problems of         opportunism,   an efficient output-contingent
 oontreot    exists    in the   special case where demand and opportunity-cost

 shocks are related      by a monotonio fmnntion; i.e.,        = f(m).   This case

stylizes     the natural gas industry because of the exhaustible nature of

the resouroe.         Stochastic demand shifts affect the price of gas in the

future, thereby effecting          opportunity cost today.    In this case, an

efficient oontrest satisfies the conditions

in the natural gas field markets.


B.     I5plementing the Efficient Contrart
       The model outlined above yields the result that the efficient

contract under demand uncertainty and bilateral monopoly are character

oced   by a fixed payment,   which ia unrelated   to variable cost cendittons,

and a flexible payment that coverm marginal opportunity costs           Contracts

of this form will involve a fixed payment as a quasi-rent, the distribu-

tion of whirh depends on the relative bargainongposition of the con—

trarting parties.      The flexible payment ensures appropriate    compensation

on the margin.

       There are two aspects of "timing' in rontrartual      arrangements

between buyers and sellers in these markets.         First, with respect to the

                                                         frame encom-
period in which a contract is signed, the producers time

passes the interval     during which offers from pipelines can be enter-
                                                             offers until
tained.     Wellhead producers   typically do not consider

exploratory drilling has been conducted to the point where        a   reliable


estimate    of sustainable volume can be obtained.      MacAvoy notes that there

was typically a two-year maximum time interval between exploratory

 drilling and lapse of the lease on the property.            The    relevant time    frame
 for   a   pipeline io longer.    Ao   diaousaed by
       A new pipeline usually obtains the reserves
                                                     neoesssry for oectifi
       oatinn within one to four years (while
                                                engineering and finanoing of
       transmission are planned).  Once the original reserves are obtained,
       there is no urgent need for a
                                      transporter to purohase replacement
       reserves until twenty years have
                                         passed. Aotually, it cay be least
       oostly for the buyer to purohase reserves
                                                   equal to five years'
       production every five years., The buyer's market includes most
       reserves offered in a five—year period in the established
                                                                   gathering
       region.

       The second aspeot of "timiog" in the oontraotual
                                                        arrangement is
 that, cnoe the large capital outlays are made,           they are sunk fur the

 duration of the contract       (typically twenty years).        Given the difference
 in initial market time frame for the
                                      buyer and seller, the possibility
 for opportunistic    behavior on the part of the pipeline is clear.             There
 is little reason to believe that, absent contractual
                                                     provisions to the
point, pipelines     would compensate producers for changes in the value of

their gas as demand increased over time.

       Hence given the partfcular conditions governing
                                                       producer-pipeline
bargains,     the efficient    contract    cannot be implemented    without   the use of

provisions to guard against the possibilityof opportunisticbehavior

after the contract is signed.          Natural gas is sold by the producer to a

pipeline,    which then trsnspnrts        it tn distributioncompanies     or final
users downstream; producers have lacked lack direct access to downstream

markets until recently        (i.e., late 198Cc).     More than s simple price

guarantee is required to support            in equation   (6), since a pipeline

could force renegotiation       at a lower price.      If the producer objected,

the pipeline could reduce
                          purchases.           Since pipelines     in genersl have

significantalternative sources of supply, such a threat would he

credible.

        In   field markets for natural gas, the fixed payment is determined as

follows        Contracts   typically specify a minimum payment earh year,

regardless      of downstreamdemand, in terms of           a   "take—sr-pay'    requirement

ralsula ted as     the product of    a   fixed rnntract prire       and a   fixed quantity

sperified      as a perrentage of the well's physical produrtsu capacity.15

Definite (fixed-price,         esralatore    establish   minmsm prices         n each period
cf the contract,       These provisions,       together with the initial price and

the take—or-pay provision,         guarantee       a minimum payment to the producers

in each persod of the contrast.             Take—sr—pay percentages varied little

across    contracts   in quantity teums,16 though the initial price set in the

contrast      in general doffers across contrasts depending on differenses in

costs and no the relative bargaining positions                 of the transactingpar-

ties.     We   address this issue in the next section.

        In his pioneering work, NasAvoy consideredstatic comparisons                  of


models of pipeline msoopsony and competition in explainingprice deteumi—

nation in natural gas fields.            Within toe framework of our model, it is

possible      that differences in hsriznntal masket power on the buyers'               and

sellers'      sides affected    the dstrbotion of the rents in natural gas

late lDSOa were a time of new discoveries in the fields and of expanding

final demand for natural gas.            Must pipelines        signed large numbers of

rontrasta      with many producers.         The number of pipelines dealt with by a

single producer on different          fields or markets obviously varied with the

size of the produces.          For producers with many contrasts, producer—

pipeline retatconohips         were an ongoing process of signing new contrasts,

suggesting that a static market-power approach to analyzisg prise

 lISOs), most-favored-nation     clauses are useful since transactionprices

in a contract are linked to terms in future contracts rather than to

movements    in underlying costs or demand, which are unlikely to be observ-

able by botb parties to the contract.'8            For such a provision to be

useful in practice, however,      sellers should     be                            —-
                                                          relatively homogeneous

having   similar underlying cost structures and selling to the same down-

stream market.     Natural gas field markets fit this description        well.

     large producers are more likely to operate in several field markets

than small producers, and are less likely to be at an informational

disadvantage relative to pipelines.         When downstream demand is not

dorectly    observable,   the two-party ?ffN may be a useful proxy.      Prices are

ad3usted    to reflert not only the field market valuation of gas, but also

its resale value,     Signing of new contracts       occurs only when downstream

demand conditions    warrant payment of prevailing field prices.         In addi-

tion, when the pnpeline     has superior    informationabout current and future

levels of downstreamdemand,       the HEN provision       can have substantial

value.     By putting the clause in the contract, a seller can mitigate the

problem of being outnegotiated      for a lack of knowledge about current or

future demand and prices.      This information would be most needed by small

producers, who lack the resources to prepare elaborate forecasts of

downonream demand)9

     Our interpretation     of the HEN as an instru.meot to replicate effi-

cient contracting during periods of growing demand implies that it is

unlikely to be merely a reflection of producer market power, a claim

often made by proponents      of wellbead price controls      in the lSSOs.   Even

at first glance, the market-power argument          is not very convincing.      If

producer market power were important,           there is no reason that it should

have    materialized in the form of lWNs rather than high                  initial prices or
take-cr—pay requirements.            In addition,      the MIII   is activated at     the
discretion       ci   the buyer.    It is also     inappropriate to think of the ?ffN as
just    a means Of non—price competition.              Studies    of   regulated industrier
have emphasized        the importance of non-price competition,10 but wellhead
price ceilings        were not binding        during our period of study, In          a   highly
competitive, growing market,           relatively high prices           and frequent use      of

III. U.S. NATIONAL GAS TUNIC MAlLETS:                 BACKGROUND,      DATA,   AND EXISTING

        LITERATURE

A.      stRfiral SettiRE and          Data

        The industry developed in the l930s with the discovery of large

fields in the Southwest, and the intrcductics                 ci seamless pipe, which

allowed the construction           ci large     pipelines   to   transport     gas at high

pressure without leakage over the long distances from producing areas                         to
consumers    in the Best, Middle            West, and West.      The Natural Gas Act of

1939 authorized the Federal Power Commission (TPC) to regulate interstate

pipeline    tariffs, but wellhead prices (the prices charged                    by producers   to
pft"lines)       remained unrontrclled.22

        The Supreme Court emtended            the FPC's jurisdiction to wellhesd prices

in the Phillips        case in 1954.        The decision was based in large part on

the alleged monopoly power of               Phi'Il'ips Petroleum,   the largest ci the more

than 2000    independent" producers selling natural                 gas   into interstate
commerce    in   the late tI4Cs. and other large gas producers.                   Natural    gas

demand had risen sharply after World War II and Phillips                       and other
                                           15




producers had raised prices substantially.          Alleged monopoly power by gas

producers was a major policy issue         throughout   the 1950s,24

        As a result of the Phillips decision, the FPC froze welihead prices

in 1954, and required producers to file rate schedules25 on their

existing     contracts,   requests   for price increases,    and new contracts.           In

this era of increasing       demand and prices there followed       a   deluge of

price-increase     requests and requests     for new-contract    certification,

inundatiog    the Commission,    which was obliged to approve the vast majority

of them26.     The Commissionestimated that, utilizing its time-consuming

cost—based regulatory procedures,         it wiuld require until the year 2043 to

review the thousands of requests it had received by 1960.27

        The FF0 abandoned its quixotic effort to base prices on costs at

individual    wells in 1960, and adopted pricing based on geographic areas.

Prices were effectivelyunregulated until that time,             and had nearly

doubled since 1954.

        Our data base consists of 1804 contracts filed between 1953 and

August 1957.     The contracts filed run to several pages each, but fortu-

nately the relevant economic data were extracted and compiled systemati-

cally as part    of the   initial rate hearing    (the so-called        'Omnibus

Hearing"    on regulatorymethods)       following the Phillips     decision.28 The

data cover the majority of transactions         during this period.        Each con-

tract    is a transactionbecause regulators       obliged producers       to dedicate

the output from each well to only one pipeline.             Omitted are (i) con-

tracts for gas not dedicated         to interstate commerce    (since intrastate

pipelines    were outside FF0 jurisdiction),        (iii short-term contracts,

(with a duration of less then twenty years),30          (iii) wells outside         the

main producing areas of the Gulf Coast, Southwest,            ad   Rocky liountains
                                            ii

(which     account for over 90 percent of U.S. production),             and (iv)   corv

tracts     signed. but not yet filed     by September     i,   1957.

       Associated witb                is tbe following information:
                          each transaction
pipelIne, producer, date, location (state, county, and gas field), term
length, price adjustment clause, initial price, price on June 30, 1957
(only tbree contracts is tbe database were filed after this date), and
volume    in l9Si (for costracts filed after July 1, 195i, the volume in tbe
first    montb of tbe contract). Some transactions have missing data, and

some judgments were necessary regarding tbe identities of producers

(e.g..    individual producers     who   appeared to be from tbe        same   family were
aggregated),
       These   data provide a rare opportunityto observe prices cbarged by

each seller to each buyer.         The difficulty, as usual in industrial

organiration,     is to define markets in an economically meaningful manner.

The Federal Power Cosissinn classified the major producing areas into

three regions —-     Gulf Coast,    Midcontinent,     and Rocky hountains.         The FF0

divided the Gulf Coast region into five markets, which from east to vest

are:     Mississippi,   Southern Louisiana, Houston, Goliad, and Corpus

Christi.     The Midcontinent region was likewise divided              into five   markets

   North Louisiana/EastTexas,         Hugoton/Psohandle,       North Texas/Gklahoxe,

Kansas,    and West Texas/SoutheastNew Mexico.           The eerkets are depicted         in


Figure 1.

     In his early study of price formation in natural gas fields
MacAvoy°1 reclassified the North Louisiana/East Texas (into the Gulf

Coast region) and West Texas/Southwest New Mexico (into the Rocky Noun-
tains region) markets on the besie of the destination of the gso pcoduced
there.     Roughly speaking, Gulf Coast          supplies vent to the East,
Midcontinent supplies to the Midvest, and Rocky Mountain supplies to the

West.     Market definition is discussed in detail by MacAvoy;             with minor

exceptions,    we follow his classification         here (the Appendix provides a

list of countces in each market).32


B.      Previous Economic    Research   on Natural Gas Markets

        Despite the intense political       controversy, economic       interest,33     and

data gathering and compilation at the time of wellhead price control,

there was little attempt at empirical            analysis    of market power.    In the

"Omnibus Hearings,'       producers   argued that the FPD should approve all

prices    that were the outcome of "competitive         market forces,"      and inter-

vene only where such forces were absent.             Economists'      views were couched

in terms of runrontration       levels.    The procompetitive         position was that

nationwide the industry was unroncentrsted on both buyer and seller sides

relative to averages of all industries, while the snticompetitive                 argu-

ment noted that the market was not national, and that only new contracts,

not total production, mattered because existing contracts bound buyers

and sellers together fur the long          term)      Under this definition;markets

could no longer be characterired          as unconcentrated.

        Two studies actually looked at pricing-             MarAvoy   conducted a de-

tailed                     of structure and conduct in various markets,           sod
          investigation

carried out the only econometric analysis.35 He ran prire regressions on

one market at a time (on the                            data), looking at the extent

to which cost factors affected the prices pipelines paid.                  He tested for

mnnopsnny versus competition (ignoring monopoly),               assuming   nearly verti-

cal supply curves on that prices paid would vary between producers under


competitionbut       not munnpsnny (because under monipsnny pipelines could

C      in           TransactionCost and Ma rkeerotheses

       We divide our empirical efforts into two parts ——                   (i)   individual

reduc ed—fona       models    of the determination      of   initial contract pric esecd
the   use of the most—favored-nationclause, and (ii)                 a   model of price

detecmination in which the coefficients               on market-specific         and

transaction—specificvariables vary according to whetter the contract

ocncacna     a most—favored—nation clause. Simultaneous estimation of price
and   MPH   determination      is designed to address the claim that the presence
of    an MPH     clause   is merely another item that producers requent an part of

their    contractual   package,     possibly to be traded off for a higher initial

price in toe contract.

        Jut approach ran be ciorarized           a     fllows.       We define variables

3sLicated with (i) market structure,                  (ii)   transaction and   information

eito, and      (iii) produrtion costs, and investigate                 their relative    impact

on contract previsions.           We identify the first group of variables with

'market power' models,        and the second group with "tranoactiona              rest"

models.      The third group of variables             serves as a control.      Thus, we are

able to test whether centrarteg theories                  based on transactions tests, or

market structure, or beth, have explasatorypower in this setting.

        We expert zero reeffiriests en all of the market-structure                  variables

in the empirical work presented below if only transactions-rest                     renaider—

atcins matter.      likewise,      if   only market-powertheories           are relevant

here,    the transactions-cost       variables will have zero ceeffirientm.                Of

course,     the theories    are net mutually          exclusive;     nenzern ceeffitienta    en

both greups of var.ables would indicate this,                    It is only by including

bntn groups of varsaslem          in the same empirical model that the

transactions—cost      and market-power views can be disentangled, which

previous research has net attempted.
        Market structure     is   of interest because allegations            of producer
nnr.ipnly   power were instrumental         in th" decasian          to regulate wellhead

prc es, as noted above.           There have als, been claims that pipelines have

appropriated same      pridueer rents thrnugb their exercise of                monnpmsny

power.      In a textbook rase of ennnpsnny power,               a   bargaining situation in

which a single buyer fares          a   Large number of independent sellers tn             arms

Prndurer-pipeine dealings are, hewever,                  characterized     by repeated
                                                20


transactions between parties, so that bargaining on price and non-price
provisions nay mitigate inefficiencies on the margin associated with
nonopsonistic    behavior.

        Definfng "market' boundaries for measuring buyer               and seller concen-

tration    is difficult.         While most    pipelines wore shle to gather          gas   in
soy field within      a   basin (or     FBI market) in which they operate, produc-
ers' markets are      much more narrow.           Because, by    the middle   IBSOs, most

pipelines within a large market could collect gas in all of the fields
wothin the market, we define our measures of producer concentrationwith

respect    to the   full markets         A high    concentration measure for production
in a given snaIl field would            moan   little if pipelines were free          to gather
gas   from neighboring fields in the same general market.                 Realized produc-

er market power is unlikely given the asymmetries noted is the sizes of

pipeline    sod pmodurer markets.          Table     i   shows bnyer and seller concen-

tration levels in each of the eleven field markets.                   It is clear that

buyer (pipeline) concentration            levels are considerably       higher than seller

0000entcation    level.         In empirical tests, we use the four-firm ooncen-

trerion ratio (04)        for    sellers and the two—firm        concentration   ratio      (02)

for buyers (since 04 was so close to              unity), as well as the llerfindabl

index for both buyers sod sellers.4t

        Frobleos of   opportunisticbehavior are potentially important in gas

no cketa   because of the       way   transactions ars organized.        There   is   no

central    market place, and no quoted "market price."                Rather, each     ooo
treot is the outcomb of bilateral negotiations. The pipeline and the
well are both forms of isssobile capital, and buyer and sellers have
little choirs but      to deal with each other over an extended period.
                                           21




        An important asyimsetry exists between buyers and sellers.          Most

 sellers are small firms or individuals,          and are likely to have only one

 well, perhaps     a   handful.4'   The buyers are natural gas pipelines, large

 companoes with knowledge of downstream demand, and with a large number of

 contracts to guide them in negotiating          terms.   Moreover,   sellers have

 little recourse if buyers act opportunistically;            the seller's definition

of 'market" is very restrictive.         In contrast, buyers' pipelines run

hundreds     of mules, and carry the output of many sellers.          Attempts   by
sellers to appropriate        rents can be met by switching      to other sellers in

the same market, or switching to other markets.              A descriptionof pipe-
line operatuons        in each market is contained    in Table 2.

        As shown on Table 3, there were,        however, a few very large sellers,

with many contracts across several markets.           During the period covered by
rio"   database,   there were ten producers      that signed more than tbirty

contracts.     These producers,     all large oil companies, also had a sizable

stork of existoog contracts (see Table 3).           Doe might expect that these

firms bad both     a   much better idea of the value of their gas at diverse

lcatoons than did the single-contract           producers,   and a better idea of

bow to negotiate with pipelines.         Moreover,    reputation effects are

important in dealing with such sellers.           Pipelines would be less apt to

try to capture all of the rents from a partner that they antiripate

facing repeatedly on the fucnre.

       In an attempt to capture these considerations          we employ firm size as

an explanatory variable, both within the market (using market share), and

across all marketo.42 We can then test whether, e.g., the Texas Company

(Texaco)    is able to obtain a better deal than a small producer for its
                                                 22




gas, when market structure         and other factors are properly cootrolled

for. 43

        Third,                                               considerations   are impor-

tant.      Cur revenue function R for the pipeline represents net revenue, so

that differences      in acquisition costs of gas must be controlled            for.

Relative      to its value, natural gas is expensive to transport.            Some gsa

is worth less because it is further from pipelines,                 or becauoe the field

is   fur                Similarly, a large-volume well is worth more
           irom consumers.

because the coat of connecting the well to the pipeline is fixed and
because cf the higher pressure associated with such wells,44'4
        We   are no more able to establish costs than         was    the FPC staff io the
iRSta,     and employ proxies —-        the distance of the market frem consuming
                                                      46 the density of   weuls per
regions (represented      oy region duumies,

county (higher density means lower fixed cost of gathering                 lines to

transport      gas from wellhead to pipeline), and the volume of the contract.
An additional conaideration to measuring cost differences is distinguish-
ing the more roamon "gas-well gas" and occasional "oil—well gas" coo—
traoto; the latter represent gas produced jointly with oil (thus at a
subotuotially lower marginal cost than gas-well gas). The main body oi
data    we   use did not contain this information. By matching contact
iniormution with ancillary data in Sxbibit 2-tC of the same FPC docket
(thamolin case) , we were able to exclude orl-'ell—gas contracts from the
analysis.
     Finally, we include         two    additional factors that affect the sire of
the rent to be divided.          The "common—pool"       nature of producing from
underground      fields serves to       reduce the rent available to be split
between buyer and      seller.     As    a rough measure of the extent of the
                                             :3



common-pool     problem, we use the number of sellers producing              in the given

field; the more sellers per field, the greater the potential problem.

The large number of pools in each market prevents a multicollinearity

                                                     variables.      The level of demand
problem with the seller market-structure

is clearly important; we employ dummy variables for each year after 1953

because a secular increase in demand caused prices to rise over the
          47
period.

     Whereas we follow the industrial             organication     literature in treating

the number and size of buyers and sellers (as measured by concentration

ratios and Herfindahl indices)           in a given market as elements of market

structure,     ilulherin uses the number of buyers and sellers            in a   given

field as a proxy for "asset specificity,"             a   transaction-cost    measure.48

Since our results depend on proper sdentificatinn                 of markec-structure      and

transaction-cost         variables,   it is worth justifying the differences here.

     First, Nulherin's concern (and that of hasten and Crocker4) over

the common-pool problem's effect on seller bargaining power motivates his

tand their) inclusion          of the number of    sellers per     field as a

transaction-cost—related         seasure.    Because we use seller—specfic         data,

and because common-pool effects are by their very nature identical across

contracts      in   a   given field, we treat these effects        (as proxied by the

number of sellers per field) as part of costs, and include them as

controls,      in addition     to our market—structure      and

transaction—cnsc-related
                       variables.                 Our cjncentratios measures,        in

contrast,      sre for entire markets, which include many fields (many of

which are relatively small).

     Second,        the ownership     of the gathering system that carries gas in

the field to the pipeline,            s provision for which Nulherin uses the number
                                                   24



 of   sellers per field to explain (through whether the contractual                          delivery

point is at the well or the pipeline),                   is likely to he related to the

number of       sellers in   the    field,      becauae the        coat of the gathering      system
is    largely fixed, and is spread over the various wells to which the

system     connects. Thus         its inclusion as           a   transscticn-cost—related
variable arguably makes sense for the purpose that Nulherin uses it.
     Finally, our use of buyer concentration measures for each market                             as
e   measure of market structure            is similar to that of Hasten and Crocker,

who also included tbe number of buyers per field as a transaction—cost-

releted    variableS0        As   discussed above. our view of transaction coats                   is
one     closely related to games with asvTemetric information,                     for which the

use of buyer and seller size is a more appropriate proxy for
                                                             bargaining
power than the number of buyers or sellers in a given field.

 problems, we expect prices       in a given field to depend only    on market
 characteristics     (transportation   costs, level of demand, and buyer and

 seller concentration),       and not on cbaracteristics   of specific contracting

 firms.


       Equation    (7) was eatimated   by ordinary least squares using data on

 contracts   in markets 2_10.51      Market I (Mississippi)    was omitted because

 (s) no d_stinccion    is made between firm and market characteristics             (as

 shown xn Table 1, there was only one buyer in this market);          (ii) there

are few contracts in the market; ano (iii) most of these contracts are in

a single rsunty near the Louisiana        (Market 2) border.     Market 11 (Rocky

Mountains)     was omitted because it covers not one market, but       a    large
number of small,     isolated   fields stretrhing   from the "Four Corners" area

of the southwest     to the Canadian border,      Thus, the only Rocky Mountain

contracts used are those from Market 10 (West Texas/Southeast           New Mexi-

co).    As a result of these omissions and inrsmplete         information    in some

of the contracts,     1424 contracts are available for use in the empirical

analysis.     Because we iater estimate jointly models of the determinants

of price and the use of a most—favored-nation         clause, we restrict      our

analysis    to tbe 1102 contracts with information on both.52

       Table 4 contains the means of the explanatory variables.             Table S

reports the regression results for the contract price equation.              The

results in Table S are present for the rategsries          of variables described

before ——    "market-structure;     ttransactionspecific and "firm-sperifir;"

'transportation     csst;" and "other"     Two sets of market structure vari-

ables were used --     (i)   the csnrentration   ratios on the buyer (two-firm)

and seller (four—firm)       sides, and (ii) the Herfindahi indices for buyers

and sellers,      In addition, two sets of variables were employed as
                                            26



measures of absolute size of buyers and sellers (i)                      buyer and   adler
total volumes and total numbers of contracts, and (ii)                   buyer   total   volume

and seller total contrarts, Tbe latter represents the oase for which
seller size and arcess to information about market conditions is proxiad
by    the number of contracts, wbile pipelines,              with their bettor access to

information about market conditions are indexed for size by thair total

volume.      Apart from other conditions,          tbo yearly dummy variables indicate

generally a rising profile of prices over the period.

       The   coefficients   on   the buyer and        seller concactration ratios yield
evidence     of pipeline monopsony power, tbougb tbere is no evidence of                   a


positive association between producer concentration                 and the price re-

ceived by producers in the contract.              These results are consistentwith

much of the discussionof the gas market by economists in the ISSOs —-

that   such anticompetitive problems that might exist were most likely to

come from the buyer, not the seller, side.                  Similar findings     occur on the


buyer and seller sides when the }ierfindabl index is used.

       The coefficient estimates in Table S reflect the importance of

transaction—specificand firm—specifd              c    characteristics   in contract price

determination.      Measures     of buyer   and       seller sizo in tIe market are
assoodated     with negative and positive effects, respectively,                 on the

initial price.      Our indicators of the effects of absolute size of trans-

                   reveal that the number of contracts             is moro important       than
aoting parties

size measured     by total volume, most likely refleoting the informs tion-

gathoriog process     associated with bavisg  contracts.manyIncreases in
rho number of producer contracto raises the contract price, while the

opposite is true for buyers (picelines) . In general, the variables
specific to transacting parties         ace   relatively       more important on the
                                         27



 seller side than the buyer side, where market—specific          effects dominate.

Fir example, spanning the range nf nur sample, very large producers with

 100 cintracts   receive prices abiut 9 percent greater than very small

prnducers    with only nne cnntract.

      Finally,   in the inst side, the positive coefficientnn the contrart

volume reflects    the significance of the fixed cost of connecting the

individual    well to the pipeline.     The gathering-cost prixy was impre-

cisely estimated;     the coefficients on the region dummies reflected the

greater proximity     of the Midcontinent and Rocky Mountain regions to final

markets.     The negative and statistically     significant    coeffinient on the

number of sellers per field indicates the importance of the common-pool

problem.     We test further for mooospony power by allowing the roeffi—

rieots in the cost proxies     (well volume and gathering       cost) to vary with

the degree    of buyer concentration.     The negative estimated coefficients

on the cost-coorentration     interactions    iodicate    that the rents from being

a low-cost producer accrue in part to buyers in markets with           a   high

degree of concentration on the pipeline side.

      The results in Table S are indicative of the importanceof "small—

numbers-bargaining"    issues in the gas market.         Based on the F-tests

reported    in the table, we can reject at any reasonable significance level

the hypotheses that the (i) numbers      of buyer and      seller contracts,   (ii)

combination of volumes and numbers of contracts, and (iii) combinationof

volumes,    numbers if contracts,   and market shares should not be included

in the contract price equation.        We also cannot reject the joint intlu—

sun   of buyer and seller concentration ratios, though only the firmer is

individuallyconsistent with the seller-market-power            hypothesis.

                V. DETERMINANTS OF USE OF MOST-FAVORED-NATION           CLAUSE

 A.     Most-Favored-Nation       Clause:      Market—Power or Transaction—Cost

        Influences?

        As noted before, the most—favored-nation            clause   raises the contract

 price to the level of the highest price paid by the pipetine                   on any new
 contracts      in the field,54      Table 6 illustrates     the use of most-favored-

nation    clauses in the various         field markets iocloded in     our   data.      Use of
ffN    provisions differed considerably across markets.5 Below                   we    contrast
the predictions of the "transactios—coec" and "market-power"views.
During the ZREDs, concern over the use of most-favored—nation clauses                      was
based on     their   supposed   origins in producer market power.6              Such
arguments     would suggest that ffNs should appear most
                                                         frequently in
contracts in markets with relativelyhigh seller concentration.

        As in the model of the initial contract price we include both

market—structure variables (buyer and seller concentration ratios or
Herfindahl indices) and transaction—specific variables (measuring buyer
and seller size absolutely and within specific markets). Time dummies
are    included, as are dummies        for the Midrentinenc and Rocky Mountain

regions    (to reflect differences in "maturity" of the regions).                  That   is,
we    consider a probtt model of the form

(I)          MEN..
                  ckt
                        = f(M. . w
                             ic    ..,W.cj Dt).
                                   ck
where   "MEN"    takes on the value of one        when   a two-percy MEN   is   used in    the
contract, and      zero otherwise.          The variables are as defined before in the

price roOd.

       Additional questions as to the definitico of "racket' boundaries
arise in the consideration of root-favored-nationclauses.                    One   potential
                                           29



 cost of the HEN stems      from the obvious perunisry       externality prnblem

 stressed    by Neuner and NacAvoy.57 Resourceo        may be wasted as pipelines

 switch fields to avoid triggeringHENs.            We include in the model in

 equation    (8) a "boyer escape" variable measuring the fraction of a

pipeline's total volume accounted for outside the market where the

 contract is being signed.      The expected sign on this variable is ambigu-

ous-    A   higher value of "buyer escape" makes the pipeline        more willing to

grant an HEN, ceteris paribus; on the other band, higher values of "buyer

escape" make the potential      for field switching greater, making the clause

of less value to producers.58

       Specific    tests are formulated as follows.      A   market-power   interpre-

tation of the occurrence of HENs would imply a positive effect of
                                                                  produc-

er concentration      and a negative   effect of pipeline concentration.         The

contracting interpretation      suggests   that market-structure     variables   are

irrelevant,       but that informational   asymmetries and the potential for

opportunistic behavior (and hence the value of the HEN) are greater,

ceteris piilios,      the larger the buyer or the smaller the seller.

       Probit results are presented     in Table 7 for the same markets and

groupings of traosactinn-related       variables    considered in Table 5; the

results are consiotent      with the contracting approach outlined earlier.

Coefficients      on neither the buyer nor seller concentration       ratio are

statisticallysignificantlydifferent from zero; the

producer-concentration-ratio      coefficient even has the opposite sign from

that predicted     by the market-powerhypothesis. Coefficients on the

Herfiodahl measures are statisticallysignificant,             though the producer

index still has the wroog sign for the market power explanation.              Coeffi-

cients on buyer and seller "size" indicate that large buyers and small
                                           35



sellers    (both in the market and in absolute size) are             more   likely to    have
a moot—favored nation       clause in their contrarte. In particular the
ooeffioient on seller size         measured by number ci        oontraots is negative
and    precisely    estimated.    The estimated negative ooeffioiente on "buyer

escape" suggest that the field-switching            problem may well have been

important.     The Rocky Mountain and Midccntinent dummiee have the expected

negative    signs, reflecting the more infrrquent use of             WNs    in thoae

relatively mature regions.

        These results from the reduced-form model provide support for the

hypothesis that the 9WN is part of a oontractual package designed                   to

approximate    marginal    efficiency over the course of a long—term contract

(by making price changes responsive to growth in demand),                  while allowing

inframarginal       rents to he distributedbetween producer              and pipeline

according to differences         in bargainingpower.       Our findings point up the

need to consider contractualprovisions together                 as part of a bargain,

and not focuo individually on "price" and "non-price"                coapetition.

Policy    propooale to    restrict the use of particular provisions sre likely
to be inappropriate.59

        One alternative explanation of the use of tbe            tifFs   is as an

anticcepetitive       device on the   yvp side.6        That is, if each pipeline         in

a given market offered a two-party         tifN   in its contracts,       competitive

bidding would       be discouraged -- buyers, by      competing     for new suppliers,

would trigger price increases         in existing    contracts.      The difficulties

with   this explanation are three. First, the presence of an ?ifN clause
(in   the data) is negatively associated with concentration on the buyer
side.     Second,    credible punishments would     have   to   be explained;    pipelines

 not using the MEN can take advantage of their rivals.                   Third, entry

 barriers must be substantial to forestall                              from potential
                                                         competition

 rivals,       Theae criticisms ace serious.           The estimates in Table    7   suggest
 that buyers with large market shares are wore likely to have MFNs in

their contracts.        Moreover,     in an examination of the Southern Louisiana

market over the 1946-1955 period, Butz con cludes that MFNs are used

extensively       even though the market was growing rapidly with substantial

pipeline entr.y.61

           A second alternative emphasizes         insurance features     sf contracts.

S.'hile     the model of section II assumed that buyers and sellers are risk—

neutral,      more generally,      contractual    provisions    may redistribute risks
between risk-averse        contractingparties.           In related work, we derived the

optimal mix of "spot"           (flexible-price)      and "contract" (fixed—price)
trades as a function        of market characteristics          and the risk aversion of

            and sellers.   62
buyers                          Suppose for exsmpie that pipelines         and large

corporate producers        are risk-neutraland small, undiversified             producers

are risk-averse.       If uncertainty stems principally            from the demand aide

(as opposed to uncertaintyover production costs), then small producers

would prefer a fixed-price contract and large producers would prefer a

flexible-price      contract.63 This prediction is not borne out by the

results in Table ..6465
                 i.

       The reduced—form models outlined in sections IV sod V indicate the

potential      importance of transaction—specific           factors    (over and above

market—specific      cunditions)     in the contract bargain.          Given the rule of

transaction—specificfactors in influencing the use of a MFN clause, it
is   possible that the estimated effect of transactionvariables in the
price equation just reflects the tradeoff between the price and the ffN
clause in the initial bargain. lorluding a dummy variable for the
presence      of a ffN clause in the price equation would not be aufficient,

since    the     two   contract terms are detetmioed simulteoeouely.
        To   consider this issue,                    we   begin with tho following form of the
price    equation:


                              + W'd. +
                                                 £, if        tffN   =

                              +              + m0, if         !ffN   = 0,

                       = 0, otherwise,


and W   is   a   vector of transaction-specifit                          variables;   X   is a vector of

other variables          in the price equation; 1 is a vector of exogenous vari

shIes in the ffN equation; and                                       and u are error terme.

      Including         a   dummy variable                for tffN in the price equation would imply

an exogenous       switching process,                     appropriate only if the error terms a0

and e, crc uncorrelatedwith u (the error term in the                                  bffIi    equatitr).     We

correct for potential simultaneitybias by estimating the price equation

as an endogenous            switrhing regression                     (i.e., price and ffN are       jointly

determined as endogenous variables),                            wherein the dusmeyvarieble           ?ffy   is

replaced     on the right-hand side of the price equation by its fitted value

from probit models analogous to those presented in Table                                      7.


      Specifically,          we        assume that u,     and a. are jointly normally

procedure is to first obtain an estimate                                 of      from the maximum likeli-

hood probit model for NFN, then, using                               construct      ''   and 0.   The next

step is to estimate           (12) by ordinary                least squares using the estimated

and 0.        We   estimate   the endogeoous         switching                model described     above for

the price models outlined               in columns           (2),        (4), (6), and (8) of Table 5.

The first stage estimates the likelihood of                               a   hFN clause in the contract

from the probit models in Table 7 with similar right-hand-side variables.

Estimated      coefficients          for the endogenous switching model are reported in

Table    8.

        An    efficient-contracting             interpretation                of the combination      of price

and NFN provisions would suggest that:

        (i)    MYNs are most likely to be used in growing markets with signif-

               icant entry so that, ceteris paribus, high prices and the use

               of ffNs go hand in hand; and
                                             34




        (ii)    holding   constant the presence of an    in contracts the
                                                          ?ffN


                effects   of transaction—specific characteristics on price should
                not he important.
This pattern stands in contrast to the notion of              a   simple tradeoff
between price and the ffN prcviaicn, in which WHs would be used primari-
ly in lcw—price markets, irrespective of transaction—specific
characteristics
        Given the    estieated   coefficients     in Table 8, une   can easily reject
the hypothesis of s unique tradeoff between initial price and mast-
favored-nation clauses in producer-pipeline contracts. The effects cf
characteristics of transacting parties cn contract prices vary signifi-
cantly between contracts with and without ffN provisions. In particular,
the positive impacts on price of seller market share and seller size
(measured by the number of contracts) are traceable to csntrscts without
ffN provieions; such impacts are negligible in contracts with tffNs.
Similarly, tbe negative ssseciation of buyer market share and price in
the reduced—form model        is a feature of contracts not ceotsining a
clause.        These characteristics     of the transacting parties affect the

likelihood       of contracts' including     two—party !ffH clauses (see Table      7),
sod,    in en doing, affect the contract price.

        All    other things equal, small     sellers received higber prices in
contracts with       ffNs; they are more likely as well to have an Nfl provi-

sion.        We also knew from previous discussion that          WNs   ware most often

used    in    growing markets.   the pattern of NTNs is consistent with
                                 Hence

their being used tc permit flexible price adjustment in the pceaenca ci
growing demand. The results in Table g are inconsistent with a static
seller-market—p owen interpretation, in which a tradeoff between price and
                                             35



1FN would be related only to market—specific            rharacteristics.     Similarly,

if use of Miss reflected primarily tacit collusion among buyers (which we

noted earlier was unlikely                                                 effect of
                                   a   22ji), any estimated    negative

buyer market share on price should be greater in the presence of an               IffN


provision;     just the opposite       is true.


                         VII.    CONCLUSIONS AND IMiLICATIONS

     It is well recognized by economists that long-term contractingunder

an array of price and non-price provisions may be an efficient response

to small-numbers       bargainingproblems.        Empirical work to distinguish    such

issues from predictions         of models of market power and bargaininghas been

sparse, principally because the necessary data on individual transactions

are seldom publicly available.           The U.S. natural gas industry is well

suited     for such tests both because of the small number of buyers          (pipe-

lines) and sellers (producers)          in each market and the large capital

cosmatments    required   of transactingparties at the beginning of the

contract.

     In this paper, we make use of a large detailed data set on contracts

between U.S     natural gas producers       and pipelines signed during the lPSOs.

With respect to the determinationof the initial price in the contract,

principal    results are two.      First,   static market—power influences are not

the only factors in cuntract price determination.             While thece is some

evidence    of pipeline sooopsony power, there is no evidence for positive

impacts of producer market power (as measured by concentration)              on

contract prices.    Second, transaction—specificand firm-specific            variables

are important, including measuces of buyer and seller market share and

size indicated    by   total volume or total number of contracts.
     The key test of the relative role played by transaction
considerations is to assess how prices adjust over time. Use of the
most-favored—nation clause in this respect cannot he explained by produc-
er market power; indeed the provision is usedbv large buyers and small
sellers to approximate the flexible marginal compensation under growing
demand suggested by the model in section II.

     We    have discussed many problems     associated with ens's-length trans-
actions in field markets for natural gas, including specific capital,
ucspecified property rights,      and   asysetric information.       Exchange    is
complicated    still   further by a regulatory framework        which has been

attacked    as both inefficient and inequitable.      Recent research has

focused on regulationand its reform.70          Phased deregulationof wellheed

prices began in l97g, yet field markets still show few signs of a balance

between supply snd demand.      Some researchers have attempted to measure

the effects of price regulation;        others have offered proposals     for

regulatoryreform.       Maintained throughout much of this        literature is the
assumption that the use of long-term contracts        is   an   obstacle to   economic

efficiency.
     y             regulation is blamed for the problem associated with
            example,
large 'take—cr—pam" requirements in contracts negotiated just prior to
the onset ci deregulation. That contracts are long-term is blamed icr
the problem's persistence. Many poliryproposals have attempted to force
changes in contracting practices, either by abrogating existing contracts
of directing all parties to recnntract. Others suggest changes in tbo
instituticnsl structure of the industry, thereby redocing the need for
long—tern    contracts.   It is often argced, for    example,     that a switch       from

private to    common   carriage would allow spot markets and short-term
marketing arrangements       to displace     long-term contracts     We have noted to

this paper the widespread ose of long-term contracts prior to the adveot

nf binding wellhead price regulation, and have argued that such contracts

were effective at coordinatingproduction and exchange 10              the presence      of

potential    opportunistic   behavior.

     Two differences between the provisions in the contracts we studied

and more recent marketing arrangements          are important      First,   recent


contracts generally provide for downward          price and quantity    adjustments

                                                         are of much shorter
when demand falls.       Second, recent arrangements

duration    than their early postwar counterparts, and they typically
feature "escape" clauses allowing either the pipeline or the producer to
termioate the agreement. Otherwise, provisions in recent agreements
closely resemble provisions in older contracts Contracts from the 1950s
did not oeed to incorporate the dovnward price flexibility observed in
recent marketing arrangements, since natural gas prices were rising
rapidly in real terms. Had such flexibility been needed, there is no
reason a    aori to suppose      that   it   could not have been generated
     The much       shorter duration of recent contracts arises        from   current
                       in the industry        Low market prices have reduced new
supply   conditions

exploration,    and take—or-pay provostons have made        it   difficult for
pipelines to substitute cheaper gos from new sources for more eap005cve
gas covered in existing contracts duch of the contract:og co recent
years has, in fart, been 'rerontracrtog     In scar catec, the original

long-term contracts have expired, sod the relationship is maintaoned
using short—term arraogements or spur-market transaction. In other
cases, short—term exchange replacee long-term contracts on a temporary
basis;     if the   arrangement is terminated for any reason, the reletonship
                                              38



 reverts back to      an existing    long—term     contract7'    That is,   these short-
 term   contracts    are   used by producers and     pipelines   that ace already

 "hooked up."       No substantial new specific capital is invalved.            To the
 extent that specific        investments    are the primary mctive for long—term

 contracts in these markets,         the shorter length nf recent agreements           is

not surprising.

        Our analysis suggests that, as new relatiosohips are begun,
                                                                    private

carriage   will once again entail long—term contractiog. Gathering lines
be   needed to connect pipelines with new producers, and the capital

involved will be both long—lived and specific. Producers will  be reluc-
tant to      the investments in these lines unless they are assured of
           make

long-term access to pipeline capacity. Pipelines will likely refuse to
make theae investments unless producers are willing to commit their

reserves on a lang—term basis.             Short-term contracts cannot provide these

assurances.

        This focus on the efficiency role of long-term contracts has impor-

tant policy implications.           If pipelines continue to operate as private

carriers,    long—term contracting will likely reemerge as an important

means of organized exchange,         along with short—termmarketing          agreements
and spot-market transactions.          Our research indicates that during the

1950s, long-term contracts         aerved to allocate    resources   efficiently,

while mitigating the potential for opportunistic            behavior.       Although

these older contracts contained few merhanisms for downward price and

quantity    adjustments,     there is no reason that they could net have done so

if there had been      a   need.   Future long-term contracts will likely contain

such mechanisms.

  10.     Theoretical   analyses    of bilateral-monopoly       bargaining date to early
 nenrlaaairal writera.         Our approach parallels closely models of bilateral

 bargaining between firms and labor unions, which emphasize               runtracra      far

 wages and employment.         Such bargaining problems         stem from the importance
 of specific capital and asyetrir
                                  information, both of which figure

 prominently in the natural gas market.              It is well known in the labor

 ernnnmirs     literature    that optimal contracting in the presence        of asymetric
 information will involve a nperlfied relationship between
                                                           employment and
 wage. See for example Robert S. Hall and David H. Lilien, Efficient

regulation,       which is essentially baned on rates of return.          Gae purchased

by a pipeline at various prices is "rolled in" to cone up with an average

acquisition test.

15.     An alternative to     long—term                 in these circunstances      is
                                          contracting

that the transaction-specific         assets he jointly owned, through vertical

integration or a jnsnt venture between buyer and seller.                The issue nf

joint ownership      versus long—term tuntructing does nat          arise here because
                                        42



downstream    cost-of—service   regulations    discouraged     pipeline   companies

from owning natural gas wells.       In the Hope Natural Gas oase (320 U.s.

603 (1944)), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Federal Power Commission
                                              ——
(the regulatory body in this industry              regulation is   described    in

detail        practice of computing mat oi service for regulated utili-
          below)
ties on an original cost rather than replacement cost basis. Thus,
integrated producer-pipeline companies could not take advantage of rising
wellhead prices. The fraction of U.S. natural gas produced by pipeline
oompanies    dropped from 36 percent at the time of the Supreme Court

decision to 13 percent ten years later,            See Arlon P. Tuusiug and Connie

contract    negotiations,   they are not merely a means of creating a spot

market under another name.

30.    Short—term contracts were less desirable tn pipelines because they

could not be counted toward their
                                  regulatory reserve requirements.                  The

examine the robustness of the definitions            we use, we also oonsidersd the

350   (iO percent)     have only one contract, and 517 (almost 90 percent) have

five or fewer.

42.     These    firm-specific   measures       are not higily correlated with the

market—specific       measures   of concentration.        For example, on the buyer

side:

        rorr (C2, H)    = 0.914,

        corr (Market share, 02)        = 0.367,

        corr (Market share, H)        = 0.2i9;

        sod on the seller side:

        corr (04, H)    = 0.820,

        rorr (Market sbsre, C4) =         0,086,
        corr (Market share, H)           0.026.




43      Our discussion suggests         us "g     ne "umber of   c        racts as the app n

priste measure of producer size, and total volume for pipeline size.

Experiments witb       both   volu,me and number      of contracts produced similar

                                              traceable to economies nf
scsle in trsnsmissinn. It is important to control for this since, on
sccnunt of lower transport costs for large deliveries, a premco.m price
                                                46




can be offered to such producers.               The sources of cost savings are

reductions      in construction      and opersting      costs and in costs of rights of

way per mcf of      gathered      gas.     MacAvoy   (see note 15,   pqa) estimates         that

these    volusse-driven differences in costs are substantial retative to the
average wetlhead price.
45. in       this market, there is tittle question of the statistical exogeneity
of volume in      considering      the price of fered a given well.           While   explorstioc
and    drilling may   be price—sensftive, gas           wells,   once sunk, produce       at
maximum sustainable yield because of transmission—cost considerations                          and
because of the common-pool prshlem.
46.     We   also experimented with a variable representing the 'ii stance ot
the market      from consuming regions.          The variable     was csnstructed using

FF0 maps,      by measuring the distance along major pipeline routes from the
center    of each market to selected reference points; the method of con-

struction is available from the authors upon request.                     The cuefficiont on

this variable in the price equations was always statistically insignifi-
cantly different from sero, and its inclusion did not affect cur esti-
mates of other coefficients; we exclude the variable from the results

repsrted in      Table 5.     Because      of this   problem and since     distances are not
comparable across regions (because              of, e.g., varying terrain, weather,
and    rights of way),      we   include    dummy variables for the Nidrontinent and

Rocky Mountain      regions.
48.    Dummy    varishles are appropriate bars only              if the   stspe of the    demand

curve   is constant.        We have used them to avoid estimating            a   demand

function, which would lead us into simultaneityproblems.

51.     Some       motivation for this      partica.ar approach is        needed.   MacAvoy

(see    note 15,      p5) examined          price equations      for   eab   FPC market sepa-

rately over various periods                covered by the data.        This strategy would not

be appropriatefor our purposes, since we want to cnnsldr the influence

of both market- and transactrun-related                  variables on prcce determination.

We did, however, examine the robustness of our estimates (in Table 5) of

the effects of transaction—related                variables     by using fixed msrket

effects instead sf our measurs oi market concentratconon the buyer and

seller sides.          The fixed effects reflected the patterns predicted by the

market structure variables, and the Coefficient estimates on the firm and

transactionvariables of interest were srmilsr to those reported in Table                          3.


52.    The results reported in Table              I   are robust to estimation over the

full set of 1424 contracts.

53.    This is probably more isportant for prodncers                    than for pipelines,

who have better informaticn abnct downstream demand conditions.                         Indeed,

when we include only produ er vnlnscu and buyer total contracts, the sane

pattern emerges.

54.    This is true under a 'two-party                 ffI¼   4ause.    There are also a few

'three-party'         .  .swhereunder the pipeLne             ca onlcged to match the

over   the take-or-pay provision in       Hubbard and Weiner and Masten and
