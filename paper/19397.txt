                                             ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the effects of health insurance and new antiviral treatments on HIV testing
rates among the U.S. general population using nationally representative data from the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) for the years 1993 to 2002. We estimate recursive bivariate probit
models with insurance coverage and HIV testing as the dependent variables. We use changes in Medicaid
eligibility and distribution of firm size over time within a state as instruments for insurance coverage.
The results suggest that (a) insurance coverage increases HIV testing rates, (b) insurance coverage
increases HIV testing rates more among the high risk population, and (c) the advent of Highly Active
Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) increases the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing for high
risk populations.

1. Introduction


The number of uninsured Americans has risen steadily during the last decade. In

1999, about 40 million Americans lacked health insurance, and in 2009 more than

50 million were uninsured. The recent economic downturn has exacerbated the

problem with the number of uninsured rising even more rapidly compared to

historical trends with 6 million more uninsured since 2007. Health care reform in the

U.S. seeks to reverse this trend by providing subsidies for insurance coverage to low

income persons and by creating insurance exchanges to promote competition among

health insurers. This naturally raises the question: How will changes in uninsurance

affect the health of Americans now and in the future? It is well understood that lack

of health insurance can affect health status by reducing access to treatment,

especially new and expensive treatments (Bhattacharya, Goldman and Sood 2003;

Card, Dobkin and Maestas 2008; Card, Dobkin and Maestas 2009). However, it is

less clear how uninsurance affects health related behaviors which might affect long

term population health. In this paper, we seek to investigate this issue in the context

of HIV/AIDS—a disease that has claimed more than half a million lives in the U.S.

and about 25 million lives worldwide. CDC estimates that approximately 50,000

people are newly infected with HIV each year in the United States.



There are several reasons that make HIV/AIDS an interesting case study for

examining the effects of health insurance on population health and health related

behaviors. First, insurance coverage might have competing effects on health and

health related behaviors in the context of HIV. On one hand, insurance coverage

saves lives by improving access to expensive but efficacious HIV treatments

(Bhattacharya, Goldman and Sood 2003). On the other hand, insurance coverage

might increase the spread of HIV by increasing risky sexual behavior among the HIV

positive (Lakdawalla, Sood and Goldman 2006).         However, prior work does not

address how insurance coverage might affect HIV testing rates, a question we


                                                                                      2
address in the current paper. Second, new but expensive treatments for HIV –

Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) - were introduced in the mid-1990s.

The introduction of HAART allows us to understand how the effects of insurance

coverage on health related behavior are influenced by health care innovation. In

particular, we study how the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing differed in

the pre- and post-HAART era. Finally, changes in HIV testing rates induced by

changes in health insurance might have significant externalities in terms of changing

the dynamics of the HIV epidemic. Thus, the results of the analysis are relevant for

understanding the welfare implications of government-financed health insurance

expansions in the U.S. as well as in several African countries ravaged by HIV.



We estimate recursive bivariate probit models with insurance coverage and HIV

testing as the dependent variables. We use changes in Medicaid eligibility and

distribution of firm size over time within a state as instruments for insurance

coverage. The validity of these instrumental variables is discussed in detail in section

4 and section 5. The results suggest that insurance coverage increases HIV testing

among both the high risk and low risk populations. The results also suggest that the

advent of HAART increases the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing for high

risk populations but lowers the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing for low

risk populations.



Overall these results suggest that insurance coverage has the potential to have

significant effects on health related behaviors. The paper also contributes to

literature on the economic epidemiology of HIV. Past work has shown that increased

insurance coverage save lives and improves welfare of the infected by improving

access to HIV treatment. The results from this paper show that insurance coverage

might also have long term effects on welfare of the current uninfected by altering HIV

testing rates and hence the dynamics of the epidemic. The results of this paper also

add to our understanding of the motivations for HIV testing. For example, a recent

paper in this field uses data from a randomized experiment to show that small

                                                                                       3
financial incentives or subsidies for HIV testing can have significant effects on HIV

testing rates in poor countries (Thornton 2008). Our results suggest that HIV testing

rates can not only be improved by subsidizing HIV testing but also by improving

access to treatment.



The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the conceptual

framework; Section 3 describes the data used in the estimation of the empirical

model; Section 4 presents the empirical results and section 5 concludes.




2. Conceptual Framework
To examine the potential implications of insurance on HIV testing, one needs to

understand the potential benefits and costs for HIV testing or not testing. Prior work

suggests two benefits from testing (Tomas J. Philipson and Posner 1995). First, HIV

testing is a way to signal quality or HIV negative status to potential partners in the

market for mutually beneficial sexual trades. Signaling HIV negative status might

enable a person to attract a greater number of sexual partners. Second, HIV testing

is motivated by the desire to seek early treatment – if a person knows that he is

infected then he can start treatment early. Finally, sometimes HIV testing is required

for purposes of employment or for health related purposes such as donating blood.

Insurance coverage can affect HIV testing rates through several pathways. First, for

individuals seeking to test because of a desire to start HIV treatment, testing is more

valuable when treatment costs are lower. Since insured consumers face lower

treatment costs than uninsured consumers they enjoy greater benefit from testing.

That is, for individuals seeking to test because of a desire to start HIV treatment,

testing is more valuable when treatment costs say $2,000 rather than $15,000.

Second, insurance might encourage testing by reducing the monetary costs of testing

as insurance plans might offer free or subsidized testing services to their




                                                                                      4
beneficiaries. Third, insurance likely increases contacts with the health care system

and therefore increases the chance that a doctor or nurse recommends HIV testing.



The effects of insurance on HIV testing likely depend on the risk status of persons

getting tested. High risk individuals are more likely to test positive compared to low

risk individuals. Those who test positive primarily benefit from testing due to

initiation of treatment. Since insurance reduces HIV treatment costs it might

increase the value of testing more for high risk individuals since they are more likely

to test positive and thus more likely to enjoy the benefits of lower treatment costs.

High risk individuals are also more likely to increase sexual activity in response to a

negative test result. The reasoning is that the signaling value of a negative HIV test is

higher for high risk individuals compared to low risk individuals. In other words,

high risk individuals are more likely to be surprised by a negative test result and

therefore more likely to alter sexual behavior in response to a negative test result

(Boozer and Philipson 2000). Low risk individuals expect to be HIV negative and thus

a negative test result is unlikely to change behavior. The consequent increase in

sexual activity among high risk might increase the risk of future HIV infection and

thus increase expected HIV treatment costs. Since insurance subsidizes treatment

costs it might again affect incentives for testing more for high risk individuals.

Finally, increased contact with doctors and nurses due to insurance is more likely to

affect high risk individuals. High risk individuals might be more likely to use health

care and doctors or nurses are more likely to recommend HIV testing to high risk

individuals.



New treatments that are effective but expensive might mediate the effects of

insurance coverage on incentives for HIV testing in complex ways. New expensive

treatments increase the value of subsidized treatments available through insurance.

That is an insurance policy that covers 80% of treatment costs is more valuable if

treatment costs $15,000 rather than $5,000. This implies that the effect of insurance

on HIV testing would increase with the advent of new expensive treatments such as

                                                                                        5
HAART. However, new treatments also reduce the signaling value of a negative test as

potential partners are less worried about getting infected. This implies a smaller

increase in the risk of infection and decreased expected burden of future infections.

Thus, if the reduction in signaling value dominates then new treatments might

reduce the effect of insurance on HIV testing. Again the effects might be

heterogeneous and depend on the risk of infection or the probability of testing

positive.



Our empirical model is motivated by the theoretical framework above. In particular,

we estimate the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing rates and allow the

effects of insurance on HIV testing to differ by risk status. We also examine the extent

to which the introduction of HAART affects the link between insurance and HIV

testing. Finally, we allow the effects of HAART to vary by risk status. In summary, we

aim to answer the following questions:

   (1) How does health insurance affect HIV testing? And how does the effect of

       insurance on HIV testing differ for high risk and low risk individuals?

   (2) How does the introduction of HAART affect the impact of insurance on HIV

       testing? And how is this effect of HAART different for high risk people and low

       risk individuals?




3. Empirical Strategy


We observe two discrete outcomes: having health insurance and undergoing HIV

testing, which take the form of           . In a bivariate probit model these outcomes

are modeled using a latent variable approach where we only observe whether the

latent variable is above or below zero.



We use a Recursive Bivariate Probit model to estimate the causal effect of health

insurance coverage on the probability of testing for HIV.     The recursive structure


                                                                                       6
builds on a first equation for the potentially endogenous dummy–insurance status

and a second equation determining the outcome of interest-decision to undergo an

HIV test. We estimate separate models from each risk group                                  .

We discuss the empirical definitions of the risk group in the data section of the paper.


                             ,                                                        (1)
                   .                                                                  (2)


                                                       ,                              (3)
               ,                                                                      (4)



In (1)-(4),     is the latent variable for HIV testing,         is the latent variable for

health insurance,           is a dummy variable for post HAART years (i.e. following

introduction of HAART in1996),                                       where            are

demographic variables including age, gender, education, race, and income level. We

add state fixed-effects (        ) to control for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity

across states and year fixed-effects (         ) to control for secular time trends. In

particular, We assume that                  is independent of        and distributed as

bivariate normal with mean zero, each has unit variance, and                                .

Standard errors are clustered at the state level.



In this model, insurance status and HIV testing are linked for two reasons. First,

insurance status enters as a regressor in the HIV testing equation – that is,

insurance is causally linked to HIV testing. Second, unobserved determinants of HIV

testing and insurance status (the error terms in each equation) are correlated. For

example, individuals engaged in risky behaviors might be more likely to undergo an

HIV test but less likely to have insurance.



Our model belongs to the general class of simultaneous equation models with both

continuous and discrete endogenous variables introduced by Heckman (1978). In

                                                                                            7
this general context, Heckman (1978) argues that only the full rank of the regressor

matrix is needed to identify the parameters. However, Maddala (1983) asserts that

the parameters of the second equation are not identified if there are no exclusion

restrictions on the exogenous variables. However, Wilde (2000) shows that this

assertion is not true and exclusion restrictions are not necessary for identification as

long as each equation contains at least one exogenous regressor, i.e., theoretical

identification does not require exclusion restrictions if there is sufficient variation in

the data.



Although the model is identified by its non-linear functional form even in the absence

of exclusion restrictions, identification by functional form relies heavily on the

assumption of bivariate normality. Under distributional misspecification, exclusion

restrictions might help to make the estimation results more robust. In a Monte Carlo

simulation study, Chiara Monfardini and Radice (2008) show that, even under

correct distributional assumptions, the lack of availability of a valid instrument will

make exogeneity tests unreliable.



It is therefore a common practice to impose exclusion restrictions to improve

identification. These exclusion restrictions (instruments),       , should be causally

linked to insurance status and should affect HIV testing only through their effect on

insurance status. We use expansion in Medicaid coverage and changes in the

distribution of firm size within states overtime as instruments for insurance

coverage. They are discussed in greater detail in the data section.



The key parameters of interest are the parameters related to the causal effect of

health insurance coverage on HIV testing. In particular,          , specifies the causal

effect of health insurance on HIV testing for risk group                           in the

pre-HAART era. Similarly,          , specifies the causal effect of health insurance on

HIV testing in the post HAART era. Since the bivariate probit model is non-linear

these parameters cannot be directly interpreted as marginal effects. However, it is

                                                                                         8
straightforward to derive marginal effects based on these parameter values and the

cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. We denote the

corresponding marginal effects by    . We next describe the data used for estimating

the bivariate probit model.




4. Data


   4.1 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

BRFSS is a population-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey administered

yearly to a representative sample of non-institutionalized U.S. adults aged 18 years

and older that inquires about various health behaviors associated with premature

morbidity and mortality. The survey has been approved by institutional review

boards in each state, and participants provide oral consent to be interviewed.

Interviewers record answers using computer software. We used data from 1993 to

2002 surveys. Below we describe the variables from BRFSS that we used in our

analysis.



   HIV Testing of Adults Under 65

We measured HIV testing as the self-report of an HIV test within 12 months before

the interview. The HIV/AIDS section of the current BRFSS core questionnaire

collects the following information: whether the respondent was ever tested for HIV

and, if so, the month and year of the last test and the facility where last tested.

Respondents were coded as having tested (tested = 1) if they reported that they tested

for HIV sometime in the year preceding their interview date; we assigned a value of 0

otherwise. Respondents who had never been tested for HIV were coded as 0 because

they had not been tested in the preceding 1 year.


   HIV-Risk Group: Self-perceived HIV Risk




                                                                                     9
Subject’s self-perception of HIV risk was based on their response to the core BRFSS

question that asked: “What are your chances of getting infected with HIV, the virus

that causes AIDS?” Responses were categorized as High, Medium, Low, None, Not

applicable or Refused. We defined those who reported having a high or medium risk

of HIV infection as the high risk group and those who evaluated themselves as having

low or no risk as the low risk group.



   Demographics and Health Insurance Status

Demographic characteristics in the BRFSS include gender, age, education (Less than

a high school degree, High school degree, Some college or AA degree), marital status,

ethnicity (Non-white or Hispanic). The BRFSS also includes information on whether

the respondent is employed and their income level (Less than 200% of federal poverty

line (FPL) or More than 200% of FPL). Finally, BRFSS asks respondents “Do you have

any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as

HMOs, or government plans such as Medicare?” Respondents that answered yes to

this question are coded as insured.



   4.2 Instruments

We used the two sets of instruments for insurance choice – Medicaid expansion and

firm size distribution. These instruments are similar to those used by Bhattacharya,

Goldman and Sood (2003) who estimate the causal effect of insurance on HIV related

mortality.



The first instrument captures availability of public insurance through the Medicaid

program. There has been a significant expansion of Medicaid eligibility with

significant variation across states in the pace at which these expansions have

occurred. Prior research documents a strong association between Medicaid

expansions and insurance coverage despite evidence that public insurance

crowds-out private insurance coverage (Jonathan Gruber and Simon 2008). However,

other research finds no evidence of a crowding out effect of Medicaid expansion (John

                                                                                   10
C. Ham, Ozbeklik and Shore-Sheppard 2011; Lara Shore-Sheppard, Buchmueller

and Jensen 2000). Medicaid is also an important source of coverage for HIV+

individuals with about half of the HIV insured receiving coverage from Medicaid

(Bhattacharya, Goldman and Sood 2003). Medicaid eligibility criteria vary from state

to state and change over time, but the eligibility criteria are mandated by a Federal

statute as the federal government pays about half of Medicaid expenditures. We

measure changes in Medicaid eligibility within a state by estimating the percentage of

Medicaid 1115 waiver beneficiaries over the total Medicaid beneficiaries in every

state and year. These data were obtained from Centers for Medicaid and Medicare

Service. These data are available online at

https://www.cms.gov/MedicaidDataSourcesGenInfo/MSIS/list.asp accessed

August 20, 2012.



The reason we choose the fraction of 1115 beneficiaries as an instrument is that

section 1115 demonstration authority is one of the ways that States can expand

eligibility for the Medicaid program beyond what is authorized under federal law (J.

Jordan, Adamo and Ehrmann 2000). Waivers allow states to provide coverage and

deliver services to the low-income population by using federal Medicaid funds in

ways that do not conform to existing federal standards and options. Medicaid section

1115 waivers have recently been promoted as a way to expand coverage without

committing new federal resources. About 13 states have utilized section 1115

demonstrations to increase Medicaid enrollment by expanding eligibility for

state-sponsored health insurance (Teresa A. Coughlin and Zuckerman 2008). To

date, ten states have also applied for Section 1115 waivers to expand Medicaid

coverage to people living with HIV who are not legally considered disabled and three

HIV 1115 waivers have been approved in the District of Columbia, Maine, and

Massachusetts (ASPE 2009).




                                                                                    11
The second set of instruments capture availability of private insurance. These data

are obtained from the Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB) available online at

http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/data.html accessed August 20, 2012.

In particular, we use data on the distribution of firm size in every state and year to

construct two instruments at the state-year level (Bhattacharya, et al. 2009): (1) the

percentage of workers employed in firms with 100 to 499 employees, and (2) the

percentage of workers employed in firms with 500 or more employees. These

instruments are strong predictors of insurance coverage as large firms are much

more likely to offer insurance coverage. For example, data from the 2008 Current

Population Survey show that 32% of workers in firms with less than 25 employees

are uninsured and only 13% of workers in private firms with more than 500

employees are uninsured. For our analysis we interact these instruments with

poverty status as prior research suggests that the effects of availability of insurance

on take-up of insurance might vary with income (Ham et al. 2011)



The proposed instruments are valid under two conditions. First, they should be

strong predictors of insurance coverage. Second, they should affect HIV testing only

through their effect on insurance choice. In the next section, we show that the

instruments are strong predictors of insurance coverage. The second assumption

cannot be directly tested. However, it seems unlikely that changes in firm size

distribution within a state or timing of adoption of 1115 waivers (our models have

state fixed effects) would be related to HIV testing, except through insurance

coverage. However, one concern is that variation in our instruments might be

correlated with state economic conditions or other characteristics correlated with

HIV testing. To address this concern, Table 1 compares five important state

characteristics (unemployment rate, disposable income, poverty rate, percent White

and age distribution of population) between 19 states with an increasing proportion

of 1115 waiver beneficiaries over total Medicaid beneficiaries from 1993 to 2003 with

31 states without 1115 waiver or with a decreasing proportion of 1115 waiver


                                                                                     12
beneficiaries over the total Medicaid beneficiaries in the same period. We find that

not only are the levels of these characteristics similar across these two types of states

but trends in these characteristics over the sample period are also similar. This

allays concerns about systematic differences in characteristics of states with high

versus low values of our instrumental variable for public insurance coverage. Table 2

compares the same state characteristics between 41 states with rising proportion of

employment in medium and large firms from 1993 to 2003 to 9 states with falling

proportion of employment in medium and large firms from 1993 to 2003. Again, the

data show little difference in levels or trends in state characteristics across states

with high versus low values of our instrumental variable for private insurance

coverage. In another similar test of validity of our instrumental variables, we estimate

alternate models which include these state-year level variables as covariates. We

find that our results are robust to the inclusion of these state-year level variables as

covariates. The results section provides more details on this specification test.




5 Results


Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics for the analytic sample. The average age of

respondents is 40 years and slightly more than half the respondents are females.

About 60% have some college education, more than a third have incomes below

200% of the federal poverty line and 85% have health insurance. Overall, about 16%

of the respondents report testing for HIV in the previous year and not surprisingly,

the testing rate among high risk individuals is 10 percentage points higher than the

rate among low risk individuals. High risk individuals also are less likely to be white,

female, and single. High risk individuals have similar insurance coverage and

education.



Table 4 reports results from the recursive bivariate probit model of HIV testing and

health insurance coverage.    We estimate separate regressions for the low and high


                                                                                       13
risk groups. Key marginal effects and their standard errors are reported in Table 5.

We use 5,000 bootstrap replications clustered at the state-year level to estimate

standard errors.



The results suggest that health insurance coverage significantly increases the

probability of testing for HIV in both the pre and post HAART period. For example,

among the low risk population insurance coverage increases the probability of HIV

testing by 2.6 percentage points in the pre-HAART period. Similarly, among the high

risk population insurance coverage increases the probability of HIV testing by 2.7

percentage points in the pre-HAART period.      Second, the results suggest that the

effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing are larger for the high risk group in both

the pre-HAART and HAART period. For example, in the post-HAART period insurance

increases the probability of HIV testing for the high risk group by 4.8 percentage

points. In contrast, in the post-HAART period insurance increases the probability of

HIV testing for the low risk group by 1.8 percentage points. Third, the results suggest

that HAART increases the effects of insurance on HIV testing for the high risk

group. Specifically, the marginal effect of insurance on HIV testing for the high risk

group increases from 2.9 percentage points in the pre-HAART period to 4.8

percentage points in the post-HAART period. We do not observe a similar increase in

the marginal effect of insurance for the low risk group. In fact, the evidence suggests

a modest decrease in the effect of insurance on HIV testing for the low risk group.



Instrument Validity

The results in Table 4 suggest that our instrumental variables are statistically

significantly related to insurance coverage. Firm size distribution is a strong

predictor of insurance coverage for the low risk population and Medicaid eligibility

expansion is a strong predictor of insurance coverage for high risk population. We

also find that availability of both public and private employer provided insurance has

a stronger effect on insurance coverage for poor rather than rich households. In both

the high risk and low risk models the instruments are jointly significant with a Chi-2

                                                                                      14
statistic of 18 (p-value = 0.0062) and 42.84 (pvalue = 0.0000) respectively.



Since our instruments vary at the state year level, one concern is that they might be

correlated with other state year level determinants of HIV testing. To address this

concern, Tables 6 and 7 reports results from models that include additional

state-year level covariates. The additional covariates are poverty rate, unemployment

rate, per capita income and population age structure. The results are robust to the

inclusion of these state controls. As before, we find that health insurance increases

the likelihood of testing for HIV and that the effects of insurance coverage on HIV

testing are larger for the high risk group. Finally, we also find that the advent of

HAART increases the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing for the high risk

population but not for the low risk population.


Finally, in a second indirect test of instrument validity, we checked the robustness of

our results to the inclusion or exclusion of certain sets of instruments. This test is in

the spirit of the Hausman over-identification test and is based on the principle that if

all our instruments are valid then the estimates obtained by using only a subset of

instruments should differ only as a result of sampling error (Hausman 1978). Thus,

for this test we estimated two different sets of models. The first set of models only

used the instruments related to availability of private insurance and the second set of

models only used the instruments related to availability of public insurance. The

results from both these sets of models were virtually identical to the model that used

both sets of instruments. Thus, these results also suggest that our instruments are

valid.




6. Conclusions


In this paper we analyzed the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing behavior

and how this link between testing and insurance coverage changed with HIV


                                                                                       15
treatment innovations. The results suggest that (a) insurance coverage increases HIV

testing among both the high risk and low risk populations (b) insurance has larger

effects on HIV testing for the high risk population, and (c) the advent of effective HIV

treatment increased the effects of insurance coverage on HIV testing for high risk

group.



Overall these results suggest that providing insurance or subsidized treatment can

be an effective strategy for increasing HIV testing rates. These results have important

implication for developing economies which are considering subsidizing treatment

and for developed economies like the U.S. where budget pressures might force

several states to reduce the generosity of public insurance coverage for HIV.



The results suggest that providing subsidized treatment not only improves the health

of the infected but also has important effects on the dynamics of the HIV epidemic.

Prior research suggests that knowing one’s HIV status can reduce risky sexual

activity. For example, a meta-analytic review of published research from1985 to 1997

found that after testing and counseling, HIV positive participants reduced

unprotected intercourse and increased condom use. A more recent review (Gary

Marks, et al. 2005) found that the prevalence of high-risk sexual behavior is reduced

substantially after people become aware they are HIV+. Following these findings,

Marks et al. (2006) estimate the proportion of sexual transmission of HIV attributable

to HIV-positive aware and unaware persons in the USA. They found that the

transmission rate from the unaware group was 3.5 times that of the aware group.

Similarly, Thornton (2008) found in an experiment in rural Malawi that sexually

active HIV-positive individuals who learned their results are three times more likely

to purchase condoms two months later than sexually active HIV-positive individuals

who did not learn their results. These prior studies indicate increased HIV testing

can potentially have a large impact on HIV transmission.     Juxtaposing these results

from the prior literature with the results from this study suggest that insurance

coverage might reduce risky sexual behavior and reduce the spread of HIV.

                                                                                      16
The results of this study also improve our understanding of the motivation for HIV

testing and how changes in treatment technology can influence HIV testing behavior.

The results are consistent with the notion that high risk individuals are motivated to

test primarily due to the desire to seek early treatment. Therefore, improvements in

treatment technology increase the incentives for HIV+ persons to test.



Overall, the lessons learnt from this research might have wider applicability. They

suggest that public policy and health care innovation can have important and

complex effects on health related behaviors. Policymakers should be cognizant of

such effects as they design policies to improve health.
