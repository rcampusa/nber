                                            ABSTRACT

       In this paper I argue that corporate finance theory, empirical research, practical applications,

and policy recommendations are deeply rooted in an underlying theory of the firm. I also argue that

while the existing theories have delivered very important and useful insights, they seem to be quite

ineffective in helping us cope with the new type of firms that are emerging. I outline the

characteristics that a new theory of the firm should satisfy and how such a theory could change the

way we do corporate finance, both theoretically and empirically.

Introduction

        For a relatively young researcher like myself, there is a very strong tendency to look at

the history of corporate finance and be overwhelmed by the giants of the recent past. A field that

40 years ago was little more than a collection of cookbook recipes that reflected practitioners’

common sense is today a bona fide discipline, taught not only to future practitioners but also to

doctoral students, both in business schools and in economic departments -- a discipline whose

ideas are now influencing other areas of economics, such as industrial organization, monetary

policy, and asset pricing. The quality and the impact of the contributions that were made to the

field during the last 40 years, and in particular in the period from the late 1970s to the late 1980s,

justify the widespread feeling that the “golden age” of corporate finance is behind us.

        Two excellent recent surveys of the main areas of corporate finance reinforce this sense:

the capital structure survey by Harris and Raviv (1991) and the corporate governance survey by
                                                                                                          2


Shleifer and Vishny (1997). Both are very lucid categorizations of the existing literature. This

lucidity is the product not only of the ability of their authors, but also of the ripeness of the

moment. Both surveys follow a period of intense activity in the field, and in a certain sense, they

close it. It is especially noteworthy that, ten years later, the survey by Harris and Raviv (1991)

would not necessitate any dramatic rewriting. While there have certainly been important

contributions afterwards, they have been mostly empirical, and they have not undermined the

conceptual framework underlying Harris and Raviv’s analyses.

        The temptation to dedicate this piece on the state of the art in corporate finance to a

celebration of past achievements, thus, is very strong, but it would fall short of the task assigned

me: to provide the readers of the Journal of Finance with an overview of what is new and

exciting in the field of corporate finance. Thus, rather than taking comfort from the great

successes of the past, I will focus on the challenges the future presents. In doing so, I feel like a

dwarf who has the arrogance to try to see further than his giant predecessors. In my defense, I

invoke Giordano Bruno’s famous line that I am a dwarf, but I am standing on the shoulders of the

giants of the past. Like Giordano Bruno, I will inevitably present a very personal view of what I

see from those shoulders. I hope I will not be condemned to the same fate.

        The essential point of the paper is extremely simple. Corporate finance is the study of the

way firms are financed. Theory of the firm, thus, has a tremendous impact on the way we think

about corporate finance, the way we do empirical research, the policy implications we derive, and

the topics we choose to study. Even the most practical applications of this discipline, like the way

we value firms, are unconsciously slaves to some underlying theory of the firm.

        The first goal of this paper is to show why this is the case. I will link the central issues in

three main areas of corporate finance (financing, governance, and valuation) to the main theories

of the firm. In doing so, I will also show that, in spite of some shortcomings, the existing theories

of the firm have been quite successful in providing an intellectual backbone for the principles of

corporate finance we all know and teach.
                                                                                                     3


          The type of firm modeled by these theories, however, was the traditional business

corporation, which emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century and has since prevailed. It

is a very asset-intensive and highly vertically integrated firm, with a tight control over its

employees -- control that is concentrated at the top of the organizational pyramid. Its boundaries

are clear-cut and sufficiently stable that one can take them for granted while considering the

impact of financing and governance choices. In such a world, once the concept of the firm is

defined, most corporate finance can be developed without a continuous reference to the

underlying theory of the firm.

          Not any more. The nature of the firm is changing. Large conglomerates have been

broken up, and their units have been spun off as stand-alone companies. Vertically integrated

manufacturers have relinquished direct control of their suppliers and moved towards looser forms

of collaboration. Human capital is emerging as the most crucial asset. As a result of these

changes, the boundaries of the firms are in constant flux and financing and governance choices

can easily change them. The influence of theory of the firm is no longer limited to defining the

object of analysis. The interaction between the nature of the firm and corporate finance issues has

become so intimate that answering the fundamental questions in theory of the firm has become a

precondition for any further advancement in corporate finance.

          The second and most important goal of the paper, thus, is to discuss these fundamental

questions and show how addressing them might change the way we will do corporate finance in

the future. I identify four such questions. The first and fundamental one is how an organization

devoid of unique assets succeeds in acquiring power that differs from ``ordinary market

contracting between any two people" Alchian and Demsetz (1972, p. 777). An answer to this

question will help us to define not only the boundaries of the firm, but also the role of outside

equity.

          The second question is how is this power maintained and enhanced, and how is it lost?

An answer to this question can explain what factors underlie a firm’s ability to capture growth
                                                                                                       4


opportunities or its failure to do so. Understanding these factors will not only affect the way we

value firms, but will also create a fundamental building block toward a theory of

entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is the process by which new firms are created. But new firms

are created to exploit growth options existing firms cannot or do not want to exploit. Thus, a

theory able to explain what growth options existing firms are willing and able to exploit will also

identify the opportunities for entrepreneurial activity.

        The third question is how this authority-based system operates in a way different from

ordinary market contracting. Not only would an answer to this question enable us to understand

theoretically the effects of mergers and spin-offs, but also it will bring new life to the debate on

the costs and benefits of corporate diversification.

        The fourth and final question that a theory of the firm should address is how the surplus

generated by the firm is allocated among its members. Such an understanding will help us derive

a new approach to valuing firms that is consistent with the new nature of firms.

        To illustrate concretely the benefits that can be reaped by answering these questions, I

present a recent attempt in this direction and the implications that can stem from it.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section I analyzes what corporate finance is

about and why it assumed this name. Section II explains why the name carried important

consequences for the type of research that has been done and the type of problems that have been

ignored. Section III discusses how corporate finance is deeply rooted in an underlying theory of

the firm and illustrates the implications for corporate finance of the most important theories of the

firm. Section IV argues that while the existing theories have delivered very important and useful

insights, they seem to be quite ineffective in helping us cope with the new type of firms that are

emerging. Section V outlines the characteristics that a new theory of the firm should satisfy and

suggests how such a theory could change the way we do corporate finance, both theoretically and

empirically. Conclusions follow.
                                                                                                       5


I. What Is Corporate Finance?

        Starting a new section dedicated to corporate finance, The Wall Street Journal defined it

very effectively as the “business of financing businesses.” However, Webster's dictionary defines

the verb “to finance" as “to raise or provide funds or capital for.” Why then the adjective

corporate? What is corporate finance about, as opposed to finance in general?

        One could argue that the presence of the adjective corporate stems from the need to

distinguish corporate finance from the other areas of research in finance. However, that would be

an excessively academic-centric view of the world. As the Wall Street Journal’s new section

demonstrates, practitioners feel the need to qualify the term finance with the adjective corporate.

A more compelling explanation is that the adjective corporate helps distinguish corporate finance

from other forms of financing, such as real estate finance, which concerns the financing of assets,

and from personal/consumer finance, which concerns the financing of an individual or household.

Thus, corporate finance means financing of a firm -- not simply an asset, not simply an

individual, but that unique combination of assets and individuals that constitute a firm.

        Interestingly, however, the term that prevailed is corporate finance as opposed to

enterprise finance or firm finance. While it is true that the main legal vehicle used for almost any

economic activity is a corporation, it is not the only one. The choice of this term is probably due

to historical reasons. The practice of actively raising capital from a large public of investors for

the purpose of undertaking new private ventures started with the spread of the legal concept of a

corporation. In fact, during the seventeenth century, early corporations (such as the East India

Company) were granted limited liability with a special royal decree for the purpose of facilitating

the raising of capital for socially beneficial endeavors that involved too much capital and too

much risk to be undertaken by a few wealthy individuals. In spite of some major setbacks, such as

the South Sea Bubble, this system proved so successful that after the middle of the nineteenth

century England started granting freedom to incorporate to all business enterprises. All other

major countries followed promptly. Thus, while financing in some forms go back as far as
                                                                                                     6


Babylonian king Hammurabi (1800 B.C.), it was only after the middle of the nineteenth century

that the raising of funds in the marketplace became common practice. Not surprisingly, the

meaning of the verb “to finance” as “to raise or provide funds or capital for” entered the English

dictionary precisely in those years, i.e., in 1866.
                                                                                                         7


II. Not Just Semantic

        The brief discussion above highlights two important points. First, corporate finance

concerns the financing of enterprises, i.e., unique combinations of physical and human capital.

Second, for historical reasons, the idea of enterprise that became ingrained in corporate finance

coincided with the legal notion of corporation. This historical association was not

inconsequential. In fact, I claim that even before a direct link between the theory of the firm and

corporate finance was established, the field was subconsciously shaped by this identification of

the object of study with the legal entity known as a corporation. Let’s see how.

A. Limited Liability

        The most distinguishing feature of the legal entity called the corporation is limited

liability: investors are not personally responsible for corporate liability. As Black and Scholes

(1973) pointed out in their seminal article, this feature assimilates a firm’s equity to a call option

on the firm, having a strike price equal to the face value of the outstanding debt. This option-like

nature of equity is behind the asset-substitution effect of Jensen and Meckling (1976) and the

underinvestment problem of Myers (1977). These two effects represent the workhorse of the

capital structure literature for the last twenty years.1 Especially before the advent of the literature

on control (e.g., Aghion and Bolton (1992)), most papers on capital structure that were not using

signaling or taxes were based on some variation of the asset-substitution effect or the

underinvestment problem (or both).



B. Corporate Governance

        The other important distinguishing feature of a corporation, which is closely linked with

its origins, is the large set of laws that regulate its working. Some of these laws are simply default

rules, freely disposable by the parties; others, such as the directors’fiduciary duty toward

shareholders, are not.2 The identification of the enterprise with the corporation, together with the

paramount role played by the law in shaping the corporation, have transformed the debate on the
                                                                                                    8


governance of enterprise into a debate on corporate law. While it would be foolish to ignore the

importance of corporate law in the entire governance debate, this should not be at the expense of

other important factors. If we are willing to accept a broader definition of corporate governance

(e.g., Zingales (1998a)), then many other dimensions play an important role. The competitive

structure of input and output markets, for instance, is an often-mentioned but rarely studied

aspect that might have greater impact on the governance of enterprises than the details of the law.

Similarly, the structure and the control of the media industry, which shapes the formation of

public opinion and thus the creation of reputation, has been largely ignored in the growing

literature on corporate governance comparisons across countries; however, this plays no

secondary role.

        For example, shareholders’activist Robert Monks succeeded in initiating some major

changes at Sears, not by means of the norms of the corporate code (his proxy fight failed

miserably), but through the pressure of public opinion. He paid for a full-page announcement in

the Wall Street Journal where he exposed the identities of Sears’directors, labeling them the

“non-performing assets” of Sears (Monks and Minnow (1995)). The embarrassment for the

directors was so great that they implemented all the changes proposed by Monks.

        Why did the ad work where the proxy fight failed? In the United States, newspapers

have a tradition of being accurate and reliable. Readers rely on them to form their opinions.

Sears’directors knew it and realized the cost their inactivity had on their own reputation; and this

is, according to Fama and Jensen (1983), the most important factor motivating corporate

directors. What Fama and Jensen do not emphasize is that this reputation is a function not only of

an agent’s past behavior, but also of the system that transforms this behavior into public

information. In Russia, for instance, all the newspapers are controlled by major oligarchs who

attack each other on a regular basis with major allegations. In such an environment, how could a

director form a reputation for integrity? And why should he care?
                                                                                                      9


C. Dispersed Investors

         While corporations are not necessarily public companies, my brief historical excursus on

the origin of corporate finance can explain why large, publicly traded corporations with dispersed

investors became its natural object of study. While numerically these companies represent the

exception even in the United States (not to mention in the rest of the world (La Porta, Lopez-de-

Silanes, and Shleifer (1999)), they have occupied the center stage both in the theoretical debate

and in the empirical analysis, greatly influencing what has and has not been studied.

         Theoretically, the emphasis fell on the fact that investors were dispersed and thus unable

to coordinate. Hence, the focus is on the distortions produced by the free riding behavior of

creditors in financial restructuring (Bulow and Shoven (1978)) or of shareholders in the case of

proxy fights or takeovers (Grossman and Hart (1980)). Empirically, this bias toward large

companies has led to an excessive concentration of studies on large publicly traded companies,

which are certainly the most important ones from a value-weighted point of view, but which are

also the ones where internal funds are generally abundant and external financing (especially with

equity) is a rare event. Thus, most of the empirical effort has been dedicated where we expect

finance to matter the least. This explains the great influence the Modigliani and Miller (1958)

theorem played, not just as a theoretical starting point, but also as a positive description of the

world.

         While this perspective has brought tremendous insights, it has not been without costs

both on the theoretical and on the empirical fronts. Theoretically, the emphasis on large

companies with dispersed investors, for instance, has underemphasized the role that different

financing instruments can play to provide investors better risk diversification (for a notable

exception see Allen and Gale (1994)). If all companies’stock is held by well-diversified

investors, there is little need for additional diversification. Unfortunately, this convenient

assumption does not seem to hold in practice. Most companies do have a large shareholder, who

is not well diversified. Even when the financial capital is held by well-diversified investors, the
                                                                                                      10


human capital invested in the firm is not well diversified. Thus, a greater attention to these

problems is well warranted. Empirically, the emphasis on large companies has led us to ignore (or

study less than necessary) the rest of the universe: the young and small firms, who do not have

access to public markets.

        One could claim that the disproportionate amount of research dedicated to large publicly

traded companies is simply an effect of data availability. The access to datasets, such as

COMPUSTAT, facilitated this type of research, while the difficulty in obtaining information

about privately held companies prevented the other type. While there is certainly some truth in

this alternative explanation, I think it ignores the extent to which the availability of data is

endogenous to the interest of researchers. Consider for instance the long time series of stock

prices. Its availability is not a gift from God, but the result of the interests of researchers such as

James Lorie, who in the early 1960s created the University of Chicago Center for Research on

Security Prices, whose data we all love and use today. Similarly, it was only after an intense

scrutiny both by researchers and by journalists that data on executive stock options were collected

on a regular basis by Standard and Poor.3
                                                                                                    11


III. The Theory-of-the-Firm Foundations of Corporate Finance

    The previous section showed that even the term used to define the discipline had great

importance in the direction the discipline evolved. Much more important, though, have been the

theoretical developments in the concept of the firm. In this section, I first argue why the link

between the theory of the firm and corporate finance is so tight and then I draw forth the

implications that the most important theories of the firm have for the three main areas of

corporate finance:

1. Capital structure, i.e., the distortions associated with different ways of financing;

2. corporate governance, i.e., the optimal governance structure for this entity; and

3. valuation, i.e., the valuation of this entity.



A. Why This Link?

        In their seminal article on capital structure, Modigliani and Miller (1958) assume the

existence of a firm (actually of two firms in the same “risk class”) with a predetermined payoff.

Once we accept this assumption, the irrelevance of financing choices follows. Thus, as is well

known by now, the secret to finding reasons why capital structure does matter lies in a deeper

understanding of the content of the firm “black box” and how this content is affected by different

choices of financing instruments. An answer to these questions, however, is only possible after

we have defined what a firm is and how it operates.

        Furthermore, a major role in the capital structure debate is played by the costs of financial

distress. Most models assume some costs of liquidating a firm. But where do these costs come

from? To understand why value is lost in liquidating a firm, we need to understand why a firm is

worth more than the sum of all its components. We must therefore understand what a firm is

about and how it adds value with respect to the market. In sum, we must have a theory of the

firm.
                                                                                                      12


        The link between theory of the firm and corporate governance is even more compelling,

and I have already argued for it in Zingales (1998a). The word ``governance" implies the exercise

of authority. But in a free-market economy, why do we need any form of authority? Isn't the

market responsible for allocating all resources efficiently without the intervention of any

authority? In fact, Coase (1937) taught us that using the market has its costs, and firms alleviate

these costs by substituting the price mechanism with the exercise of authority. By and large,

corporate governance is the study of how this authority is allocated and exercised. But in order to

understand how this authority is allocated and exercised, we first need to know why it is needed

in the first place. We need, thus, a theory of the firm.

        The connection between the theory of the firm and the theory of valuation is probably

less apparent, but precisely because of that, is very important. From an economic point of view,

we would like to measure the entire value created by a firm, as the discounted sum of the payoffs

generated by the entity called the firm minus the opportunity cost of the inputs used. A theory of

valuation, thus, presupposes a definition of what this entity is, and an understanding of the

relationship between the prices paid for the inputs and their opportunity cost. Unionized workers,

for instance, tend to be paid above their opportunity cost. The total value of the firm, thus, should

include the rent appropriated by unions. While economically very sensible, this perspective on

valuation is clearly different from the one used in most finance textbooks. Finance textbooks

identify the value of the firm as the value of all financial claims outstanding. Whether this

approach is justified depends on what theory of the firm we espouse. This fact by itself proves the

importance of theory of the firm for valuation.

        Now that I have, I hope, explained the sources of the connection between the theory of

the firm and corporate finance, let’s review how this connection plays out in the major theories of

the firm.
                                                                                                         13


B. The Firm as a Nexus of Explicit Contracts

        The view of the firm prevailing in corporate finance is due to Alchian and Demsetz

(1972) and Jensen and Meckling (1976). They define the firm as a nexus of contracts. Sometimes

this definition includes only explicit contracts, while other definitions include both explicit and

implicit contracts. These two notions, though, have very different implications. Thus, I will treat

them as two separate views of the firm. In doing so, I will not do justice to many authors, but I

will greatly simplify the exposition.


B.1. Implications for Capital Structure


        If we consider the firm a simple nexus of explicit contracts, then the firm does not exist

as a separate entity, but just as a shorthand notation for this set of contracts. By definition, then,

the firm cannot be worth more than the sum of the individual contracts that compose it. This

obvious conclusion carries enormous consequences for our view of financial distress, and thus,

for capital structure. If the value of a firm is simply the sum of its parts, then the prospect of a

piecemeal liquidation cannot affect its overall value. Once we accept this, the irrelevance result of

Modigliani and Miller (1958) applies straightforwardly.

        To be true, one can easily introduce some costs of financial distress in the form of the

cost of renegotiating the contracts that belong to the nexus. As a shorthand notation, the nexus

saves transaction costs, and thus its dissolution may force costly renegotiations. In fact, Fama

(1990) provides a rare example of integration between capital structure and theory of

organizations.

        While logically consistent, this approach does not seem to provide a very rich and

convincing theory of the costs of financial distress. In the nexus, there are multiple ways to offset

changes in one contract or in the environment. Thus, the deadweight loss in renegotiation is

bounded above by the cost of renegotiating the simplest (and cheapest) contracts to renegotiate.

Consider, for instance, the financial structure of a dividend paying company. The cost of
                                                                                                     14


renegotiating the financial structure is bounded above by the cost of adjusting the dividend, which

is hardly overwhelming.4


B.2. Implications for Corporate Governance

        If we accept the view that decision rights should be allocated to the party that can benefit

and lose the most from these decisions, then this view of the firm has very sharp implications for

the allocation of voting rights. Looking just at explicit contracts, the only residual claim is equity.

Thus, shareholders deserve the right to make decisions. Hence, we have the basis for

shareholders’supremacy.

        In order to accept this view at face value, one has to take a very legalistic view of

contracts. While de jure equity is the only residual contract, de facto a firm’s decisions influence

the payoff of many other members of the nexus, sometimes even to a greater extent than that of

equityholders. In fact, Fama and Miller (1972) already point out that bondholders are not fully

protected by the decisions made by the shareholders. But they dismiss this problem as second

order, intuition confirmed by the simulation results of Parrino and Weisbach (1999). But is this

true with regard to all the members of the nexus?

        If we take the nexus of contracts view literally and accept that contracts specify all the

future payoff-relevant contingencies for everybody but the shareholders, then the allocation of

decision rights would not be a matter of contention. All the other members of the nexus would be

indifferent to the choice made by equityholders because they are contractually protected against

any negative consequence. If they were allocated the decision rights, they would happily dispose

of them for a cent or could be easily bribed into making the same choices shareholders would

make. For control rights to be valuable (as we know they are, see Zingales (1994) and (1995))

and reflect a real conflict of interest, the party in control must be able to make decisions that alter

the distribution of payoffs among the members of the nexus. However, this implies that other

contracting parties besides equity holders are not fully protected by the explicit contracts,
                                                                                                    15


undermining the basic premise of shareholders’supremacy. If many members of the nexus are

residual claimants, why are shareholders necessarily the ones affected the most by the firms’

decisions? Even if they are, are they the party that benefits the most from the additional

protection granted by the control rights?



B.3. Implications for Valuation

        If we ignore this problem, however, the nexus of explicit contracts view provides clear

insights on how a firm should be valued. Since all other interests are fully protected by contracts,

which pay the various contracting parties their opportunity cost, the value created by a firm can

be computed by subtracting from the firm’s payoff all the contractual payments to the other

patrons of the firm. This is equivalent to computing the difference between the payoff received

by the only residual claimants (equityholders) and their initial investments. If we ignore the cost

of investment, which is sunk, this boils down to the discounted value of future payments to

equity. Hence, we have the cashflow-to-equity approach to firm valuation.

         But since within the nexus of explicit contracts the Modigliani and Miller theorem is a

reasonable approximation of reality, the cashflow-to-equity approach can be substituted with the

traditional discounted cashflow analysis (DCF), e.g., Kaplan and Ruback (1995). Thus, the nexus

of explicit contracts is really at the heart of most of what we teach to our MBA students.


B.4. Other Implications

        Finally, the nexus of explicit contracts view provides clear insights on how a firm should

be managed. Since shareholders are the only ones who bear the cost of decisions, the firm should

be governed to maximize shareholders’value. At the same time, since any change in total value

can be measured by changes in the value of the residual contract, the impact of decisions on stock

prices can be used as a way to evaluate the social consequences of decisions, such as corporate

investments, mergers, etc. Hence, we have the proliferation of event studies.
                                                                                                     16


        This approach also has very unequivocal policy implications. It justifies shareholders’

supremacy, and it eliminates (at least from a theoretical point of view) the possibility of any

inefficiency. Capital structure choices, for instance, are by and large irrelevant, and any

government intervention is bound to make things worse.



C. The Firm as a Nexus of Explicit and Implicit Contracts

        A variation of the approach outlined above defines the firm as a nexus of explicit and

implicit contracts (see for instance, Baker, Gibbons, and Murphy (1999)). This might seem like a

minor variation, but in fact it changes the conceptual framework in a dramatic way. First of all,

implicit contracts, unlike explicit ones, are not available on demand: they cannot be reproduced

simply by signing a photocopy of the original contract. To be credible, they require one party (or

both) to have established some reputation over time.5 Thus, a firm is not simply the sum of

components readily available on the market, but a unique combination, which can be worth more

or less than the sum of its parts. Consider, for instance, a firm with the reputation of rewarding

employees on the basis of their contribution to the firm, regardless of their value in the

marketplace. Counting on this reputation, the employees will make investments that are different

from those they would have made in the marketplace. If these investments are indeed valuable

and could not have been elicited with an explicit contract, the firm’s reputation adds value: it

represents an organizational asset. On the other hand, if these investments are wasteful, the firm’s

reputation will destroy value; it represents an organizational liability. The firm, thus, can be

worth more or less than the sum of its parts, with the difference being the net of value of

organizational assets and liabilities. By using a loaded term, I will call this difference the value of

organizational capital.


C.1. Implications for Capital Structure
                                                                                                      17


        A theory of the firm able to incorporate the idea of organizational capital can provide a

much richer theory of the costs and the benefits of financial distress, and thus of the effects of

financing on a firm’s value. Financial distress can be viewed as the threat that a firm will be

liquidated. Such a threat may destroy the effectiveness of the implicit contracts, eliminating the

workers’incentive to invest. This might turn out to be detrimental or beneficial to the firm,

depending upon the contribution of those investments to the firm’s value. What is noteworthy,

however, is the fact that a temporary shock (such as financial distress) may have very long-term

consequences on the value of the firm. After recovering, a firm may have the same set of

objective characteristics as before, but may be worth more or less, depending on whether the

period of distress has destroyed some of its organizational capital.6

        Another major difference in this approach compared to its narrower precedent is in the

definition of a firm’s boundaries. Once we accept the idea that implicit contracts are part of the

nexus, the economic definition of the firm starts to differ from its legal counterpart. A firm may

have implicit contracts with its suppliers and its customers, but suppliers and customers are not

generally considered part of the corporation. This is not necessarily a shortcoming of this

approach. At the very least it makes us appreciate that the legal entity undertaking the financing

does not coincide with the set of relationships affected by that financing. A neat illustration of

this “externality” of the financing choices is a paper by Titman (1984), in which he studies the

effects of capital structure choices on the implicit contracts a firm has to service its customers.

        If we accept this potential externality, however, we must also accept the possibility that

private contracting does not deliver an efficient outcome. Consider, for instance, a company that

manufactures a very special product and would maximize its profits if it could credibly promise

its customers to service the product for the long term. One possible way to implement such a

commitment would be to maintain a very high credit rating, which would make it very unlikely

that the firm would be liquidated any time soon. Depending on the temporal pattern of sales,

however, this commitment might not be feasible, which would reduce the value of the company.
                                                                                                      18


In such a case, a regulation that forces all the companies in that sector to maintain a high credit

rating to operate might help in making this commitment credible.7

          In fact, the very need for implicit contracts suggests the existence of some inefficiency in

explicit contracting, which can be used to claim the benefits of government intervention. But

this inefficiency only constitutes what Coase (1990) calls “prima facie evidence” in favor of

regulation. In order to ascertain whether such intervention is really justified, we need a better

sense of what imperfections implicit contracts are trying to address and to what extent regulation

can improve upon a private solution. In sum, we need to have a more fully developed theory of

the firm along these lines.


C.2. Implications for Corporate Governance

          If taken seriously, this theory of the firm also has governance implications that are at the

opposite end of the spectrum with respect to the traditional nexus of contracts view. In fact, once

we recognize the existence of implicit contracts, then there are other residual claimants besides

equityholders who may need to be protected (the famous stakeholders, often mentioned in the

public policy debate). It then becomes unclear whether control should reside in the hands of

shareholders, because the pursuit of shareholders’value maximization may lead to inefficient

actions, such as the breach of valuable implicit contracts, as described by Shleifer and Summers

(1988).


C.3. Implications for Valuation

          Finally, the presence of implicit contracts in the nexus also raises two important issues

for valuation. First, the members of the nexus can be paid above or below their opportunity cost

in different moments of their relationship. This creates a wedge between market prices and the

opportunity cost of inputs, which makes it impossible to identify the value created by a firm with

the payoff accruing to equityholders. As a result, stock price changes are not reliable indicators of
                                                                                                     19


welfare changes even when the market is perfectly efficient. This possibility warns us against

drawing any welfare conclusion from event study analysis.

        Second, this view of the firm recognizes the existence of hidden organizational assets

(and liabilities). Understanding and valuing them is a major challenge for future research.



C.4. Summary

        In sum, it is interesting to highlight how a slight variation in the definition of the firm can

trigger major changes in the implications. Once implicit contracts are added to the nexus, one can

easily justify government regulation of financing choices, undermine all the results obtained in

the event study literature, and rationalize other stakeholders’theories of corporate governance.

This alternative paradigm, however, is not very well developed, possibly because of the

difficulties in working with implicit contracts. Some of the implications, thus, remain to be

worked out formally.



D. The Firm as a Collection of Growth Options

        Myers (1977) defines the firm as a collection of assets in place and growth opportunities.

This is not a full-fledged theory of the firm, because it does not provide explanations of what the

glue is that keeps the growth opportunities attached to the assets in place nor of how the inner

workings of this entity differ from the workings of the marketplace. Nevertheless, this approach

has been extremely important in shaping the capital structure debate and has had profound and

long-lasting effects on the theory of valuation.



D.1. Implications for Capital Structure

        The interesting insight that this view brings to the financial structure debate is the

importance of the interaction between assets in place and growth opportunities. In both of Myers’

greatest contributions (Myers (1977) and Myers and Majluf (1984)), it is the structure of the
                                                                                                      20


existing assets and liabilities that impedes the efficient exploitation of growth opportunities, when

these need to be financed with external equity. Informational asymmetries on the value of the

assets in place between insiders and outsiders are responsible for the friction in Myers and Majluf

(1984). If a new project requires equity financing and the manager has private information that

makes her believe the market is undervaluing the assets in place, she will prefer passing up the

valuable growth option rather than diluting the value of the existing shareholders. On the other

hand, it is the excessive amount of debt raised to finance the existing assets that makes it very

costly for shareholders to raise new equity. In fact, the proceeds of the equity issue go to insure

the existing debt in case of default, increasing its value at the expense of equity.

        Both these papers provide a clear view of what the costs of financial distress are:

underinvestment in valuable projects. But what is the origin of the problem? In both cases, the

problem arises because the growth option cannot be easily detached from the existing firm to

become a separate company. Thus, the essence of the problem is the inextricable connection

between assets in place and growth opportunities. But understanding this connection is equivalent

to having a theory of the firm able to explain why a firm is worth more than the sum of its parts. I

do not think we are there yet.



D.2. Implications for Corporate Governance

        I am not aware of any formal development of the consequences of this approach for

corporate governance. This is simply a reflection of the lack of a full theory explaining why

assets in place and growth opportunities are linked together and how the right to exploit these

opportunities is allocated. Once such a theory is in place, it is easy to derive that the role of a

governance system is to ensure that the power to make decisions should be allocated to the people

with the best opportunities.
                                                                                                    21


D.3. Implications for Valuation

        Finally, Myers’(1977) approach has revolutionized valuation techniques. The standard

discounted cash flow model values a firm on the basis of the cash flow that a firm will generate,

net of the cost of making the future investments. Future investments, however, are discretionary,

and will be made only when and if they will generate a positive expected net present value.

Future investments, thus, are options that the firm can exercise at will and as such they need to be

valued. The real option approach to investments and valuation is only now spreading outside

academia and becoming a common, although not yet standard, technique in the industry.

        While the similarity to financial options has been extremely fruitful in enhancing our

understanding and in providing analytical tools to improve valuation techniques, it has led the

literature to ignore some important differences between the two. Financial options are well-

specified contracts with a clear owner and a defined payoff. Except for exploration rights, real

options rarely share these features. Many real-world growth options are not clearly allocated to

one owner and their payoff is highly dependent upon the way the option is exercised; i.e., it is

endogenously determined, rather than exogenously specified, as in the case of financial options.

        Consider, for instance, a food company composed of several existing brands and

numerous options to introduce new brands through its commercial channels. The ownership of

the existing brands is well defined and well protected: anybody else who tries to market a product

under an existing brand name can be stopped. The ownership of the option is less protected. To

start with, the idea of a new product will come to an employee who has the choice whether to

pursue it within the company, or on her own. While the law prevents flagrant exploitations of

corporate opportunities, there is usually ample leeway to do so without triggering any effective

legal consequence. In fact, Bhide (2000) reports that 71 percent of the firms included in the Inc

500 (a list of young, fast-growing companies) were founded by people who replicated or

modified an idea encountered in their previous employment.
                                                                                                     22


        Even if the laws were able to effectively prevent employees from exploiting a firm’s real

options, the firm would rarely enjoy a monopoly in the exploitation of its growth opportunities.

Unlike financial options, in real options there are potential competitors who can seize the

opportunity or take advantage of a delay in exercise to appropriate most of its net present value.

Finally, even in the absence of competitors in the product market, the firm might face the

potential holdup by crucial suppliers, who while unable to exercise the option on their own, are

happy to exploit their monopolistic position to capture some (or all) of the value embedded in

these options. One of the most famous examples, described in Klein, Crawford, and Alchian

(1978) (see also Williamson (1985)), is that of Fisher Body holding up General Motors when an

unexpected surge in the demand for cars forced GM to purchase its car bodies from Fisher Body.

Another example is sequels of successful movies. The right to make a sequel can be seen as an

option that can be exercised by the studio that produced the original movie. Except for animated

movies, where the studio owns the entire value, in regular movies the crucial actors “own” a

claim on part of the net present value of that option. Since it would be hard to have a Godfather

movie without Al Pacino or a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger, these actors effectively

own a stake in the sequel. Consistently, the cost of producing a sequel is in general 20 percent

higher than that of the original movie (Luherman and Teichner (1992)).

        As I will argue in Section V, we really need a theory of the firm to lay down the factors

underlying a firm’s ability to capture the value of new growth options.



E. The Firm as a Collection of Assets

        One of the major shortcomings of the traditional nexus of contracts view is that it is

unable to explain what is so special about mergers. If the firm is simply a collection of contracts,

the results achieved through a merger could be more simply obtained by writing a contract

between two separate firms. Why, then, do firms spend billions to merge? The property rights

literature developed by Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990) addresses this
                                                                                                       23


question. The starting point is that contracts are necessarily incomplete; and, as a result, there is a

need to allocate the right to decide in the events not specified by the initial contract. This decision

right, which Grossman and Hart (1986) associate with the ownership of an asset, affects the

distribution of the ex post surplus created by an enterprise, and, thus, the incentives to generate

this surplus. By changing the allocation of ownership, a merger changes these incentives in a way

that no contract could. In the property rights literature, thus, what makes a difference is how

ownership is allocated. Consistent with this view, the firm is defined as a collection of assets that

are jointly owned.

        The concept of residual rights of control, introduced by Grossman and Hart (1986), is a

fundamental contribution, which has shaped indelibly the whole subsequent discussion. Another

appealing feature of their definition of the firm is that it corresponds very closely with the legal

definition. A potential shortcoming is the identification of control with ownership, which Hart

and Moore (1990) further specialize in the right to withdraw the asset. As Kay (1996, p. 111) puts

it very effectively: “if we asked a visitor from another planet to guess who were the owners of a

firm [on the basis of this definition] by observing behaviour rather than by reading text books in

law or economics, there can be little doubt that he would point to the company's senior

managers.”

Not surprisingly this line of research has found it extremely difficult to deal with the separation

between ownership and control.


E.1. Implications for Capital Structure

        The identification of both ownership and control with the right to withdraw the asset has

led to very elegant theories of debt (Aghion and Bolton (1992), Hart and Moore (1989), Bolton

and Scharfstein (1990), Hart and Moore (1994)) but it has failed to deliver a convincing model of

outside equity. The few attempts made (Fluck (1998), Myers (2000)) model outside equity as a

sort of debt with infinite face value, which always has the ability to intervene and subtract the
                                                                                                       24


asset from the managers. This characterization seems to underplay the diversity of equity from

debt and overplay the power to intervene of outside equity.

           A possible solution within this framework is to find a role for control that is different

from that of ownership. Rajan and Zingales (1998), for instance, identify the separate role of

control in the regulation of access to the asset itself. This can be a valuable instrument if the asset

requires specific investments by the employees. One can then distinguish between the role played

by ownership, which confers the right to withdraw a resource after specific investments have

been made, from that of control, which regulates the access to the asset before specific

investments are made.

           Another shortcoming of this definition is that it focuses on the firm after all the human

capital specific investments have been done. At this stage, the firm is simply the sum of its parts

(assets) and the only reason why liquidation can produce a loss in value is if the market for

individual assets is less liquid than the market for the whole firm (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny

(1992)).


E.2. Implications for Corporate Governance

           The difficulty of this approach in dealing with the separation between ownership and

control has also impinged on its ability to deliver implications for corporate governance. In fact,

there is some schizophrenia between the message contained in the original contributions and the

way these contributions have been interpreted. For example, there is a clear Marxian flavor in the

role played by ownership in Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990). The residual

rights of control allow the owner to extract the surplus out of the worker. The key workers, thus,

should control the assets they work for to prevent this “exploitation.” Unlike in Marx, however,

this reallocation of ownership is not motivated by distributional concerns, but by efficiency

concerns. If workers expect to be exploited, they will not make valuable investments. While I am
                                                                                                      25


not aware of any corporate governance paper arguing along these lines, I think this would be a

reasonable literal interpretation of the property rights view of the firm.

        Interestingly, this is not the way this view has been used. Quite to the contrary, it has

been re-interpreted to support the shareholders’value maximization paradigm. The best example

is Shleifer and Vishny’s (1997) corporate governance survey. They recognize that contracts are

incomplete and that the allocation of the residual rights of control shapes the ex-post distribution

of surplus. But they argue that insiders have a better bargaining position as a result of their ability

to quit. Outside financiers – they conclude -- should be protected against expropriation through

the residual right of control. The greater need for protection, however, only suggests that the

suppliers of finance need some form of protection; it does not necessarily imply that they should

be protected via the residual rights of control rather than via other contractual mechanisms. This

is not a forgone conclusion, since Rajan and Zingales (1998) show that it might be efficient to

allocate formal control rights to the party who has a lot of de facto power, as in the case of

workers who can easily leave.


E.3. Implications for Valuation

        Some potential contradictions also emerge when we try to move from the property rights

view of the firm to a theory of valuation. The theory makes it quite clear that there is not a fixed

or exogenously specified division between cash flow going to financial claimholders and cash

flow going to insiders. Therefore, it would be natural to define the value of the firm as the total

surplus produced by the firm, which is then divided between these two groups. However, by

defining the firm as a collection of assets, the property rights view excludes the insiders’human

capital. As a result, the value of the firm gets identified with the value that can be appropriated by

the owner of the assets, thanks to their control of the assets. The amount of surplus appropriated

by insiders, beyond what they are entitled to on the basis of their equity stake, is then classified as

private benefits. The concept of private benefits has been introduced precisely to reconcile this
                                                                                                       26


tension between a definition of a firm’s value based only on the amount appropriated by financial

claimants and a model where the division between insiders and outsiders is endogenous. On the

one hand, the introduction of private benefits has been an important step toward recognizing that

there is an appropriability problem, and that financial structure and governance structure affect

who is able to appropriate what.8 On the other hand, it has often confused the problem, as is

testified by the ambiguous use of private benefits in the welfare analysis. While some papers

explicitly account for them (e.g., Aghion and Bolton (1992)), others ignore them (e.g., Grossman

and Hart (1980)) on the basis that their value will be dissipated in rent seeking.


F. What about Signaling?

        By focusing on the link between financial structure and the theory of the firm, I left out

an important branch of the capital structure literature: the one based on signaling. By assuming

that managers have an incentive to reveal their superior information to the capital market via the

choice of different financing instruments, this literature has derived interesting implications for

capital structure (Ross (1977)), dividends (Bhattacharya (1979); John and Williams (1985), etc.).

In fact, the richness of this literature might appear as a contradiction to my claim that any work in

corporate finance is rooted in an underlying theory of the firm, because most of this work seems

to be independent of any notion of the firm.

        To the contrary, this is the exception that proves the rule. This literature has gone out of

fashion not for lack of empirical support, but for its difficulty in addressing questions such as:

Where do the (assumed) incentives to signal come from? Why have certain devices and not others

been chosen? In order to answer these questions, we need a theory of the firm in the background.

And when such a theory is provided, the effects of signaling may disappear. For example, within

a nexus of contract framework Dybvig and Zender (1991) show that if we endogenize the

contract shaping the incentive to signal, then the irrelevance proposition still holds. Thus, even

the signaling literature is strictly dependent upon an underlying theory of the firm.
                                                                                                      27




IV. The Nature of the Firm Has Changed9

          In spite of some criticisms I have voiced, the existing theories have been quite successful

in providing an intellectual backbone for the principles of corporate finance we all know and

teach. It is less clear, however, whether this model will be helpful very much longer. In fact, the

very model of a corporation that has inspired the debate on theory of the firm and, indirectly,

informed the theoretical debate in corporate finance is changing, and many of the conclusions we

took for granted need to be re-examined.

          The case of the British advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi, described in Rajan and

Zingales (2000a), well illustrates the clash between the principles derived on the basis of

yesterday’s model and today’s reality. In 1994, Maurice Saatchi, chairman of Saatchi and Saatchi,

proposed for himself a generous option package. The U.S. fund managers, who controlled 30

percent of the shares, became furious. The stock had underperformed for several years, and the

last thing they wanted was to reward the chairman. This act of managerial self-interest needed to

be punished with a serious shareholders’initiative, and so the shareholders voted down the

proposal at the general shareholders’meeting. This opposition led to the departure of Maurice

Saatchi, quickly followed by the resignation of several key senior executives. These executives,

together with the Saatchi brothers, started a rival agency (M and C Saatchi) that in a short period

of time captured some of the most important accounts of the original Saatchi and Saatchi. The

original firm, which later changed its name to Cordiant, was severely damaged.

          In hindsight, the mistake the U.S. fund managers made was to treat Saatchi and Saatchi as

a traditional company with clear boundaries defined by its assets. Because they had ownership

(thanks to their 30 percent holding of the votes) they may have thought they controlled the firm.

Instead, much of the firm broke off as they attempted to exercise their traditional ownership

rights.
                                                                                                      28


        Interestingly, in 1994 a firm like Saatchi and Saatchi, with few physical assets and a lot

of human capital, could have been considered an exception. Not any more. The wave of initial

public offerings of purely human capital firms, such as consultant firms, and even technology

firms whose main assets are the key employees, is changing the very nature of the firm.

Employees are not merely automata in charge of operating valuable assets, but valuable assets

themselves, operating with commodity-like physical assets. The changing nature of the firm

forces us to re-examine much of what we take for granted in corporate finance. What precisely is

the entity that is being financed, governed, and valued?



A. The Prototypical Traditional Firm

        There are four main features of the traditional firm that are relevant from our point of

view. First, the traditional firm, which according to Chandler (1990) emerged during the second

industrial revolution to exploit economies of scale and scope, was very asset-intensive and highly

vertically integrated. It was asset intensive because the first companies in each sector that could

exploit the economies of scale and scope gained a formidable advantage vis-à-vis new entrants

(Chandler (1990)). At the same time, it was very highly vertically integrated, because the need to

ensure the right level of throughput, at a time when the market for intermediate goods was just

developing, forced companies to take direct control of their suppliers and distribution systems

(Chandler (1977)). As a result, the realm of transactions governed by power rather than by prices

tended to coincide with the legal boundaries of the corporation.

        Second, the traditional firm had a high degree of control over its employees. Vertical

integration reduced the size of the market for intermediate products. The scarcity of competitors,

both in the intermediate and in the output market, implied a thin outside labor market, able to use

(and pay for) the skills that employees acquired on the job. Through its control of the firm’s

assets, the headquarters effectively controlled the main source of employment open to their

specialized employees, giving to top management enormous power.
                                                                                                   29


        Third, the size and the asset-intensity of the traditional firm required more investment and

more risk-taking than was within the capacity of the management. The control conferred by the

ownership of crucial assets, however, made outside ownership feasible. Therefore, the traditional

firm came to be owned by disperse investors.

        Finally, the concentration of power at the top of the organizational pyramid, together with

the separation between ownership and control, made the agency problem between top managers

and shareholders the problem. Both capital structure and corporate governance became singly

focused on this dimension. The objective became to maximize the protection of outside investors,

and the means was by reducing or removing all the obstacles to shareholders’control. Thus,

transparency, accountability of directors, contestability of corporate control, and managerial

compensation aligned with shareholder wealth maximization became steps in this battle.



B. The New Firm

        In the last decade we have witnessed three major changes in the balance of power within

firms. First, physical assets, which used to be the major source of rents, have become less unique

and are not commanding large rents anymore. Improvements in capital markets, which have made

it easier to finance expensive assets, have certainly contributed to this change, as has the drop in

communication costs, which reduced the importance of expensive distribution channels, which

favors the access to the market of newly formed companies.

        Second, increased competition at the worldwide level has increased the demand for

process innovation and quality improvement, which can only be generated by talented employees.

Thus, the quest for more innovation increases the importance of human capital.

        At the very time human capital has become more important, firms’ grip on it weakened

for two reasons. First, the easier access to financing has increased employees’ outside options.

Second, the opening up of world trade created the space for many independent suppliers. This

generated many alternative employment opportunities, making employees’human capital less
                                                                                                     30


specific to their current employer. At the same time, the increased competition at the intermediate

goods level has also triggered the breakdown of the vertically integrated firm. The rising of

competitors against which to benchmark performance exposed the real costs of cross-subsidies,

putting pressure on firms to break up.

        Summarizing, new firms tend to be non-vertically integrated, human-capital intensive

organizations that operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition, the exercise of

authority by the headquarters is severely limited by the ability of employees to quit, taking with

them their human capital or (as in the case of Saatchi and Saatchi) part of the firm.



V. A New Agenda

        The changing nature of the firm forces us to abandon the illusion that firms’boundaries

are clear-cut and remain unchanged when we change the capital structure or the governance

structure. This was a sensible assumption for a GM type of organization -- very physical-asset

intensive, where the boundaries were clearly set in advance and not easy to alter -- but is not very

sensible for today’s organizations, which are mostly human-capital intensive. In these

organizations internal distributional conflicts can change the boundaries of the organization itself,

as the Saatchi and Saatchi example shows.

        Once we admit that, the need for a theory-of-the-firm foundation of corporate finance

becomes even more compelling. While in Section III I argued that such need has always existed,

in the past, the legal notion of a corporation captured closely enough the economic boundaries of

the firm that such an explicit link was less necessary. When, for instance, assets in place assigned

to their owner a de facto exclusive right to pursue further investments opportunities, there was not

much need for a theory that explained who can appropriate those options to value a company.

When different capital or governance structures did not have much of an effect on who

appropriated those options, the corporate finance implications could be safely worked out without

taking a position on why growth opportunities were attached to the assets in place.10 When firms’
                                                                                                 31


assets represented the main source of value and control, it was perfectly legitimate to approximate

a firm with its physical assets. As a result, most corporate finance theory was successfully

developed even if the fundamental questions in the theory of the firm were not completely

resolved.

        But now that the boundaries of the firms have become fuzzy, employees’ human capital

has become the most valuable asset, and growth options are up for grabs, answering these

questions becomes unavoidable. After all, what defines corporate finance is its focus on the

challenges raised by financing the unique combination of assets and people that we call firms.

Understanding what makes this combination unique is a fundamental step we cannot postpone

any longer.


A. What We Need

        The defining characteristic of a firm is that it substitutes authority for the price

mechanism in determining how decisions are made (Coase (1937)). The fundamental question a

theory of the firm should address, then, is how an organization succeeds in acquiring power that

differs from ``ordinary market contracting between any two people" Alchian and Demsetz (1972,

p. 777). Only by understanding the source of this power can we hope to explain where the

influence of this power ends (i.e., the boundaries of the firm) and how this power operates within

the firm’s boundaries.

        In the case of physical asset-intensive firms, an answer to this question is already

contained in Grossman and Hart (1986) and Hart and Moore (1990). The residual rights of control

over the assets attributes to the owner a power that she does not have in ordinary market

contracting. The new challenge is to explain what happens when there are no physical assets

involved or when these assets are simple commodities, and hence, easily replaceable. This is

tantamount to explaining how a third party can have control over human capital in a world where

labor has been liberated not only from slavery, but also from the modern form of indenture
                                                                                                    32


represented by the uniqueness of the assets they specialized to. In other words, what is the power

of a shareholder in a firm like Saatchi and Saatchi? Answering this question will enable us to

explain the role of outside equity in human-capital intensive firms and thus provide a new

perspective to the capital structure debate.

        The second question a theory of the firm should address is how this power is maintained

and enhanced, and how it is lost. An answer to this question can explain what the factors are that

underlay a firm’s ability to grow or its failure to do so, even in the face of valuable growth

opportunities. It will also be a critical step toward an understanding of the costs of financial

distress. In fact, as I mentioned in Section III, one of the shortcomings of the existing theories of

the firm is their inability to explain why temporary shocks to liquidity can have permanent, and

sometimes irreversible, consequences on a firm’s value. If we can show that liquidity shocks

alter in an irreversible way the factors responsible for growth, then we would have a new theory

of the costs of financial distress and consequently a new capital structure theory.

        The third fundamental question a theory of the firm should address is how this authority-

based system operates in a way different from ordinary market contracting. Not only would an

answer to this question enable us to understand theoretically the effects of mergers and spin-offs,

but it also would bring new life to the debate on the costs and benefits of corporate

diversification.

        Understanding the internal workings of firms will also enable us to derive some policy

rules on how a firm ought to be governed. In the simple nexus-of-contract world, the

maximization of a firm’s value corresponded, with few exceptions, to the maximization of

shareholders’value. Consequently, the traditional precepts of corporate governance were all

aimed at empowering shareholders by reducing the cost of collective action. In the current

environment, where human capital is crucial and contracts are highly incomplete, the primary

goal of a corporate governance system should be to protect the integrity of the firm, and new

precepts need to be worked out.
                                                                                                        33


        The fourth and final question a theory of the firm should address is how the surplus

generated by the firm is allocated among its members. This is not a trivial task, since by

definition, resources inside the firm are not allocated on the basis of prices. Such an

understanding will help us derive a new approach to valuing firms that is consistent with the new

nature of firms. In fact, the enormous success of the nexus-of-contracts view of the firm is due, at

least in part, to the very practical implications it provides for valuing firms.

        The growing importance of human capital and its greater ability to capture rents make

this approach no longer tenable. In assessing the value generated by a firm we have to consider

the surplus captured by other stakeholders. A more reasonable approach to valuation, thus, would

be to discount the total value added generated by the firm. In order to move from here to the

equity value, however, we need a theory of how the surplus is divided among different

claimholders, be they financial claimholders (equityholders and debtholders) or nonfinancial

ones, such as employees, key customers, and suppliers. Understanding the internal allocation of

surplus, thus, is a necessary step toward a theory of valuation of the new firm.



B An Attempt

        Thus far, the discussion has been rather abstract, as is necessarily the case when one tries

to illustrate the features of a theory that does not yet exist. To make this discussion a little more

concrete, I will describe some attempts Rajan and I have made to develop such a theory. Far from

being the solution, this is just meant to be an example of what can be done in this direction, an

example that allows me to describe more concretely what the consequences of this approach

could be.

        In Rajan and Zingales (1999) what distinguishes the firm from the market is the web of

specific investments built around a critical resource. In order to acquire power over human

capital, an entrepreneur needs control (not ownership) over some valuable resource, which need

not be a physical or alienable asset, but can even be her own human capital. By controlling a
                                                                                                     34


critical resource an entrepreneur can influence the accumulation of specific investments so as to

build complementarities between the person the entrepreneur seeks to have power over, and her

critical resource. Once the complementarity exists, the specialized person may obey orders from

the entrepreneur for fear that disobedience would jeopardize the joint value they can create

together. More generally, while ownership legally links an inanimate asset to a firm,

complementarities economically link some person that cannot be owned to the firm.

        But why would anyone choose to specialize when he knows that this will make him

dependent on the critical resource and, thus, at the mercy of who controls it? The secret is to

create a situation where employees know that their rewards will be greater if they make firm-

specific investments. The enterprise does this by giving key employees or units privileged access

to the enterprise or its critical resources, so that they have power if they specialize (see Rajan and

Zingales (1998)). Through regulated access an entrepreneur can build a nexus of specific

investments able to produce more than any competing entrepreneur with a similar resource

starting from scratch. This is because the web of specific investments built over time cannot be

reproduced instantaneously. This web could also be viewed as a firm’s production capabilities

(Wernerfelt (1984)) or its organizational capital (Klein (1988)).

        In this framework, power is maintained and increased by having more and more people

specializing; thus at some point the critical resource becomes the web of specific investment

itself. In order to maintain the incentive to specialize, however, employees have to be granted a

certain level of rents in the future. Since the possibility of renegotiation jeopardizes long-term

commitments, growth prospects are crucial in making the promise of future rents credible. If

growth prospects diminish (as in the case of a temporary liquidity shock), then employees may

lose the incentives to specialize, reducing the value of organizational capital. This might be a new

way to formalize the idea of the costs of financial distress as a temporary shock causing a

permanent loss in organizational capital. Note that a similar loss will be generated if the firm
                                                                                                        35


were to reduce its growth prospects for non-financial reasons. This might explain why it is so

difficult to empirically disentangle economic from financial distress.

        A fundamental difference between the working of the firm and the working of markets is

the protection granted to property rights in the two environments. Employees are generally not

granted property rights inside the firm, while this occurs in markets. This lack of internal property

rights makes resources more easily transferable within firms than across firms. In fact, one of the

benefits of corporate diversification is the ability to transfer resources to divisions with the best

opportunities (the so-called winner picking, see Stein (1997)). The flip side is that divisions might

distort their investments to protect their own turf. The fear of inefficient protective investments

may induce the headquarters of a diversified firm to misallocate some funds at the margin

(relative to the first best) to prevent greater average investment distortions. Rajan, Servaes, and

Zingales (2000) argue that this is more likely to occur when divisions are very different in their

opportunities, and by observing the allocation of funds of diversified firms in the United States,

they find evidence consistent with this claim. These results suggest that the costs of corporate

diversification tend to outweigh the benefits when divisions have diverse opportunities and

resources. This could explain the success of General Electric under Jack Welch’s reign. Welch’s

principle to divest any division that is not the leader in its market segment can be interpreted as a

rule meant to reduce the level of diversity inside General Electric. This is an example of how a

theory of the firm can be used to shed new light on a highly debated topic (corporate

diversification), provide new testable implications, and even rationalize popular management

principles.



B.1. Implications for Capital Structure

        As I discussed above, a model of how power is acquired and maintained can be used to

derive a theory of outside equity. While this has not been done in this context yet, it is easy to

sketch how it could be done. In Rajan and Zingales (1999) outside ownership can be supported
                                                                                                      36


only when the web of specific investments around the critical resource is strong enough that the

ownership of the critical resource, even without daily control, confers some power. In order for

this to happen, though, an organization should accordingly be designed and modeled over time.

This, in fact, may be the major service venture capitalists provide emerging firms (Rajan and

Zingales 2000a). They ensure that the management of a firm is professionalized so that it is not

too dependent upon the entrepreneur or any specific professional manager. In this way, they make

the firm easier to finance, initially by themselves, and eventually by dispersed outsiders (for some

evidence in this sense see Hellmann and Puri (1999)). Another way to ensure more power to

outsiders is to provide a firm with an internal bureaucracy that generates verifiable information on

employees’performance (Novaes and Zingales (1998)).

        The above argument, however, only explains how outside equity is feasible, not why it

exists and who should own it. Of course, one can appeal to the usual arguments that an

entrepreneur needs to raise funds and diversify risk. But this approach could deliver some

interesting new roles for capital structure: not as financing instruments, but as a glue to preserve

the rents of an organization from being dissipated by competition among different stakeholders. A

recent example of this phenomenon is provided by Autodaq.com, one of the many e-commerce

firms that sprouted in the last couple of years. It specializes in the resale of used cars from car

rental and leasing companies to car dealers. One of the major problems for Autodaq.com, as for

most internet business, is how to make sure that the efficiency gains generated by its internet-

based intermediation system are not fully passed to the buyers -- in other words, how to lock in

crucial relationships that enable the firm to appropriate at least a fraction of the benefits. The

strategy followed by Autodaq.com is to make the crucial suppliers of used cars shareholders in its

company. As shareholders, they will be co-interested in the success of Autodaq.com, making it

unlikely they will supply their cars to new entrants. This is one of the many examples where

equity is used not to raise funds, but to protect the long-term viability of the firm.
                                                                                                     37


B.2. Implications for Corporate Governance

        In the traditional type of firm power was clearly allocated to the person controlling the

asset, thus the corporate governance problem centered on how to prevent the person holding this

power from abusing it. This explains the focus on the agency costs between providers of financial

capital and managers and/or between large shareholder and small shareholders.

        The de-integration of the firm and the growing importance of human capital are changing

the terms of the problem. Power and rents are not concentrated at the top of a steep pyramid; they

are sprinkled throughout the organization, even outside the legal boundaries of the firm, as is the

case for crucial independent suppliers. Now that power is diffused, the major corporate

governance problem becomes how to prevent conflicts among stakeholders from paralyzing or

destroying the firm. In fact, traditionally one of the great advantages of the corporate structure

was that it concentrated all the control rights to a group with very homogeneous interest: the

shareholders (Hansmann (1996)).

        The recent changes in the nature of the firm described above are undermining this

advantage. Some patrons become equityholders (as in the example of Autodaq.com), while others

maintain enormous power even without controlling votes (as with Maurice Saatchi in Saatchi and

Saatchi). These changes make new firms more similar to cooperatives, rather than to traditional

corporations.11 Thus, corporate governance has a lot to learn from a serious analysis of

cooperative governance along the lines of the one conducted by Hansmann (1996).

        At the same time, the increased power of human capital forces corporate governance to

confront the fundamental issue of how we should allocate de jure control rights, when there are

multiple sources of de facto control rights (Rajan and Zingales (2000a)). This analysis can

deliver novel implications both in terms of the optimal allocation of ownership and in terms of the

optimal capital structure. For example, Rajan and Zingales (2000b) argue that de jure control

rights should be given to the party who has de facto power to minimize the amount of resources

wasted in fighting. A similar point is made by Welch (1997) in the context of the seniority
                                                                                                     38


structure of debt. He argues that banks, which are better at fighting in court, should hold senior

debt, because this will minimize the resources wasted in legal battles.

        This fragmentation of power also presents serious risks for the survival of organizational

capital. Since no party is the sole residual claimant and no party has absolute control, nobody

fully internalizes the preservation of organizational capital. One might argue that this is less of a

concern today, because the de-integration of firms has made the organization less specific and

thus the organizational capital more portable across firms. But if it is still an issue, we should

devise some corporate governance guidelines aimed at protecting the organizational capital

against the centrifugal (and destructive) forces represented by the interest of each stakeholder.

        One form this disintegration of organizational capital can take is the failure to exploit

growth opportunities. If we identify a firm with the nexus of specific investments, the link

between assets in place and growth opportunities is represented by their common reliance on the

same nexus of specific human capital investments. Whether these opportunities will be exploited,

though, depends upon who has the formal right to exercise them in the name of the firm, who has

the opportunity to exercise them outside the realm of the firm, and who will benefit most in either

case.

        In some sense, this is the old Myers underinvestment problem in a broader context. In

Myers (1977) the failure to exploit firm growth opportunities, is due to the fact that the

exogenously specified payoff of the party in control (equityholders) does not compensate it

enough for its cost of financing the investment. In this broader context, where the payoff of all the

parties involved is endogenously determined through bargaining, growth opportunities will not be

exploited when they tilt the power distribution against the group who has to pay the “exercise

price” of the option. Consider for instance the failure of IBM to market its personal computers

through mail order as discussed in Hamel and Prahalad (1994). The real reason for this decision

(or lack of) they argue is the enormous clout the sales people and the existing distribution

network had at the top of IBM. Although such a move was efficient, it would have had an
                                                                                                      39


extremely negative impact on the power of the existing sales network--which successfully fought

this choice for a long time--at the expense of IBM's performance as a whole. A similar failure

recently occurred in Bertelsmann, a German conglomerate, with divisions both in publishing and

new media. For both these divisions, the development of book sales through the Internet provided

a wonderful opportunity. Yet both ignored the opportunity, for fear that once the unit was

developed (and most of the costs incurred) it could be reassigned to another division, subtracting

its potential benefits.12

         This discussion suggests that the primary role of a governance system is to ensure an

alignment between the ability to capture the opportunities and the reward stemming from them. A

failure to do so will result in a governance overhang, not unlike the debt overhang described by

Myers (1977). Unfortunately, however, preventing this governance overhang is not as simple as

maintaining a low level of debt. In fact, deriving such governance guidelines is a major task for

future research.



B.3. Implications for Valuation


         To illustrate the opportunities of applying these ideas to valuation, consider the case of

Technical Data Corporation (TDC), an early provider of financial information online, described

in Sahlman (1983). At the time of the case, which centers on TDC valuation, the firm had

already established itself as a reliable bond data provider with a good clientele. On top of this,

there were plans to expand the business to include providing online information about equity.

The central question of the case is whether the price should incorporate TDC’s future growth

opportunities. These options clearly do not belong to TDC in a legal sense, but this is not the

point. Whom do they belong to in an economic sense (i.e., who is going to reap the proceeds

from it)? Do they belong to TDC as a whole, to Jeff Parker, its founder, chairman, and large

shareholder, or to somebody else?
                                                                                                     40


        If we accept the idea that the firm is a nexus of specific investments, what keeps a firm

together is the strong complementarity between human and physical capital. Thus, an option

“belongs” to a firm if it is highly complementary with the physical and human capital that

constitutes the firm. In the case of TDC, there was a strong complementarity in the distribution

channels: the same computer terminals disseminating information about bonds could be used to

disseminate information about equity. Similarly, there was some complemetarity between the

software used in the two cases, and thus in the human capital of TDC programmers. There was

not, instead, a strong complemenatrity between Jeff Parker and the growth option, because his

area of expertise was the bond market. Thus, in this case it is pretty simple to see that these

growth options belonged to TDC as a company (and thus also to the outside shareholders), not to

Jeff Parker himself.13

        Unfortunately, not all the cases are as simple as TDC and I think we are still very far

from having a coherent new approach to valuation. What I hope these examples can convey is the

far-reaching implications that a new theory of the firm could have on the way we value

companies. For this to happen, however, we also need a great deal of empirical work

substantiating some of the crucial steps required to move from an abstract theory to a very

concrete valuation.

        First, there is a pressing need to understand what factors determine the ability of firms to

capture new growth opportunities. The theory focuses on the degree of complemetarity. But how

can we measure it? And what is the predictive power of such an idea? An answer to these

questions will be crucial to deriving the value of the entire enterprise.

        Second, we need to know how the surplus generated by a firm is allocated among its

members. The dominance of the nexus-of-contracts paradigm has blinded empirical research on

distributional issues inside the firm. With few notable exceptions, such as Rose’s (1987) analysis

of the distribution of regulatory rents between unions and equityholders, the empirical literature

has just assumed shareholders are residual claimants and has ignored how the surplus is split and
                                                                                                    41


what factors drive these splits. Such studies would be of tremendous help in moving from the

value of the entire enterprise to a value of financial claims.



B.4. Toward a Theory of Entrepreneurship

        Understanding the factors underlying a firm’s ability to exploit growth opportunities will

not only affect the way we value firms, but also create a fundamental building block toward a

theory of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is the process by which new firms are created, and

they are generally created to exploit new growth opportunities. But not every new endeavor

necessitates a new firm. In fact, existing firms, as expected, exploit many new opportunities since

they generally have access to a much better pool of resources. Thus, new firms are created to

exploit growth options that existing firms cannot or do not want to exploit. But what are these

options? A theory of the ultimate causes of “governance overhang” in organizations should be

able to illuminate us on this front as well.



VI. Conclusions

        This paper makes an extremely simple point. Corporate finance is the study of the way

firms are financed. Thus, our view of what a firm is shapes the way we do research in the field

and the policy implications we derive. This influence has always been present, but was less

strong in the past because firms were very asset intensive and their boundaries were sufficiently

stable that one could safely ignore the impact financing and governance choices had on them.

        This is not a sensible approach anymore. In human-capital intensive firms, financing and

governance choices can easily change the boundaries of the organization itself. As this type of

firm becomes more and more common, the fundamental questions in theory of the firm become

central to the corporate finance debate. How does an organization succeed in acquiring power that

differs from ordinary market contracting? How is this power maintained, enhanced, or lost?

How is this power used in a way that differs from ordinary market contracting? How is the
                                                                                              42


surplus generated by the firm divided among its members? Answering these questions has

become a precondition for any further advancement in corporate finance. I present an example of

how such an approach can provide fruitful implications in the three main areas of corporate

finance: capital structure, corporate governance, and valuation.

∗
    University of Chicago, NBER, & CEPR. Paper prepared for the 2000 AFA meeting in Boston. I benefited

from the comments of Franklin Allen, Darin Clay, Francesca Cornelli, Eugene Fama, Thomas Hellmann,

Raghu Rajan, Jesus Santos, Paola Sapienza, and Andrei Shleifer.
1
    In a recent paper, Parrino and Weisbach (1999) have challenged the importance of these two effects from

a quantitative point of view.
2
    In fact, in the legal doctrine it is still highly controversial whether the fiduciary principle is disposable by

the parties (see Everett. Phillips, Court of Appeals of New York, June 4, 1942).
3
    Of course, disclosure requirements do help in making data available. The Executive COMPUSAT

database was also made possible by the SEC requirements to disclose the details for executive option plans

in the proxy statements. Mandatory disclosure requirements themselves, however, are a function of what

regulators think is important, which is itself affected by the theoretical model regulators have in mind and

thus is ultimately affected by what theory considers important.
4
    It is certainly possible to argue that the cost of adjusting dividends is very large for a manager, because of

the reputational consequences of such a decision (e.g. Myers (2000)). But this is equivalent to admitting

that the manager has an implicit contract with the firm, whose terms depend upon her reputation in the

marketplace.
5
    For an excellent model of how reputation can be acquired over time see Diamond (1989).
6
    For an attempt in this sense, see Novaes and Zingales (1993).
7
    Of course, one could argue that the initial shareholders could devise a similar contract with the product

customers up front. This contract, however, will face two difficulties. First, it will be extremely difficult to

renegotiate in case such a renegotiation is needed. Second, it would require a very expensive bond up front.
8
    The most extreme for of appropriability is when insiders can dilute the value of the company to their own

benefit (see Zingales (1994), (1995), and (1998b)).
9
    This section is based on Rajan and Zingales (2000a).
                                                                                                              52



10
     To be accurate, Myers (1977) contains a very interesting discussion on this very issue. Many of its

applications, however, take the connection between assets in place and growth opportunities for granted.
11
     Hansmann (1996) differentiates between cooperatives from corporations on the basis that in the former

capital is supplied by patrons, while in the latter it is not.
12
     See the Economist, November 21 1998, survey p 10.
13
     Consistent with my claim, Telerate, a competitor interested in acquiring the expertise of Jeff Parker,

made an offer to buy out TDC at a price that did not reflect the value of the growth options. Jeff Parker

rejected the offer, developed the growth options, and sold out three years later at seven times as much.
