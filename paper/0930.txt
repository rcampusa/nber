                    CONSUMPTION DURING RETIREMENT:
                  THE MISSING LINK IN THE LIFE CYCLE


                               AB STRACT



       This study presents the first evidence on the relation of consumption

to lifetime wealth, based on data from the 1973 and 1975 Retirement History

Survey that have been linked to Social Security earnings records.

Nearly 500 white, married, fully retired couples ages 62—69 form the basis

of the analysis. On average their consumption early in retirement exceeds

by 14 percent the income that their financial, pension and Social Security

wealth can generate. This implies that their saving, both private and

through Social Security, is insufficient to sustain consumption throughout

the rest of their lives. Additional evidence based on changes in spending

between 1973 and 1975 shows that these households respond by reducing their

real consumption at a rate sufficient to generate positive changes in net

financial worth within a few years after retirement. These two pieces of

evidence can be rationalized by a rate of time preference much higher than

the interest rate, coupled with either a bequest motive or uncertainty about

the length of life. They also imply that, even when combined with private

pensions and savings, Social Security in the United States today does not

enable most recipients to maintain their living standard at the levels they

enjoyed before they retired.

 I.   Introduction


        An immense amount of recent empirical research has examined how

 wealth accumulation changes with age. The purpose of most of this work is

 to test the theory of life—cycle utility maximization in which consumption

 is the choice variable. Despite the focus of the theory on life—cycle

 consumption, though, empircal work using longitudinal data has been based

 exclusively on data on wealth and earnp. Cross—section data, on the

 other hand, have been used exclusively to examine the relation of consumption

 to income across age groups. Here I try to rectify this imbalance by con-

 sidering longitudinal data on consumption and wealth late in the life cycle.

 By considering the issues from a different empirical perspective, this

examination should enable us to sort out explanations for observed

behavior in a way not possible in the work that had to infer consumption

profiles from the data on assets, or that looked at "snapshots" of

consumption—income relations.

        Studying actual consumption among the elderly allows the direct

estimation of how well Social Security retirement benefits meet one of the

program's main goals——the maintenance of consumption (see Hamermesh, 1982a).

While this largest of transfer programs has accreted a number of redistri—

butive aspects (both within and across cohorts) over its life in most

Western countries, its original stated purpose, at least in the United States,

was to prevent economic hardship (reduced consumption, independent of a

household's place in the distribution of lifetime income).-1
                                                               By examining
the sources of income available to finance consumption in old age, we can,

under alternative assumptions about what private saving would be in the absence

of enforced saving for Social Security, discover whether Social Security

benefits are sufficient to sustain consumption, and how much consumption

would have to be reduced without these transfers.


II. Life—Cycle Issues and Patterns in Consumption


        In the presence of certainty about earnings trends and the length

of life, no bequest motive, a fixed retirement date and perfect capital

markets, the life cycle pattern of consumption depends solely on the

relationship between the rate of interest (r) and the rate of time

preference (p). To the extent that r exceeds (is less than) p consumption

will be observed to increase (decrease) with age. The less perfect are

capital markets, assuming the observed inverse J—shaped age—earnings profile,

the more likely it is that consumption will increase with age, and the less

likely that it will decrease monotonically with age from time zero. If

r <   p, we may observe consumption increasing with age until some point in
the life cycle, though it decreases with age after that. Given the assuinp-

tions made here, savings will be positive up to some age at or before

retirement, and consumption will exceed income and be on a trajectory that

will exhaust wealth on the date of death. Wealth——all physical capital and

financial wealth including the value of pensions——will decline with age

during retirement.

        Modifying this scenario to allow for planned bequests does not

change the implications for the rate of change of consumption with age.

This still depends on the possibilities for borrowing and the relation

between time preference and the rate of interest. But the requirement

that wealth be positive on the date of death does entail a lower level of

consumption at each age during retirement. Thus the ratio of consumption

to wealth or to an annuity out of wealth will be lower during retirement
                                    3



 the greater is the bequest motive; and the ratio will, if this motive exists,

 be low enough to imply positive net worth at the (certain) date of death.

        Unfortunately, information on consumption during retirement does not

 allow us to distinguish between a bequest motive and risk averse behavior

 in the face of uncertainty about the date of death. Uncertainty about

 survival produces two opposite effects (Levhari—Mirman, 1977) ——   increasing
 consumption to enjoy what one may not be around to enjoy later, decreasing

 consumption to provide for a horizon that may be quite distant. Whether

 the profile of consumption rises or falls during retirement depends, as

 in the standard case, on the relationship between time preference and the

 rate of interest, but also on whether the extent of uncertainty and/or the

degree of risk aversion change systematically with age.

        Some empirical evidence has been adduced on a number of the

implications of life—cycle theory for wealth accumulation. Physical and

financial wealth——the value of non—pension assets——may not increase with

age (although Hirer, 1979, suggests it does), but it surely diminishes far

more slowly than simple life—cycle theory predicts. (See King——Dicks——

Nireaux, 1982; and Blinder et al, 1981, for cross—section and Hurd—Shoven,

1982, for longitudinal evidence.) The more recent of these studies point

out that wealth, defined as physical and financial wealth plus the discounted

value of pension benefits, declines quite rapidly with age.

       The evidence on age—wealth profiles is clearly inconsistent with

the simple life—cycle model of Modigliani—Brumberg (1954). The very slow

decline in wealth during retirement cannot be reconciled by a model that

postulates a certain date of death and no planned bequests. Davies (1981)

rationalizes this evidence by showing that the paths of noninvestment income

and actuarial survival probabilities by age are consistent with consumption

that could be generated by highly risk—averse utility—maximizing consumer
                                   4


facing uncertainty about the date of death.-' There is evidence (David—

Menchik, 1981) that bequests form a sizable fraction of lifetime earnings.

That being the case, the evidence on the age—wealth profile can also be

rationalized by a planned bequest of the principal of the (bequeathable

financial) wealth accumulated at retirement, with consumption being financed

by non—bequeathable pension benefits and real interest on the principal of

the physical wealth.

       This discussion rests on evidence on age—wealth profiles. Wealth,

however, may be measured with substantial error in the microeconomic

data sets that form the bases for most of the studies. Even if not,

because the theory is designed to predict life—cycle consumption, it

would seem sensible to concentrate on what that theory is most concerned

with, namely the pattern of consumption.

III. Data and Methods

       To examine the relation of consumption among older workers and

their ability to finance it I use the linked Retirement History Survey

——Social Security Administration data. The Retirement History Survey

(R}IS) contains records on over 11,000 subjects, ages 58—63 in 1969, who

were interviewed biennially for a decade. In this study I concentrate

on information from the 1973 and 1975 interview waves. The RHS is one

of the few data sets, and the only one containing only older people,

that has information on the spending of a substantial fraction of each

household's income. Social Security earnings records for 1951—1974

have been linked to the RES, enabling one to derive the current or

prospective entitlement of members of each household in the RHS.

       To remove outliers from the sample and concentrate on behavior

among otherwise similar households, I exclude all households other than:

1) White male—headed households in which the head was married to the
                                    5


 same wife from 1969—1975; and 2) From among these, households containing

 persons whose current or most recent job was not in the farm or Federal

 sectors and who was not currently or recently self—employed.

 These disqualifications, and the requirement that information be available

 on all the spending flows in the survey instrument, reduced the samples

 to 1797 households ages 62—67 in 1973, and 1422 households ages 64—69 in

 1975. In the discussion I analyze the spending of those households with

 no earnings in the previous year and in which neither spouse is currently

 working (retired households). There are 426 of these, ages 62—67, in 1973,

and 494, ages 65—69, in 1975.

        Since the RHS data on spending are the main focus of this study,

 and since they are not exhaustive of all spending, some consideration of

 the validity of using them as a proxy for total spending is in order. In

the 1973 wave of the RHS spending on the following items is reported:

Food consumed at home; food consumed away from home; nonfood groceries;

transportation; vacations; and cost of owned or rented dwellings

(including utilities, interest and real estate taxes). Also included is

an imputation for the implicit rental value of owned housing.   ifl the

1975 wave data on spending are similar, except there are no data on

spending for transportation, but spending on miscellaneous items,

including gifts, charity, dues to organizations and several others is

included.

       Are these spending flows representative of total spending? The

first row of Table 1 lists the ratio of spending to after—tax income for

the complete subsamples in each of the two waves of the RHS (most

observations of which had at least one working member).   Though the

spending data are not complete, they do account for the disposition of

roughly half of income flows in each year. More insight into their

validity can be gotten by examining spending in comparable categories

 in the 1972—73 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) by households in which

the head is between ages 62 and 69. Comparing the first and second rows

of the table, it is clear that the ratio of spending in these categories

to after—tax income is quite close to what it is among households in the

           Moreover, as the third row shows, spending in these categories

accounts for a majority of total spending in the CEX.

          Is the sample variation in spending in the RIIS categories also like

that of total spending? The equation:


          CRHS/Y =   a + b dY    ,                                          (1)

where CRHS/Y is spending in the RHS categories, Y is after—tax income,

and C is total spending, was estimated using households with older heads

from the CEX. The bottom part of Table 1 presents the results: When

the entire sample is included, variation in the ratio of spending in

RI-IS categories to income is nearly fully explained by variation in the

ratio of total spending to income. Even if one excludes households

whose spending exceeds their incomes (a large fraction in this older

population consisting partly of households that may be drawing down their

financial assets), the coefficient of determination exceeds .5 for both the

1973 and 1975 sets of spending categories on which the RHS presents
     4,
data.—

          Based on the 1972—73 CEX data this check of the BBS' ability to

represent total spending shows quite strongly that the BBS measures

spending well in those categories that it covers. Therefore, to

compare spending in the RI-IS to available resources and account for

incomplete reporting, I inflate BBS spending by the inverse of the
                                    8


ratio of spending on RIiS categories to total spending in the CEX. This

means inflating in the 1973 RHS by 1/.628 (in 1975 by 1/.572) to derive
                  5/
total spending, C.—

       The spending measures are compared to available resources, both

currently and in the future. Among retired households I have data on

three sources of wealth: Physical and financial, pension and Social

Security. Assuming there is a market in actuarially fair annuities, I

annuitize physical and financial wealth (two—thirds of which is the

owner's share of owner—occupied housing), I assume a 2 percent real rate

of interest, use the 1969—71 life tables for whites, and assume the

household is buying a joint annuity. (In this age group letting .03 equal

the real interest rate raises the annuity income by about ten percent.)

       I treat the resources currently available from Social Security

as the benefits generated by the household's earnings history, as

reported in the linked SSA data. This stream of benefits was assumed to

remain constant in real terms over the household's life. Available

pension benefits are based on actual or expected benefits and the

characteristics of the plan's provisions for benefits for spouses.

Since few pensions are indexed, I assume these benefits would decline

in real terms at 6 percent per year. The available resources measure,

*, thus   consists of the annuitized real value of financial wealth,

indexed Social Security benefits, and pension benefits fixed nominally.

I assume these are the only resources available to these older house-

holds; if this is incorrect, I overestimate C*/Y*.-' I also assume

that the income flows are untaxed; if this is wrong, I underestimate
            7/
this ratio.—

 IV. Can   The Elderly Sustain Consumption?


        The first three columns of Tables 2 and 3 present information on

 the ratio of current consumption to income currently available from

 annuitized physical and financial wealth, and from pension and Social

 Security benefits. In addition to the frequency distributions of these

ratios, I show the ratios of average consumption to average income for eacii

of the two samples, and for each divided into two age groups. The asymptotic

standard errors of these ratios of means are also shown. The final three

columns present the same information based on current consumption and on

resources available at age 75 for the 1973 sample (76 for the 1975 sample).

(These ages are those at which half the couples can expect both partners still

to be alive.) These differ from the first three columns because of the pro-

jected decline in the real value of pensions as the household ages.

       The most striking finding in the information from Tables 2 and 3

on non—working households is the very high value of C*IY* early in

retirement. Current consumption is not sustainable given the financial

resources that are on average available to the retired couples in the

RHS samples.1 Moreover, this finding does not result from a few

outliers with unusually high consumption or very low income: 54 percent

of the retired households in the 1973 RHS, and 53 percent in the 1975

RITS, have values of C*/Y* greater than 1.1.

       Pensions make up a sufficiently large proportion of retirement

income in these samples, and the projected decline in real pension values

is sufficiently rapid, that current consumption quickly becomes even more

difficult to sustain. Roughly two—thirds of the households in each sample

would have C*/Y* >   1.1   at age 75 (76 in the 1975 sample) if they maintained

consumption at its current level. Clearly, current consumption is

inconsistent with the resources available; further, if people in the

sample intend to maintain consumption, the evidence in other studies

of assets that rise with age is clearly inconsistent with this

evidence on consumption.

       As the penultimate row of Table 4 shows, Social Security benefits

form nearly half of retirement income in this samp1e.---" Even if

one makes a liberal estimate and assumes that Social Security displaces

half of the private saving that would otherwise occur, one finds (row

(1) of Table 4) that the ratios of average C to average * would be

far greater than the actual large, unsustainable values presented in
                10 /
Tables 2 and 3.— Assuming Social Security benefits displace no private
saving just reinforces this conclusion: The averages in row (2) of the

Table are even more outlandishly high. Indeed, in the majority of

households in the sample, spending on items reported in the RHS exceeds

the resources available from sources other than Social Security benefits.

Looking at the issue somewhat differently, 58 percent of the households

in the 1973 sample (58 percent also in 1975) for which C*/Y* <    1.1 would
have C*/Y* >   1.1   if there were no Social Security (assuming 50 percent

displacement of other wealth).

       Social Security benefits clearly are very important in maintaining

consumption among retirees, even under the strong assumption that they

displace private savings on a one—for—two basis. They may also

(Kotlikof f—Summers, 1982) be sufficient to allow households to achieve

a rate of real consumption during retirement equal to the average

sustainable during their working lives. They are not, however, sufficient

for most households to maintain real consumption throughout retirement

equal to its rate early in the retirement years. The evidence suggests

(see, e.g., Ghez—Becker, 1975, P. 60) that consumption during the work

life follows the inverse J—shaped age—earnings profile quite closely.

It may thus be more sensible to evaluate the adequacy of Social Security

by comparing its ability to sustain consumption during retirement to

consumption observed around the time of retirement than to the average

of consumption throughout a household's working life.


V. Responses to Insufficient Savings


       Real consumption early in retirement cannot be sustained, given

the level of assets possessed by most households and the stream of

pension and Social Security benefits available to them. It certainly

cannot be sustained if there is a bequest motive, and it is inconsistent

with the mounting evidence on the slow rate of decumulation of assets

in old age. How do households respond to the nonsustainability of

real consumption? One possible response is for one or more household

members to reenter the labor force (even though they had been out of

the labor force for at least one year). Of the households in the 1973

sample, though, only 9 percent chose this route (had positive earnings

in 1974). The mean 1974 earnings (in 1973 dollars) among all households

in the 1973 sample was $93; this would have added only 1.3 percent to

*, hardly     affecting C*/Y*. Clearly, either most of the human capital

this sample possesses is fully depreciated, or their leisure has a very

high value.

       The other response is to change C*. Comparing columns (2) and (3)

within Tables 2 and 3, we see that households with older heads in each

subsample have a lower ratio C*/Y* than households with younger heads.'
                                    15




 However, the rate of decline in this ratio with age is not rapid, roughly

 .01 per year of age in the 1973 RRS, slightly less than two percent per

 year in the 1975 RHS. The former is not quite consistent with a

 consumption profile that is sustainable under the actuarial survival

 probabilities facing households in the sample; the latter is consistent

 with such a profile.

        The comparison of C*/Y* across cohorts provides some evidence that

 retired households cut their real consumption as they age, but its

magnitude is too small to explain planned bequests or reductions in

consumption consistent with risk—averse behavior in the face of uncertain

lifetime. Because the evidence in Tables 2 and 3 is based on different

cohorts, and thus possibly tainted by sample heterogeneity, I examine

the issue further using a subsample consisting of all 171 households

that: 1) Were in the RHS nonworking subsamples in both 1973 and 1975,

and thus had no earnings either in 1972 or 1974 and neither spouse

working at the time of the interview in 1973 and 1975; and 2) Reported

the same size household in both years. Because the
                                                     spending components
differ in the two samples, I redefine consumption to exclude those

items that are not reported in both years)---" Information on changes

in spending by these households between 1973 and 1975   is reported in
Table 5. Spending in current dollars in these categories increased in

these households by over 10 percent; less than one—fourth of the house-

holds decreased nominal spending by more than 10 percent. If we

deflate each spending flow by the appropriate change in the most closely

related component of the personal consumption expenditure deflator, the

story is completely different: Real spending in these categories in this

 longitudinal data set declined by over 9 percent, and almost half the

 households cut real spending by more than 10 percent.UI

        The decrease in real spending was not merely a reflection of the

 general slowdown in the growth of real incomes that occurred after 1973.

 Real consumption spending per capita on a weighted average of the

 commodities I have included grew by three percent during this two—year

 period. If we adjust real spending by these households to make it

 relative to per—capita spending in the U.S., the decreases in consumption

 are even more pronounced: 53 percent of the households reduced spending

by more than 10 percent relative to the average change in real spending.

        People in this sample appear to know they cannot sustain real

consumption, and they respond by reducing spending by 5 percent per year

on the items covered in the RHS samples. While too much should not be

made of evidence based only on two years of data, the findings lend

strong support to the notion that retired households' age—consumption

profile is negatively sloped. The size of the decline in consumption

is consistent with a profile of real physical and financial wealth

that increases during most of the retirement years.


VI. Explanations and Conclusions


       This study has demonstrated two hitherto undiscovered phenomena

describing life—cycle behavior. First, I have shown that the resources

available to retirees are insufficient to allow them to sustain the level

of real consumption enjoyed early in their retirement.   Second, both

cross—section and longitudinal data demonstrate they respond to this

insufficjcy by reducing their real consumption as they age. There
                                  18


are three sets of explanations possible for these findings: 1) Problems

of mismeasurement or misspecification in the empirical results 2) An

inability to plan optimally for consumption during retirement because

of imperfections in the information available for planning; and 3) Perfect

information, with a consumption path either arising from bad planning,

from optimal planning under uncertainty, or from a bequest motive.

       A number of data problems could be confounding the results.

First, the apparent inability of savings to sustain consumption may

reflect income sources excluded from Y*. This seems unlikely: Income

other than from pensions, Social Security benefits and assets is a tiny

fraction of total income of retirees in data gathered by the Social

Security Administration (see footnote 6); and data on older households

in the CEX suggest the same thing.-' Future earnings may be

expected by these apparently retired households; but that hardly seems

likley among the 171 households with no earnings in either 1972 or 1974, and

with no workers at the times of the interview in 1973 or 1975, whose

spending was shown in Table 5 to decline so sharply. Missing income sources

are not a problem. Second, wealth holdings may be underreported. The

annuitized value of reported financial wealth in the samples is only 7

percent of Y*; and a weighted average of the amount of underreporting of

financial assets in a similar survey (Lebergott, 1976, p. 218) suggests

3/4 of such assets are reported. If that is true in the sample used here,

Y* is understated on average by less than 2 percent. Moreover, to explain

the decline in C*/Y* with age, one would have to argue that underreporting

decreases with age, which severely strains credulity. Third, spending

may be mismeasured. For example, the people may be "house poor". This

is refuted by the calculations shown in footnote 8. Alternatively, C
                                   19


may contain some work—related consumption. This too seems unlikely, for

the couples had not been working for at least one year before most of the

spending data were recorded. Fourth, even though I have shown real

spending falls during retirement, real consumption may not. This is also

improbable, partly because I have included consumption of housing services

in my measure, partly because it is hard to believe that consumption is

rising while spending is falling as rapidly as the data indicate.

       One data issue that may have a major effect on the results is a

sample selection problem: The retired households may have much shorter

horizons than the average household, so that resources are in fact

adequate to maintain consumption. There is some evidence (Wolfe, 1982)

suggesting that people likely to die early retire early. The bias,

though, must be small: It affects only the annuity income from financial

and physical wealth, and this represents less than 20 percent of

available resources (see Table 4). Even with the effect Wolfe suggests,

and thus a higher annuity from assets, consumption cannot be maintained.''

That households in the sample do reduce consumption is further evidence

that this bias is minor.

       Another possibility is that the 1973—75 period was atypical and

that the cuts in spending I observe reflect that. One could argue that

households had extrapolated the real increases in Social Security benefits,

and were forced to cut back spending in 1974 when they realized that

real benefits were to remain constant. A similar argument might be made

about the effect of the unanticipated inflation during this period on pension

and financial wealth. Tests of these possibilities must rely on additional

data from different times.

       One source of imperfect information is about life expectancy: The

households in the sample may have planned badly because information about
                                   20


their horizons was poor. It is true that longevity increased very

rapidly during the lifetimes of households in the RHS sample. However,

I have shown (Hamermesh, l982b) that people are aware of their current

life expectancy, and they even extrapolate secular changes in longevity.

This means that the rapid rise in longevity has not had a negative impact

on their ability to reach an ex post utility—maximizing choice of the path

of consumption. People may also not have expected the unprecedented

growth in real incomes that occurred during the years of peak earnings

in the RHS cohorts. But if they did not expect this rapid growth to be

permanent, they would have saved a disproportionate fraction of their

earnings. They clearly did not, suggesting they were not maximizing

lifetime consumption according to a plan dictated by a small absolute

value of p —   r.
       Assuming information about income flows and horizons is sufficient

to allow life—cycle planning, how can we reconcile previous findings

of slow or no decumulation of financial wealth with my findings of

insufficient savings to finance constant consumption, and declining real

consumption during retirement? The results could be rationalized by an

ad hoc claim that the bequest motive increases in importance as the

household's horizon shortens. The rapid rate of decrease in consumption

during retirement could also be rationalized in a model of relative

risk aversion and uncertainty about length of life in a world of perfect

annuities. Unless relative risk aversion increases with age, though,

declining consumption during retirement requires that uncertainty about

longevity increase with age. I have shown (Hamermesh, l982b) that this

form of uncertainty decreases with age. Thus, in the absence of
                                        21


 evidence on the relation of relative risk aversion to age, uncertainty

 about lifetimes alone is not a promising candidate to rationalize the

 findings. Another serious possibility recognizes that there is no perfect

 market for annuities. To the extent that the change in survival probabilities

 increases with age, even if p —   r   is small we would observe consumption

 decreasing with age. This may be important in late old age, but the

 percentage change in the probability of survival is small in the age

 bracket 62—69; also 80 percent of Y in the samples is actually annuity

 income——Social Security and pension benefits.

        The findings can be rationalized by a combination of a bequest

motive, or uncertainty about length of lifetime, coupled with a rate

of time preference far greater than the real rate of interest. There is

substantial independent evidence that real rates of time preference are

very high, at least 10 percent (Heckman, 1976; Hamermesh—Soss, 1974;

Kurz et al, 1973). We should not be surprised that, with a fixed amount

of financial and physical assets, virtually certain real Social Security

benefits up to any horizon, and pension benefits that are known (and

expected to decrease in real terms), retired households consume beyond

their means early in retirement and rapidly reduce consumption as they age.11

       The implications for the adequacy of Social Security benefits

depend on one's views about the ability of people to plan for their

future. The benefits are adequate to allow retired households that

plan under uncertainty, or wish to leave a bequest, and have a high

rate of time preference to realize their consumption plans. One might

also, though, take the view, inconsistent with utility—maximizing

life—cycle behavior, that many households cannot save sufficiently for

retirement, and that Social Security benefits partly offset this
                                   22



insufficiency)' My evidence suggests this offset is only partial; it is

not enough to enable older households to maintain their consumption.

       1As two of many examples, the Committee on Economic Security,
set up by President Roosevelt to design a social insurance system, stated
in its Report (Washington, GPO, 1935, p. 2), "Old age. ..is a misfortune
only if there is insufficient income to provide for the remaining years
of life." The House Report on the bill that became the Social Security
Act of 1935 (U.S. Congress, 74:1, Report No. 615, April 5, 1935, p. 5)
said, "To assure support for the aged as a right rather than as public
charity, and in amounts which will insure not merely subsistence but
some of the comforts of life,.. .the bill establishes a system of old—age
benefits."

       2kinner (1981) shows that uncertainty about length of life will
affect the responsiveness of savings (consumption) to changes in real
rates of interest. One may infer from his work that it is difficult
empirically to extricate the effects of uncertainty from those of
changes in p — r.

       3Among the 31 categories of spending into which Hamerinesh (1982a)
grouped the CEX data, I use food at home and away from home; rent and
spending on owner—occupied housing; utilities and telephone; owned vehicles,
other transportation and vehicle operations, and vacations to correspond
to the categories of spending included in the 1973 1UiS. The correspondence
to the 1975 RHS dropped owned vehicles, other transportation and vehicle
operations, but added admissions to spectator events, televisions and
radios purchases, photography, other recreation, reading materials, and
gifts.
       4
         If (1) is reestimated on only those households in which the head
is a white married male who is not working and whose wife is not working,
the R2 is .989 for the 1973 spending categories, .992 for the 1975
categories. Deleting households for which dY > 1, the R2 are .598 and
.548 for the two definitions of spending, CR1-IS.
       5
        The goods on which spending is reported in the RHS may have an
average income elasticity different from one. The procedure of inflating
spending in the R}iS by the ratio 1/.628 will not bias the ratio of the
estimate of average spending in the sample to average resources, ft will
create a systematic bias in these ratios, C*/Y*, by income class, though,
if the average elasticity is not one. (The bias will be positive for
low—income, negative for high—income households if the elasticity is below
unity, vice—versa if it is above unity.) Since in fact the income
elasticity of commodities included in the 1973 EBS sample is only 1.01
times the average for all commodities in the CEX (1.12 for the 1975 RHS),
this potential difficulty seems unimportant empirically.

       6This bias is likely very small. Among married couples 65 or over
in 1976, income from sources other than earnings, Social Security,
pensions and assets was only 2 percent of the total. (Social Security
Administration, Office of Research and Statistics, Income and Resources
of the Aged, 1980.)
       7
        Even assuming that all the pension income is subject to taxation,
the average couple in the 1973 sample with a head above age 64 would have
paid no Federal tax on its 1972 income. A household with average Social
Security benefits, but other income twice that of the average, and with
only two exemptions (no children, and both spouses under 65) would have
paid Federal income taxes equal only to 6 percent of *• This bias too
is likely to be small.

       8Excluding the annuitized value of the owned portion of owner—
occupied housing from * and the imputed rent from C*, and inflating C*
accordingly corresponding to spending in the CEX, I find the recalculated
ratio of average C to average Y* to be 1.12 in both    samples. This is
only slightly below ratios listed in Tables 2 and 3.

          This is slightly above the share of Social Security in the incomes
of couples 65+ from Social Security Administration, op. cit., footnote 6,
once earnings are excluded from the calculation. PEN*/Y* is somewhat
above the share of pension income reported in that source. Since I
exclude the self—employed and ax—government employees, who receive small
Social Security income at most, and since my sample includes people early
in retirement, before their real pension income has eroded, the estimates
in Table 4 seem remarkably close to the estimates covering a much broader
sample.

          Feldstein's (1980) most completely specified and carefully
estimated model based on micro data yields an estimate of displacement
quite close to .5.
      11
         This is not because of some strange difference in the ages of the
wives in the subsamples: Husbands in the younger subsample in the 1973
R}IS are 2.9 years younger than those in the older subsample; their wives
are 2.0 years younger than their counterparts. Comparable differences
for the 1975 RHS are 2.4 and 2.2 years for husbands and wives respectively.
      12
         Transportation is excluded from C* in this comparison from the
1973 RHS for this group, while miscellaneous expenses are excluded from
the 1975 RRS.
       13
         The correspondence between RI-IS spending categories and components
of the PCE deflator is: Vacations, recreation; imputed rent; owner—
occupied dwellings; rent, renter—occupied dwellings; utilities, household
utilities; food, off—premise food consumption; nonfood groceries, toilet
articles; and food away from home, purchased meals and beverages. Because
the RI-IS data on spending in the various categories are based on different
points up to one year before the interview date, the observations on
the deflators are chosen to correspond to the quarters when the RI{S
spending is measured.

        14lncome from sources other than assets, pensions and Social
 Security, and earnings constituted only 8 percent of the total among all
 households with a head age 65 or over in the 1972—73 CEX (BLS, Consumer
 Expenditure Series: Interview Survey, 1972—73, Report No. 455—4, 1977).
 Half of this small fraction was composed of rental income and income from
 royalties and roomers, which presumably also stem from physical assets
 that are included in the RHS measures of assets.

       15Wolfe estimates that men who retire on Social Security at age
62 have a mortality rate roughly one—third above that of men who retire
at 65. His estimated differential for women is somewhat below this.
Taking a one—third higher mortality rate for both spouses, and recomputing
the value of an annuity using these higher rates raises the payout on a
joint annuity starting at ages 65 and 62 for husband and wife only by 11
percent. For the average household in the RHS this would increase Y*
by only 2 percent.

       16An argument based on declining ability to consume goods because
of sharply decreasing efficiency in household production early in
retirement is inconsistent with data from the National Health Survey in
1975. Among persons age 55—64 the number of days of restricted activity
per year were 28.0; days of bed disability were 9.3 per year. Comparable
figures for persons 65—74 were 34.0 and 10.3. Only among persons 75+
do these statistics increase substantially,, to 46.2 and 17.4 respectively.

                                               Statistics, Series 10, No.
118, p. 20.)

       17Sobol's (1979) results suggest that blacks' accumulation of
physical and financial assets up to the point shortly before retirement
is far less relative to their lifetime earnings than that of whites. To
the extent they were in covered employment and earned less than whites,
progressive Social Security benefit formulae willy though, offset some of
this greater inadequacy among blacks than among the whites I examine here.
