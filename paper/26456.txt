                                         ABSTRACT

Over the past 20 years, elite colleges in the US have seen dramatic increases in applications. We
provide context for part of this trend using detailed data on Harvard University that was unsealed
as part of the SFFA v. Harvard lawsuit. We show that Harvard encourages applications from
many students who effectively have no chance of being admitted, and that this is particularly true
for African Americans. African American applications soared beginning with the Class of 2009,
with the increase driven by those with lower SAT scores. Yet there was little change in the share
of admits who were African American. We show that this change in applicant behavior resulted
in substantial convergence in the overall admissions rates across races yet no change in the large
cross-race differences in admissions rates for high-SAT applicants.

1         Introduction
Applications to elite colleges and universities have skyrocketed over the past twenty years
with little change in the number of admits (DeSilver, 2019). At top schools, admission
rates are now in the single digits (U.S. News & World Report, 2019).1 With such low
admit rates, many applicants simply have no chance of being admitted, suggesting clear
information problems in this market. Even though the Common App has lowered the costs
of applying to multiple institutions (Knight and Schiff, 2019), the high rejection rates imply
significant wasted resources in terms of the applicant's time filling out additional essays, the
monetary costs associated with applying to the school (both directly and through sending
score reports), and the time of the admissions officers reading files.
        Part of the reason for these high application rates is that colleges actively recruit appli-
cants. Students who take exams such as the PSAT are often flooded with brochures from
various colleges (Rivard, 2013b; Strauss, 2017). For example, Howell, Hurwitz, and Smith
(2019) find that in a sample of 2015-2016 SAT test takers, the average number of institutions
purchasing a student's contact information is 28.5. Colleges recruit students to find the most
productive matches and to maximize the number of full-paying students (Rivard, 2013b).
However, there are additional incentives to recruit students to apply, even those who have
no chance of admission. This phenomenon, dubbed `recruit to deny' in the popular press,
results in part from college rankings depending on the selectivity of the school (Colarusso,
2015). Prior to 2019, one of the factors that influenced U.S. News & World Report's college
    1
    For example, the admissions rate for the Harvard Class of 2023 was 4.5% (Caldera and Mohammadzadeh,
2019).


                                                   2
rankings was the acceptance rate of the college (Morse, Brooks, and Mason, 2018). Other
incentives to recruit include attracting a diverse applicant pool. In 2019, the College Board
charged 45¢ for each name provided to interested colleges, with colleges (assuming student
consent) able to send information based on factors such as students' test scores, high school
GPA, intended college major, gender, race, and geography.2
       Using data made public in the SFFA v. Harvard lawsuit, we examine Harvard's recruiting
strategies as well as how these strategies affect the applicant pool and eventual admissions
outcomes.3 We pay particular attention to the effects for African American applicants. The
clearest example of how Harvard recruits students differently based on race comes from the
ways Harvard uses information from standardized tests. Harvard uses data from the PSAT,
SAT, ACT, and Advanced Placement (AP) tests to send out recruitment letters based on
the scores students receive. In recruiting for the Class of 2018, Harvard sent out over 114,000
letters to admit 2,047 students.4 Harvard implemented substantially different cutoffs based
on the race or ethnicity of the applicant for each of the tests except AP. For example, on
the SAT, underrepresented minorities needed to score an 1170 on a 1600 point scale--a
score at roughly the 78th percentile. The corresponding scores for other groups were much
higher. For example, an Asian American male needed a 1380 to qualify for a letter, a
score roughly at the 93rd percentile. (By comparison, the 25th percentile SAT score among
Harvard matriculants in Fall 2017 was 1460.5 ) All told, almost 50% of those qualifying for
a recruiting letter were underrepresented minorities.
       Casting a wide net for underrepresented groups, including African Americans, is impor-
tant in order to satisfy diversity goals. But, as indicated by the quote at the beginning of
our paper, this is only true if the applicant has some hope of being admitted (assuming the
diversity goals are associated with actual attendance rather than application shares). As we
show, a large portion of the African American applicant pool effectively has no chance of
   2
      See College Board (2019c) for pricing details. Strauss (2017) details all of the data collected on test-
takers, as well as showing that the range of variables collected is largest for the SAT, followed by the PSAT,
followed by AP exams. College Board (2019b) indicates that colleges are also provided with detailed data
about the student's high school.
    3
      For a complete list of the legal documents used in this paper, see Appendix Table B1.
    4
      The number is even smaller for domestic students, since international students make up about 10% of
the admitted class (Trial Exhibit DX 042).
    5
      The source for this is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).



                                                      3
admission based on their test scores and grades alone.
       Our analysis is based on three sets of Harvard admissions data. First, Document 415-8
and Document 419-141 provide analysis of detailed individual-level applicant data for the
Classes of 2014­2019. Second, Trial Exhibit DX 042 provides information on the number of
applications, admits, and matriculants by race for the Classes of 2000­2017, as well as average
SAT scores by race and applicant, admit, or matriculant status.6 Finally, Trial Exhibit P044
reports the number of applications and admits by race and SAT score bin--separately for
each test subsection--for the Classes of 2009­2016.
       Using the individual-level applicant data for the Classes of 2014­2019, we first focus on
the links between race, admissions chances, and Harvard's academic index--a weighted com-
bination of the student's SAT scores, SAT II subject test scores, and high school grades.7
We concentrate on a set of domestic applicants who are not otherwise advantaged in the
admissions process. As shown in Arcidiacono, Kinsler, and Ransom (2019b), recruited ath-
letes, legacies, those on the dean's interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDC)
receive large admissions preferences. For some levels of the academic index, essentially all
admits are from one of these groups.8 Focusing instead on non-ALDC applicants, we find
that African Americans account for only 11% of the applicant pool, but 41% of the appli-
cants in the bottom decile of the academic index. The admit rate for non-ALDC African
Americans in the bottom decile was 0.03%: only 2 of the 5,921 applicants in this decile were
admitted over the six year period.9
       While there are a number of potential reasons why we see this striking pattern for African
Americans, historical data provided in Trial Exhibit DX 042 and Trial Exhibit P044 tell
us when these patterns emerge. The data from Trial Exhibit DX 042 show that, while
   6
     We supplement this document with Trial Exhibit DX 030, which provides the number of applicants,
admits, and matriculants for African Americans back to 1980.
   7
     The academic index ranges from 60 to 240 and is roughly equal to the sum of the three components,
where each is on an 80-point scale. For the Classes of 2014­2019, the median academic index was about 223
(Trial Exhibit P617), and the average converted GPA among applicants was 75 out of 80 (Trial Exhibit DX
730). This means that the two SAT score components would be about 148, or 1480 on average. To put that
number into perspective, the average SAT for admits in the Class of 2017 was about 1488 (see Trial Exhibit
DX 042, p. 11 and multiply by two).
   8
     For example, in the lowest academic index decile, the admit rate for ALDC students is above 5%, while
for non-ALDC students the admit rate is only 0.01%.
   9
     For all other races, no non-ALDC applicants in the bottom decile were admitted over these six years.



                                                    4
applications of all races have increased substantially, the increases are especially large for
African Americans between the Classes of 2008 and 2012. Namely, the African American
share of applicants grew from 6.4% for the Class of 2008 to 10.1% for the Class of 2012. Yet,
the share of admits who were African American remained unchanged. At the same time, the
average SAT score of African American applicants fell by 33 points (on an 800-point scale)
over this four-year period. The data by SAT score bins from Trial Exhibit P044 show a sharp
increase in the number of African American applicants whose SAT scores were lower than
550 on any of the SAT subsections. In 2009, the number of African American applicants
with scores above 640 was more than double the number of applicants with scores below 550.
But for the Class of 2012, there were fewer African American applicants with math scores
above 640 than below 550.10
       The timing of the increase in relatively low-scoring African American applications coin-
cides with two events. First, the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative was announced in February
2004, after application decisions for the Class of 2008 had been submitted but before ma-
triculation decisions for that class were made. This program greatly increased financial aid
generosity to students coming from family incomes under $60,000.11 However, this is unlikely
to be the sole driver of the increase in relatively low-scoring African American applications
since the African American share of high-scoring applications did not change over the period.
Second, two high-profile Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action--Gratz v. Bollinger
and Grutter v. Bollinger --took place immediately prior to the Class of 2008 application
cycle. Following these two decisions, differences in Harvard admissions rates across races
have shown a dramatic convergence.12 In 2009, African American applicants were admit-
ted at a 67% higher rate than Asian American applicants but by 2016 the rate had fallen
  10
     The similar numbers for Asian Americans show that the number of applicants with scores above 640
was at least 46 times the number of applicants with scores below 550 in all years. For Hispanics, the ratio
of above-640 to below-550 is always larger than 2.8.
  11
     The program guaranteed that students whose parents earn less than $40,000 would not have to pay
anything out of pocket to attend Harvard, and that students from families earning $40,000­$60,000 would
see a greatly reduced out-of-pocket expenditure requirement.
  12
     These two cases brought race-based admissions policies under scrutiny for the first time in 25 years (fol-
lowing Bakke v. University of California in 1978). Why Harvard would want convergence in the admissions
rates and/or similar representation rates in the applicant and admissions pools is an open question. One
potential reason is that Harvard would want to downplay the magnitude of race-based preferences in the
aggregate data (as a defense against future lawsuits on the question), and convergence in admissions rates
would be one way to accomplish that.


                                                      5
to 3% higher.13 Yet this convergence masks the fact that, for high-scoring applicants, the
admissions advantages for African Americans were relatively unchanged: African Americans
who scored above a 740 on the SAT math were 4.46 times as likely to be admitted as a
similar-scoring Asian American in 2009 and were 4.65 times as likely to be admitted in 2016.
       The relatively high admit rate for African Americans who scored above a 740 on the
SAT math is consistent with Harvard's stated goals of pursuing a diverse class. Less clear
is precisely why Harvard, starting around 2008, significantly expanded recruiting efforts
focused on low-SAT African American applicants. As noted above, Harvard's financial aid
initiative and liability concerns related to affirmative action may be contributing factors.
More directly, attracting a diverse applicant pool could aid in promoting a diverse incoming
class even if only one or two of these students are admitted. Yet, the idea that to achieve
this goal Harvard needs to apply different test score thresholds by race is tacit recognition of
the serious racial inequalities in this country affecting children prior to the time of college-
going. In addition, by recruiting many African American applicants who have essentially no
chance of being admitted (so that the applicant pool better reflects the population), Harvard
masks the substantial racial inequality in academic preparation. It is this racial inequality
in pre-college academic preparation that is in need of serious attention (Chetty et al., 2018).
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the strategies
Harvard uses to recruit applicants, paying particular attention to how race is treated in the
process. In Section 3, we discuss admission patterns in the individual-level data for the
Classes of 2014 to 2019. In Section 4, we use the historical data to show how application
and admit rates for different races have evolved over time. Section 5 discusses possible
explanations for the empirical patterns. Section 6 concludes.
  13
    The admission rate for African Americans (Asian Americans) was 12.9% (7.7%) in 2009 and 6.2% (6.0%)
in 2016. Moving back to 2000, the admit rate for African Americans was over twice that of Asian Americans:
19.2% versus 9.2%. Even back in 1990, the African American admit rate (28.9%) was more than double the
Asian American admit rate (12.7%); see Trial Exhibit DX 030 and Trial Exhibit DX 033.

2        Harvard's Recruiting Strategies
In this section, we provide background on methods Harvard uses to recruit applicants.14
These consist of the following: purchasing student information from College Board and ACT
to create search lists; financial aid programs; and direct outreach to potential applicants.15


2.1       College Board and ACT Search Lists

Harvard identifies prospective students in the US and Puerto Rico by purchasing student
information from the College Board and ACT.16 Information consists of each student's name
and physical address, as well as email address and social media accounts (Day 3 Trial Tran-
script, p. 147). Harvard uses PSAT, SAT and AP scores from the College Board, and ACT
scores from the ACT. In the case of the College Board, each name costs 45¢ (College Board,
2019c), which is up from 37¢ six years earlier (Rivard, 2013a). In all, Harvard sent out
almost 112,000 letters to applicants for the Class of 2017, and over 114,000 for the Class of
2018 (Trial Exhibit P002), of which roughly 70% came from the PSAT.17 While the term
"letters" conjures an image of postal mail, nowadays Harvard's recruitment primarily utilizes
email and social media. In fact, students on the search list may receive up to 50 electronic
communications throughout their last two years of high school.18
       As of the Harvard Class of 2017, Harvard employed varying cutoffs for determining who
was included on the search list. The cutoffs vary by race, gender, and state of residence
  14
      These methods are described in detail in the Harvard Alumni Interviewer Handbook (Trial Exhibit DX
005), pp. 13­14.
   15
      These strategies and others are also discussed in Hoxby and Avery (2013). Additional strategies in-
clude "guaranteeing need-blind admission, disproportionately visiting high schools with large numbers of
free-lunch-eligible students, sending special letters to high achievers who live in high-poverty ZIP codes,
maintaining strong relationships with guidance counselors who reliably direct low-income applicants to them,
coordinating with or even running college mentoring programs for low-income students, paying a third-party
organization for a guaranteed minimum number of low-income enrollees, sponsoring campus visits for stu-
dents from local high schools known to serve low-income families, and personally contacting students whose
essays suggest that they might be disadvantaged" (original emphasis).
   16
      For more details on the College Board Search Service, see College Board (2019a).
   17
      Approximately one quarter comes from the SAT or ACT, while the remaining roughly 5% comes from
AP exams.
   18
      See Day 3 Trial Transcript, p. 147. For an example of the types of emails Harvard sends to students, see
Trial Exhibit P055. Notably, one of the messages sent informs prospective students that "Your strong grades
and standardized test scores indicate to us that Harvard and other selective institutions may be possibilities
for you."



                                                      7
(Trial Exhibit P002).19 We present in Table 1 an adapted version of Trial Exhibit P002.
The table shows SAT-equivalent score cutoffs to be included on Harvard's search list based
on PSAT performance. In addition to test score cutoffs, Harvard also considers a student's
self-reported GPA. Men who are not underrepresented minorities (i.e. those who are white
or Asian American) are required to get at least a 1380 on the test--the 93rd percentile in the
national distribution--to be recruited.20 Non-minority women have a lower cutoff at 1350,
which is the 91st percentile nationally. Those who come from so-called "sparse country"--
US states with relatively low population density--face an even lower cutoff at 1310, which
is the 88th percentile.21
       The picture in Table 1 is much different for minorities (i.e. African Americans, Hispanics,
and Native Americans). The SAT-equivalent score cutoff for each group is 1100, which
corresponds to just the 58th percentile nationally. Minorities also face a lower GPA cutoff,
with a B+ being the lowest permissible GPA, compared to an A- for all other groups.
       Finally, in the last column of Table 1, we report the average SAT score among Harvard
admits for each group. We know this only by race/ethnicity, so some values are duplicated.
What is striking about this is that the score cutoff is at most 190 points below the average
score of admits for whites and Asian Americans, but is more than 330 points below admits'
SAT for each of the minority groups.
       It is unclear from lawsuit documents and public records how long Harvard has used the
search list. The list was first publicly mentioned as a successful recruiting tool for the Class
of 2007 (The Harvard Gazette, 2003), but may have been used before then.22 Additionally, it
  19
      It is unclear from available public documents how recruiting intensity varies with race, gender, etc. The
only evidence along these lines is Trial Exhibit P055, which appears to show that different versions of the
same recruiting email are sent to different race-gender combinations. The difference appears to be the name
and ethnicity of the current Harvard student featured in the message.
   20
      See College Board (2018) for exact percentiles used to compute these.
   21
      Asian American applicants from "sparse country" do not benefit from the lower cutoff. The following
explanation for this pattern was offered by the Harvard Dean of Admissions, "...there are people who, let's
say, for example, have only lived in the Sparse Country state for a year or two. Let's say that can happen.
And then on the other hand there are people who have lived there for their entire lives under very different
settings. So what we're trying to make sure we do, in an even-handed way, is to reach out to what lots of
people would say is the heartland of America." See Day 1 Trial Transcript, p. 148.
   22
      As of 2013, the practice of purchasing search lists appears to be widely embraced by nearly every
university and college in the US (Rivard, 2013b). Also in 2013, College Board and ACT were sued for
allegedly unlawfully selling students' data to universities (Rivard, 2013a). Privacy issues surrounding the
collection of student data for myriad uses continued to receive scrutiny four years later (Strauss, 2017).



                                                      8
is not clear how many students on the search list actually end up applying to Harvard, or how
many applications Harvard receives from students who did not appear on the search list.23
For a broader pool of universities, Howell, Hurwitz, and Smith (2019) find that receiving a
recruiting letter increases the probability of applying to that school by 23%. Additionally,
they find that African-American students and students whose SAT score is 200 points below
the recruiting school's average are significantly more responsive to recruiting efforts.


2.2       Financial Aid

The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI) was established in the summer of 2004 and had
two primary goals. The first was to ensure that all admitted students have the opportunity to
attend Harvard. Second, HFAI aimed to raise awareness of college affordability for students
interested in all kinds of colleges and universities (The Harvard Gazette, 2005). Initially,
the program greatly increased the financial aid given to students from families with incomes
of less than $60,000. In 2008, HFAI expanded its scope by targeting aid to families with
incomes between $60,000 and $120,000. Since its initial implementation, the admissions and
financial aid office have coordinated to personally reach out to students for whom the HFAI
program would be most beneficial.24


2.3       Direct Outreach

In addition to College Board searches and financial aid initiatives, Harvard recruits applicants
through various direct outreach programs. Harvard relies on alumni, admissions staff, and
current undergraduate students to aid in this recruiting effort.
       The bulk of Harvard's face-to-face recruiting comes through its vast network of alumni
interviewers. Known as the Schools Committee, this group of over 10,000 alumni actively
recruits applicants (Day 1 Trial Transcript, pp. 131­132). Harvard furnishes each of its
Schools Committees with the names of students from the local area who were on search list
  23
     Among African American Early Action applicants to the Class of 2017 who scored below 1240 on the
SAT, 54% (64/119) were actively recruited (Trial Exhibit P050, p. 1). It is difficult to use this information
to infer anything about the broader application yield from the search list, since this figure is for Early Action
applicants from one cycle.
  24
     See Trial Exhibit DX 005, p. 14



                                                       9
purchased from College Board and ACT (ibid., p. 130). Members of the Schools Committee
are encouraged to invite these members to attend any public recruiting events that may be
held (ibid.). Once the application process has started, members of the Schools Committee
interview applicants.25 After interviews are completed, each Schools Committee meets to
rank applicants from their local area and send the recommendations back to the admissions
office (Trial Exhibit DX 005, p. 36).
      Members of Harvard's admissions staff also directly interact with potential applicants.
Harvard staff members, along with admissions staff from other elite universities, visit over 130
US cities (Trial Exhibit DX 005) and hold information sessions open to the general public.
Through these efforts, Harvard contacts over 50,000 students. Notably, students who appear
on the test score search list are invited by the local Schools Committee to attend recruiting
events (Day 1 Trial Transcript, p. 131). Additionally, the admissions office holds interviews
and information sessions on Harvard's campus (Trial Exhibit DX 005, p. 14).
      Current undergraduate students also play an important role in recruiting, particularly
for underrepresented minority applicant groups. The Undergraduate Minority Recruitment
Program (UMRP) consists of more than 20 undergraduates who conduct personal outreach
to minority students. UMRP members also travel to schools with large concentrations of
minority students to encourage the students to apply to college. The UMRP works closely
with the financial aid office to identify students who could benefit from HFAI and who would
otherwise not consider applying to Harvard (Trial Exhibit DX 005, p. 14).



3       Harvard Applicants, Classes of 2014­2019
Using individual-level application data, we explore how the recruiting practices at Harvard
cited above influence the academic attributes of the applicant pool. We focus primarily on
recruitment through the College Board since it is explicitly tied to a student's academic
credentials.

3.1       Applicant Data

Our analysis of individual applicants is based upon anonymized data on domestic applicants
produced by Harvard and used in the trial's expert witness reports. The sample consists of
166,727 domestic, non-transfer, complete applications of which 11,132 were admitted.26
       For each applicant, the data contain detailed demographic information, academic per-
formance in a variety of categories, scores on each of Harvard's internal ratings, and final
admission decisions. For more details on the application process, see Arcidiacono, Kinsler,
and Ransom (2019b). The findings presented in the current paper are based solely on infor-
mation in the publicly released versions of the expert witness reports or information publicly
released in other documents.


3.2       Academic Preparation and Admission

We begin by examining the distribution of academic preparation among Harvard applicants
using the academic index, a variable available in Harvard's admissions data. The academic
index is a weighted average of an applicant's scores on the SAT, SAT II, and high school
grade point average (or class rank).27 It is used primarily by Ivy League institutions and was
designed specifically to regulate athletic recruitment.28 The academic index provides a simple
summary of the academic credentials of an applicant. There are numerous online calculators
that will not only compute a potential applicant's academic index, but also provide feedback
on whether the applicant's academic index is competitive. The index ranges in value from
60 to 240.
       We construct deciles of Harvard's academic index for all domestic, non-recruited athlete
applicants applying between 2009 and 2014.29 The ranges of the academic index deciles are
  26
      For further details about the data and sample selection, see sections 2.2 and 2.3 of Document 415-8 and
section 3 of Document 419-141.
   27
      For those who took only the SAT, the highest math score on any of the times the applicant took the
SAT is averaged with the highest verbal score and then divided by 10. The average of the two highest SAT
subject test scores, again divided by 10, is then added to the SAT number. Finally, these two numbers are
added to a measure of the student's high school GPA or class rank that has been converted to a 20­80 point
scale. See Document 415-8 footnote 29.

      See https://www.toptieradmissions.com/resources/college-calculator/ for additional informa-
tion.

      We remove recruited athletes because their admit rates are extraordinarily high and are the only ones
admitted given especially low scores on Harvard's academic rating. Over the course of this time period, the


                                                     11
presented in Table 2, as well as admit rates for applicants in each decile. For the admit
rates, we split applicants into two groups: (1) legacy, dean's interest list, and children of
faculty/staff (LDC) and (2) applicants with no special status as a recruited athlete or LDC
(non-ALDC).
   The bottom 10% of applicants to Harvard have an academic index below 193.8, while the
bottom 20% all have an academic index less than or equal to 205.5. Thus, the bottom 20%
of applicants according to the academic index would all be deemed weak by readily available
admissions websites. Consistent with this, the admit rates for non-ALDC applicants in the
1st and 2nd deciles are 0.01% and 0.53% respectively. Out of 14,593 non-ALDC applicants in
the 1st academic index decile, only two were admitted over the entire six-year period. Thus,
being in the lowest academic index decile essentially guarantees rejection. The corresponding
admit rate for LDC applicants in the bottom decile is 500 times higher, illustrating the strong
preferences Harvard employs for special status applicants.
   By construction, approximately 10% of the applicants fall within each academic index
decile. However, the racial distribution of applicants is not uniform across the deciles. Table
3 shows the distribution of non-ALDC applicants across deciles by race, along with the
corresponding admit rates. Nearly 40% of non-ALDC African American applicants are in the
bottom academic index decile. Over 60% of non-ALDC African American applicants are in
the bottom two deciles combined. By comparison, only 13% (9%) of white (Asian American)
non-ALDC applicants are in the bottom two deciles. The admit rate for African American
applicants in the bottom decile is 0.03%, meaning that nearly 40% of African American
applicants, or 5,900 prospective students for the Classes of 2014­2019, have essentially no
chance of being admitted to Harvard.
   Regardless of race, any applicant in the bottom academic index decile has essentially no
chance of admission. This fact by itself is not surprising or alarming. However, as Table
4 illustrates, African American applicants account for 43% of the non-ALDC rejections in
the lowest academic index decile. Overall, African American applicants account for only
admit rate for recruited athletes was 86%. See Arcidiacono, Kinsler, and Ransom (2019b) for an analysis
of athlete preferences at Harvard. We also exclude those who received the lowest score for converted grade
point average (35). This is because converted GPAs range from 35 to 80, and there is a spike in the data
at 35. It is apparent from the data that a 35 is often a result of grades being incorrectly converted. See
Document 415-8 footnote 51 for details.


                                                   12
12% of all non-ALDC rejections.30 Thus, African American applicants are substantially
over-represented among rejected applicants with low SAT scores and high school GPAs. At
the top of the academic index distribution, admit rates for African American applicants
are relatively high and African American applicants account for relatively few rejects. For
example, in the 9th academic index decile, the admit rate for African American applicants
is approximately five (seven) times higher than the admit rate for white (Asian American)
applicants. At the top of the academic index distribution, racial preferences appear to play a
large role, while at the bottom of the distribution, race is inconsequential since all applicants
are noncompetitive.
       In addition to the academic index, Harvard also assigns each applicant an academic
rating. This rating ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest rating.31 Similar to the
academic index, Harvard's academic rating can incorporate SAT scores and GPA, but it can
also take into account additional information such as AP scores, high school competitiveness,
and other academic achievements such as success in science or math competitions (Document
419-1, pp. 167­169). The racial patterns we observe in the academic index deciles are also
present in the academic rating, and the two appear to be highly correlated, as we show later in
more detail. More than 50% of non-ALDC African American applicants receive an academic
rating of 4 or worse. In contrast, only 10% (8%) of white (Asian American) applicants receive
a rating of 4 or worse (see Trial Exhibit P621). The admit rate for non-ALDC applicants
with an academic rating of 4 or worse is 0.01%.32
       Why are there so many African American applicants to Harvard who appear to effectively
have no chance of being admitted? Harvard's recruitment strategy appears to play a role.
The cutoffs Harvard uses in recruiting applicants through the College Board (see Table 1)
can be mapped to academic index values. Consider an African American applicant towards
the low end of the SAT range that qualifies for a recruitment letter, 1170. Suppose this
individual also earned a combined 1170 on their two SAT II tests, and had a converted GPA
  30
     The patterns for Hispanic applicants are similar to those of African American applicants, though slightly
muted. 20% of non-ALDC Hispanic applicants are in the bottom decile of the academic index, or approxi-
mately 3,600 applicants.
  31
     See Document 419-1, pp. 158­160 for more detail on the rating. See Arcidiacono, Kinsler, and Ransom
(2019b) for an overview of Harvard's non-academic ratings.
  32
     See Trial Exhibit P618 for admit rates by academic rating. There are just 3 admits out of 24,511
applicants with an academic rating of 4 or worse.


                                                     13
equal to the average among applicants (75, see Trial Exhibit DX 730). This would yield an
academic index of 117 + 75 = 192, well within the first decile of the academic index. In
other words, Harvard is actively sending recruiting materials to prospective students who
effectively have no chance of being admitted.33
       One rationale for recruiting applicants with noncompetitive academic credentials is that
these applicants may be highly competitive in other dimensions that Harvard values (i.e. ex-
tracurricular activities, personal qualities, and secondary school teacher recommendations).
While the admit rates at low academic index deciles and low academic ratings suggest this
is not the case, we show this explicitly in Table 5. Panel A shows that the academic rating
moves closely with the academic index. Panels B through D show that applicants in the
bottom deciles of the academic index are significantly less likely to be rated highly according
to their extracurricular activities, personal qualities, or teacher recommendations.34 In other
words, it is unlikely that an applicant who has relatively weak academic credentials will be
strong on non-academic credentials. As a result, recruited students who are not academically
competitive do not gain admission to Harvard.
       An important caveat to the above analysis is that the PSAT cutoffs for African Amer-
icans were the same as the PSAT cutoffs for Hispanics for the Classes of 2014­2019. At
slightly under 20%, non-ALDC Hispanics are also over-represented in the bottom decile of
the academic index.35 But this is still much smaller than the rate for African Americans.36
Part of the explanation may lie in Hispanics having an SAT score distribution that is to the
right of African Americans. Part of the explanation may also be residue from different cutoffs
prior to the Class of 2014. As we illustrate in the next section, the application patterns are
  33
     White and Asian-American recruits scoring at the low end of the SAT search range also have a low
probability of admission. Consider a white male applicant who scored a 1380 on the SAT and SAT II, and
had a converted GPA equal to the average among applicants. This applicant's academic index would be
213, essentially on the border between the 3rd and 4th decile. The admissions probability for this applicant
would probably be about 1%. While low, the overall admit rate for all non-ALDC applicants is only about
5.5%.
  34
     Other Harvard ratings, such as Teacher 2, School Counselor, and Alumni ratings, show similar patterns.
  35
     Additionally, more than 35% of non-ALDC Hispanic applicants receive an academic rating of 4 or worse
(see Trial Exhibit P621).
  36
     This suggests that a portion of the African American applicants in the bottom decile of the academic
index are not actually recruited through the College Board or other testing services. However, as discussed
in Section 2, there are other channels through which Harvard reaches out to potential African American
applicants, such as the UMRP program. These additional recruiting efforts may help explain the large
overrepresentation of African American applicants in the bottom academic index decile.


                                                    14
consistent with African Americans and Hispanics having different cutoffs prior to 2014.



4        Historical Trends in Applications at Harvard
For the Classes of 2014­2019, Harvard sent letters of interest to many African American high
school students who essentially had no chance of admission. Over this short window, Har-
vard's recruitment practices appear fairly steady--the share of non-ALDC African American
applicants in the bottom two academic index deciles ranges from 63.1% in 2014 to 57.1%
in 2019 (Document 415-8, Table B.5.7). However, this has not always been the case. Using
historical records on Harvard admissions, we provide evidence that suggests Harvard has
altered its recruiting practices over time.
       We focus on three data sources. First is Trial Exhibit DX 042, which lists aggregate
numbers of applications, admissions, and matriculations by race/ethnicity and athlete/legacy
status for each of the Harvard Classes of 2000­2017 (applicants graduating high school in
1996­2013).37 This document also has information on average SAT scores for applicants and
admits by race and year. Second is Trial Exhibit P044, which lists detailed SAT distributions
by admit status, race and year, covering the Classes of 2009­2016. Third are the recruitment
reports given in Trial Exhibit P002, Trial Exhibit P050 and Trial Exhibit P057, which show
test score cutoffs as well as the number of students who qualify according to the various
search criteria.


4.1       Application Trends at Harvard

As documented in Arcidiacono, Kinsler, and Ransom (2019a), applications to Harvard in-
creased substantially over the 2000­2017 time period. Using data from Trial Exhibit DX
042, Figure 1 shows the growth in total applications, as well as key events in US law or
changes in Harvard's admissions policies.38 Applications grew considerably over the period
  37
     Similar to Trial Exhibit DX 042, we can recover data back to the Class of 1980 using Trial Exhibit
DX 030, Trial Exhibit DX 031, and Trial Exhibit DX 033. These exhibits provide aggregate numbers of
applications, admissions, and matriculations for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans. They
do not include SAT scores for these groups, nor do they provide separate counts by athlete/legacy status.
  38
     The US Supreme Court cases Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger were decided in June 2003,
just prior to the start of the Class of 2008 application cycle. About one year later, Harvard implemented


                                                   15
of 2012­2015.
    The growth in applications for African Americans, however, occurred earlier. Figure 2(a)
shows the share of applicants and admits over time who were African American. The time
trend for applicants can be characterized by three periods. The first period spans the Classes
of 1980­2008. Here, the African American share of applicants is slightly increasing, from
about 5% in the early 1980s to about 6% in the mid-2000s. The second period, covering
2008­2012, sees the African American share of applicants rise dramatically, increasing from
6.4% to 10.1% in four years, a 58 percent increase. The third period, covering 2012­2017,
shows no time trend.
    The patterns for the African American share of admits are much more stable, and es-
pecially so during 2008­2012--the period of rapid growth in the African American share of
applicants.39 While the African American share of admits grew by about two percentage
points between 1980 and 2008, the share in 2008 is essentially identical to the share in 2012.
So, despite a 58 percent increase in the African American share of applicants during this
four-year period, the African American share of admits remained unchanged.40
    This pattern is consistent with the rise in the African American share of applicants coming
from noncompetitive applicants or with Harvard having a quota on the share of African
American admits. To investigate how the competitiveness of African American applicants
changed over time, Figure 2(b) plots the average SAT scores for African American applicants
over this period. Between 2000 and 2008, the average SAT score for African American
applicants rose slightly, from 627 to 636 on an 800-point scale. But from 2008 to 2012, the
average SAT scores of African American applicants steadily fell, dropping by 33 points (or
the HFAI. As mentioned before, this financial aid initiative greatly reduced the required contribution for
families from lower income backgrounds. The next change happened in 2007, just before the Class of 2012
application cycle. Here, Harvard eliminated its early action program and also announced innovations to the
HFAI. These financial aid innovations greatly reduced the cost of attendance for families between $60,000
and $120,000. Finally, prior to the Class of 2016 application cycle, early action was reinstated.
  39
     We are unable to distinguish between African Americans whose parents immigrated to the US, versus
those whose parents and grandparents were born in the US. As Massey et al. (2007) show, there is a large
over-representation of African Americans in the Ivy League who have at least one parent born outside the
US.
  40
     For comparison purposes, Figure A1 shows the share of applicants and admits over time who were
Hispanic. The overall time patterns differ in that the share of Hispanic applicants and admits is growing
throughout the period, consistent with broader US demographic trends. Additionally, the gap in the Hispanic
share of admits and applicants is smaller throughout, with a convergence starting around 2006.



                                                    16
roughly one-third of a standard deviation in the national distribution; see College Board,
2012, p. 7) over four years. Indeed, 2012 is the minimum average SAT score for African
American applicants during the time period of our data. After 2012, the SAT scores of
African American applicants recover a bit, but remain at least seven points lower than any
of the pre-2009 classes.
       The sharp decline in SAT scores among African American applicants beginning in 2008
does not hold for any of the other major racial/ethnic groups applying to Harvard, as we
show in Appendix Figure A2. Hispanic applicants show a dip of 15 points between 2008 and
2012, but their scores fully recover by 2017. The average SAT score for white and Asian
American applicants is rising or flat over the 2000­2017 time period.
       SAT scores for admits also rose over this time period for each racial/ethnic group. For
example, the average SAT score for admitted African Americans grew from 693 to 717. For
white and Asian American admits, the growth was more modest at less than 10 points for
each group. This further supports our claim that the growth in applications for African
Americans in particular was driven by unprecedented growth in noncompetitive applicants.
       Additional documentation from Harvard supports the hypothesis that the rise in appli-
cations among African Americans starting in 2008 was driven by noncompetitive applicants.
Trial Exhibit P044 lists the number of applicants and admits for the 2009­2016 admissions
cycles by race/ethnicity and SAT math, verbal, and writing score ranges. In Figure 3(a),
we report the number of African American applicants from four different SAT math score
ranges. What is striking is the growth in the number of African American applicants whose
SAT math score is below 550.41 Between 2009 and 2013, the number of African American
applicants with SAT math scores below 550 increased from approximately 300 to nearly 800.
In 2012 alone, there were more African American applicants with scores below 550 than
with scores above 640.42 These patterns are not mirrored by other racial groups.43 Figure
  41
     In 2008, a 540 on the math SAT would correspond to the 56th percentile;                                   a
650 would correspond to the 86th percentile.                          See https://blog.prepscholar.com/
sat-historical-percentiles-for-2010-2009-2008.
  42
     In Appendix Figure A4, we show similar graphs for the SAT verbal and writing scores. The results look
very similar.
  43
     Appendix Figures A6­A8 show the applicant and admit totals across SAT score ranges and subjects for
Hispanics. While there is a slight uptick in applications among Hispanics scoring below 550 on any of the
sections of the SAT, the rate of increase is similar across other test score ranges. This is not consistent with



                                                      17
4(a) shows that African Americans accounted for an increasing share of sub-550 SAT math
applications, rising from 35.5% to 46.5% between 2009 and 2013. But among those scoring
above 740, the share who were African American shows little change over time.44
    That these low test score applications have little chance of admission is shown in Figure
3(b). Here we show the number of African American admits from each math SAT score
bin. Admits overwhelmingly come from the over-640 score range, with virtually no admits
coming from the sub-550 range.45
    Interestingly, there is an almost 20% drop in the number of African American applications
with scores below 550 on the math section for the Class of 2014 (in both Figures 3 and 4).
After the Class of 2014, the application pattern mirrors that of the other SAT score groups.
This pattern is also seen in the verbal and writing sections. At the same time, there is
virtually no change for Hispanic applicants for the Class of 2014 with SAT math scores below
550. This is consistent with African Americans having had a lower cutoff than Hispanics
prior to this class and having the same cutoff thereafter. Hence, the patterns we showed in
the previous section (e.g. Table 4) for African Americans for the Classes of 2014­2019 are
likely underestimates of the share of noncompetitive applications in the years immediately
prior to this period.
    The abrupt rise in applications from low-scoring African Americans starting with the
Class of 2008 is unlikely to have occurred by chance. However, there is no available docu-
mentation regarding Harvard's test score search criteria during this time period. We know
that, since the Class of 2014, Harvard has sent recruiting letters to underrepresented minori-
ties who obtain at least an SAT-equivalent score of 1100 on the PSAT.46 Figure 3(a) shows
that there was a steep drop in African American applications from the sub-550 group for
the Class of 2014. This drop is also visible in the distribution of verbal and writing scores
(see Appendix Figure A4).47 While our SAT groupings are rough proxies for the actual test
the pattern for African Americans.
  44
     The patterns in Figure 4 are basically unchanged if we consider racial shares for SAT math scores below
600 in panel (a) and above 700 in panel (b).
  45
     Appendix Figure A5 displays the same numbers for the SAT verbal and writing scores, with very similar
results.
  46
     See Trial Exhibit P050 for documentation on test score search parameters for the Classes of 2014­2017.
  47
     This drop is not present for Hispanic applicants, consistent with Harvard having lower test score cutoffs
for African Americans prior to the Class of 2014.



                                                     18
score cutoffs, it stands to reason that a drop that is highly correlated across test sections
may be taken as evidence that Harvard changed its recruitment parameters starting with
the Class of 2014. And the sharp drop in the number of African American applicants in the
sub-550 group also indicates that potential applicants are responsive to Harvard's recruiting
efforts.48 The continually high number of sub-550 scoring applicants (even after 2012) could
be due to Harvard's other recruiting tools identifying these students, such as school visits as
part of the UMRP.



5        Potential Mechanisms
While it is clear that a large fraction of African American applicants are not competitive
for admission to Harvard based on test scores alone and that this has been the case for
some time, it is less clear why this is occurring. One possible driver is the Harvard Fi-
nancial Aid Initiative (HFAI). Test scores are positively correlated with income, so HFAI
may have contributed to more lower-income students applying who in turn had lower test
scores.49 Since African Americans tend to come from less-advantaged households, the rise
in (relatively) low-test-score applications could be especially strong for this group. But the
dramatic increase in the share of sub-550 SAT math applicants that were African American,
accompanied by little change in the share of applicants with SAT math scores above 740
who were African American, suggests this is unlikely to be the sole contributor.50
       However, HFAI could have worked in conjunction with racial differences in Harvard's
  48
      This is consistent with Smith, Hurwitz, and Howell (2015) and Pallais (2015), who find that prospective
college students are highly sensitive to even small changes in psychic or monetary application costs. Liu,
Ehrenberg, and Mrdjenovic (2007) and Knight and Schiff (2019) find that the Common Application increases
schools' diversity because of reduced costs of applying to an additional school. Gurantz, Hurwitz, and Smith
(2017) show that high-achieving Hispanic students are also responsive to colleges' recruiting efforts.
   49
      Avery et al. (2006) show that Harvard's policy change had very little effect on the income composition of
the Class of 2009. They estimate that it increased the number of low-income students by approximately 20,
in a Class of more than 1,600. Avery et al. (2006) also document modest increases in low-income applications
for the Class of 2009. Because their analysis is limited to the Class of 2009 and does not report applications,
admits, and matriculants by race and SAT scores, it is difficult to understand the broader impact of HFAI
on Harvard admissions. Galat (2013) analyzes HFAI by comparing neighborhood characteristics of Harvard
matriculants before and after the policy. He finds that there was a statistically significant uptick in the
number of low-income students in the Class of 2009, but that this initial change disappeared in the years
following.
   50
      We also show in Appendix Figure A3 that yield rates for underrepresented minority groups did not
appreciably change with the advent of HFAI.


                                                      19
search criteria. Based on the racial variation in the test-score search criteria and other
race-conscious recruiting efforts, it is clear that Harvard is interested in a diverse applicant
pool. One of the margins on which Harvard can influence the diversity of the applicant
pool is through the cutoffs used on the various pre-college tests. Lowering the cutoff for a
particular group will increase applications, but those applications will be less competitive.
It is possible that Harvard was unaware that the increase in applications from low-test-score
African Americans--either from HFAI or through a change in cutoffs--was not translating
into a higher share of African American admits.
      But the existence of the information in Trial Exhibit P044--which is an attachment to
an internal email--suggests that they are aware of admit rates by test scores. There are a
handful of African American admits who have math SAT scores below 550. Thus, the large
number of low-test-score African American applicants who are rejected could be viewed as
worth the cost since a few will be admitted. As we have shown, however, those with low
academic credentials are not admitted (with the exception of two applicants out of six years)
unless they are ALDC.
      In addition to valuing a diverse applicant pool, there is abundant evidence that Harvard
pays close attention to balancing along demographic lines. As an example, Trial Exhibit
P050 illustrates that Harvard pays particular attention to gender balancing. Page 5 shows
what appear to be PSAT search criteria for the Classes of 2014 and 2015, as well as what
those search criteria would mean for the Class of 2016. The document shows that 12,022
women and 17,669 men had scores 1380 or higher. An additional 3,749 women received
scores between 1360 and 1370, labeled as "Female High Scorers."
      What is interesting is that the handwritten notes add the number of women in the two
groups together, which gives 15,771 women.51 There is also a note next to male high scorers
showing what appears to be the number of men who would qualify for a letter if the cutoff
were 1400 instead of 1380, showing that the number would fall to 15,514. Page 4 of the
document shows the search criteria actually implemented, which was to leave the cutoff
the same for men and to lower the cutoff for women to 1350. Using this cutoff raises the
number of high-scoring females to 17,728 which is remarkably close to the 17,669 men who
 51
      The handwritten notes mistakenly add the numbers to be 15,761.


                                                   20
were classified as high scorers. Thus, even though none of the details regarding Harvard's
recruitment and admissions was public until it was revealed in the SFFA v. Harvard lawsuit,
Harvard appears to manipulate its search criteria to achieve particular diversity goals.
       Changes in US law surrounding racial preferences in college admissions may also have
been a driver for the increased interest in African American applications. The two Supreme
Court cases, Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger, were decided in June 2003, right
before the start of the Class of 2008 application cycle. Furthermore, because Harvard's
recruitment is primarily based on the PSAT (which is taken by high school sophomores and
juniors), any adjustment to the criteria will have at least a one-year lag in applications.
       Since the Class of 2008, the admissions rates for different racial/ethnic groups have
converged substantially. This is shown in Panel (a) of Figure 5, which plots the admissions
rates for the four major racial/ethnic groups and overall. Over the Classes of 2000­2008,
African Americans were at least 70 percent more likely to be admitted than Asian Americans
in each of the years. But after 2008, the differences in admit rates between African Americans
and Asian Americans shrunk dramatically, with the two groups having virtually identical
admission rates in 2012.52
       This graph would give the false appearance that race was a limited factor in the admis-
sions process in the more recent years and less important than it was in the past.53 Indeed,
one of Harvard's arguments in SFFA v. Harvard was that racial preferences were small be-
cause many African American applicants were unaffected by racial preferences (Document
419-141, pp. 83­84). That document also showed that over 50% of African Americans had
characteristics (aside from race) that guaranteed rejection (Ibid., Exhibit 28).
       But the reality is that admission rates across races differ substantially by test scores.
And for top test scores, there has been little change in the racial differences in admit rates.
Panel (b) of Figure 5 shows admit rates conditional on having an SAT math score above
  52
     Appendix Figure A9(a) shows the ratio of admit rates for each race relative to the overall admit rate,
going back to the Class of 1980.
  53
     This line of thought is reflected in the recent ruling in the SFFA v. Harvard case. The judge writes,
"SFFA is not claiming that Harvard excludes Asian Americans and in fact, Asian Americans are admitted
at virtually the same rate as white applicants." Later the judge writes, "Asian American applicants are
accepted at the same rate as other applicants and now make up more than 20% of Harvard's admitted
classes, up from 3.4% in 1980." The fact that applicants of different races are admitted at the same rate
generates an implicit reference point that racial preferences must be small (see Document 672).



                                                    21
a 740. While admit rates have fallen for all races over time as Harvard has become more
competitive, the heterogeneity across races is substantial across all years, with little evidence
of convergence. Conditional on scoring above a 740, African Americans were 4.46 times more
likely to be admitted than Asian Americans in 2009 and 4.65 times as likely in 2016.



6       Conclusion
Recruiting applicants is a common practice among colleges and universities. For less well-
known schools, it is an opportunity to inform potential applicants in the hopes of filling
an incoming class. For nationally recognized universities, recruiting is a way to enhance
prestige through reduced acceptance rates and superior credentials among matriculants. It
also provides a way to increase the diversity of the applicant pool along racial, gender,
socioeconomic, and geographic lines.
      In this paper, we illustrate that Harvard recruits African American, Hispanic, and Native
American applicants differently than white or Asian American applicants. For the Classes
of 2014­2018, Harvard sent recruiting letters to potential minority applicants at significantly
lower test score thresholds than these other groups. Consistent with this recruiting tactic,
we find that African Americans were particularly affected, with almost 38% of applicants
having essentially no chance of admission based on their test scores and grades alone. Using
historical admissions data for Harvard, we provide evidence that this was not always the
case, and that beginning in the class 2009, Harvard dramatically expanded its recruitment
of low-scoring African American applicants.
      One rationale for this behavior is that Harvard is interested in boosting diversity among
enrollees, but is unaware of the fact that low-scoring recruited applicants have essentially
no possibility of admission. In fact, the Harvard Dean of Admissions explicitly stated that
Harvard would not "want to send so many recruitment letters out across the board so that
we would ... end up with lots of people who might not be strong enough to get through
the admissions process."54 However, it is difficult to claim ignorance of the low admissions
chances of some recruits since Harvard's internal documents make clear that applicants with
 54

                                               22
low SAT scores are essentially guaranteed rejection.
       If the goal of recruiting African Americans is not simply to increase the diversity of
matriculants, but also to achieve racial balance in the admit pool and/or racial balance
in admit rates, then the policy could be deemed a success. As an example, admit rates
for African American applicants were twice as large as admit rates for Asian American
applicants in 2000, but by 2017 were approximately the same. Why Harvard might care
about the racial distribution of admit rates and applicants is not obvious. What is clear is
that each year there are a significant number of African American high school students who
have a potentially false impression about their chances of being admitted to Harvard.
       An additional cost of recruiting students who have little to no chance of admission is that
it reduces the credibility of information from colleges in a market that is already information-
starved among low-income students. With a great deal of recent research devoted to resolving
information frictions and credit constraints on the supply side of the college market, our
results highlight the critical value of credible information to prospective students.55
       It is difficult to assess whether the patterns in African American recruiting at Harvard are
replicated at other elite colleges and universities.56 The Integrated Postsecondary Education
Data System (IPEDS) provides information on total applications, admissions, and enrollment
for all institutions that participate in federal student aid programs, but does not disaggregate
the data by race or SAT score. A simple change in the data collection practices would
generate a clearer picture of the role race plays in the admissions process at American
colleges and universities, as well as help high school students make more informed decisions
about where to apply to college.

     In an article in The Daily Princetonian, Chen (2017) discusses the disparity in school visits from Ivy
League universities to public high schools in San Bernardino County, CA compared with Harvard-Westlake
School (an elite private high school in Beverly Hills). This dimension of recruiting behavior appears to be
quite similar across the Ivies.

     Notes: This table lists the SAT-equivalent PSAT test score and GPA cutoffs that Harvard used for recruitment of its Class of 2018 (which recruitment took
     place in Fall 2013).
     "Sparse Country" corresponds to the following US states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska,
31




     Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
     We used the Class of 2017 to compute the average SAT score of admits by race, and multiplied by two to get consistent units.

Notes: Growth in year t is equal to the number of applications in year t minus the number of applications
in 2000, all divided by the number of applications in 2000.

"Gratz, Grutter rulings" refers to the timing of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court cases Gratz
v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger, both of which were decided on June 23, 2003. The Class of 2008
application cycle began about five months later.

HFAI stands for Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which was announced after the conclusion of the Class
of 2008 application deadline but before Class of 2008 matriculation decisions were made. HFAI was fully
implemented for the Class of 2009 cycle (The Harvard Gazette, 2005). The HFAI "requires no parental
contribution from families earning $40,000 or less and a greatly reduced contribution from those who earn
from $40,000 to $60,000" (ibid.).

The 0%­10% program was announced just before the application deadline for the Class of 2012 cycle (The
Harvard Gazette, 2007). The program increased financial aid for families with incomes below $180,000.
For families with incomes of between $60,000 and $120,000, families would be required to pay between 0%
and 10% of their income (steadily increasing with income). Families between $120,000 and $180,000 would
be required to pay 10% of their income. The policy also loosened requirements on assets and loans in
determining financial aid eligibility.

Early action was removed prior of the Class of 2012 admissions cycle (Finder and Arenson, 2006), and
reinstated at the end of the Class of 2015 cycle (Lewin, 2011).
