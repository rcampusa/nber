        Despite valid criticisms, many developing countries have issued non-transferable         import

licenses to a limited number of final-good producers so as to restrict imports of an input, such as

capital equipment.   This paper demonstrates that for a given import quota, such licensing restrictions

can actually increase domestic production of both the input and the final product, but at the cost of

reduced quota rents. Under pure competition, domestic welfare falls relative to the use of marketable

quota licenses, but if foreigners would get the quota rents, or if external economies cause decreasing

costs, then bureaucratic allocation can dominate.

                Could Bureaucrats Ever Do Better Than the Market?

1, Introduction

            Bureaucratic       licemtig    schemes have frequently      been used to restrict

imports     of intermediate       goods,   such as capital equipment         and machinery,     in

developing      countries,     most notably India and Brazil, but also in more succ~sful

countries      such as Taiwanl.      These restrictions    have been imposed with the idea

of developing       a dommtic        manufacturing    base in capital     goods with appeal

typically being made to the “infant industry argument                for protection”.   Even if

one accepts the argument           for infant industry protection,      the development       of a

bureaucracy       to diratly     allocate import licenses seem       hard to justify    or even

comprehend        from a standpoint of promoting          economic welfare. Not only is the

policy instrument      far from transparent,      the need to negotiate what often s~m to

be byzantine bureaucratic          rules typically results in significant misallocation       and

higher deadweight       losses. Other more market based policy instruments,             such as

marketable       quota licenses     or a tariff, are both more transparent         and allocate

imports to the high=t          value use. Assuming policy makers have a genuine desire

to promote       development,       is there any offsetting      advantage     that might help

explain this choice of policy instruments?

            This paper examines the implications           of bureaucratic     import licensing

restrictions    by focusing on two commonly           observed    features of such schemes.

First, import licenses are allocated only to established producers              that dirwtly use




    ‘In the 1950’s and 1960’s in Taiwan, firm spmitic approval was required
to import products placed on the “controlled import items” list to encourage
domestic manufacture (See Wade(1990), pp. 122-126).
                                                                                                              2

the imported        input.    The import        licenses    cannot be sold or transfemed                 and,

moreover,         resale     r=trictions       apply   to    the   imported      goods.          This   non-

transferability     has often been supported by the use of foreign exchange controls

that relatively      allocate foreign exchange to individual firms. The swond typical

feature that prova           significant   is the tendency for bureaucrats             to accept only a

proportion     of license applications         (or of foreign exchange applications),              rejating

others, even though the rej mted applications                  are essentially       no different.       This

wuld be viewed as inequitable               for those firms, the non-license           holders,     that fail

to r~eive      any import quota. However,              although domestic welfare is reduced if

domestic     production        costs remain constant,         a licensing     scheme incorporating

both featur=        has some perhaps            surprising     implications      for the size of the

intermediate-good          industry    created by import replacement.                Specifically y, for a

given import quota, such a scheme can boost the domestic outputs of both the

intermediate       and final products        above the levels that would be achievable                   with

marketable      quota licenses or an equally restrictive,              equivalent      tariff.

            To achieve tis          increase     in output requires      that the firm-level            quota

allocated to each license holder be raised above the level of the input the firm

would purchase         if it had to pay the higher domestic                 price.    This reduces        the

marginal     valuation       of a license to a license holder (the value of being able to

import one more unit) below the marginal                     valuation    of a non-license          holder,

given by the excess of the domestic price over the import price of the input.

Thus a “dual-price”            market is created in which license holders                  face a lower

implicit price or marginal cost for own use of the input causing them to use their




    Wnder pure competition,                use of marketable       licenses is equivalent         to a tariff
for the same import level.
                                                                                                           3

quota allocation      so as to produce a higher output than do non-license                      holder<.

By contrast,     iflicenses     were marketable,         orifatariff       were used, this equali-

marginal costs across firms, reducing              the output of license holders to the same

lower level as non-license           holders.     Since aggregate           imports    are unchanged,

domestic production           of the input falls together with final-good             output.

             Since the distortion      caused by the import               quota reduces      final-good

output, raising this output is beneficial.          However,           output is increased by the use

of non-transferable      licenses only by driving a wedge between                     the valuations   of

different groups of users. This amounts to a further distortion,                       which tends to

lower welfare.      Specifically     the reduced marginal value of an import license to

license holders arising from an increase in the firm-level quota, directly lowers

the value of quota rents. Since, for a given aggregate level of imports,                        a higher

firm-level     quota raises the proportion         of non-license        holders with no choice but

to buy       domestic,   it also     raises     domwtic       production       of the input.        As a

consequence,       licensing     schemes      associated     with larger      increases    in domestic

output also cause a greater loss in quota rents. Indeed, output is highest under

a “zero-rent”      licensing     scheme in which license holders               are allocated     a quota

equal to what       they would       import      under     free trade and no quota rents are

generated.

             It is comforting      for the standard prescription             in favor of marketable

licenses     that this loss in rents is sufficiently            large” that, at least in a small




     3A dual-price market could also arise if only exporters can import
intermediate inputs duty free up to some limit and resale is prevented. SW

    “That quota rents are large is supported by a number of studies (see Feenstra
(1992)) showing that the loss of quota rents is a significant part of the cost of
a VER.

country,       perfatly     competitive      setting,    the use of marketable          quota licenses

always      dominates       bureaucratic     allocation       when import     prices    and domestic

production       costs remain      constant.     However,       if foreign    firms would       anyway

extract the quota rents5 as occurs when a VER (voluntary export restraint) is the

alternative,     a “zero-rent”     licensing scheme bwome-s optimal in a broad class of

~.       Viewing this last rtiult          in the light of the thwry of domestic distortion&,

it is not so surprising          that a seemingly         inefficient   regulation     preventing     the

formation of a market in licenses can be beneficial in a third best world in which

there    is both      an import       restriction       and    a domestic     loss     of quota     rent.

Neverthel=s,         since VERS are quite common,                   this result    could have some

empirical      relevance.

            A further and perhaps more significant result arises when the domestic

costs of intermediate-good           production         fall with expansion       of industry     output.

Consideration        of decreasing    costs is natural in this context,           since the existence

of external wonomies           arising from hands on learning by doing is typically part

of the infant industry justification            for protection’.     Given the central result that

non-tradable       quota licens=     can raise domestic output, one might expect that the

=ond       best optimal policy would be to institute a bureaucratic                    scheme at some

sufficiently     large rate of decrease in cost. What is perhaps surprising                 is that this

r=ult holds for any, even a very small, rate of decrwse                      in costs. This suggests



     ~s        is more likely if the foreign suppliers are imperfectly competitive.
Imperfwt       competition in input supply would not fundamentally change the output
rmlts.

that the efficiency argument in favor of marketable                  quota licenses has something

of a knife-edge      character.

             The above discussion         indicates    that in a second best context there are

legitimate efficiency arguments for the use of bureaucratic                      licensing schemes and

it is possible     that policy makers had these ideas in mind when choosing                            the

bureaucratic       route.     However,       these     arguments      abstract      from    other    costs

associated     with bureaucratic        schemes such as rent-sinkings              and the cost of the

bureaucracy      itself. Since, in addition,          inducd      changes in the structure          of the

industry,    such as merger between license holders and non-license holders, could

undo the output gains in the long run, there is no implied policy conclusion                            in

favor of bureaucratic         schemes.

             At a more fundamental           level, the paper contributes            a new theoretical

argument      showing that in a setting where the quantity of an input is restricted,

the use of licensing regulations            to create different prices for different groups of

users can at least partly be understood                 on the basis of output effwts               in the

industry.     For example,        suppose     that a limit is set on the total amount                of a

polluting    chemical,      such as refrigerants        containing     CFC’S, that can be used in

the products       of a particular      industry.     The daire      to limit losses in output and

employment       might then help explain the use of command                       and control methods

with   different     levels    of enforcement           across     firms    as opposed        to issuing

marketable      permits.

             Despite widespread         use, as shown by the surveys of trade practices in

Trela and Whalley (1991) and Erzan et al (1989), non-transferable                          quota licens=

have received        little attention     in the academic          literature.     Trela   and Whalley



    ‘Spencer (1996) extends the model to consider rent-seeking in the context
of “Law of the Similars” type schemes in which imports are permitted only if
they are sufficiently different from locally produced products.

(1991) also estimate the costs imposed by non-transferable                      export quota licenses

in “locking       out” newer lower cost producers.               In Anderson          (1987),   the non-

transferability     of export quotaa between counties reduces world welfare because

it prevents arbitrage      in a situation of demand uncertain y. Finally,                   Krishna and

Tan (1996) consider          the effects of non-transferability             of quota licenses         when

licenses    are    sold by       the government        prior     to the revelation           of demand

uncertainty.      Although non-transferability         can increase the market price, welfare

nevertheless       falls when     equal weights        are given         to consumer        surplus    and

revenue.       Related    work     dealing      with   other     trade     restrictions     applying     to

intermediate      goods includes Grossman (198 1) and Vousden (19 87), who consider

the output        and welfare      effects     of domestic       content     prot=tion       under     pure

competition.

           Section 2 of the paper presents the fundamen~l                     insight as to why non-

transferability     of licenses can raise domwtic            output. The paper then develops a

model to show the implications               of this insight for import licensing restrictions

applied to intermediate          goods. Section 3 provides           an overview           of the model,

Section 4 develops the model and Section 5 explores the central output result.

Swtion     6 then examines        welfare effects, with particular             attention    given to the

roles played by quota rents and by decreasing                  costs in the domestic intermediate

goods industry.       Finally Section 7 contains concluding                remarks.

2. The Fundamental            Idea

           To further      explain why non-transferable              quota licenses         can increase

domestic output, suppose that the intermediate                  good can be imported            at a price

# (F for foreign) or produced            domestically,     but at a strictly higher price rD (D

for domestic).       Only a subset of firms (the license holders)                     receive   the non-

transferable      licenses restricting       imports to the quota Q. As illustrated in Fig. 1,

under a “dual-price”        licensing scheme, the firm-level quota, denoted ~ exceeds
                                                                                                    7

the quantity of the input that the firm would purchase                as a non-license    holder,

reducing    the value, denoted X, of an additional license to a license holder below

the value, y = # - # to a non-license             holder. License holders expand output

(shown at point B) above the output y(f)               of a non-license      holder   (shown at

point A).


                                                   s




                 y(r ~        J         output            y(r ~                  output

                              Fig. 1: Intermediate-Good      Market

            Suppose now that the licenses are made marketable.                If the quota Q is

sufficiently    restrictive   to induce domestic production         of the input, a license will

command        a price ~ = rD - P. Consequently,          the marginal cost P of the input

to (previous)     non-license      holders is unchanged    and hence the output produced

by these firms is also unchanged.            Since X rises to equal -y, this gives rise to a

“unified market” in which license holders also face a marginal opportunity                   cost

(F + X) of production             equal to f’. Thus license holders sell licenses so as to

reduce     output from ~ to y(fl          (see Fig.    1) causing     an unambiguous       fall in

domestic final-good output. Domestic production              of the input also falls since the

purchase of licenses by (previous) non-license            holders reduces their demand for

the dom=tically       produced input, while @revious) license holders continue to use
                                                                                                  8

only importsg.

           The above argument         is very general. It does not depend on particular

demand or market conditions           and as previously       mentioned,    it has implications

for the use of quota-licenses       in other areas, such m pollution control. However,

the need to create and maintain dual prices in equilibrium                 imposes restrictions

on the model. ~us,        further modelling is required both to give an understanding

of these restrictions     and to explore the welfare implications.

3. Model     Overview

           A competitive      industry    consisting     of n firms located in the domestic

country    (the LDC) produc~          a final good Y, both for export             and domestic

consumption.      The industry is small in world markets and thus is unable to affwt

the world price p for good Y or the import price rF of an intermediate                 good X,

such as capital equipment 10. Three inputs are used to produce                   good Y: good

X, labor L and a spwific           factor T, which could represent          the limited pool of

managers     with   the necessary        talent to operate      a firm in the industry       or,

alternatively,    some scarce natural resource            such as land of a particular     type.

Capital equipment        X is producd      domestically     by a competitive     industry using

labor alone at an average cost P and, since P > P, it would all be imported

under free tradeii.      To close the model,           a second (traded)    final good Z, also

produced by a competitive          industry with labor alone, acts w a numeraire.          Since



    ~ am indebted to a refer~            for sugg=ting      Fig. 1 and this was of explaining
the issue.

     lolf p = p(y) where p’ < 0, domestic output Y would still incr~se                    under
“dual-price” schemes, but by a smaller amount. The terms of trade effect from
the fall in p would raise welfare if the good is imported but reduce welfare to
the extent that the good is exported.

     llDomestic     ad    forei~    produc~ units of the input X are homogenmus.
                                                                                                      9

labor has a constant         marginal   product        in producing       Z, the domestic        wage,

denoted by w, remains constant.

             The fact that only a fixed quantity P of the specific factor is available

in the domestic         economy    creat~      diminishing      returns    to labor,     making     the

aggregate      output    of good     Y determinate,          even     given     the   small    country

assumption.      me     analysis is simplified     in the main text by assuming               that each

final-good producer        requires just one (lumpy) unit of the specific factor, which

becomes      sunk at the time of entry the industry.            This fixes the number n = ~

of domestic final-good producers            and also provides a mechanism by which firms

can prove they have a legitimate commitment                  to the industry so as to qualify to

apply for an import license.         Also for simplicity,        production      of Y requires      the

intermediate     good X be UA        in fixed proportion]z,         with the units chosen so that

one unit of X is required for each unit of Y. Hence, assuming that labor exhibits

diminishing     marginrd productivity        when combined with one unit of T and using

subscripts     to repr=ent    partial derivatives,      the production        function is given by

                      Y = min[X,f(L,     1)] where f= > 0 and fw c O.                             (3.1)

             A more realistic and more general, but also more complicated                        model

in which firms can be of different              si~s    determined       by the quantity       of their

investments      in the specific factor, is developed          in the Appendix.        An ability to

handle    different     sizes of firms is obviously          important     when considering        real

world licensing schemes and all the results are shown to carry over. A further

contribution     is to show the critical importance          of the sunk nature of the specific

factor in maintaining        the dual-prices     necessary     for the bureaucratic       scheme to

raise output. As the Appendix           shows, if the specific factor were not sunk, it



    l~f firms wuld substitute away from the input, this would reduce the
magnitude of the increase in output from a dual-price scheme, but not
fundamentally change results.
                                                                                                        10

would be sold by non-license            holders to licence holders to the point that output

is reduced     to the same level as under a marketable                   license scheme.       In effwt,

making       the    spmific   factor     non-lumpy       and     fully    tradeable     has   the    same

implication        for overall     output   as if the import             licenses     themselv=      were

tradeable.    Although the fundamental          effect driving these results is not limited to

the particular model developed here, ttis suggests that any long run chang~                            that

allow license holders         to gain access to the resources                of non-license       holders

would negate the beneficial            output effects.

             The bureaucratic      licensing scheme implementing              the import quota Q for

the intermediate        good involves       a lottery in which only a proportion                  s (s for

success) of the identical final-good producers                 are successful in obtaining import

licensw.      Import    licenses   are allocated     fr=       of charge     to the winners         of the

license lottery. So as to rule out rent-seeking,               s is assumed constant. Thus firms

have no influence on their individual probabilities                of success. Also, resale of the

imported      input (or the license itsel~ is prohibited13. This restriction                   on resale

places a natural limit on the quantity of the input that each license holder would

want to import,         but license holdem         are also limited by a firm-level                 quota,

denoted

                                       ~ = ~(s,~         E Q/ns,                                     (3.2)

where ~,(s,Q) = - ~/s < 0 and ~~(s,Q) = l/ns > 0. Thus a smaller firm-level

quota is associated       with an increase in the proportion               s of license holders or a

tightening     in the overall quota Q.

             If all final-good producers       receive import licenses (i.e. ifs              = 1), then

the marginal value of a quota license is the same across firms, giving rise to the




     13Prohibitive fines could be imposed for non compliance. In the context of
this model, all actions are observable so all violators would be caught.
                                                                                                  11

same     total     levels     of production       as would    be achieved       if licensfi     were

marketable14.       This correspondence           betw~n   the bureaucratic     scheme at s = 1

and a marketable            license scheme,   makes it a convenient         base for comparison.

Also, althoughs        is treated as a continuous variable,       this is not strictly nmessary.

For example,        if there were just 4 equal size final-good          firms, s could take the

values    1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and 1, which is sufficient              variation    to show the r~ults.

However,         if a firm were able to monopolize         the market by cornering        the entire

supply of the s~ific            factor, then with only one license holder, s ordy takes the

value 1 and the model collapses.

            There are thr~ stages of decision for final-good producers.                 In stage 1,

after the government           announces   the license allocation process together with the

valu~     ofs and ~, firms decide whether to enter the domestic final-good industry

taking into account the equilibrium           outcomes of subsequent stages. To enter each

firm must purchase one unit of the spwific factor which is available at a market

clearing price. In stage 2, producers             can choose to apply for import licenses and

license allocation          takes place as announced.      In stage 3, the intermediate       good is

imported      and producd         domestically,     the final good is produced       and revenue-s

are distributed.

4. Finn     Level Decisions

            This section develops the effwts of the bureaucratic               licensing schemes

on the decisions of firms as to entry and output. Consideration                   is first given to

the third stage competitive output equilibrium,              before moving back to the limnse

application       stage and the decision to enter the market.

            The respective        outputs of a final-good       producer     with and without an




    l%e licens= could be allocated to firms and then sold or be initially sold
by the government.
                                                                                                       12

import license are denoted by yi for i = F,D.                     If ~ is sufficiently     large that

license holders use ody imported capital equipment                    (good X), since one unit of

X is n~d         to produce one unit of Y, license holders each import fl units and

non-license     holders      each purchase       yD units of (the identical)      but more costly

domestic equipment.           Also letting C@) = wLi denote the total cost of the labor

V used at the firm level and u, the price paid for the unit of the specific factor

purchased      in stage 1, the profit of a final-good producer              using equipment         only

from source i for i = F,D is then

                                        7ri = (p-+)yi - C(yi) - a.                                  (4.1)

            In stage 3, each non-license             holder    sets yD to maximize         profit    R,

taking p and f’ as given. Assuming p > f,                     the first order condition

                                 aR/ayDs        P - f - c’(Y9 s o,                                  (4.2)

defies    an internal equilibrium           in which yD = y(f)       >0.    Since a2#/(ay~2          = -

C“@)     < 0 because of diminishing             marginal productivity       (fU < O), the second

order condition         is satisfied.    To relate the size of the firm-level      quota ?(s, Q) to

output y(fl,     let s = S denote the value ofs at which

                                            ~(S,Q) = y(f).                                          (4.3)

It follows      that if the firm-level          quota ~(s,Q)      were     at or below      y(f),      or

equivalently     ifs     > S (since y, < 0 from (3.2)),            then after filling their quota,

license holders would raise their output to the same level as non-license                     holders

by purchasing          the domestically     produced     input X at the margin:     i.e.

                                  YF = y(f)      2 ~(s,Q) ifs      > S.                             (4.4)

However,       if the quota allocation were sufficiently             generous   to make ~(s,Q)         >

y(fl,    then taking into account thats           < 1, license holders will purchase imports

alone for s < min[~, 1]. It is possible that R > 1. In this case the firm-level

quota ~(1 ,Q) ats         = 1 strictly exceeds y(fl        so license holders purchase none of

the domestically         produced       input whatever   the value ofs.
                                                                                                 13

          Supposing     that s < min [3,1], in stage 3 each license holder sets its

output yp to maximi~           #     as in (4.1) subjmt          to yF < ~(s, Q). Forming        the

Lagrangim       ~ - TF + A(~(s,Q) - y~, the Lagrange                 multiplier    A is the value of

relaxing ~ through an additional             import license (as introduced         in Section 2) or

equivalently     the marginal quota rent. Output yF then satisfies the Kuhn-Tucker

conditions:

          &/dyF      = p -(~         + ~) - C’(yq       = O                                  (4.5a)

          &/dA       = ~(s,Q) - yF >0            where (d~/dA)X       = O.                   (4.5b)

btting   pF = rF + A, pF repraents               each license holder’s marginal opportunity

cost from the use of the intermediate              input in production.       From (4.5a&b)     and

(4.2), yF can be written as Y = yb~                 where y(.) is the same function deftig

YD = Y(f)-       If ~ > 0, then the firm-level           quo~ is binding so Y@F) = 7(s,Q).
If X = O then PF = rF and the license holder producw                    y(~), its level of output

at free trade.

          An important role is played by the “zero-rent”                 licensing scheme under

which license holders can import as much as they want for own use, generating

no quota rents. Nevertheless,             imports are restricted     bwause       ody a proportion

of final-good     producers,   denoted by s = S, receive import licenses.                At s = S,

the firm-level     quota eqmls        the quantity of the input the firm would import at

fr= trade: i.e.

                                   ;@,Q)      = Y(fi ad     ~ = 0.                             (4.6)

For the subsequent       analysis,        attention is restricted   to the region of interest in

which the firm-level quota is binding (i.e. s 2 Q. In this region, using (4.4) and

(4.6), license-holder     output can be expressed           as
                                   ~(s,Q))     > y(r~      for s c ~,min[~,l]]                 (4.7)
                   Y(P9 = {
                                   y(r~      > Y(s,Q       for s c P,l].
                                                                                              14

Similarly,     the marginal quota rent X can be expressed          as15:
                                              - C’~(s,Q))     for s ~ ~,min~,l]]           (4.8)
             X = A(s,Q) = { f~-_r~,
                                                               for s ~ [S,1].

As can be -n        from (4.8) using (3.2), an increase ins aboves              raises the value

of A: i.e
                                ——
                        N = C“(y)y/s >0           for s G ~, min[s, l]].                   (4.9)

             In demonstrating    that the bureaucratic       scheme can increase       domestic

output, an important       step is to show that firma failing to obtain a license will

nevertheless      always   choose     to produce.       LettiDg   Pn   -    r“ for notational

convenience,      this result follows b=ause         the stage 3 variable profit

                                v@)    = @-p’)y@’) - c(y@)),                              (4.10)

from producing       output ybi) for i = D,F is strictly positive’b. With marginal

cost increasing     once the specific factor has been committed,             even non-license

holders earn rents on infra-marginal            units of output. As illustrated     in Fig. 2, a

non-license     holder would produce output yD at point A, equating price p with

marginal      cost based on the price P for the input so as to earn infra-marginal

rents (variable profit) as shown b y the hatched area. As for license holders,               the

lower price rF paid for imports,          shifts down the marginal cost curve. Under a

~ro-rent      scheme,   license holders are unconstrained         by the firm-level     quota ~

and hence       each produces       its free-trade    level of output      shown    at point B.




     15Since C’@(S, Q)) = p - P from (4.3) and (4.2), we have A@,Q) = f -
# and using (4.4), this implies ~(s,Q) = F - P for s E [~,1]. me other part

However,    a more rtitrictive         firm-level           quota shown at ~ would constrain               the

firm to produce       where price exceeds marginal                    cost, reducing     infra-marginal

rents and making the marginal value A of an import license positive.                             If ~ were

reduced to yD (or below yD), then X would increase to equal y -                               rD - f.

           Turning     to the stage 2 decision                to apply for an import          license,     the

overall profit of a license holder and non-license                       holder    respectively     can be

expressd    as

                 ~F = VtiF) + k(s,Q);(s,Q) - u and #                      = V(fl       - u.             (4.11)

Thus, from (4. 11) the gain G -                   #   - #     from a successful license application

is given by

                     G = G(s,Q)         = V@~ - V(fl                + ~(s,Q);(s,Q)                      (4.12)

where pF = P + X(S,Q). Since A > 0 for pF = f                            and V@~ - V(f)            > 0 for

pF < P,     it follows from (4.12) that G > 0. Taking into account                                that G is

earned with probability            s, each final-good producer            will apply for a license if

and only if its expected profit, denoted E{m}, equals or exceeds its known profit

from just buying domestic equipment:                      i.e. if and only if
                                                                                                    16

                                   E{T} = SG + TD = +.                                         (4.13)

Since the gain G is always positive,         all fial-good        producers    make applications

for import licenses.

             In stage 1, firms competing to enter the industry bid up the price of the

spwific factor to the point that E{T} = O, which from (4.11) and (4.13) impli=

                                       a = V(fl       + sG.                                    (4. 14)

Hence the spwific       factor earns rents UT = nV(P)             + nsG where ‘P = n. Firms

that subsequently      obtain an import license earn positive profits, but non-license

holders   do not fully recover       their sunk investment          in the specific factor: i.e.

using (4.11),      (4.12) and (4.13),

             #    = (1-s)G > Ofors         < land~D        = -sG < Ofors            >0.        (4.15)

5. Irnuort       Licensing Schemes and AQQreQateDommtic OutDut
             As previously   mentioned,     a critical distinction is between         “dual-price”

licensing schemes and licensing schemes in which there is a “unified market” for

the input (marginal costs are equaliti).          Under a dual-price           scheme,      the value

X of an additional license to a license holder is below the value y = f                        - f to

a non-license      holder and there are some non-license           holders (i.e. s < 1). Since

A < rD - rF is equivalent      to PF < P, license holders then face a lower marginal

opportunity      cost for own use of the input and hence produce a higher output than

non-license      holders. Givens    > S, it follows from (4 .7), that dual-price licensing

schemes are represented        by the region

                                        s E ~, min[s,l])

where ~(s, Q) = y~~          > y(fl.      Since X = rD - F for s E [3,1] and there are

no non-license       holders at s = 1, markek         are unified in the remaining           region s

E [min~,l],l].

             Now considetig        total production     levels,     let A(+)    -   ny(d)      (A for

aggregate)       represent aggregate final-good output when all producers                 face a price
                                                                                                         17

+ for use of the input. Thus A(f)            represents         the aggregate    quantity of both the

final and intermediate         goods      that the domestic         country     would produce         at a

prohibitive    quota Q = O and A(fl,         the aggregate quantity of domestic final-good

output and intermediate        imports at free trade. Using Y(s, Q) = Q/ns in (4.6) and

(4. 3) r~ectively,        we obtain

                               s = Q/A(fl          and 3 = Q/A(P).                                    (5. 1)

Since a bindtig        quota impli~     Q < A(r~,         it follows thats       <1.   If Q < A(f),

i.e. if intermediate       imports are restricted         at or below the level that would be

produced      domestically    at Q = O, then 6 < 1 and for s G [S, 1], license holders

purchase      the domestically       produced      input at the margin unifying              the markets

with A = # - rF. However,             it is also possible that A(p)             < Q < A(r~ making

6 > 1. In this case, A(1 ,Q) is strictly below # - ~, so such a quota is not

sufficiently rwtrictive       to induce domestic production            of the input when all firms

rweive     import licenses at s = 1.
                                                                                                                .
             Under      a dual-price       scheme,        ody     non-license      holders      buy     the

domestically     produced     input. Since non-license            holders constitute     1-s of firms,

denoting the total domestic production               of the input by XD, this implies XD(S) =

(1-s)A(f).     Now suppose the market is unified. Ifs                 G ~, 1] which implies Q <

A(f),     then since p F = f’, shifting more firms into the license holder category

by increasing        s above 3 has no effect on production.             Thus XD remains constant

at XD(S) = (1-6) A(f).          If A(fl      c     Q < A(rF) and s = 1, no equipment                       is

producd       domestically.    In summary:


                           (1 - s)A(r 7                    for s f ~)min[~, 1]]
                                                                                                      (5.2)
                X ‘(S) = { (1 - ~)A(r 9                    for s t ~,1]

As for total final-good production,              denotd    by Y = Y(s, Q), this is just the sum

of XD(S) and the quantity of output Q produced using the imported                            input: i.e.
                                                                                                                     18

                                    Y = Y(s,Q)            = x“(s)           + Q                                   (5.3)

            Since from (5.2) and (5. 3), dXD/ds = dY/ds = -A(fl                                        < 0 for s E

            If quota licenses were made marketable,                         this would cause the marginal

at pF = ~           + A(l, Q) < r“ for A(fl                       <        Q <       A(fl,      just   as under     the

would be the same as achieved from market unification                                       under the bureaucratic

scheme. Proposition          1 follows.




    ‘me price of a license is A = rD - F for Q < A(r~                                         and A = X(l,Q)        for
A(r”) < Q < A(fl.
                                                                                                   19

Pro~osition 1: For a given import quota Q on an intermediate product,
(i) a bureaucratic        licensing scheme raises the domestic outputs of both the final

and intermediate produas            relative to the use of marhtable          quota licenses l~and

only 1~a dual-price         marht    is created in which A < y = P-f                 and there are

some non-license holders.

(ii) the domestic         outputs    of both the jinal         and intermediate      produ~s      are

maimized       by a zero-rent         liceming     scheme      and minimized        by the use of

marketable     licenses.

-f         follows from the text. ***

            The idea driving Proposition           l(i) was previously        explained   in Section

2. Recalling that ~ > y(r~)           creates a dual-price market, making quota licenses

marketable     would cause each license holder to sell some of its quota to non-

licensed holders reducing its own output so as to equalize production                     incentivw

across firms. For Q < A(f),             the input is produced domestically           so outputs are

equaliti      at y(fl.      Since previous       non-license     holders     now buy less of the

domestic input, it follows that the domestic output of both the intermediate                      and

final goods must fall. For A(fl              < Q < A(r~,          previous    non-license    holders

switch entirely to using imports and output is equalid                     at y = y@~ where pF

= # + A(l,Q).            Since the quota Q remains constant and the input is produced

domestically     under a dual-price        licensing    scheme,     but not when licenses         are

marketable,     it again follows that marketability         reduces the output of both goods.

As for part (ii) of the Proposition,         since the proportion      of firms rweiving       import

licenses is at the minimum necessary to exhaust the total import quota Q, a zero-

rent licensing scheme maximizes the proportion                 of non-license holders and hence

the aggregate     domestic output of the input. Also, since Q is unaffected                    by the

licensing scheme, domestic production               of the final good is also at a maximum.

            At a deeper level, a dual-price licensing scheme raises domestic output
                                                                                                    20

by increasing        the overall intensity of use of the specific factor. When the firm-

level quota allocation exceeds the quantity of the input the firm would use at the

domestic     price I-O, this induces     the firm to hire more labor so as to use the

spwific     factor more intensively      than it would as a non-license             holder.    At the

extreme, under a zero-rent licensing scheme, firms winning the quota lottery are

allocated a quota that enables them to operate at the same labor to specific factor

ratio as at free trade. In effect, non-marketability               makes the quota allocation

lumpy, which raises output by forcing license holders to increase their intensity

of use of the specific factor so as to use all of the quota allocation.                  By contrast,

if initial quota allocations       can be split up and sold, trading in quota licenses

would      equali~      the intensity   of use of the spwific           factor    across      all final

producers,     but at a lower output level. If Q < A(rO), all final producers                   would

operate     at the low factor intensity         associated     with the domestic         price f’ for

capital quipment,         the same factor intensity used by non-license                 holders under

a dual-price     bureaucratic     scheme.      If A(fl     < Q < A(p),        then since only Q

units of the final good are produced when quota licenses are marketable                         and Q

units are produced         by licenses holders       alone under a dual-price            scheme,    the

specific     factor    is again used less intensively           under   the marketable         license

scheme.

             Consideration      of the effect of varying the size of the quota Q provides

some further insight into the output implications                of the use of non-transferable

license-s. These effects are illustrate          in Fig. 4 for a zero-rent       licensing scheme

withs      = s (shown as solid lines) and a marketable              license scheme with s = 1

(shown as dashed lhes).           Starting at fra        trade (point F), the domestic country

uses the imports         A(fl   of the intermediate        input to produce      A(fl     of the final

product.     With marketable       licenses,    a small reduction       in the quota below frw
trade results in an equal dwrease              in final-good     output (see the line Y(l ,Q)),
                                                                                                        21

whereas      (as shown by the line Y@, Q)), output                        falls by less if s = S. As

previously     explained,    since non-license               holders have no choim but to buy the

domestic     input, even a mildly restrictive                   quota (in the region A(fl         < Q <

A(fl)   creates a domestic industry producing                     capital equipment whens         = S, but

not when quota licenses are marketable.

             A quota set at Q = A(fl                   in Fig. 4 marks the point at which domestic

production      of the intermediate            good commences             under    a marketable     license

scheme. Any further reduction in the quota is matched by an equal increase in

domestic production         of the input, with the result that final-good output remains

constant at A(rO), the output corrtiponding                       to a prohibitive     quota. Essentially,

once the input is produced        domestically               under a unitid       scheme, the size of the

quota has no effect on final-good output since all producers                         use the domestically

produced      input at the margin. By contrast,                  ifs   = S, firms shifted into the non-

licence holder category by a reduction in Q produce 1=s than they did as licence

holders,     causing aggregate output of the final good to continue to fall. Although

more    of the input is produced                       dom~tically,     the increase     is less than the

reduction     in the quota. Finally,               at a prohibitive      quota,    Q = O, the licensing
                                                                                                          22

final products       are equaliti         at A(fl.

6. Welfare        Comparison

           In      developing       the     welfare      effects,    three     different    settings      are

considered.       The first is the case already considered               in which the prices P and

F are constant.         With rF unaffected             by the quota,     all quota rents go to the

domestic country.           In the swond       setting, foreign      suppliers are assumed to raise

#in     r~ponse      to the quota so as to collwt all quota rents. Finally, consideration

is given      to the possibility             that     the domestic     intermediate-good          industry

experienc~        decreasing    costs causing P to fall as output expands.

           Domestic welfare is made up of the utility U(Y’) from consumption                              Y’

of the final good plus consumption                   Z of the numeraire        commodity.     Since both

the price of the final good and the wage are constants,                      consumption    Y’ and labor

income wL, where L represents                   the total labor used in the production                 of the

three    goods,      are not affwted           by the licensing        scheme.      Thus    setting     total

domestic income, given by WL + nE{m} + UT equal to expenditure,                               p~       + Z=,

welfare can be expressed            as

                            w=u(Y=)           +z”=a+nE{7r}+uP,                                          (6.1)

where u - U(Y)              - pY’ + WL is constant. From E{T} = O, ~ = n and (4. 14),

it then follows that

                  W = W(S,Q) = a + up                   = a + nV(P)           + nsG(s,Q),               (6.2)

where, from (4. 12), G(s, Q) = V@~ - V(fl                      + A(s, Q)~. Since standard surplus

analysis is used, quota rents count equally towards domestic welfare regardless

of recipient.      Thus welfare comparisons             are unaffected if the government           collects

the quota       rents   as would          be the case if the government                auctions    off the

marketable        licens=    or if it uses a tariff that is equally restrictive            as the quota.

            Proposition       2 compara         domestic welfare under a marketable                license
                                                                                               23

scheme with welfare under dual-price bureaucratic                  schemes.

Proposition       2: Suppose P and r’ are constant. For a given quota Q, domestic

welfare is mmimized               by we of a marketable     licewe scheme. If the propotiion

of licen.res issued is reduced under a bureaucratic scheme so as to create a dual-

price marht,         this lowers the marginal quota rent A, reducing welfare. We~are

reaches its minimum under a zero-rent                 licensing scheme.

*E        From (4.12),           (3.2) and V’@~ = -~ (see (4.10)),        we obtain dG/ds = -

X~/s. Hence from (6.2),

                     dW(s,Q)/ds       = n[G + sdG/ds]      =    n[V@F) - V(f’)].            (6.3)

Since p’ c rD, (6.3) implies dW/ds                  > 0 for s E h, min~, l]). If S < 1 then,

since p   F =    p

                         (fj.    impliesdw/d5 = O for s G ~, 1]. Hence welfare is at a

maximum         ats = min[~, 1], corresponding          to welfare under a marketable     license

scheme, and decreases ins until it reaches its minimum at S. Since, from (4.9),

~ >0      for s E ~, min~, 1]] and A is constant fors              G [S, 1], the result follows.

           As Proposition           2 shows, the creation of a dual-price market through the

use of non-transferable            licensw always reduces welfare if rD and P are constant.

In this second best context caused by the quota, the beneficial                    output effects

arising from dual-prices             are gained by generating     a second distortion   in which

the marginal evaluation             of a license by license holders is reduced below that of

non-license      holders.        This causes a loss of quota rents, which, with rF constant,

is suffered      by the domestic          country    in the form of a lower return      u to the

specific factor. The increased            output arising from dual-prica      tends to raise the

return u, but domestic welfare falls because the loss of quota rents dominates.

In effwt, the loss in quota rents is (inefficiently)            translated into higher domestic

output, causing domestic welfare to fall.

           But what if the dom=tic              country    would not enjoy the quota rents?
                                                                                                     24

Consider     a setting    in which        a foreign     monopoly      supplies     the input.   If the

monopolist    can price discriminate betwan               countries, profit maximization        would

lwd it to extract all the quota rent by raising its export price, denoted IF, to

wual   pF = # + X. Thus, as first shown by Shibata (1968) and explored                               by

Krishna    (1990),    a government          that attempted      to auction import licenses with

prices determined      endogenously         would fmd that the price of a license is zero and

the auction raises no revenue.            Setting A = O in (4. 12) and (6.2), it follows that

without quota rents, domestic welfare,                 denoted ~(s,Q),         is given by

                                ~(s,Q)       = cr + nV(~)         + nsG                          (6.4)

for G = V(fl         - V(f)     and ~      = pF, where ~          < rD and s < 1 under a dual-

price scheme.

           If markets are unified and quota rents are captured by foreign firms, the

outcome is the same as an equally restrictive                 VER (voluntary        export restraint).

Thus   a VER is the natural              base for comparison           with dual-price       licensing

schemes    in which quota rents are captured                  by foreign firms.       If the input is

produced     domestically      under a VER (i.e. if Q < A(rD)) then pp = # for s 6

~, 1] implies G = O and from (6.4), domestic welfare under a VER is the same

as if the quota were prohibitive:            i.e.

                         ~(s,Q)          = a + nV(~)          for s G ~,1].                       (6.5)

Imports of the input fall as Q is reduced from Q = A(fl                        to Q = O, but welfare

as in (6.5) is unaffected        since it is just as efficient to use domestic equipment.

For a less restrictive        quota, A(f)      < Q c A(fi,         markets are unified ody at s

= 1 and from (6.2) and (6.4), welfare under the VER is given by

             ~(1,~       = a + nV(fl                where ~    = ~ + A(l,Q)         < rD.        (6.6)

           Now comparing          a VER with dual-price licensing schemes, the fact that

any loss of quota rents is a loss to foreigners,               significantly     changes the welfare

ranking from the domestic viewpoint.
                                                                                                             25

Proposition 3: ~foreign suppliers capture all quota rents, use of any dual-price
licewing     scheme increases domestic we~are relative to a WR,

~EFor           Q<       A(fl,       since rW=pF       <rDmakes          G>       Ofors       G

~, S), the result follows comparing                (6.4) with (6.5). For A(f)             < Q < A(r~,

rearranging     (6.4), we obtain ~(s,            Q) = cr + nsV(fl             +

n(l-s)V(fl      for #         = # + X(S,Q). Since X(S,Q) < X(l ,Q) and

(1-s)V(f)      >0      fors    <1,     the result follows comparing           ~(s,Q)      fors      <1     with

W(l,Q)       as iD (6.6). ***

             If quota rents          go to foreigners,        Proposition     3 has shown            that the

favorable       output effects from the use of a dual-price                       licensing       scheme    are

sufficient    to raise domestic          welfare     above the level achievable               with a VER.

However,       if favorable      output effects are causing the result, the question arises

m to why it is not necasarily              optimal to maximize the domestic output of both

the intermediate         and final products          through    the use of a mro-rent               licensing

scheme (with s = ~.

             Further     examination       of this issue reveals         that the optimal           licensing

scheme is influenced by variations                 in the rate of increase of marginal               cost. As

Proposition     4 shows, for the zero-rent            scheme to dominate both other licensing

schemes and a VER, it is sufficient                 that the third derivative        C” ‘(y) of the cost

of labor function be positive or zero. Since C“ (y) > 0 because of diminishing

marginal      productivity,       having    C” ‘(y) > 0 magnifies             the rate of increase            in

marginal      labor     costs    as output       increases.     This    favors      a reduction          in the

proportion      s of license holders          (moving     s towards         ~ bwause      firms that are

shifted from the license holder to the non-license                     holder category produce              less

output. Proposition           4 is neverthel~s       fairly general, since the condition                 C” ‘(y)
                                                                                                26

> 0 holds for a wide class of production              functions’s,

Proposition 4: Suppose foreign suppliers capture all quota rents and C” ‘fi) >
0. For a given quota Q, domestic we~are is maimized                    by the use of a zero-rent

licensing scheme.     Welfare falls in the dual-price              region as the proportion      of

licenses    issued is increaed        reaching    a minimum when the market becomes

unl~ed, the outcome corresponding              to a ~R.

P~fi       Since dG/ds = -~(dP/ds)        it follows from (6.4) that for

s G ~, min[s,l]),

                      dW/ds      =    n[V(fl     - V(r”) - s~(dF/ds)],                      (6.7)

and dW/ds       = O otherwise.       Since V’@~ = - y@F) from (4.10) and (4.5a), this

implies V“ti~      = -y’@~ >0          and hence that V(fl           - V(r”) < V’(fl[#        - r“l

= ~[f’ - r~.     Similarly,
                          using ~ = p - C’(i) it follows from C“ ‘(y) 20 that
                                 ——
r“ - #     = C’@) -C’(y”) < C“(y)[y - y“l. Hence
                                              ——
                         V(fl  - v(f) < jc’’(y)[y - yq.                  (6.8)

Now combining       (6. 8) with (6.7) and using d7/ds              = ~ = C“(~)~/s from (4.9),

we obtain

                 d~/ds        < -n~C’’~)yD       <0    for s G ~, min~,l]].                   (6.9)

Hence welfare is at its maximum            at s and decreases         with s until it reaches its

minimum       at s = min[~, 1], the point corresponding                to a VER at which the

market becomes unified.         ***

            The next task is to consider         the possibility      that the increased   output

induced by the quota actually causes the domestic intermediate-good                  industry to

become more efficient leading to a reduction in the price rD. These gains arising,

for example,     from positive externalities          associated     with greater experience     in



    ‘gSince y = f(L, 1), marginal labor cost is C’(y) = w/f~. Hence C“(y) = -
wfU/(f~3 > 0 and C’ “(y) = w[3(f~2 - f~f~~/(f~s.       Thus C” ‘(y) > 0 if fu
<0 or if fw < 3(f~2/fU
                                                                                                27

production      are assumed       to apply only to the domestic          industry,      the more

efficient foreign industry having already achieved them. Decreasing                    costs could

also arise if domestic producers          experience ~onomies     of scale in an imperfectly

competitive     setting. Writing f        = h(X~ where h’(X~        < 0 to capture this cost

reduction     and using XD = XD(S) from (5.2), this defines f            = h(XD(s)) = P(s)

where

                  df/ds      = -h’(X7A(fl/[1      - (1-s)h’(X~A’(fl]          >0            (6.10)

in the dual-price        region s G ~,min~,     l]). Since increases ins above 3 have no

effect on output, + = P(s) is constant for s E [6,1].

             If the quota is below A(f),       Proposition    5 shows the strong result that

any reduction      in rD, however small, shifi       the optimal licensing scheme into the

dual-price     region.     Since it is assumed that the domestic country would get the

quota rents,      this provides      a case in which      bureaucratic    allocation      of non-

transferable     licens~     actually dominates the use of marketable          quota licensw    or

an equivalent      tariff.

Proposition      5: Suppose the domestic         count~      captures the quota rents (F is

constant) and Q 4 A(P).              If P declines   with industry output, then domestic

welfare      is increased     (relative   to using marketable     licenses)    by reducing     the

proportion      of licenses issued to the point that a dual-price         domestic market is

crealed. We~are is at a muimum              under some dual-price bureaucratic           scheme.

kfi        From (4.12), using (3 .2) and dV(~(s))/ds          = -yD(dP/ds)         from (4.10) and

(4.2), we obtain dG/ds = -A~/s + yD(dP/ds).               Hence from (6.2) using ny(fl           =

A(P(s)),

                dW(s,Q)/ds      = n[V@~ - V(P(S))]        - (1-s)A(F(s))dP/ds.              (6.11)

For Q < A(fl,            setting p F = #(3) in (6. 11) implies dW@, Q)/ds =

-(1-6)A(~(S))dP/ds.          Hence from (6.10),      dW@,Q)/ds      < 0 for s E          b,sl and
dW/ds       = O for s E ~, 1]. Since marketable           licenses correspond        to s = [3,1],
                                                                                                         28

and welfare is increased by rducing                  s below i, the Proposition         follows.     ***

            It should        be remembered        that the above results         concern      a welfare

comparison         of the different        ways      of implementing         a given     quota,      not a

justification     for the imposition of the quota itself. If there were no cost reduction

from expansion         of the intermediate        good industry,     as in the first two settings

considered,       the quota clearly         reduces    domestic    we] fare and if the dom~tic

country does not get quota rents, the negative effect of the quota is even greater.

Although a temporary quota could be justified on the basis of the infant industry

argument        for protection    when there is a cost reducing externality,               the learning

by doing or other process               that underlays     the externality      n~s       to lwd       to a

permanent        reduction    in costs sufficient      to bring domestic costs down to world

levels so the industry can eventually                compete.

7. Concluding         Remarks

            This paper has shown that when an import                    quota is imposed             on an

intermediate       input, such as capital equipment,            then the use of non-transferable

quota licenses can increase             domestic output of both the intermediate                  and fial

products      above the levels          achievable     with either marketable           licensa      or an

equally restrictive       tariff. For this to occur, the bureaucratic             rules must act to

create     a dual-price       market     in which license holders        face a lower             marginal

opportunity       cost for own use of the input than do non-license                      holders.     This

might help explain some of the typical rules associated                       with import licensing

schemes in developing            countries including the allocation of licenses to a limited

subset of final producers              and the prohibition      of resale,    applying     both to the

licenses and to the imported good. Since the import licensing restrictions                          can be

enforced by selectively allocating foreign exchange to particular                      firms, the paper

could also help explain the widespread                 use of exchange controls by developing

muntries.
                                                                                                 29

             The fundamental      idea driving the results is quite robust. The effect of

dual prices in raising the domestic outputs of both goods does not depend on the

nature of demand and, although pure competition                    is assumed so as to illustrate

the output effects in their simpl=t             form,    similar     effects would     apply under

imperfectly      competition     in intermediate        good    supply,    such as Coumot         or

Bertrand competition.        At least in thwry,      the fundamental idea should also extend

to quota licenses limiting imports of a final product.                In this case, if dual prices

could be maintained         behveen   different groups of final-good              consumers ‘9, this

would increase      total domestic production           and consumption          of the final-good.

Moraver,        as shown in the Appendix,             dual-price     licensing     schem~    can be

designed      to handle the differing       import needs of domestic             firms of different

sizes. This involves         the allocation     of firm-level      quotas in proportion       to the

existing size of the firm as measured               by the firm’s investment         in the spwific

factor. It does not matter for the results whether the firms invest in the spwific

factor, anticipating       the imposition     of the quota, or whether the size distribution

of firms is historically        given based on past investments.             The allocation     rule

arising from a zero-rent        licensing scheme is particularly          simple: import quotas

should equal the quantity each firm would import at free trade.

             Considering     the broader implications       of applying import restrictions       to

an intermediate        input    deemed      important     for      development,      the economic

development      literature linking the level of investments           in capital by downstream

industries     to monomic        growth     would     suggest   that any policy        that redums

investment     in capital equipment,        including import restrictions,         can only worsen




     ‘Wowever, it is likely to be substantially more difficult to monitor numerous
final-good consumers to prevent resale (and the break down of the dual-price
market) than it is to monitor final-good producers.
                                                                                                 30

growth performance.            This is particularly   the case if by forgoing imports,          the

developing       country    fails to take advantage    of new technology         and new ideas

being developed abroad. However,            Romer (1992) argues persuasively           that ideas

are central      to economic     development,     but that there are two rather        different

strategies.     The first involves    a policy of openness to trade and foreign direct

investment      so as to obtain the latest goods and technology        developed       abroad as

quickly    as possible.      The second involves judicious       restrictions     on trade and

investment      (Taiwan is the example) so as to encourage        the development        of local

human capital in manufacturing           and the eventual production        of new technology

incorporating      locally produced     ideas. With respect to this latter strategy,           it is

possible      that the extra experience     in manufacturing    gained from a dual-price

scheme could favor use of such a scheme, but the long run practical difficulties

involved in implementing          and maintaining     such a scheme suggest that extreme

caution is warranted.

              Maintenance    of a dual-price licensing scheme requires not only that the

authorities     be successful     in preventing   resale of the licenses      and the imports

themselves,      but also that license holders not be able to access the rwourcw                 of

non-license      holders through long run changes in the structure              of the industry,

such as merger.        As modelled,      this latter problem   is reflected      in the need to

prevent    reallocation     of the specific factor from non-license         holders   to license

holders.      If over time the specific factor were to depreciate           substantially     or if

licence holders were able to merge with non-license              holders,     combining       their

supplies of the specific factor, this would cause the eventual collapse                     of dual

prices. A new lottery for licenses would then be required to again create dual-




    ‘See for example,           Rodrik (1994) and Lee (1994) for development                of this
argument.

prices and the associated higher output. However,              given the political difficulties

likely involved in taking licenses away from established firms, the final outcome

could easily be a break down in the dual-price               market,   yet the maintenance     of

an expensive bureaucracy         which encourages rent-swking          and stifles genuine new

initiatives.

           In summa~,          it is important    to emphasis      that this paper    does not

advocate the use of bureaucratic          import licensing rul=. Rather the idea is to help

explain    why such practices          may have come into effect,          particularly    in an

environment,        as was the case 20 years          ago,    in which    import    substituting

investment        in capital   equipment    was viewed       as a main road        to economic

development        in manufacturing.




                          AuRendix A: Firms of Different Sizes


               This Appendix develops a more general model in which firms can vary

in size because of different levels of investment             Tj for j ~ [1. .n] in the specific

factor. The production         function becomes

                                       Y = min[X,f(L,T)],                                    (Al)

where f(L,TJ) is assumed to be linearly homogeneous. Since most features of the

model are unchanged            from the “main model” in the text, I will mostly just

highlight the new features.

               Letting nQ denote the number of license holders,          each final-good     firm

faces an equal probability           s = nQ/n of receiving      an import license as before.

However,         the firm-specific     quota, denoted ~ is set proportionate         to firm j’s

investment       T in the specific factor. Noting that Q now represents             the planned
                                                                                                    32

or expected level of imports of X and that 6 = Q/s~                     is a constant,   we have

                            ~ = j(s,Q,Tj)      = 6Tj for ~ = Q/sT,                               (M)

where,     as in the main model, ~,(s,Q,Tj)            = -~/s   < 0.

             The actual quantity of imports denoted by Q’ = ~~                      ~ = 6 ~~        Tj

will vary depending           on the actual sizes of the firms picked                in the lottery.

However,       if Tj = ~/n      is constant across firms, then (A2) impliw               ~ = Q/sn

where Q = Q’, as in the “main model” and the quota Q can be implemented

exactly.     Also Q = Q* if all firms get import licenses                  (i.e. if s = 1). In the

general case, planned          Q = E{Q*} = nQ8E{Tj} = sT6 where E{Tj} = ~/n

represents     the average       quantity    of the specific      factor     per firm.    Thus     the

difference     between     Q = E{ Q’} and Q’ tends to zero as the number of fmal-

good      producers      increases.   Consequently,         although    licensing     schemes      are

compared       ex ante based on the expected             level of Q, an ex-post comparison

based on the actual level of Q would typically be very little different.

             The nature     of the lottery      together    with the values         of s and 6 are

announced by the government            prior to the three stages of decision by final-good

producers,     constituting     a sub-game perfect equilibrium.            In stage 1, knowing         s

and 6, each potential         final-good    producer    decides on its level of investment          in

the specific factor, which becomw             sunk at this stage. Any Tj > 0 giva             a firm

the right to apply for an import license in stage 2 and stages 2 and 3 are as

before.

             Using    a superscript    j to index variables        that depend        on ~,     linear

homogeneity      allows the production        function yij = f(Ej,Tj) to be expressed in the

form yij = f(fi, l)Tj where (i - Lij/Tj denotes the labor to specific factor ratio.

Hence,      supposing     that firms purchase       quipment      from only one source,            the

profit of firm j using equipment            from source i for i = F,D can be written as
                                ~ij = [(p-i) f(fi, 1) -    Wfi - u]T,                            (A3)
                                                                                                         33

where f~f < 0 (from linear homogeneity)                implies Tij is strictly concave in Pi. At

the stage 3 competitive         equilibrium,   maximizing          xjD taking the prices p and P

as given, a non-license        holder would increase its labor input to the point that fD

satisfies the first order condition

                           afi/ae”    = [(p - r~f,(&’D,l)         - w]Tj = o,                          (A4)

which defines lD as a function             fD = 1(fl       in equilibrium.        It is important        to

notice that lD is independent          of T. Firm j‘s equilibrium            level of output is then

given by

                                 Y“ = Y(P,Tj)      = f(l(fl,       1)~.                            (A5)

             Next, deftig       S to satisfy ~@, Q,Tj) = y(P,Tj),            it follows, using (A2)

and (A5), that &is independent            of T. Since ~, < 0, it also follows (as in the

main model)         that each license holder j uses only the imported                    input if s <

min[~, 1], but purchases        dom=tic     equipment      at the margin so as to produce               the

same output yF = y(~,Tj)             as it would as a non-license           holder ifs     E (3,1).

             For    s <     min~, 1], each license holder j sets IF to maximize                         the

hgrangim           %j -    TFj + A(~(s,Q,Tj)     - yFj) where the hgrange                multiplier,     A,

represents     the marginal quota rent. Letting pF - rF + A and using (A3) and yFj

= Tjf(tF, 1), IF satisfies the Kuhn-Tucker              conditions:

             dY/dfF       = [(p - p~f, - w]~     = O;                                             (A6a)

             dY/dX = ~(s,Q,Tj)         - yFj = [6 - f(tF,l)]Tj        = O                         (A6b)

where (d~/dA)X            = O. As can be seen from (A6a&b),                 lF can be written w fF

= 1~~ where h and hence PF ~ rF + x is independent                          of ~. Hence, ~alogous

to (A5), each license holder j produces            output
                                 y’j = y~F,Tj)     -    f(lb’),     l)Tj,                          (A7)

where f ‘~F) = (ff)z/wfff            < 0. Now letting s satisfy j(s, Q,Tj) = y(P,Tj),                     it

follows from (A2) and (A7) thats is independent                   of Tj. Assuming that firm-level

quotas are binding, just as in the main model s E ~,min~,                         1]) represents        the

[min[5,     1], 1] represents     the region of market unification.

             To extend the central output result (Proposition               1) to this more general

model, let A(?) -           ~=1      y(r’,Tj) represent   aggregate    domestic output when all
fial-good         firms pay F for the input (as before). Since A(ri) = f(t(?), 1)~ from

(A5) and (A7), A(F) is independent               of the distribution    of the specific factor T

across      firms.    Hence,     following    the same reasoning       as in the text, the total

(expected”)          domestic production      X“ of the intermediate         good is given by X“

= X“(s) as in (5.2). Since, the total (expwted)              domestic output of the final-good

is given by Y(s, Q) = X“(s) + Q as before and dXD/ds = -A(f)                          < 0 for s G

E, fi[S,      1]), Proposition      1 follows.

rquires       expressions       for profit.   Letting p“ = rD, the stage 3 variable             profit

earned by firm j evaluated at pi is given by

Since s > S, using (A3), (A8) and PF = F + A, firm j earns profit

              ~j = V@F,Tj) + A7 - uTj for ~ = dTj and

              P      = V(r”,T)     - aTj.                                                        (A9)

Hence since X >0            if pF = P and VtiF;T)         - V(r”;Tj)   >0     ifpF < r“, the gain,

Since firm j gains @ > 0 with probability                  s > 0, its expected profit, denoted

Hence, having sunk Tj in stage 1, all final-good firms choose to apply for import

licenses in stage 2.

            Turning to the stage 1 choice of Tj, we first define M’ = - (dL i/dTj) 1,,

> 0 to represent      the MRS (marginal rate of substitution)            between labor and the

specific factor for firm j at output yfi for i = D,F. It then follows from linear

homogeneity       of the production     function that

                  M’ =    (dyij/~Tj)/(dyij/~~j)     = [f(~@i), 1) - t@i)fl]/f,.            (A12)

Hence,     using (AS), (A12) and p - pi = w/f,(t@i), 1) from (A4) and (A6a),

variable profit becomes

               V@i,T)     = (w/f~[f(&’Qi),l)       - l@i)fl]Tj      = wMiTj > 0,           (A13)

and, from (Al 1), using (A9), (A1O) and (A13), firm j‘s expwted                     profit can be

expressed    as

                              E(mj} = S@ + (wM(fl               - u)Tj                     (A14)

where Gj = [W(MF - MD) + X8]Tj > 0.

            In stage 1, maximizing        E{rj} taking s, ~ and the price u as given, Tj

satisfiw

                       dE{rj}/dTj     = s(dGj/dTj)        + WMD - u = O,                   (A15)

where, from (A14), dGj/dTj = @/Tj = W(MF - MD) + X6 > 0 is independent

of Tj. Hence it follows that d2E{r}/(dTj)2               = O making the actual level of Tj and

the equilibrium      number of firms n indeterminate.           At free trade, setting PF = rF,

X = O and s = 1 in (A15) implies that MF = cr/w, which is just the familiar

result that the MRS equals the factor price ratio. However                   a binding    import

quota causing 1 > 0 distorts this efficiency condition.

            Using (A13) and dd/d~          = Gj/Tj in (A15), each firmj            pays UT = sd

+ V(P;Tj)         for the spwific     factor,   reducing      E{mj} to ~ro    (-      (A14)) and
                                                                                               36

generating     rents for the specific factor equal to UT = ~-,                 [s@ + v(r”;Tj)].

The equilibrium         profits of firm j are as in (4. 15): i.e. from (A9) and (A1O), ~j

= (l-s)@       >0       for s < 1 and Tq = -s@ <0            for s >0.       Thus it is not hard

to S= that adjusting          for the indexing     of variables    by ~,      all the subsequent

welfare results also hold for this expanded model.

2. Importance           of the Sunk Nature      of the Specific Factor

           To see the role played by the assumption            that T is sunk prior to license

allocation,    suppose      that licenses    are instead allocated       in stage 1 prior to the

choice of T in stage 2 and stage 3 is unchanged.             Since no commitment         has been

made to production,          all license applicants     are identical.     Thus in stage 1, the

government      could allocate ~ = Q/ns to a proportion            s of the n applicants     as in

(3. 1) of the main model.

           Indexing T by i for i = D,F, and using (A13), stage 3 profits are:

                    #    = [wMF - u]~        + X; and ~      = [wMD - u]~,                 (A16)

where ~       = n(sTF + (1 -s)T”). Since at stage 2, firms know whether or not they

hold an import license, TF >0               and T“ >0     respmtively      satis~:   from (A16),

           dfl/dTF       = WMF - u = O and

           d~/dTD         = WMD - u <0         (= O ifTD > 0),                             (A17)

From (A17), non-license           holders set T“ > 0 if and only if MD = MF, which

implies (see (A12)) that markets are unified with PF = r“. Since pF < r“ for all

s when A(fl         < Q < A(fl,       u is then too high for non-license         holders to enter

and T“ = O. License holders, using imports alone, then produce the same output

as ifs   = 1. If pF = r“ when Q < A(r”), then non-license                  holders enter setting

TD > 0 so as to achieve the same labor to specific factor ratio as license holders

(i.e t~q      = f(r”) from (A12)), but they earn zero profit (see (A16)). In both

cases, total output is the same as if licenses were marketable.                 Hence trading in

the specific factor prior to the allocation of quota licenses gives rise to the same

outcome as if the licenses themselves were tradeable.
