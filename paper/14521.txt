    In this paper we argue that the persistent global imbalances, the subprime crisis, and the
volatile oil and asset prices that followed it, are tightly interconnected. They all stem from
a global environment where sound and liquid financial assets are in scarce supply.

    Our story goes as follows: Global asset scarcity led to large capital flows toward the
U.S. and to the creation of asset bubbles that eventually crashed. The crash in the real
estate market was particularly complex from the point of view of asset shortages since it
compromised the whole financial sector, and by so doing, closed many of the alternative
saving vehicles. Thus, in its first phase, the crisis exacerbated the shortage of assets in the
world economy, which triggered a partial recreation of the bubble in commodities and oil
markets in particular. The latter led to an increase in petrodollars seeking financial assets
in the U.S. Thus, rather than the typical destabilizing role played by capital outflows during
financial crises, petrodollar flows became a source of stability for the U.S. The second phase
of the crisis is more conventional and began to emerge toward the end of the summer of
2008. It became apparent then that the financial crisis would permeate the real economy
and sharply slow down global growth. This slowdown worked to reverse the tight commodity
market conditions required for a bubble to develop, ultimately destroying the commodity
bubble.
      Let us now develop some of these steps, starting from the underlying structural force

fueling U.S. asset appreciation. Figure 1 displays the main patterns of global imbalances since
1990. In particular, it shows the current account of the U.S., Europe & Japan, emerging Asia,
and oil producing economies, relative to world GDP.1 The facts are well-known: Starting in
1991, the U.S. current account deficit worsened continuously, reaching 6.4 percent of U.S.
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005, then stabilizing back to 5 percent of GDP by early 2008.
The counterpart of the U.S. deficits, initially due to Japan and Europe, were bolstered by
emerging Asia and commodity producing countries after 1997.

   In Caballero, Farhi and Gourinchas (2008) we showed how this build-up in “global im-
balances” could be understood as the consequence of asymmetries in financial development
and growth prospects across different regions of the world. In particular, we argued that

of China and other East Asian economies, and the associated rise in commodity prices in

recent years, reoriented capital flows from emerging markets toward the U.S.. In effect, EMs
and commodity producers in need of sound and liquid financial instruments to store their
newfound wealth, turned to the U.S. financial markets, perceived as uniquely positioned to
provide these financial assets.2
   As we explained then, a by-product of this reallocation of capital flows was a necessary
decline in U.S. and world real interest rates and a boom in U.S. asset markets. Ex-ante real
interest rates on 10-year U.S. government bonds fell below 2% in 2002 (figure 2) while the rate
on a 30-year fixed rate conventional mortgage reached 5.23 percent in June 2003 (figure 3),
with a 2.9 percent annual inflation. As foretold by then Governor Bernanke in his influential
‘Savings Glut’ speech (Bernanke (2005)), it is now apparent that this boom was located in
no small part in a rise in U.S. housing markets and the related markets for structured credit
instruments (figures 4 and 5). In the context of low real interest rates, U.S. households
were encouraged to take on more housing risk than they could bear, risks that magically
   2
     In recent years, a significant portion of the capital flows from EM countries to the U.S. took the form of
official reserve accumulation. The composition of capital flows is not the focus of our analysis. Nonetheless,
we observe that, especially in the case of China, most of these reserves are indirectly held by local investors
through low-return sterilization bonds.

disappeared from the mortgage-backed securities and other structured investment vehicles
whose supply exploded over the same period (figure 5). The catastrophic and systemic
failures of this originate-to-distribute model are now well-documented.3
      By sometime in 2006, the appreciation in U.S. real estate prices came to a halt and the
U.S. current account deficit began to turn around (see figures 1 and 4). Starting in earnest
in June 2007, with the bailout of two Bear Stearns’ funds that could not meet their margin
calls, the world economy entered, with a certain fracas, into a period of significant global
adjustment. Within weeks, funding dried up for entire segments of the U.S. and international
banking sector, especially asset-backed commercial paper (see figure 5), leading to major
convulsions of credit and money markets, including the dramatic collapse and rescue of
several U.S. and European commercial and investment banking institutions. More than 12
months after the onset of the crisis, financial markets appear nowhere near stabilized. In
fact, by the beginning of the summer of 2008, financial distress in major players began to
accelerate, a process that started with the government rescue of the Government Sponsored
Enterprises (GSE) Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac in July and culminated with the failure of

Lehman Brothers on September 15. This was a watershed moment. Until then, the crisis had
been severe, but largely contained within the financial sector of the economy. Following the
collapse of the GSEs and of the entire U.S. broker-dealer industry, the seizing of wholesale
money markets reached unprecedented proportions. Figure 6 decomposes the spread between
3-months LIBOR and 3-months Treasury yields (the TED spread) into a LIBOR-Overnight
Index Swap (OIS) spread (top part) that measures interbank credit risk, and a Treasury-OIS
spread (bottom part) that captures flight to liquidity. In the weeks following the collapse of
Lehman Brothers, both components of the spread increased dramatically, with the Treasury-
OIS spread reaching 165bp on September 17 and the LIBOR-OIS spread reaching 365bp on
October 10. With credit markets on life support the crisis quickly spread to the rest of the
economy.

    Most likely, the strong U.S. capital inflows of the last few years contributed to the sig-
nificant weakening of U.S. credit markets. The eventual recognition of their degraded per-
formance was one of the triggers of the current crisis. However, this weakening is in itself
part of the endogenous response of U.S. financial markets to world financial conditions. In
effect, U.S. assets became stretched by trying to accommodate the world’s excess demand


                                               6
for assets. Therein lies the structural problem. This chronic excess demand for assets de-
rives from financial underdevelopment in emerging markets and most commodity producing
economies, rather than from macroeconomic imbalances. Excess asset demand leaves an
unmistakable signature in low real interest rates, which in turn provide a fertile ground for
bubbles to emerge. Thus an alternative –perhaps metaphoric– interpretation of the sequence
of events is that the bubble located in emerging markets during the 1990s migrated toward
the U.S. housing and credit markets (and the NASDAQ before that) following the EM crisis
and the coming on-line of capitalist China.4

       With the U.S. financial crisis, that bubble collapsed as well. Initially, the excess as-
set demand that produced it did not. Emerging Markets and commodity producers were,
more than ever, in search of investment opportunities. Witness the long list of sovereign
wealth funds and the financial means at their disposal. According to Deutsche Bank (2007),
Sovereign Wealth Funds managed $3 trillion USD as of September 2007, and were expected
to manage an additional $7 trillion within the next ten years.5 Another bubble was likely
to appear as the endogenous response of a world economy that tried to increase the global
supply of financial assets. We argue that it did so quickly, in the form of a commodity
bubble. Figure 7 reports the real price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) in 2008
U.S. dollars. Between June 2007 and June 2008, real crude prices increased by almost 100
percent. During the summer of 2008, however, as the financial crisis spread and economic
growth started to decline, commodity prices suffered a dramatic collapse. Between July 2008
and October 2008, real crude prices declined by almost 53 percent, bringing them back to
their level of June 2007.6
   Essentially, in the first phase of the crisis the combination of a tight commodity market
and the decline in equilibrium real interest rates made it privately worthwhile to transform
commodities into an asset (or even a new bubble). The mechanism is related (but not
identical) to that in Hotelling (1931): Sufficiently low real interest rates make inventory

based on financial underdevelopment.

     These figures are being revised downward as a result of the brutal slowdown in world economic growth.

     This price pattern is quite general. It is apparent for energy commodities (coal, gasoline, heating oil), or
biofuels such as corn. It is also present for most metals (aluminum, lead, copper, gold and silver) with the
exception of zinc and nickel whose price peaked earlier in 2007. We find it also for most food prices (wheat,
soybean, coffee, tea, cocoa, barley, rice, palm oil, groundnuts and rapeseed oil), less so for (sugar, cattle and
hog). Our model provides a broad brush to understand the general evolution of commodity prices. Yet,
individual commodities might also be affected by other factors – supply disruptions, weather, commodity-
specific demand shocks. We also note that high energy prices generally push up food prices through higher
production costs, and stronger competition for acreage from biofuels

accumulation profitable and drive up the price of exhaustible resources. However, in the
second phase the market-tightness precondition disappeared, which in turn destroyed the
asset-accumulation incentive behind the feverish rise in commodity prices, triggering the
collapse in these prices.
   Figure 8 presents a scatter plot of crude oil prices against the S&P500 index from 2004
to 2008. The graph clearly illustrates the different phases of the crisis. Prior to June 2007,
the correlation between oil and U.S. stock prices was positive. During the first phase of the
crisis, from July 2007 to June 2008, the correlation is strong and negative. Finally, since July
2008, the correlation again becomes strong and positive. The negative correlation during
the first phase of the crisis is especially interesting from our point of view. Purely demand
driven explanations of the surge in commodity prices would predict a positive correlation
between assets and commodity prices. Later in this paper we provide instrumental variables
evidence to support the claim that the negative correlation in this phase is not due to oil
shocks but due to the financial mechanism we describe.


   Let us now return to the implication of these developments for the global imbalances.

the subprime crisis should lower equilibrium interest rates and trigger a rebalancing away
from now ‘toxic’ U.S. assets.7 The resulting decline in U.S. wealth reduces domestic con-
sumption,and improves the trade balance and the current account. This is in line with what
we observed since June 2007: U.S. long real rates fell from 2.3 percent to 1.4 percent by
June 2008 (Figure 2). The current account (trade) deficit improved from 5.6 (5.2) percent
of GDP in June 2007 to 5.0 (5.0) percent in June 2008.
       While qualitatively correct, the initial response of the trade balance and the current
account was muted relative to what our basic view implies. That is, if the relative financial
appeal of the U.S. is what is behind the initial imbalances, why didn’t the subprime crisis
did not lead to a sharper turn around in the U.S. current account? Again, we argue that the
answer lies in the endogenous response of commodity prices. Because commodity inventories
were initially very low, a by-product of the strong demand arising from the robust growth
of emerging economies, the net asset creation from the commodity mechanism is initially
small. In contrast, the strong impact of the price rise on the income of commodity-producing
economies leads to a sharp rise in their demand for store of values, which further depresses

    The model predicts a simultaneous move towards ‘safe’ US assets. This flight-to-quality is an important
feature of our analysis.



                                                                               9
real interest rates and stabilizes capital outflows to the U.S. in the short run.8
    In the second phase of the crisis, external imbalances may or may not increase. Two
offsetting forces are at play. On the one hand, the decline in economic growth reduces
asset supply. This tends to depress interest rates and increase capital outflows to the US.
Simultaneously, the collapse in commodity prices makes commodity producers poorer, hence
reducing asset demand. For low levels of inventories, this second effect may dominate so
that interest rates rise and external imbalances are reduced.

       The rest of the paper provides a model and a quantitative assessment of the story and
mechanisms we just described. The model is based on Caballero et al. (2008) with com-
modities. It has two regions, U and M. We interpret U as the U.S. and M as the rest, with
an emphasis on emerging market economies and commodity producers. The model features
two goods: A non-storable good, X, produced by both countries and a storable commodity,
Z, that is only produced by M. The supply of X grows exogenously while the supply of Z
is constant. This is meant to capture the growing demand pressures on commodities that
arise from robust world economic growth. We set-up the model so that a bubble develops
initially in U. As discussed above, we interpret this bubble metaphorically as the extent to
which asset markets in U are stretched to provide financial assets to the rest of the world.
With the bubble, the U.S. runs a larger current account deficit (the external imbalances)
and world interest rates are low.

       The original event in our model is the U.S. financial crisis: The bubble bursts at t = 0,
leaving savers scrambling for alternative stores of values. The resulting decline in real interest
rates has two effects. First, it increases the value of ‘good’ U assets. This translates into a
flight-to-quality, from the bubble to the ‘good’ U asset. Second, and more importantly, it
triggers the commodity markets into action. As speculative hoarding takes place, the price of
commodities jumps. Per se, this increase in commodity prices results in a significant wealth
transfer from U to M. But M needs good stores of value. Thus a significant portion of that
newfound wealth finds its way back into U. The resulting capital inflows further boost the
value of the domestic asset and cushion the impact of the bubble’s burst. Eventually, and
gradually, the increase in asset supply due to commodity inventories pushes up interest rates,
which forces rebalancing in U. To capture the second phase of the crisis, we assume that
   8
    The reader may wonder why the rise in the price of oil is not simply a transfer of income from oil
consumers to producers and hence has no impact on asset demand. The answer is in our choice of nu-
meraire, which is the non-commodity good. This will be clearer once we describe the model but, as with all
normalizations, it has no substantive implications.

                                                   10
somewhere along this process, the financial crisis compromises global growth. The decline
in global growth removes the asset market excess demand, which leads to a decumulation of
inventories and a rapid collapse in commodity prices, alongside with asset prices.
   Before turning to the details, it is worth clarifying two modeling subtleties that are
important in interpreting our formal discussion. First, while the commodity side of our
model shares some of Hotelling (1931)’s seminal insights, ours does not rely on Hotelling’s
key stock constraint (exhaustible resource). Instead, in our context there is a flow-extraction
constraint which is insufficient to meet demand growth. This mismatch is the main factor
behind the structural trend in commodity prices. In this context, the subprime collapse
superimposes on the previous trend a speculative reason (in the precise sense of a rational
bubble) for price increases; and the collapse in global growth in the second phase of the crisis
damages the structural reason (the trend) supporting the bubble. Second, this speculative
factor raises the effective opportunity cost of resource extraction for producers since there is
now an asset-opportunity-cost, as in Hotelling’s model, which reduces extraction incentives
for commodity producers. The latter response means that, in equilibrium, there need not
be any rise in measured inventories, and hence our allusion to inventories throughout this
paper includes previously unextracted commodities.


    Section 1 describes the basic mechanism connecting the financial crisis to commodity
prices. Section 2 focuses on long-run global imbalances, while section 3 discusses short-
run imbalances and presents some back-of-the-envelope estimates of the effects we describe.
Section 4 calibrates the model and explores its dynamic implications. Section 5 presents
evidence supporting the speculative nature of the rise in oil prices following the subprime
crisis, and of the recent drop in these prices. Section 6 concludes. Most formal derivations
as well as explorations of some extensions of the model (such as the role of future markets
and inventory trends) are relegated to appendices.



1     Global Capital and Commodity Markets

1.1    The model for the world economy

Time evolves continuously. Infinitesimal agents (traders) are born at a rate θ per unit of time
and die at the same rate; population mass is constant and equal to one. Agents receive some
endowment at birth, which, for simplicity, they save in its entirety until they die. Denote by

                                              11
Wt the savings accumulated by households at date t. In every period, aggregate consumption
Ct is then a constant fraction θ of these accumulated savings:9

                                                 Ct = θWt .                                                (1)


    Households consume a basket of two goods: an X-good (the numeraire) and a Z-good.
Intratemporal preferences over these two goods are of the constant-elasticity-of-substitution
(CES) type:
                                     h            1
                                                            iσ/(σ−1)
                                       (σ−1)/σ      (σ−1)/σ
                                 Ct = CX,t     + α CZ,t
                                                  σ                  .                                     (2)

σ > 0 is the elasticity of substitution while α > 0 controls the equilibrium share of expendi-
tures on the Z-good.
       Given a relative price pt of the Z-good, households split their consumption between both
goods as follows:
                                          θWt                αp−σ
                                                                t θWt
                              CX,t =         1−σ and C Z,t =           .                                   (3)
                                       1 + αpt               1 + αp1−σ
                                                                   t

    The X-good is a conventional non-storable good, while the Z-good is a storable commod-
ity. Denote by It ≥ 0 the outstanding inventories of the Z-good. Storing the commodity
imposes an iceberg storage cost d ≥ 0 per unit of time and good stored. Denote rt the
instantaneous interest rate (in terms of the X-good). By arbitrage, pt must satisfy:

                                                ṗt
                                                    ≤ rt + d,                                              (4)
                                                pt

with equality if It > 0 or I˙t > 0. This arbitrage equation is central to the analysis of storable
commodities, such as Hotelling (1931). It states that the capital gains on commodities
cannot exceed the interest rate, net of any convenience yield or carrying cost.
       The endowment of the X-good, denoted Xt , grows at rate g > 0 over time. By contrast,
we assume that the endowment of the Z-good is constant through time: Zt = Z, which allows
us to capture the idea that demand pressures on commodities are growing over time.10
   9
      As Caballero et al. (2008) show, this can be interpreted equivalently as log-preferences over consumption
streams.
   10
      Note that our model differs from Hotelling (1931)’s in that we replace his stock constraint with a
flow constraint on commodity production. This has important implications later on since it allows us to
separate more cleanly the asset-aspect of commodities from their goods-aspect. Moreover, in our framework,
macroeconomic conditions determine whether one aspect or the other dominates in price-determination. See
Jovanovic (2007) for a Hotelling based model of bubbles in exhaustible resources.



                                                      12
   The Z-good is assumed to be noncapitalizable unless it is transformed into inventories
(below or above the ground). In contrast, a fraction δ of the X-good is capitalizable. We
capture this feature as follows. At every point in time, there is a number Xt of identical
trees with an aggregate market value of Vt . Each tree yields 1 unit of X-good, a fraction
δ of which is distributed to its current owners. Since the number of trees grows at rate g,
the total value of new trees is gVt per unit of time. The fraction of the output that is not
capitalized is distributed to newborns, as are the new trees. Hence, the total endowment
received by newborns per unit of time is composed of (1 − δ)Xt units of the X-good, Z units
of the Z-good and gXt new trees. The value of this endowment is (1 − δ)Xt + pt Z + gVt.
   The return on existing trees is the dividend price ratio δXt /Vt plus the capital gain
V̇t /Vt − g which, in equilibrium, must be equal to the instantaneous interest rate in the
economy, rt :
                                   rt Vt = δXt + V̇t − gVt.                            (5)

   In addition to the tree asset, some of our equilibria will exhibit rational bubbles, Bt ,
which must satisfy the arbitrage condition:

                                      Ḃt = (rt + λ)Bt ,                                  (6)

where λ > 0 is the hazard that the bubble bursts in the next instant. For simplicity
we analyze the limit case as λ goes to zero and d > λ. These assumptions allow us to
approximate the solution with the perfect foresight case and to reduce the number of subcases
we need to discuss.
   Savings decrease with withdrawals (deaths), and increase with the endowment allocated
to new generations and the return on accumulated savings:

                       Ẇt = −θWt + (1 − δ)Xt + pt Z + gVt + rt Wt .                      (7)


   In equilibrium, savings must be equal to the value of all the assets in the economy:

                                    Wt = Vt + pt It + Bt .                                (8)




                                             13
      Using (3) and imposing market clearing in the X-good market, we obtain:

                               θWt              αp−σ
                                                   t θWt

   In equilibrium, replacing (9)
                               D backE into (7), yields the equilibrium interest rate (for the
case with inventories, i.e. max It , I˙t > 0):

where ǫd is an expression that plays no role in our main discussion.11
      The interest rises as θ rises because a higher θ increases consumption and reduces asset
demand. The two terms in parentheses in the numerator are central to our discussion below.
The first of these terms represents asset supply: the interest rate rises with δ and with
Bt + pt It because they increase asset supply. The second term represents the “petrodollar”
effect and is present when inventories are being accumulated: When the price of commodities
rises, the income of oil producers rises more than the effective income of oil-consumers falls.
This net income effect lowers interest rates because it raises asset demand.
   Later on we will see that for plausible parameter values, the asset demand effect dominates
the asset supply effect in the short run, and so that an increase in the price of oil puts
downward pressure on real interest rates. Since commodity prices also rise when interest
rates fall (see (4)), the interaction between commodity prices and real interet rates gives rise
to potentially large feedbacks.


1.2       The σ = 1 case

Although in practice the short run elasticity of demand for the Z-good is significantly smaller
than one, it is useful to start with the case σ = 1 since it allows us to characterize explicitly
the main mechanisms at work. We simplify things further by studying the case where d
converges to zero (while preserving the assumption d > λ).
      Assume momentarily that the equilibrium has neither inventories nor bubbles. Replacing
(9) back into (7) yields a reference interest rate, r ref = θδ/(1 + α). Henceforth we shall

assume that financial assets are sufficiently scarce (δ low) for the economy to be dynamically
inefficient (r ref < g):


Assumption 1 Dynamically Inefficient Economy: δ < g(1 + α)/θ


Bubbleless equilibrium. Suppose for now that there are no bubbles, then the equilibrium
must have inventories. To see this, note that if there are no inventories r = r ref < g. But
in this case equation (9) requires pt = αXt /Z, so the price of commodities grows at a rate g
which exceeds the equilibrium interest rate. Thus, there is a clear incentive to accumulate
inventories, which is a contradiction of the no-inventories premise.
   From (4) and (9), the dynamics of the economy can be summarized in a simple sytem
with variables It and qt ≡ pt /Xt :
                                            (

Asymptotically, the level of inventories stabilizes at a strictly positive level which is propor-
tional to the degree of dynamic inefficiency in the economy:

The price pt of the Z-good grows at rate g and the interest rates rt converges to the growth
rate g of the X-good.

   Figure 9 reports the phase diagram associated with (11). The dynamic system exhibits

consequence of assumption 1. The case where g > θ (δ + α) / (1 + α) is similar and features also a downward
sloping saddle-path, but the q̇ = 0 schedule is downward sloping.

it is downward sloping, consider an initial inventory position I0 < I¯ and suppose that the
price is such that the commodity market is initially in equilibrium at that inventory level
(I˙0 = 0,or q0 = q̄). This is point B1 on figure 9. It is immediate that the interest rate r0
that clears the asset markets at point B1 must be below the growth rate g. The economic
intuition is that at q = q̄, too few assets are created through inventories (whose value is
q̄I0 ). Equilibrium on global asset markets then requires a low interest rate. But when
r0 < g, the (normalized) price of commodities declines over time, which increases demand
for commodities and reduces inventories (I˙0 < 0). Instead, the equilibrium requires that the
price of commodities is initially sufficiently high to depress the demand for commodities, and
allow inventory accumulation (I˙0 > 0). Equivalently, the price of commodities needs to rise
sufficiently to depress equilibrium interest rates and make inventory accumulation profitable.
This is represented by point A in the figure. This high initial price depresses interest rates
below r0 . Over time, since rt < g, (normalized) commodity prices decrease, which increases
demand for commodities and slows down inventory accumulation. The steady state is reached
at point C.


   The price of commodities performs a dual role in the model with inventories: it influences
the demand for the Z-good on the spot market; and it influences the global supply of assets
in the economy (Vt + pt It ) . As in traditional models of portfolio balance, it is the tension



                                              16
between these two functions that generates interesting dynamics.13


Bubbles. Now let us turn to the opposite extreme, where bubbles exist and do not vanish
asymptotically relative the size of the economy. In the limit, since we assumed d > λ, there
are no inventories. Without inventories, the Z-good is for consumption only, and its price
grows at rate g. The interest rate rt converges to g and the bubble converges to:

                                             1+α          
                                   Bt ∼          g − r ref Xt .                                  (14)
                                       t→∞    θg

    The size of the asymptotic bubble in (14) is the same as the size of the asymptotic
equilibrium inventories pI in the bubbleless equilibrium (13). In both cases, the endogenous
increase in asset supply is just sufficient to increase the equilibrium interest rate to g.


The No-Inventory Economy (a benchmark). In our model, the price of the Z-good
is both a relative price, and, when inventories are non-zero, an asset price. In order to
illustrate the importance of this dual role, we provide a benchmark-economy where the
inventory-channel is turned off. That is, we assume that storage costs are prohibitive (i.e.,
d is very large) so the Z-good cannot be stored.
    This benchmark economy has two long run steady-states: a bubbly one and a bubble-
less one. The bubbly steady-state is exactly as above with the same equilibrium prices and
quantities. However, the bubbleless equilibrium is different since inventories cannot be ac-
cumulated. In the bubbleless equilibrium, market clearing for the Z-good implies that pt
grows at rate g. Equilibrium in asset markets implies that the interest rate rt is equal to
r ref < g.
    Note that Assumption 1 implies that the interest rate r ref in the bubbleless equilibrium
of the no-inventory economy is smaller than the interest rate g of the bubbleless equilibrium
of the economy with inventories. The reason for this difference is that total asset supply is
smaller in the economy without inventories. Note also that pt is the same in the bubbly equi-
librium and in the bubbleless equilibrium without inventories. That is, the price is entirely
determined by the relative endowments of the X-good and the Z-good and is completely
decoupled from the asset market.

1.3       The Financial Crash and Commodity Boom (Phase I)

Suppose now that a ‘subprime’ shock takes place. This can be interpreted as the realization
that financial instruments are less sound than they were once perceived to be. It could result
from, inter alia, the realization that corporate governance is less benign than once thought
(excessive risk-taking and poor risk management by investment banks, or the realization
that securitization and certification by rating agencies involve important agency problems);
a significant loss of informed and intermediation capital (deleveraging of commercial and
investment banks hit by losses) and so on. All of these factors -and more- have been men-
tioned in the events surrounding the recent subprime crisis.14 We assume that this shock
is completely unanticipated, but this is not crucial to our analysis as long as there is some
degree of market incompleteness, preventing agents from fully hedging away.
   In the model we capture this shock with a crash in the bubble B at date t0 . The dynamics
that follow are described by those in the bubbleless system and are illustrated in Figure 10.
Right before the shock, the economy is at point A, with qt0 = q̄ and no inventories (It0 = 0).
When the crisis erupts, the price of commodities jumps to point B, on the saddle-path. With
decreased demand in the spot market, the economy immediately begins to build inventories
(which could be kept under the ground). The price of commodities remains high until the
economy converges to the new steady state (point C).

                                                    18
   The collapse of the bubble reduces asset supply and leads to a drop in the interest rate.
Lower interest rates make more attractive the strategy of storing the Z-good to sell it in
the future, which validates the build-up in inventories. Higher commodity prices along the
transition are required to lower demand and restore equilibrium in the Z-good market. The
commodity price jumps at t = t0 , and asymptotes from above to the same path as in the
pre-crash economy.
       The interest rates initially drops by:
                                                                          !
                                               Bt−0      θα   pt+0
                            rt+0 − rt−0 = −g          −              −1       <0                   (15)
                                               Wt−0     1+α   pt−0

and then converges smoothly back to the asymptotic level g. There are two terms on the
right hand side of (15). The first “bubble-burst” term −gBt−0 /Wt−0 is directly due to the
collapse of the bubble. The second “commodity-price-jump” term follows from the increase
in the price of the Z-good, which raises the rate of wealth accumulation. Since inventories
are only gradually accumulated, an additional gap opens between asset supply and asset
demand, which requires a further decline in interest rates.
       In the benchmark no-inventory economy, the normalized price of commodities stays con-
stant and equal to q̄, so the economy remains indefinitely at point A in figure 10. Since the
price of commodities does not jump, the second term in equation (15) would equal 0, and
the interest rate drop would be entirely given by the bubble-burst term.15

       Note that there is a strong flight-to-quality feature in the model since both the value of
accumulated savings and the total value of assets are continuous at t = t0 :

                                                                     1+α
                           Wt−0 = (Vt−0 + Bt−0 ) = Wt+0 = Vt+0 =         Xt0 .
                                                                      θ

    This means that the decline in interest rates raises the value of the trees (the ‘good’
asset) enough to fully offset the loss in value due to the crash in the bubble. Later on we
will show that when σ < 1, the decline in interest rate is more pronounced than in the σ = 1
case, which further raises the value of the remaining good assets.16
  15
    We know from the previous analysis that the interest rate would drop to rref = δθ/ (1 + α) .
  16
    Note that if we were to use a true CPI (rather than the price of good X) to deflate quantities, then
wealth would always drop in real terms after a crash. This alternative numeraire formulation, which we
develop in Appendix A.4, modifies the “language” but none of our substantive conclusions.

1.4     The Growth Slowdown (Phase II)

Eventually, the financial crisis starts to hurt global growth prospects. We capture this turn of
events by assuming that at t = t1 , global growth slows down unexpectedly and permanently
                                                                                ¯ In fact,
from g to ĝ < g. In the long run, the slowdown lowers the level of inventories I.
from (13) we see that if the growth slowdown is sufficiently severe as to reverse assumption
1, the commodity bubble ultimately crashes and I¯ = 0. We formalize this with the following
assumption.

Assumption 2 Severe Growth Slowdown: ĝ < δθ/(1 + α)

   Under assumption 2, inventories are not sustainable in the long run. The dynamics
that follow the growth slowdown are illustrated in Figure 11. At time t1 , the economy is
at point D, with inventory levels It1 and a commodity price qt1 . Following the shock, the
price of commodities needs to collapse, so as to pick up the slack from the decreased rate of
inventory accumulation. Equivalently, the collapse in commodity prices from D to E pushes
equilibrium interest rates to rt > ĝ, making inventory accumulation less profitable.17 Over
time, inventories converge to I¯ = 0, while commodity prices increase back to q̄ (point A),
and the interest rate converges to r ref .

    By constrast, in the no-inventory economy, the commodity price and the interest rate
would not be impacted at t = t1 . The economy would remain indefinitely at point A in
figure 11.



2      Global Imbalances in the Long Run

Let us now study global equilibrium in a world with two large regions, i = {U, M}.                         We
interpret region U as the US, with initially good but perhaps fragile financial conditions,
  17
    Note that while rt+ > ĝ, the interest rate can increase or decrease when the growth shock hits, depending
                       1
on the level of inventories It1 . This is because a decrease in commodity prices reduces both asset supply (the
value of inventories decreases) and asset demand (the value of the flow of Z-goods decreases). When It1 is
small, the asset supply shifts less than the asset demand curve, requiring an increase in the interest rate to
clear the asset market. We can compute the increase in interest rates,
                                     θ   Z               θ   Z                
                     rt+ − rt− =             pt− − pt+ +           pt+ ĝ − pt− g It1
                       1     1     1 + α Xt1   1     1   1 + α Xt1   1        1



where the second term on the right hand side is negligible if It1 is small. Note that despite this potential
increase at impact, the interest rate eventually converges to a lower level since rref < g under assumption 1.

and region M as the set of emerging and commodity producing economies that offset U.S.
external imbalances.
   Each of the regions is described by the same setup as the world economy, with an instan-
taneous return from hoarding a unit of either tree, rt , which is common across both regions
and satisfies:
                                 rt Vti = δXti + V̇ti − gVti                            (16)

where Vti is the value of country i’s tree at time t. We assume initially that both regions
have common parameters g, δ and θ, but that the initial bubble is concentrated in the U
region. The latter captures the idea that the U region has more attractive assets than the
M region. Moreover, we assume that the Z-good is produced only in the M economy and
that the potential inventories are held in this region (perhaps under the ground, see later
discussion). These two features are all that differentiates the two regions, aside from scale.
   Let Wti denote the savings accumulated by agents in country i at date t. By analogy
with (7):
                       Ẇti = −θWti + (1 − δ)Xti + gVti + rt Wti + 1{i=M } pt Zt ,        (17)

where 1{i=M } is an indicator for country M. Adding (16) and (17) for U and M, the world
economy is exactly the one described in Section 1 with:

                  Wt = WtU + WtM ;          Vt = VtU + VtM ;    Xt = XtU + XtM ;

   Let us start from the steady-state with bubbles and σ = 1 described in Section 1.2.
Figure 12 represents graphically the external equilibrium in U in a ‘Metzler-diagram’ (Metzler
(1960)). The curve labeled V U /X U represents the long run value of the U-tree, relative to
output. It is equal to δ/r and decreases with the interest rate r. The curve labeled W U /X U
represents the long run value of the savings to output ratio, as a function of the equilibrium
interest rate. It is equal to (1 − δ + gδ/r) / (θ + g − r) . It decreases, then increases with r.18
   Without bubbles or inventories, long run financial autarky is achieved at point A with
r = δθ. Under financial integration, but still without bubbles or inventories, the interest rate
is lower, at r ref = δθ/ (1 + α) . The reason for the lower equilibrium interest rate is that a
larger fraction of global output is not capitalized when there are commodities. The lower
interest rate allows U to supply more assets to M and to run a current account deficit that
is proportional to the distance between points B and C on figure 12.
  18
    While the asset demand schedule W U /X U can be downward sloping, the gap between W U /X U and
V /X U , equal to (1 − δθ/r) / (θ + g − r) , is always increasing with the interest rate. The downward sloping
 U

part of the W U /X U curve comes from the impact of interest rates on asset demand through the new trees
gV U . When g < δθ, the W U /X U curve has the shape shown in figure 12. When g > δθ, the asset and
demand curves cross on the downward sloping part of the asset demand curve W U /X U .

so as to eliminate the dynamic inefficiency of Assumption 1. The increase is such that
the world equilibrium interest rate increases from r ref to g. The current account deficit in
the bubble equilibrium (proportional to the distance between points D and E) is always
larger than in the no-bubble & no inventories case (the distance between points B and C).19
The reason for this larger current account deficit is that a disproportionate share of M’s
income is non-capitalizable (because their commodity income, pZ, is noncapitalizable unless
it is transformed into inventories), while U produces a disproportionate share of the global
assets.


2.1       Long-Run Imbalances with no Growth Slowdown

As before, the subprime shock takes place at t = t0 . In the long run, the presence of
commodities leads to a larger global rebalancing in response to a subprime shock in the
U.S. (the U-region). Let’s consider first what happens if there is no growth slowdown. In
this case, since the asymptotic interest rate in the absence of bubbles is still r = g, the
asymptotic current account deficit of the U region following the collapse of the bubble is
smaller by exactly the size of the bubble:
                                                         
                                           CAUt       1 δ
                                                ∼ g    −
                                           XtU t→∞    θ g

This asymptotic current account will be in deficit if the degree of dynamic inefficiency in
the global economy is not too severe (δθ > g), as is assumed in Figure 12. Otherwise, the
buildup in inventories is significant, which increases the supply of assets in the M region and
reduces its need to buy foreign assets for store of value.

   This build-up of inventories implies that endogenous commodity prices lead to more
rebalancing in the long-run. The reason is that inventories contribute to increasing asset
 19
      Indeed, the increase in the current account deficit in the presence of the bubble can be computed as
                                                                                          

supply in the M region, and hence endogenously reduce the effective asymmetry between
the two regions. In terms of figure 12, the current account deficit contracts from D − E to
D − F, as the bubble collapses and inventories are accumulated, while it would contract from
D − E to B − C in the benchmark no-inventory economy. Therefore, the inventory channel
unambiguously leads to more rebalancing in the long run. We will see in the next section
that this result can be overturned in the short run when σ < 1.


2.2    Long-Run Imbalances with a Growth Slowdown

Let us now reintroduce the slowdown in growth. Under assumption 2, the asymptotic interest
rate drops to r ref . Figure 13 describes what happens to U ′ s asymptotic external imbalances
as growth declines. The asset demand curve rotates clockwise around point A, so that asset
demand decreases in the relevant range (r < δθ).
                                                                    
    The asymptotic net foreign asset position NAU /X U = W U − V U /X U can be read as
the distance G − C. Since there are no inventories and r = r ref , it is the same as in the
benchmark no-inventory economy and worsens as the growth rate ĝ declines. Further, this
asymptotic net foreign asset position is more negative with the growth slowdown (G − C)
than without (D − F ). The reason is that lower growth eliminates the buildup in commodity
inventories and hence curtails the expansion in asset supply in the M region. The inventory
channel analyzed above, which reduces the asymetry between the two regions, is now damp-

                                              24
ened and the economy experiences less rebalancing in the long-run. However, since growth
is also slower in the former case, the asymptotic current account may or may not worsen
asymptotically with a growth slowdown.20



3        Global Imbalances in the Short Run

3.1        Phase I: The Financial Crisis

The behavior of the current account in the short run depends on the initial portfolios, the
degree of home portfolio bias, and the degree of substitution between the commodity and the
general consumption good. Following Caballero et al. (2008), we assume an extreme form of
home bias: at t = t0 all the assets held by the agents in the U region are U assets. Moreover,
we assume that domestic residents’ portfolios are proportional to the relative value of trees
and bubbles. The assumption of extreme portfolio home bias is a good approximation. As
of 2005, Sercu and Vanpee (2007) find that the degree of home equity bias varies between
0.5 for Norway and 0.90 for Japan.21 The assumption that domestic residents’ portfolios
are proportional to the relative value of trees and bubbles implies that M has a significant
exposure to U ′ s bubble asset. Again, this is a reasonable assumption. The onset of the U.S.
subprime crisis was marked by the failure of a small German bank, IKB, and a few months
later by the collapse of Northern Rock, a U.K. bank, highlighting the exposure of foreign
investors to tainted U.S. assets.22
   Under these assumptions the degree of rebalancing on impact, CAUt+ − CAUt− is given by
                                                                    0       0
the sum of two terms: the adjustment in the trade balance XtU − θWtU , and the change in
payments on external debt, through asset valuations and interest rates. The adjustment in
payments on external debt is swamped by the adjustment in the trade balance when the
external debt is initially small, so we focus on the latter.It is always positive and given by:

       The asymptotic current account deficit is now:               t

  21
     The degree of home equity bias is defined as one minus the ratio of the share of foreign equities in the
domestic and world portfolios. It varies between zero (when the weight on foreign equities is given by their
relative market capitalization) and one (when investors hold no foreign equities). It has declined in recent
years, but remains very high for most countries.
  22
     According to Beltran, Pounder and Thomas (2008), table 6, foreigners hold 39 percent –$2.3 trillion out
of $6 trillion– of outstanding ABS backed by U.S. assets, and about 16 percent of all U.S. credit market
instruments.

the direct effect of the bubble crash is a reduction in wealth WtU0 , which lowers consumption

economy than in the benchmark no-inventory economy.24 The change in the trade balance

where xUt0 = XtU0 /Xt0 is the output share of U. This result is particular to the case σ = 1
because the share of X-goods in consumption is invariant to the price pt of Z-goods.25


3.2     Phase II: The Growth Slowdown

Consider now the impact effects of the growth slowdown shock. We maintain the assumption
of extreme home bias so that immediately before the growth slowdown shock hits, all of U’s
wealth is invested in U assets. The adjustment in the trade balance is always positive:
                                                                      

where µt1− = WtU− /VtU− . The change in the value of U assets can be computed as above.
                1     1
We show in Appendix A.1 that when It1 is small and σ = 1, the impact of the growth
slowdown on the trade balance is negligible. By contrast, when σ < 1, the decline in the
value of U assets is accentuated, and the trade balance improves at impact. We show in
  23
     However, in equilibrium, the drop in wealth is dampened because interest rates plummet, raising the
value of the good U −asset and making up for part of the drop in wealth.
  24
     In Appendix A.2, we show that the difference in trade rebalancing between these two economies is
strictly less than the direct effect of the change in terms of trade resulting from speculation in commodities,
holding imports and exports constant. In other words, imported and exported quantities adjust by more in
the endogenous commodity price economy than in the no-inventory economy.
  25
     In contrast,we show in Appendix A.1 that in the more realistic σ < 1 case, the increase in the price of
the U -assets in response to the subprime shock, VtU+ − VtU− , is larger when commodity prices are endogenous
                                                      0     0
than when they are not. The reason for the larger increase in the value of U assets is that the share of
X-goods in value-added decreases, which raises asset demand relative to asset supply. As a result of this
gap, asset supply has to increase by more in equilibrium. This “petrodollar” channel will prove crucial later
on in our quantitative exercises. This effect is absent in the no-inventory benchmark economy, which would
as a result experience a greater amount of rebalancing in the short run.

commodity component of the trade balance.


3.3       Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations

This section gauges the order of magnitude of the effects discussed above. We focus on
the impact effect of the financial crisis, which we can develop analytically, and present in
the next section discussion of the full dynamics. We find from this ‘back-of-the-envelope’
exercise that our model can explain much of the observed decline in real rates and rise in
the price of oil in the first phase of the financial crisis, as well as the sharp collapse in the
price of oil in the second phase. The model also goes a long way in explaining why the U.S.
current account adjustment has been only minor so far, but it forecasts that the decline in
the price of oil will reduce the trade deficit significantly in the future.


Phase I: The financial crisis. We begin with the impact of the crisis on interest rates.
According to Figure 2, real interest rates declined by about 1.75 percent between September
2006, when house prices start to decline and the current account turns around, and June
2008.26 With a unit elasticity, σ = 1, the change in interest rates is given by (15); when
the elasticity of substitution σ is smaller than 1, the drop in interest rates rt+0 − rt−0 can still
be expressed as the sum of two terms, a bubble-burst term reflecting the direct impact of
the collapse of the bubble on asset supply and a commodity-price jump term reflecting the
impact of the increase in the price of commodities on global asset supply and demand.27
   The starting point in assessing the role of the two terms is an estimate of the size of the
perceived losses generated by the financial crisis, in relation to the world’s financial wealth:
Bt−0 /Wt−0 . Estimates of the perceived size of the initial collapse of the bubble are difficult to
come by, and necessarily imprecise. A key issue is that the endogenous response of interest
rates offsets the impact of the crash in Bt on global wealth.28 Empirically, this means that
the estimates of the size of the initial bubble that we obtain are likely to be downward biased.
       Direct losses in U.S. mortgage markets alone are estimated in the vicinity of $500 billion
(Greenlaw et al. (2008)). In its April 2008 Global Financial Stability Report, the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund reaches a similar estimate of the aggregate losses in the U.S. residential
  26
     The world short real rate dropped from 1.6 percent to -0.9 percent. The U.S. long real rate drops from
2.4 percent to 1.4 percent.
  27
     See Appendix A.3 for an expression for the commodity-price jump-term.
  28
     For instance, we have seen that in the case of a unit elasticity σ = 1, aggregate wealth remains unchanged.

mortgage market (IMF (2008a)). Adding the potential losses to broader credit markets, the
IMF calculates aggregate losses from writedowns of U.S. loans and securitized assets of about
$945 billion.29 To these losses, one needs to add the declines in assets values generated by the
broad process of deleveraging and the associated contraction in lending across markets. For
instance, Greenlaw et al. (2008) estimate an overall $2.3 trillion contraction in intermediary
balance sheets. Moreover, mortgage market losses only reflect the increased rate of delin-
quencies on prime mortgages and commercial real estate (as well as the declining value of
foreclosed properties). To this, one needs to add the decline in housing wealth for residential
borrowers that remain in good standing on their mortgage. Estimates of the latter are signif-
icantly larger than the direct losses in mortgage markets. For instance, the Federal Reserve
estimates household’s housing wealth at $19.6 trillion dollars as of June 2006.30 According
to the Case-Shiller U.S. composite-10 Home Price index, U.S. housing prices declined 18
percent in nominal terms between September 2006 and June 2008 (see figure 4). Assuming
that this decline is across the board would wipe out at least an additional $3.5 trillion in
U.S. housing wealth alone.31

    Adding these estimates yields a total loss in U.S. housing wealth and mortgage markets
in the range of $2 to $4 trillion. What is relevant in our calculation is the ratio of these
initial losses to the world’s financial wealth Wt−0 . We construct a crude estimate of the latter
at the onset of the crisis as the sum of the U.S. household net worth of $51.7 trillion at
the end of 2005, and an estimate of the financial wealth of the rest of the world of $80.7
trillion.32 This would give an initial size of the bubble between 1.5 and 3.0 percent of the
world’s financial wealth. In what follows, we assume an initial bubble equal to 2 percent of
the world’s financial wealth.
       It is immediate that the bubble-burst term in equation (15), equal to −gBt−0 /Wt−0 , is
relatively small. With a growth rate around 3 percent, it is equal to only -0.06 percent. On
  29
      In its October 2008 report, the IMF revised its estimate of U.S. declared losses on loans and securitized
assets to $1.4 trillion (IMF (2008b)).
   30
      See table B.100 of the June 2008 release of the Flow of Funds.
   31
      This is calculated under the extreme assumption that all mortgage market losses are housing market
losses. Of course, foreclosures and reposessions generate additional losses beyond the decline in housing
values.
   32
      See Table B.100 of the June 2008 issue of the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds Accounts for the US
figure. To obtain the estimate of the financial wealth of the rest of the world in 2006, we calculate the ratio
of output to financial wealth for the United States, the European Union and Japan between 1982 and 2004.
We find a GDP-weighted average of 2.48 (see Caballero et al. (2008) for additional details). We apply this
ratio to the GDP of the rest of the world in 2005 and obtain $80.7 trillion. To the extent that many countries
are less financially developed than the U.S., Europe or Japan, we are likely to overstate the world’s financial
wealth. This would further bias downward our estimate of Bt0 /Wt0 .

the other hand, the commodity-price jump term can be substantial. To see this, Table 1
reports estimates of the decline in r for different values of the elasticity of substitution σ and
different estimates of the increase in commodity prices. The calculation of the commodity-
price-jump term requires an estimate of average expenditure share of commodities, szt−0 . In
the table, we assume that szt−0 = 0.04 percent, which corresponds to the average share of oil
expenditures in world GDP in 2005 and 2006.33

   Between September 2006 and June 2008 the real price of a barrel of West Texas Interme-
diate increased from $68.5 to $142.3 in constant 2008 prices (see Figure 7). Interpreting this
surge as the direct effects of the crisis yields pt+0 /pt−0 = 2.08. The associated decrease in real
interest rates in table 1 is consistent with what we see in the data. For a realistically low
level of the short-term price elasticity of demand σ = 0.1, we find a decline in interest rates of
1.16 percent, smaller than the 1.75 percent observed over that period, but much larger than
the 0.06 percent decline associated with the direct effect of the collapse of the bubble. Most
of the decline in interest rates comes from the indirect effect of higher commodity prices,
hinting that the endogenous response of commodity prices to the subprime crisis is critical
in understanding the global macroeconomic environment.


    We now turn to the effect of the crash on commodity prices. We can compute the decline
in U ′ s financial wealth and find an expression for the jump in commodity prices as a function
  33
    According to the Energy Information Administration (Table 2.4, World Petroleum Demand), world
demand for oil in 2005 was 83,646 thousand barrels per day. With a WTI price of the barrel equal to
$56.64 dollars, this corresponds to $1.7 trillion, or 3.79 percent of world GDP. In 2006, the share of oil in
expenditures was 4.16 percent. The remaining parameters will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.2.

June 2007 and March 2008, U.S. households financial wealth declined $1.65 trillion, or 12
percent of output.35 Next, we construct an estimate of µt−0 , the share of domestic financial
wealth invested in the domestic tree and the domestic bubble before the crash. In 2005, the
net foreign liabilitiesof the U.S. amounted
                                            to $1.85 trillion, or 15 percent of U.S. GDP.36

commodity prices that followed the subprime crisis. We find that, for our benchmark estimate
of the size of the bubble of 2 percent, commodity prices increase by 98 percent, when the
short run elasticity of substitution equals 0.1, which is very close to the 108 percent observed
in the data. Recall that without an asset-channel (no-inventories benchmark), commodity
prices would not jump when the crisis occurs.
   Turning to the external accounts, between September 2006 and June 2008, the U.S.
trade deficit on goods and services improved from $793 billion to $710 billion (annualized),
an improvement that represents 1.02 percent of U.S. GDP.39 Can the model explain this very
limited rebalancing? We answer this question by rewriting the trade balance equation (19)

The first term inside the brackets represents the direct impact of the collapse of the bubble
on the trade balance. It contributes positively to global rebalancing. The second term reflects
the contribution of commodity prices. Table 3 reports the sum of the direct and indirect
impacts of the subprime crisis on the trade balance as a function of the commodity price
surge pt+0 /pt−0 and the size of the initial bubble Bt−0 /Wt−0 for an elasticity of substitution σ
equal to 0.1.
   The first line of the table reports the change in the trade balance in the benchmark no-
inventory economy (which coincides with the direct effect). We find a large and implausible
improvement in the trade balance. For instance, for an initial bubble equal to 2 percent of
world financial wealth, the no-inventory economy predicts a 6.02 percent improvement in

the trade balance relative to output. This is a far cry from the 1.02 percent observed in the
data. Again, once we introduce the “petrodollar” channel, the required rebalancing drops
significantly. For instance, the trade balance improves ‘only’ by 2.55 percent, instead of
6.02 percent when commodity prices double. If instead, we consider a tripling of commodity
prices, or a smaller initial bubble collapse, it is possible for the trade balance to worsen on
impact. While our preferred numbers are on the high side (2.5 percent against 1.02), it is
apparent that the model has the capacity to rationalize the very limited global rebalancing
that we are witnessing.40

   All in all, we conclude that the model is in the right ballpark and can account for the
broad features of the global economy in the first phase of the crisis.


Phase II: The growth slowdown. We now ask whether the model can account for
the broad features of the data following the slowdown in economic activity. In real terms,
between July and November 2008, oil prices declined by 53 percent (see figure 7). We can
use (21) to write the change in commodity prices as:

   It is immediate that commodity prices are extremely sensitive to the drop in financial
wealth. For σ = 0.1, a modest decline in U.S. financial wealth representing 10% of output
triggers a staggering 58 percent (0.42-1) decline in commodity prices. This is remarkably
close to the 53 percent decline observed in the data.


   Table 5 reports the predicted change in the trade balance as a function of the decline
in U.S. financial wealth. Since T B U = X U − θW U , this calculation is independent from σ.
This part of the analysis is necessarily more speculative. It indicates that the model predicts
a significant rebalancing of the trade balance, equal to about 2.2 percent of output, as a
consequence of the growth slowdown.



4     Calibration and Dynamics

We now turn to the analysis of full general equilibrium dynamic simulations. We begin with
a discussion of plausible short run and long run elasticities of demand for commodities. We
then present the results from dynamic simulations of the financial crisis with and without
growth slowdown.


4.1     Short and Long Run Elasticity

A key parameter of our model is the elasticity of substitution σ. Nordhaus (1980) finds
low ‘apparent’ short run price elasticities of demand, around 0.3, at the time of the 1973
oil price shock. Long run elasticities are typically higher since it takes time to substitute
away from energy-intensive technology. Nordhaus (1980) notes that for many components
of the physical capital stock, energy-substitution is only possible when the existing capital is
scrapped. In the transportation sector for instance, in which energy consumption depends


                                                    33
in large part on the fuel efficiency of the outstanding stock of vehicles, energy consumption
responds gradually as old vehicles are slowly replaced with more fuel efficient ones. Similarly,
in the case of electricity generation, there is almost no possibility for substitution in the short
run. In the long run, on the other hand, electricity generation can switch to other methods
of production such as nuclear or wind power generation.

   More recent studies confirm the ‘crude’ estimates in Nordhaus (1980) for the short run
while finding higher long run estimates.41 The typical estimates for short run price elasticities
vary between 0.1 and 0.3 while long run estimates vary between 0.4 and 1.42

   Table 6 provides an update on Nordhaus (1980)’s apparent price elasticity estimates
around the recent increase in oil prices. It reports recent data on U.S. petroleum consumption
and prices before and after 2003, where the break in oil prices is apparent in figure 7. Between
2003 and 2007 petroleum prices increased by 8.55 percent per year, a sharp break from the
1.44 percent annual increase between 1988 and 2003. Nevertheless, the growth in demand
for petroleum products slowed only from 0.84 percent to 0.61 percent. The ‘apparent’ price
elasticity is calculated as in Nordhaus (1980), under the assumption of a unit elasticity of
petroleum product demand to GDP, as the (opposite of the) percentage slowdown in energy
demand corrected for the percentage change in real output growth, divided by the percentage
acceleration in prices.43 We obtain an estimate of 0.04, on the low end of available empirical
estimates.44 This is consistent with recent empirical estimates that find an even smaller
short run price elasticity now than in the 1970s.45
       A simple way of capturing this time variation in σ is to assume that the elasticity of
substitution remains significantly smaller than one until the share of expenditures on the
Z-good reaches a certain exogenous level s̄z . When that level is reached, we assume that the
elasticity of substitution becomes equal to 1. This transition is fully anticipated by economic
agents. Continuity of the demand schedule also requires that α differ as we transition from

  42
     See Hamilton (2008) for a recent discussion of crude oil prices, and the references therein.
  43
     The income elasticity of petroleum demand is largely irrelevant in these calculations since output growth
was essentially the same over both subperiods. The income elasticity of demand of industrial countries
has declined significantly since the oil price shocks of the 1970s and is now closer to 0.5. However, the
income elasticity of emerging and oil producing countries appears to be much closer or above unity. See
Gately and Huntington (2002) and the discussion in Hamilton (2008).
  44
     Interestingly, the same (unreported) calculations for residential demand for petroleum products yields
a much larger apparent elasticity, at 0.78. The price elasticity is lowest for the industrial and transport
sectors, close to 0.
  45
     Hughes, Knittel and Sperling (2008) find a short run price elasticity between 0.03 and 0.08 between 2001
and 2006.

4.2     The Dynamic System and the U.S. Financial Shock.

We now characterize the full dynamic path in response to a U.S. financial collapse. We
start the economy on the dynamic path of the bubble equilibrium with σ < 1, and a given
level of global imbalances. At t = t0 , the bubble collapses and the economy jumps to
the dynamic path of the bubbleless equilibrium. We refer the reader to appendix B for
a complete exposition of the dynamic system and the transitions that occur between the
different regimes.
   The calibration of the dynamic path requires that we provide values for the following
parameters: the capitalization ratio δ, the growth rate of the economy g, the relative size of
U and M, the elasticity of substitution σ, the propensity to consume out of financial wealth
θ as well as the share of commodity expenditures s̄z when the elasticity of substitution
becomes unitary. We adopt a mixed approach, setting the value of some parameters based
on plausible values, and calibrating others so as to reproduce key features of the data.
    We start by setting the growth rate of the X-good to g = 0.03, which is close to the
real output growth rate in the U.S. between 1950 and 2007 (3.28%). As discussed above,
we assume that U represents a quarter of the world’s output. We set the elasticity of
substitution to σ = 0.3. This is significantly larger than the apparent elasticity estimate

    To see this, suppose that the transition

before T is given by WT − = 1 + αp1−σT     XT . Right after the switch, it is equal to WT + = (1 + α ) XT .

empirical literature. Furthermore, this value of σ produces realistic levels of adjustment
in commodity prices in the model. It also implies that the price of commodities increases
initially at g/σ = 10% in the equilibrium with bubble, accounting for some of the rapid
increase in commodity prices observed before the U.S. financial crisis.
       We set s̄z = 0.1, so that the long run model kicks in when the expenditure share of
commodities reaches 10 percent. This seems a reasonably high value. In the data, the share
of oil in world output reached 4.16 percent in 2006, up from 1.29 percent in 1998. In the
simulation, it would take around 10 years before the expenditure share reaches 10 percent.
This yields α′ = 11.11%. Finally, we set the value of the world capitalization index δ to 0.15,
which corresponds to about half of the share of capital in national accounts. As discussed
in Caballero et al. (2008), δ should be substantially lower than the capital share since many
forms of capital do not generate capitalizable streams of revenue.47 We then calibrate each
countries’ δ so as to stabilize global imbalances before the crisis erupts. We obtain δ U = 0.144
and δ M = 0.1520.48
    The two remaining parameters to calibrate are θ and α. We set their value so as to control
(a) the size of the initial bubble relative to aggregate wealth at t = 0, B0 /W0 = β 0 ; and
(b) the limit size of the bubble that would emerge in the bubbly equilibrium under σ = 1,
β 1 ≡ limt→∞ Bt /Wt . From equation (B.1), we obtain limt→∞ Bt /Wt = 1 − δθ/g (1 + α′ ). For
given values of β 0 and β 1 , we infer back the corresponding values of θ and α.
   In practice, we set β 0 = 0.02, so that the collapse of the bubble represents roughly 2%
of world’s wealth, as estimated in the previous section. We set β 1 = 1.01β 0 , so that the
economy is not far from its long run steady state when the bubble collapses (this ensures
that the share of commodities in expenditures is not too small). We obtain θ = 0.22 and
α = 0.40. We view these values as plausible. As a point of reference, Caballero et al. (2008)
computed a value of θ = 0.25, using data on U.S. household sector net worth and U.S. GDP
(θ can be interpreted as the output to financial wealth ratio). These values imply that the
economy is slightly dynamically inefficient since δθ/ (1 + α′ ) = 2.94% < g = 3%. Finally, we
set η = −0.15, in line with estimates of the U.S. net external debt position in 2006. Table 7
summarizes all the parameter values.
  47
     Caballero et al. (2008) assumed δ = 0.12. The results are largely unchanged with δ = 0.12.

of the bubble B is much larger, equal to δ̂ = δ − 1 − xt0 δ            /xt0 = 0.156. In that sense, the calibration

       Figure 14 reports the simulation obtained with these parameter values. Before the crisis,
the real interest rate is slightly above 3.4% and increasing, commodity prices (normalized)
are equal to their steady state value q̂ ≡ (α/Z)1/σ , while both the trade balance and current
account are in deficit and improving (-3.5% and -4% of output, respectively).

   At t = 0, the financial crisis hits, wiping out 2% of aggregate financial wealth. The
response of interest rates is quite stark (panel A): they drop from about 3.5 percent to
2.7 percent. This decline in interest rates is much larger than the one obtained in the
benchmark economy (the dashed line in panel A), where the decline is a mere 6 basis points.
The fall in interest rates in our economy is strong enough to trigger inventory accumulation.
                                                                              1/σ
As panel B shows, the normalized price of commodities q̂t = pt /Xt jumps 2.3 times and
gradually converges back over the next 12 years. By contrast, in the benchmark economy,
the (normalized) price of commodities remains unchanged and equal to q̂.49 The jump in
prices lowers the demand for commodities and allows inventory accumulation. We find that,
starting from It0 = 0, inventories rise relatively slowly: it takes 12 years before their market
value pI peaks at 3.2% of world financial wealth. In the initial periods after the shock, in
particular, inventories remain very low, not contributing much to the global supply of assets.


   Panel D reports the current account relative to output in our economy and the benchmark
economy. In both cases, the current account improves as a result of the collapse of the
bubble. However, as conjectured in the previous section, the rebalancing is much smaller in
the economy with inventories. In the benchmark economy, the current account jumps from
-4% to 2%, an instant rebalancing of 6% of GDP. This is not surprising, given the fact that
the bubble is located in the US: the reduction in asset supply leads agents to move part of
  49
    This still implies that in the benchmark economy pt increases at the rate g/σ, faster than the rate of
economic growth.

their financial investments to M. By contrast, in our economy, the rebalancing is ‘only’ from
-4% to -1.4%. As we discussed earlier, this is larger than the rebalancing observed in the
data, but of a similar order of magnitude.
       Eventually, the rebalancing must become larger in our economy, with a long run current
account deficit of -0.6% against -0.9% in the benchmark no-inventory economy. Nevertheless,
the role of commodities is to stabilize capital outflows for the first four years after the initial
shock. Panel E shows that the implications for the trade balance are very similar, as discussed
earlier. Panel F further decomposes the trade balance into its non-commodity component

derlying the muted response of the trade balance, both the commodity and non-commodity
balances adjust sharply. The commodity balance goes from -4.6% to -7.9% of output, while
the non-commodity balance jumps from 1.0% to 6.9% of output.
   This asymmetric response of the commodity and non-commodity component of the trade
balance is consistent with the empirical evidence. Table 8 reports the change in the U.S.
trade balance during the last two rebalancing episodes: 1987-1989 and 2006-2008.50
   The table shows that the recent improvement in the U.S. trade balance comes entirely
from the non-oil component, which improved more than 1.5 percent of GDP. By contrast,
the oil balance worsened by 0.7 percent of GDP. Comparing this rebalancing episode with
the previous episode, centered around 1987, it is striking to note that oil prices played no role
in attenuating the external rebalancing then: the deficit of the oil balance did not change
between 1987 and 1989.

       Milesi-Ferretti (2008) presents additional evidence on the contrast between the two episodes.

4.3       The Dynamic System and a Global Slowdown

The preceding results account for the negative correlation between U.S. financial assets and
commodity prices that emerged in the first phase the U.S. financial crisis. Starting in July
2008, however, commodity prices retreated dramatically. Bad news for commodities was also
bad news for U.S. and world financial markets.
   Of course, this global collapse has many causes and a host of overshooting mechanisms
are at work, from balance sheet multipliers, to margin calls, to Knightian Uncertainty that
contribute to the overall process of deleveraging. Our framework is not suited to address
the role of each these factors. Instead, we emphasize here the dramatic impact of a global
economic slowdown. To do so, we re-calibrate our model assuming that a moderate economic
slowdown –from 3% to 2% annual output growth– takes place unexpectedly one year after
the beginning of the U.S. financial crisis.
       This moderate decline in global growth is sufficiently large to ensure that assumption 2 is
satisfied, so that the global asset market tightness is removed. Figure 15 presents the results.
In each panel, the solid line reports the simulation with growth slowdown while the dashed
line reports the simulation from figure 14, without a growth slowdown. The collapse in global
growth t = 1, has dramatic consequences on asset and commodity prices. First, lower growth
reduces asset values. In the short run, however, it leads to an even larger decline in asset
demand. The result is an increase in interest rates (panel A) and a decline in asset prices
(panel F).51 This decline in asset demand arises from the sudden decline in commodity
prices (panel B) that makes commodity producers poorer. As discussed previously, this
collapse in commodity prices arises from a downward adjustment in the sustainable long run
equilibrium inventories (panel C). The growth slowdown eliminates the dynamic inefficiency
of the economy and thus the need to hold inventories in the long run. Inventory holders
immediately reduce the rate of accumulation of inventories, which leads to a collapse in the
price of commodities. As before, the decline in commodity prices is reinforced by the short
run increase in interest rates that makes commodity accumulation less profitable.
   The impact on external imbalances is also interesting. While the previous discussion
indicated that external imbalances could increase or decrease when growth slows down,
we find that for these parameter values, the decline in commodity prices accelerates the
process of global rebalancing (panel D), largely through an improvement in the commodity
  51
    Panel F reports the total value of U assets – including the bubble for t ≤ 0– in the case with (solid line)
and without (dashed line) growth slowdown. It also reports the value of the good U asset in the case with
growth slowdown (dot-dashed line).

component of the trade balance (panel E).
   The growth slowdown generates a pattern of positive comovements for asset prices and
commodities that closely matches what the world economy experienced since July 2008. In
our framework, the decline in global economic growth reduces the size or even eliminates
the bubble by reducing global asset demand. However, it is important to consider here that
this experiment assumes that the growth slowdown is permanent, a situation that is highly
unlikely. Once real economic conditions recover, our model predicts that asset demand will
rise back, recreating the chronic shortage of assets, and the cycle will start again...



5        Inventories, Oil Prices, and Asset Supply: Some Ev-
         idence

5.1       Inventories

One objection to stories like ours, where asset-demand for oil plays an important role in price
determination, is that measured oil inventory levels did not rise during the recent price spike.
OECD petroleum inventories increased from 3743 million barrels (mb) in 2000 to 4082mb
in 2008. Yet, this increase mostly occurred between 2000 and 2006. After the onset of the
subprime crisis, OECD petroleum inventories declined from 4248mb to 4082mb across the
board.52
       Yet, there are at least two reasons why the absence of a rise in measured inventories need
not be a serious concern. First, observed inventories are the result of two opposing forces: the
asset-market force which leads to an increase in inventories and a demand force which does
the opposite. In Appendix D we show that if the long-run elasticity of substitution exceeds
one, then inventories follow a non-monotonic path —rising first and declining afterwards—
in response to speculation.
       Second, as argued by Frankel (2006) and others, producers are the most efficient inventory-
  52
    In the US, petroleum and crude oil stocks increased between 2000 and 2006 by 307mb and 168mb re-
spectively. Since 2007, US petroleum stocks declined from 1785mb to 1665mb, while crude oil inventories
remained constant at 1020mb. A closer look, however, reveals that non-strategic crude oil inventories de-
creased by 20mb. The only component of US petroleum stocks that increased since 2006 is the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve (SPR) (See Energy Information Administration, Monthly Energy Review, Tables 3.4 and
11.3.). This change in the SPR is a consequence of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, mandating a gradual
increase of the SPR from 700mb to 1000mb. In May 2008, in response to the rapid increase in oil prices,
Congress voted to stop depositing oil in the SPR.

holders since they do not need to extract the oil to do so. In our model this amounts to
assuming doilproducer < d, which implies that all inventories are held underground.
   Our model is amenable to several interpretations where inventories are just oil in the
ground. Suppose, for example, that new reserves of the Z− good are discovered every period.
More precisely, the stock of discovered reserves increases by Z per unit of time. The economy
cannot consume resources that have not been discovered yet. In addition, suppose that the
rights to these new reserves are not capitalized, either because they accrue to new entrants,
because they are likely to be expropriated, or because they embody unmodelled uncertainty.
This economy would be exactly equivalent to our economy. Under this interpretation, there
are no physical inventories of Z− goods. Inventories just reflect discovered and not yet
consumed reserves of the Z-good.
   Another, more abstract, interpretation is that of a social contract in M countries. This
(implicit) contract specifies that each generation is entitled to an endowment Z of Z-goods.
They can decide when to sell it. If they do not sell it immediately, they can store it.
Moreover, they can trade rights to future consumption claims on their endowment, that is
they can sell the Z-good forward. They can also acquire the Z good from agents of the same
or different generation in M : they can then treat these newly acquired goods exactly as
their own endowment. This economy is once again completely isomorphic to our economy.
Inventories are just goods in the ground.
   As we show in Appendix C, the underground inventory holding view has important
implications for the effectiveness of recent proposals to tax speculative transactions in com-
modities.


5.2    The Empirical Link Between Oil Prices and Asset Supply

The asset-role of oil suggests a negative correlation between oil prices and the value of assets
negatively affected by financial shocks, and a positive correlation between oil prices and
economic growth. As a starting point we run the simple OLS regression:

                                 ∆pt = α + β∆st + γ∆yt + ǫt                                 (23)

where lower case variables are in log, pt denotes the spot price of crude oil, st is the Standard
& Poors 500 index and yt is the monthly U.S. Industrial Production index. In the model, a
decline in the value of bubble assets that lowers stock prices leads to a reallocation towards


                                               43
commodities, so we expect to find β < 0. A decline in growth should also push down
commodity prices, so we expect γ > 0. Table 9 reports the results of the simple OLS
regression in (23) for the period January 1984 to November 2008. We find a negative but
non-significant link between oil prices and stock market performance, and a positive and
mostly insignificant link between growth and oil prices.


       There are two obvious issues with the OLS regression. First, as shown in figure 8, the
apparent correlation is strongly negative only in the first phase of the crisis. In the second
phase of the crisis, as explained above, the collapse in global growth reduces both asset and
commodity prices. Second, there is an obvious reverse causality concern. For instance, an
exogenous increase in oil prices could increase the chance of a recession, leading to a decline
in stock returns, or push up inflation rates, leading to a tightening of monetary policy, that
would also send equities tumbling. To control for this, we use two instruments: the price of
gold, as well as the performance of financial stocks relative to the broader market. Increases
in the price of gold are often associated with flight to quality episodes. In fact, since gold
provides per se little services or yield, it is the perfect example of an asset held for speculative
reasons. The relative performance of financials captures the fact that financial crises impact
more directly the financial sector, while there is no reason for oil shocks to affect this service
sector more than, e.g. energy-intensive transportation or manufacturing sectors.
       The top panel of Table 10 presents the IV estimates. We notice that the coefficient on
equities is both much larger, and also strongly significant at the daily, weekly, monthly and
quarterly frequencies. The elasticity is always in excess of one. The coefficient on growth
has the correct sign at the quarterly and annual frequency, but appears to be insignificant.
The bottom panel reports the first stage of the IV regression.
    Financial relative performance has the right impact on equilibrium assets values at all
frequencies but annual: conditional on growth, bad news in U.S. financial markets is good
news for oil as an asset. Conversely, good news in U.S. financial markets is bad news for
oil.53
  53
   The results are similar if we restrict the sample to the period before July 2008, preceding the second
phase of the crisis.

6     Final Discussion

The prevailing view is one of central banks excesses and mistakes leading to excess liquidity,
speculative bubbles, and unavoidable crises. This seems overstated: central banks, when
reasonable, are not nearly as powerful. In this paper we take a contrarian view and provide
an entirely private-sector account of the main facts, without any role for monetary factors.
Reality is probably in between.
    Our framework builds on the idea that the world economy entered the crisis with a
chronic excess demand for financial assets, where the subprime market development may
just have been a (failed) market attempt to bridge this gap. Within this perspective, we
argue that the sharp rise in oil prices following the subprime crisis — nearly 100 percent
in just a matter of months and on the face of recessionary shocks— was the result of a
speculative response to the financial crisis itself, in an attempt to rebuild asset supply. That
is, the global economy was subject to one shock with multiple implications rather than to
two separate shocks (financial and oil).
    Eventually, the persistent financial crisis and its many multipliers severely hurt growth
prospects, which triggered and implosion in commodity prices and asset demand more
broadly. However, by the same token, when real conditions recover, our model predicts
that asset demand is likely to rise back, recreating the chronic shortage of assets, and the cy-
cle will start again. Regulation, unless distortionary enough to depress growth, is no match
for these market forces. The real problem is more macroeconomic in nature and unlikely to
go away until the world economy’s ability to generate sound store of value catches up with
its potential income growth. That is, as so much else on these days, it depends largely on
developments within China and other emerging markets.

A.1     Asset Decline and Trade Balance when σ < 1 : the petrodol-
        lar effect
In this section, we provide the analysis underlying the claims in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 regarding
the case where the elasticity of substitution σ between X and Z is less than one. Formally,
                                                 
recall that in equilibrium θWt = 1 + αp1−σ   t     Xt . Because It0 = 0, Wt+0 = Vt+0 and therefore
                 
Vt+0 − Vt−0 + Bt−0 > 0 when σ < 1. This increase in global asset value (when measured in units of
X) mitigates the fall in the value of U -assets. In fact the change in wealth can be expressed as

The first term on the right hand side of this expression is positive and is exactly the same as in
equation (20). It represents the direct effect of the bubble-burst and also corresponds to the drop in
U ′ s wealth that would occur in the benchmark no-inventory economy. The second term is negative
in our economy but vanishes in the benchmark no-inventory economy. It represents the drop in
the share of the X good in total consumption, and mitigates the fall in the value of U ’s assets.
As we argued earlier, this “petrodollar” term plays a key role in limiting the extent of short-run
rebalancing.
     Consider now the impact effects of the growth slowdown shock. We maintain the assumption
of extreme home bias so that immediately before the growth slowdown shock hits, all of U ’s wealth
is invested in U assets. The adjustment in the trade balance is always positive:

The second term is negligible if It1 is small. Since the first term is equal to 0 when σ = 1, we have
that in this benchmark the impact of the growth slowdown on the trade balance is negligible. By
contrast, when σ < 1, the first term is negative and, under our calibration, it swamps the second
term. Thus, the trade balance improves at impact.

A.2         The Trade Balance in the short Run
In this section we expand on Section 3.1 and analyze the behavior of the trade balance in the short
run both in our economy and in the benchmark no-inventory economy.
   We can decompose this difference more finely by studying the trade balance decomposition into

The three terms on the right hand side have a traditional Marshall-Lerner interpretation: The first
one represents the increase in the volume of exports. The second one represents the decrease in
the volume of imports times the terms of trade. These two are positive since the volume of exports
rises and the volume of imports falls. The third term is negative and represents imports times the
change in the terms of trade. Note that the terms of trade effect – the last term– would be absent
in the benchmark no-inventory economy. However, we can show that the positive quantity effect
– the first two terms – is stronger in our economy than in the benchmark economy, which means
that the difference in trade rebalancing between these two economies is strictly less than the direct
effect of the change in terms of trade resulting from speculation in commodities.54

A.4       The Numeraire
Throughout we have chosen the X-good as the numeraire. This section confirms the claim in
Section 1.2 that the main substantive results do not depend on this particular choice of numeraire.
                                                                                           1/(1−σ)
The price index corresponding to the composite consumption good is given by 1 + αp1−σ   t
                  α

if σ 6= 1, and pt1+α if σ = 1. We term the corresponding numeraire the composite numeraire. We
denote with a tilde the variable expressed in the composite numeraire. The interest rate in the
composite numeraire r̃t can be computed from rt as follows:
                                             h               1/(1−σ) i

                        r̃t = rt −                                        = rt −             ṗt

If max{It , I˙t } > 0, we have

Let’s now investigate how this change in numeraire would modify our conclusions concerning the

    The right comparison when we use the composite numeraire should be with an economy with
exogenous commodity prices. With endogenous commodity prices, the interest rate drops more.
The drop in asset value is also more pronounced because the trees pay dividend in X-goods the
value of which depreciates at impact. Both effects contribute to more rebalancing with endogenous
commodity prices. A counterbalancing effect is that the value of GDP goes down since GDP is
composed of X goods, the value of which depreciates at impact. This last effect contributes to less
rebalancing.

With this normalization, endogenous commodity prices only contribute to less rebalancing with
σ = 1 because they lead to lower interest rates.

   Hence when net positions are small compared to gross positions endogenous commodity prices
can lead to less rebalancing. All the qualitative conclusions of the paper remain unchanged.

    In this appendix, we provide the analysis underlying the calibration and the dynamic system
in Section 4.


B.1     The bubble economy: t < t0 .
We start the economy in the bubble equilibrium with σ < 1, for t < t0 . The economy is characterized
by the following equations:

                         Ḃt = rt Bt
                                                            1/σ−1
                                  δθ + θgBt /Xt + αq̂ 1−σ Xt        g (1/σ − 1)
                          rt =                              1/σ−1
                                              1+   αq̂ 1−σ Xt

                1/σ
where q̂ ≡ pt /Xt = (α/Z)1/σ is constant. This is a differential system in Bt with a forcing term
Xt . It requires a terminal condition. To find this terminal condition, we need to characterize the
                                                                                            1/σ
path of the economy, in the event that the bubble does not collapse. Observe that pt = q̂Xt , hence
                                                                                     
the share of consumption expenditures on the Z-good, szt = αp1−σ     t / 1 + αp1−σ
                                                                                t      , is increasing
                                                                                           1/σ−1
without bounds. The transition to σ = 1 must occur at some time T1 such that αq̂ 1−σ XT1  = α′ .
From T1 onwards, the elasticity of substitution is equal to one. The bubble economy with σ = 1
reaches its steady state instantly with:

                                  rt = g ; qt = α′ /Z                                              (B.1)

                                     =         ;        = tU =
                                 Xt       θ         Xt    Xt   g
                                             ′
                                                     
                                         1+α       δ
                                 Bt =            −     Xt
                                            θ      g

                                                                                         h             i
    This provides the terminal condition for the value of the bubble at time T1− : BT1− = (1+α   )
                                                                                               ′
                                                                                                     δ
                                                                                             θ     − g XT1 .
                                                                                         U
Solving backwards from t = T1 , we can then characterize the entire path Bt , Wt , Vt , Vt , pt that
is expected to occur in the absence of a collapse of the bubble.
   This global system is consistent with any initial net foreign asset position at t = t0 . Assume that
we want to start the economy with an external debt N AU            U
                                                           t0 = ηXt0 . Under the assumption that the


                                                  54
bubble is initially located in U , this implies that U ’s savings are equal to WtU0 = VtU0 + Bt0 + ηXtU0 .
One can then solve for the path of domestic savings from the asset accumulation equation. In turn,
this pins down net foreign assets N AU         U     U                               U       U
                                        t = Wt −Vt −Bt , the current account CAt = Ẇt − V̇t − Ḃt
                                                                                                  U

and the trade balance T Bt = Xt − θWt in all previous periods.


B.2      Collapse of the bubble: the short run.
Consider now what happens at time t = t0 when the bubble collapses. As long as σ < 1, the
economy satisfies the following equations:

                             I˙t = Z − αq̂t−σ
                                          g
                             q̂˙t =   rt −     q̂t
                                           σ
                                       1−1/σ                                  
                                    Xt       θδ + θgq̂t It − θ q̂t Z − αq̂t−σ
                             rt =                  1−1/σ
                                               Xt        + ασ q̂t1−σ

    This is a dynamic system in I and q̂ with a forcing term Xt . We have one initial condition:
It0 = 0, by assumption. We need a terminal condition on q̂t . To find it, consider what happens to
                                                            
the share of commodities in expenditures, αp1−σ
                                            t   / 1 + αp1−σ
                                                        t     over time. From the second equation
                                             1/σ−1
above, the growth rate of p1−σ
                             t  = q̂t1−σ Xt    is (1 − σ) (rt − g/σ) + g (1/σ − 1) = (1 − σ) rt , which
must be positive eventually (since the interest rate converges to g/σ). Hence the expenditure share
must eventually reach s̄z , at which point the elasticity of substitution becomes unity. Let’s denote
T2 the time at which this happens, and q̂T2− , IT2− the values of the system at that time. Note that
                                         1/σ−1
q̂T2 and T2 are also linked by αq̂T1−σ
                                    2
                                       XT2       = α′ . Thus, we can parameterize potential equilibrium
paths by T2 .


B.3      Collapse of the bubble: the long run.
When t ≥ T2 , the economy is now in the unitary elasticity inventory model described in the previous
section. The system follows a saddle path dynamics with:

                                     I˙t = Z − α′ qt−1
                                     q̇t = (rt − g) qt
                                            δ + α′ − qt (Z − gIt )
                                     rt = θ
                                                     1 + α′

   where qt = pt /Xt . The boundary conditions for that system are IT2 = IT2− and limt→∞ qt =
α′ /Z.Solving the saddle-path dynamics provides the unique initial value qT2+ that is consistent
with the equilibrium (see figure 9).



                                                     55
                                                                                                                       (1−1/σ)
   Lastly, continuity of the price at T2 requires that we select T2 such that q̂T2− = qT2+ XT2                                   .
This completes the characterization of the economy.

                                         Speculation and Policy

    In this appendix, we expand on Section 5 and analyze the effect of introducing futures markets,
as well as the effects of policies aimed at curtailing ”speculation”.


C.1      Futures
Let us start by introducing (fully collateralized) future contracts on the Z-good. We make two
simple and related points: (i) first, the payoff of the strategy that consists in buying the Z-good and
storing it can be replicated by simple futures positions; (ii) second, in our model, the introduction
of futures market has no impact on the equilibrium.
   By covered interest parity, the forward rate ft+s is equal to:
                                                                    R t+s
                                                                            (ru +d)du
                                              ft+s = pt exp          t                  .


   Consider the strategy of buying a forward contract at t with maturity t + s and reselling it at
date t + s′ < t + s. The payoff at t + s′ is
                                R t+s                      R t+s                                  R t+s′
               pt+s′ − pt exp    t
                                        (ru +d)du
                                                    exp−    t+s′
                                                                   (ru +d)du
                                                                               = pt+s′ − pt exp    t
                                                                                                           (ru +d)du



which, in net present value, is exactly the same payoff as that of buying one unit of the Z-good at
t, storing it until t + s′ and then selling it on the spot market at t + s′ . To the extent that there is
heterogeneity in the storage cost that agents need to pay to store the Z-good, all the inventories
will be held by the agents with the lowest storage costs – typically the producers, who can at least
partly leave the Z-good in the ground. Agents with higher storage costs will prefer to buy future
contracts from the producers.


C.2      Equilibrium and policy
However, the introduction of futures contracts has absolutely no effect on the equilibrium of our
economy. Futures do not increase asset supply: every long position is offset by a corresponding
short position, and there are no agents with biased beliefs deviating from the prefect foresight



                                                               56
price-path. As a result, the imposition of a tax on futures trading, or their prohibition, would have
absolutely no moderating effect on commodity prices.
    In order for a tax to have any consequence in our model, it must affect the agent with the smallest
storage costs, which hold the inventories. Thus, let us consider the effect of taxing producers for
holding inventories. While in practice this is extremely hard to do since producers are likely to
hold most of their inventories underground, it is a useful positive exercise to gauge the potential
impact of these type of policies.
    It turns out that taxes on the value of inventory holdings are almost isomorphic with the holding
cost parameter d, except that that under the tax interpretation, the proceeds can be rebated lump
sum to the agents at no resource cost. We take the latter route here and let τ denote the tax rate
per unit of value of inventories (that is, the tax per unit of inventory is τ pt
       We maintain the assumption that σ = 1 but strengthen the dynamic inefficiency Assumption 1
to:

                             θδ
Assumption 3 g − τ >        1+α .


    Under Assumption 3, the bubbleless steady state of the economy is now such that the interest
rate is given by
                                          rt = g − τ ,

the price grows at rate g

                                                            Xt
                                                   pt = α
                                                            Z
and long run inventories are constant

                                           1+α    1      h              i
                                    It =                   g − τ − r ref Z.
                                            α θ (g − τ )

The long run level inventory function I (τ ) is decreasing with respect to τ while the price of oil is
unaffected since the relative consumption of X and Z goods is unchanged in the long run. However,
in the short
            run, the
                     imposition of a tax τ lowers inventories and the price of oil which is equal to
                  ˙
pt = αXt / Z − It .
    In summary, a tax on inventories reduces the level of these and succeeds in temporarily depress-
ing the price of the Z good but it does not affect it in the long run. Note also that the tax reduces
the equilibrium interest rate and aggravates dynamic inefficiency in the bubbleless equilibrium, at
a cost for the economy. The intuition is transparent. A dynamically inefficient economy is charac-
terized by a scarcity of assets. A tax on inventories discourages the accumulation of inventories and
hence reduces asset supply. The interest rate has to adjust downward to clear the asset market.55

    Note that the bubbly equilibrium of the economy is not affected by τ . Moreover, if Assumption 3 is
violated, then the bubbleless equilibrium becomes identical to that of the benchmark no-inventory economy.

                                    Declining Inventories

    In this appendix we expand on a remark in Section 5 and analyze formally the consequences for
inventory accumulation of allowing the short-run and long-run elasticity of substitution between
good X and good Z to differ. In most analyses of commodity price and inventory dynamics, the
forward curve for commodity prices plays a central role. In our model, after the shock, the world
is deterministic and risk-neutral to that at date t, the forward price s periods ahead ft+s is simply
the future spot price pt+s . In our case, it will prove more convenient to reason in terms of the
log-forward curve which trace log ft+s = log pt+s as a function of maturity s.
    The decision to accumulate inventories is determined by a comparison of the slope of the log-
forward curve ṗptt of the price for the Z good with the level of the interest rate rt . The steeper
the slope of the log-forward curve for the price of the Z good, the higher the expected growth in
the price of the Z good, and the more storage is attractive. Similarly, the lower the level of the
interest rate, the more storage is attractive. The elasticity σ of the demand for the Z good is a key
parameter governing the slope of the log-forward curve. The higher σ, the flatter the log-forward
curve.
     Key to our analysis is the basic idea that the short-run elasticity of demand for commodities σ
is low in the short run but high in the long run. Let us denote by σ short the short-run elasticity and
by σ long the long-run elasticity with σ short < 1 < σ long . The switch from σ short to σ long is typically
gradual, and potentially governed by a number of time and state dependent factors. If the long-run
elasticity σ long of the demand for the Z good is high enough, then inventories will eventually be
undone. This is formalized by the following assumption.

                       g
Assumption 4        σ long   < δθ


    This assumption is more likely to be verified, the higher is σ long . When it is verified, then
the long run steady-state of the economy features no inventories. In the long run steady state,
                                                                         1
the interest rate is δθ. The price of the Z-good is given by (αXt /Z) σlong = pt and grows at rate
a g/σ long which is too low to make the accumulation of inventories worthwhile. The share of the
Z-good in total consumption converges to 0, and the economy effectively behaves as an economy
without commodities.
    Turning to transitional dynamics, imagine that the economy enters the region with σ = σ long >
1 with positive inventories It > 0. The presence of inventories affects both the goods market and the
asset market: the total intertemporal supply of the Z-good is higher which depresses the price of
the Z-good pt . Asset supply is higher since inventories act as a store of value, resulting in a higher
interest rate rt . The desire to reduce inventories can be traced back to how those two markets are

                                          I˙t     It   1 + ασp1−σ
                    I˙t = Z − αp−σ
                                t  Xt and     − g    =          t
                                                                  (θδ − rt ).
                                          Xt      Xt       pt θ

Hence a process of inventory reduction is initiated and the economy eventually converges to a
steady-state with no-inventories.
