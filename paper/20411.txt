Standard policies to correct market power and selection can be misguided when these two forces co-exist.
Using a calibrated model of employer-sponsored health insurance, we show that the risk adjustment
commonly used by employers to offset adverse selection often reduces the amount of high-quality
coverage and thus social surplus. Conversely, in a model of subprime auto lending calibrated to Einav,
Jenkins and Levin (2012), realistic levels of competition among lenders generate a significant oversupply
of credit, implying greater market power is desirable. We build a model of symmetric imperfect competition
in selection markets that parameterizes the degree of both market power and selection and use graphical
price-theoretic reasoning to provide a general analysis of the interaction between selection and imperfect
competition. We use the same logic to show that in selection markets four principles of the United
States Horizontal Merger Guidelines are often reversed.

1   Introduction
In health insurance markets, risk adjustment is increasingly used to offset the adverse selection that
occurs when consumers with higher medical costs select more generous health plans (e.g., Brown
et al., 2012). Reducing adverse selection, however, may be misguided when insurance plans have
market power. The reason is that firms facing adverse selection have an incentive to lower their
prices to encourage lower cost “young invincibles” to buy their product. Risk adjustment, precisely
because it offsets adverse selection, undermines this incentive and thus may lead to higher prices and
lower social surplus.
    Conversely, in consumer lending markets, some degree of market power can be helpful. In a per-
fectly competitive market, lenders have an incentive to reduce down-payment requirements to attract
profitable infra-marginal customers from their rivals. These lower down-payments draw in high-risk
marginal borrowers, to whom loans are socially wasteful. This means that financial deregulation to
increase competition among lenders—such as that attempted in the U.S. in the early 2000s—may
inefficiently inflate credit supply.
    Thus, selection and imperfect competition interact in rich, surprising, and potentially socially
important ways. Yet despite these features, we are unaware of any systematic analysis of imperfect
competition in selection markets. In this paper we try to fill this gap with a price-theoretic model that
builds on existing literature on both topics, and can be analyzed graphically to provide intuition.
    We start, however, by providing a more-detailed treatment of our two motivating examples. We
build a model of health plan choice and calibrate it to data on the U.S. employer-sponsored insur-
ance market. In this model, risk adjustment typically has the unintended consequence of reducing
surplus received by the firm and its workers, and often harms social welfare. To examine the effects
of market power in consumer lending, we calibrate a model of subprime auto lending to the data in
Einav, Jenkins and Levin (2012). We show that in this market, perfect competition generates a sig-
nificant oversupply of loans, providing a cost subsidy to the marginal borrower of 41%. While these
calibrations do not substitute for careful empirical analysis, they suggest the forces we highlight may
be quantitatively important.
    We next present a general model of symmetric imperfect competition in selection markets. To
abstract from a particular model of imperfect competition (such as Bertrand or Cournot), we use
the conduct parameter approach pioneered by Bresnahan (1989) and further developed in Weyl and
Fabinger (2013). Market power is indexed by a parameter θ that nests, as special cases, monopoly,
perfect competition, versions of symmetric Cournot competition (with or without conjectural varia-
tions), and differentiated products Bertrand competition.
    This one-dimensional conduct parameter approach is enabled by the assumption that consumers’
willingness-to-pay is distributed symmetrically across products. To add selection to this model, we
need to strengthen this notion of symmetry to account variation in the cost of providing the product
to consumers of different types. Following Rochet and Stole (2002) and White and Weyl (2012), we as-
sume that, at symmetric prices, all firms receive a representative sample of all consumers purchasing
the product in terms of their cost, and that a firm that cuts its price steals consumers with a similarly


                                                   1
representative distribution of costs from its competitors. We can then capture variation in the degree
of selection arising from different correlations between willingness-to-pay and costs across markets
with a single parameter σ.
    We use this model to derive comparative statics that sometimes match, and sometimes contradict,
standard intuitions:

  1. Under adverse selection, social surplus is (weakly) decreasing in market power. Adverse selec-
     tion leads to undersupply, and market power only worsens this problem.

  2. Under advantageous selection, when marginal borrowers are costlier than average borrowers,
     social surplus is inverse-U-shaped in market power. Advantageous selection leads to oversup-
     ply, thus market power is socially beneficial up to a point as it offsets the natural tendency
     towards excessive supply.

  3. Despite its direct costs, increasing the extent of adverse selection may benefit consumers, and
     even society, if market power and equilibrium quantity are both sufficiently high. This occurs
     because increased selection makes the average marginal consumer less costly to serve, thereby
     lowering price and offsetting market power.

  4. Conversely, increasing advantageous selection is beneficial if the market is sufficiently compet-
     itive or quantity is sufficiently low. This occurs because increased selection both lowers the cost
     of the average marginal consumer and directly lowers firm costs by creating a better average
     selection of purchasers.

    We also consider changes to the degree of selection that could be brought about by risk adjust-
ment. Reducing selection through risk adjustment impacts equilibrium price and quantity identically
to a reduction in the correlation between willingness-to-pay and costs. However, the effect on social
surplus is different because implementing risk adjustment is not generically budget neutral for the
risk adjuster. We extend our results to this setting and obtain similar, but often stronger, counterintu-
itive findings about the interaction between market power and selection.
    We illustrate the implications of our results by applying them to a canonical problem in compe-
tition policy: the merger to monopoly of two symmetric competitors. We show that several standard
intuitions embodied in the latest revision of the United States Horizontal Merger Guidelines (United
States Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, 2010, henceforth HMG) are partially or
fully reversed in selection markets. Advantageous selection can generate large values of “Upward
Pricing Pressure” (UPP), a standard indicator used to assess a prospective merger’s harm. Since mar-
kets with advantageous selection can have too much competition, this means that UPP can be large
exactly in settings where additional market power can be socially beneficial. As another example,
the merger guidelines caution that mergers between firms selling highly substitutable products are
likely to be particularly harmful as they greatly reduce competition. However, under advantageous
selection it is precisely when such intense competition between two firms exists that supply is likely



                                                   2
to be most excessive and thus the reduction in competition resulting from a merger potentially ben-
eficial. Thus, under advantageous selection, the more substitutable are the products, the more likely
the merger is to be beneficial.
      Our paper is closely related to Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010) and Einav and Finkelstein
(2011), who conduct a general analysis of perfectly competitive selection markets that builds on the
classical theory of a natural monopoly regulated to charge a price equal to average cost (Dupuit, 1849;
Hotelling, 1938).1 While this work has been influential, a constraint in applying the framework more
broadly is that the assumption of perfect competition is questionable in many important selection
markets.2 Perhaps because of this, existing work on imperfect competition has relied more heavily
on structural assumptions about firm and consumer behavior (e.g., Lustig, 2010; Starc, 2014).
      While the policy-relevant conclusions we highlight motivate our analysis, we view our main
contribution as providing a general understanding of the interaction between selection and imperfect
competition. To do so, we extend the price-theoretic approach of Einav and Finkelstein, conveying
our results when possible with simple graphs and verbal descriptions, with formal mathematical
statements and proofs presented in the appendix.3 In doing so we aim to build broader intuition and
provide a foundation for empirical work in a range of socially important markets.
      The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the motivating results on
health insurance and subprime lending in more detail. Section 3 presents the model and Section 4 the
main results. Section 5 presents our application to the Horizontal Merge Guidelines, and additional
results from our calibrated health insurance model. Section 6 concludes.


2     Motivating Results
In this section, we present our motivating examples of health insurance and consumer lending, using
graphs to illustrate the logic of our arguments and calibrated models to investigate their quantitative
importance. We refer the reader to Subsection 5.2 and Subsection 5.3 for additional details on the
calibrated models.


2.1    Risk Adjustment in Health Insurance

Employers in the U.S. are increasingly offering health plan choice. A standard setup includes a base
plan, with significant cost-sharing, and a number of high-quality options, with less cost-sharing and
   1 This is an application of Marshall (1890)’s observation that competitive industries with economies or diseconomies of

scale that are external to an individual firm’s production would operate identically to a monopolist regulated to charge a
price at average cost.
   2 In their survey on empirical models of insurance markets, Einav, Finkelstein and Levin (2010) write that “there has

been much less progress on empirical models of insurance market competition, or on empirical models of insurance con-
tracting that incorporate realistic market frictions. One challenge is to develop an appropriate conceptual framework.
Even in stylized models of insurance markets with asymmetric information, characterizing competitive equilibrium can be
challenging, and the challenge is compounded if one wants to allow for realistic consumer heterogeneity and market im-
perfections.” Similarly Chiappori et al. (2006) argue that “there is a crying need for . . . models . . . devoted to the interaction
between imperfect competition and adverse selection on risk.”
   3 See Weyl (2014) for a detailed discussion of price theory methodology more generally.




                                                                 3
access to a broader network of providers. At many employers, the base plan is self-insured, meaning
that the employer takes on the medical cost risk, and is free or available at a nominal employee con-
tribution (i.e, “price”). The high-quality options are often provided by profit-maximizing insurance
companies with the employer providing a subsidy and the employee paying the rest.
    A key decision for employers is how to set subsidies for the high-quality plans. Cutler and Re-
ber (1998) argue that Harvard University’s decision to provide a constant per-employee subsidy led
to an “adverse selection death spiral” and the collapse of the high-quality plan. They propose that
subsidies be risk adjusted to account for selection, and many employers—along with other health in-
surance exchanges—now implement risk adjustment schemes. However, Cutler and Reber’s model,
and other work that we are aware of on risk adjustment, assumes insurers are perfectly competitive,
which contrasts with the findings of Dafny (2010) and Dafny, Duggan and Ramanarayanan (2012) on
limited competition in the health insurance sector.4
    We argue that in the presence of market power, risk-adjusting subsidies may actually lead firms
to charge higher prices for insurance. The reason is that firms facing adverse selection, if and only if
their market power is sufficient to impact the composition of buyers in the market, have an incentive
to lower their prices to encourage lower cost “young invincibles” to buy their product. Risk adjust-
ment, precisely because it offsets adverse selection, undermines this incentive and thus may lead to higher
prices and inefficiently lower take-up.
    Figure 1 makes this point graphically. Panel (A) plots a perfectly competitive market, with P(q)
denoting inverse demand for the high-quality plan, or the willingness-to-pay as a function of the frac-
tion q of potential customers who purchase the product. The lines AC (q) and MC (q) denote the cost
(net of any subsidies paid to the high-quality plan) of the average and average marginal consumer
when a fraction q of consumers take-up the plan. Because selection is adverse, the individuals most
eager for high-quality insurance are also costliest, and the cost curves are declining in quantity. The
perfectly competitive equilibrium, where the high-quality plan earns zero profits, is characterized by
the intersection of inverse demand P and AC, and is shown as point A in the figure.
    Now consider a risk adjustment policy where the subsidy is adjusted to account for any dif-
ference between the cost of the consumers the select into the plan AC (q? ) and average cost in the
population AC (1). This corresponds to counter-clockwise rotation of the average cost curve about
its right-most point. Since average cost is downward sloping, this lowers average costs, shifting the
market to equilibrium with a lower price and higher quantity, shown by point B in the figure.
    Risk adjustment increases employee surplus because employees face a lower price. Risk adjust-
ment improves social surplus because we have depicted a setting in panel (A) where the average
marginal consumer is less costly than the population average (viz. MC < AC (1)) and therefore
lowering the price to AC (1) brings price closer to the social optimum of P = MC. Risk adjustment
reduces employer surplus because it requires providing a net subsidy of q? [ AC (q? ) − AC (1)]. How-
ever, since subsidies are passed through to employees, the employer can lower wages while attracting

Levin and Mahoney (2012), Glazer and McGuire (2000), Pauly and Herring (2000), Feldman and Dowd (1982), and Carlin
and Town (2010). In contrast, Dafny (2010) and Dafny, Duggan and Ramanarayanan (2012) show that not only is the
insurance sector highly concentrated but that recent mergers have significantly raised premiums in the market.

Note: This figure shows the effects of risk adjustment on the equilibrium price and quantity. Panel (A) shows effects

curves (P = AC). Panel (B) shows the effects under monopoly where the equilibrium is defined by the intersection of
the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves (MR = MC).


the same pool of employees, allowing it to recover this cost.
     Now suppose that this equilibrium is instead determined by the profit-maximizing behavior
of a monopolist provider, as shown in panel (B) of Figure 1.5 A monopolist maximizes profits,
q [ P(q) − AC (q)], by equating marginal revenue MR = P(q) + P0 (q)q and MC, generating the equi-
librium shown in point A in the figure. As before, risk adjustment makes all consumers equally costly,
and thus reduces the plans average costs. However, because quantity is high and thus the average
marginal consumer is less costly than the population average, risk adjustment raises the monopolist’s
marginal cost, shifting the market to an equilibrium with higher price and lower quantity, shown by
point B in the figure.6 Thus, in exchange for its subsidy, the plan raises its profits at the expense of
consumers and aggregate welfare.
     Nor is this outcome a mere theoretical possibility. In Section 5.2 we calibrate a model of health
plan choice, drawing on data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the Employer
Health Benefits Survey (EHBS). Insurance plan generosity is often characterized by the actuarial
value (AV) or the fraction of costs covered by the plan. Our model has a base plan (AV of 60%)
with an administratively set employee contribution and a number of high-quality plans (AV of 90%)
   5 Panel (B) shows demand and cost curves that give rise to the exact same equilibrium price and quantity as those in

panel (A); the two cases thus correspond to different analytic interpretations of (superficially) observationally equivalent
markets.
   6 For clarity we refer to “cost” as a property of an individual and “marginal” and “average costs” as properties of the

market. These are linked by averaging the costs of individuals to obtain market aggregates. In particular, the marginal cost
curve is the average cost of marginal consumers when a certain fraction of consumers are in the market, and the average
cost curve is the cost of average purchasers at that quantity.

where employee contributions are determined by market forces. We assume that subsidies are risk
adjusted to account for costs under the 60% AV plan and consider risk adjustment that further com-
pensates for the incremental 30% of costs of the 90% AV plan. We find that robustly over a range of
plausible parameter values, common risk adjustment policies are harmful.
    To see this visually, consider Figure 2. The vertical axis represents the degree of market power,
parameterized by an index θ proposed by Weyl and Fabinger (2013), which equals the inverse of
the number of firms in Cournot competition (θ = 1/n), for example. The horizontal axis repre-
sents the equilibrium fraction of individuals served in the market. The dots show simulated markets
constructed using data on the distribution of market power reported by Dafny, Duggan and Ra-
manarayanan (2012) and coverage rates in the EHBS. The figure shows that a significant share of
markets fall in the top-right region where risk adjustment reduces social surplus by lowering quan-
tity. Furthermore, most markets fall at least into the central region, where risk adjustment reduces
combined employer-employee surplus. Risk adjustment is thus, from the perspective of the firm and
its workers, attractive in a relatively small part of the parameter space and in a minority of markets.
    In Subsection 5.2 we provide more details on the calibration. In addition to the results on risk ad-
justment discussed above, we show that other interventions to reduce the impacts of selection, such
as risk-based pricing or decreasing the quality of consumer information (Handel, 2012), are similarly
unattractive to employer-employee surplus and often to society. Thus, we think it is plausible that
standard prescriptions to address adverse selection may be misguided because they are based on
analysis that ignores market power.

2.2    Competition and Consumer Lending

However, it is not only policies intended to address selection that can backfire in the presence of mar-
ket power. Policies aimed at addressing market power can backfire in the presences of selection. In
particular, the 2008 financial crisis highlighted the large social costs of excessive consumer credit. As
documented by Mian and Sufi (2009) and others, the pre-crisis period was marked by an increase in
generosity of loan terms to subprime borrowers—with sharply reduced down-payment requirements
and less rigorous verification of borrower income—followed in close succession by an increase in de-
fault rates and reduction in profitability. This evidence is consistent with de Meza and Webb (1987)’s
argument that average marginal borrowers, who would only borrow under reduced down-payment
and documentation requirements, being worse credit risks than the average borrower. We therefore
follow them in referring to this as “advantageous selection,” in contrast with adverse selection that
occurs when the average marginal consumer has a lower cost than the average purchaser.
      As de Meza and Webb explain, advantageous selection leads competitive markets to supply too
much credit. Lenders, eager to attract profitable inframarginal consumers but unable to effectively
screen them from less profitable marginal consumers, offer all borrowers more generous terms. A
monopolistic lender would internalize these “cream-skimming” externalities, but competitive firms
do not. This suggests that policies such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which intended to bring
“greater . . . competition in the financial services industry,” could have contributed to an inefficient
credit boom.7

 Note: This figure shows the social markup P − MC (y-axis) of the down-payment on a $10,000 car loan as a function of
 the degree of market power (x-axis). The social makeup on the down-payment is defined as the difference between the
 required down-payment amount and the cost for the marginal borrower, with a negative value indicating a subsidy to
 borrowers. The values are calibrated using the model and estimated parameters from Einav, Jenkins and Levin (2012)’s
 study of subprime auto lending.


    The economic logic behind this argument can also be demonstrated in a simple graph. Consider
the determinants of the equilibrium down-payment on a loan P, holding fixed the interest rate and
total amount borrowed. Figure 3 plots inverse demand and the average and marginal cost of supply-
ing the loan. In contrast to Figure 1, AC and MC are upward-slopping because marginal borrowers
are more costly (i.e., riskier) than inframarginal borrowers. The socially optimal level of credit is
determined by the intersection of demand and marginal cost (P = MC). At the competitive equilib-
rium where firms earns zero profits (P = AC), credit is oversupplied relative to the social optimum.
A monopolist, supplying at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MR = MC),
under-supplies credit. The social optimum thus lies between perfect competition and monopoly. In-
deed, as we show in Subsection 4.1, there is always an intermediate degree of market power that
achieves the social optimum, and an increase in market power is socially useful if it is below this
socially optimal level and harmful above it.
    Is it plausible that market power in the 2000s was below this threshold, meaning that excessive
competition contributed to an inefficient credit boom? To investigate this question we draw on data
from subprime auto lending studied by Einav, Jenkins and Levin (2012, henceforth EJL). The setting
is useful because quasi-randomization of contract terms allow for clean estimation of the underly-
ing market parameters and because the borrowers are similar in many dimensions to the subprime
mortgage borrowers that played a central role in the housing boom. Using EJL’s publicly-available
model calibrated to their proprietary data indicates extreme advantageous selection. For the modal
contract in their data (viz. a $10,000 car loan with a $1,000 minimum down-payment), EJL find that


                                                                               8
average marginal borrowers with respect to a change in the minimum down-payment default 79% of
the time compared to only 59% among average borrowers.
     The net distortion from advantageous selection can be summarized with the social markup for
the marginal borrower P − MC. Figure 4 plots the social markup (y-axis) as a function of the market
power parameter θ (x-axis). The value θ = 0.2 is a useful benchmark—with symmetric firms in
Cournot competition it corresponds to an HHI of 2,000, just above the threshold the Department
of Justice uses to define markets as highly concentrated. For θ = 0.2, the marginal borrower is
subsidized by $4,462 or 41% of the price of the car. Indeed, the marginal borrower receives a subsidy
for all θ < 0.5, or symmetric Cournot duopoly, indicating that high levels of concentration may be
desirable. Again, while our analysis should be interpreted with caution, implicit subsidies of this
magnitude could easily reverse standard prescriptions for competition policy and the design of pro-
competitive financial deregulations that do not consider selection.


3    Model
In this section, we describe a model of symmetric imperfect competition that nests monopoly, per-
fect competition and common models of imperfect competition including Cournot and differentiated
products Bertrand competition. By placing these models in a common framework, we are able to
develop results that are robust to the details of the industrial organization. Our model combines the
model of selection markets proposed by Einav, Finkelstein and Cullen (2010, henceforth EFC) and
Einav and Finkelstein (2011, henceforth EF) with the model of imperfect competition proposed by
Weyl and Fabinger (2013, henceforth WF), with suitable modifications to each to accommodate the
features of the other.
     Consider an industry with symmetric firms that provide symmetric, though not necessarily iden-
tical, products.8 When firms produce symmetric quantities, prices are given by P(q), where q ∈ [0, 1]
denotes the fraction of consumers served by the market. We do not specify the cardinality of the
firms in the market to minimize the notational burden. For most of our analysis we assume, like EF,
that individuals who do not purchase the product from the industry receive no product. However,
as we discuss in some detail in Subsection 3.3, the outside option may in some cases be an alternative
product, as emphasized by EFC.
     As in EF, and as described more formally by Weyl and Veiga (2014), total costs for the industry
are summarized by the aggregate cost function C (q), given by the linear aggregation of the cost
of all individuals served, and associated marginal and average cost functions MC (q) ≡ C 0 (q) and
            C (q)
AC (q) ≡      q .   These may be increasing or decreasing in aggregate quantity depending on whether
selection is respectively “advantageous” or “adverse.”9
     We assume that firms have no internal economies or diseconomies of scale, and thus no fixed
    8 Some consumers may favor one product over another, but there must be an equal number of consumers who have the

symmetric opposite preference.
    9 It is possible that these slopes have different signs over different ranges or that the two have slopes of different signs

over a particular range. All of these cases do not fall cleanly into one category or the other and are not our focus in what
follows. It would be interesting to extend our analysis to such cases.

costs. At a symmetric equilibrium, firms supply segments of the market that are equivalent in terms
of their distribution of costs and thus have average costs equal to AC (q).
                  Industry profits are qP(q) − C (q) = q [ P(q) − AC (q)]. A competitive equilibrium requires that
firms earn zero profits and is characterized by P(q) = AC (q). A monopolist or collusive cartel
chooses q to maximize profit by equating marginal revenue to marginal cost:

                                                       P(q) + qP0 (q) ≡ MR(q) = MC (q).

CS0 (q)
      =                 −qP0 (q).
                    Social welfare is CS(q) + qP(q) − C (q) and the first-order conditions for the
maximization of social welfare are

                                    −qP0 (q) + qP0 (q) + P(q) − MC (q) = 0 ⇐⇒ P(q) = MC (q).

Thus, the socially optimal quantity (constrained as we are throughout the paper to uniform prices) is
characterized by P(q) = MC (q).

tima in the case of “advantageous selection” where AC 0 (q) > 0 and the consumers with the highest

AC 0 (q) < 0 and the consumers with the highest willingness-to-pay are most costly.10


3.1    Imperfect Competition (θ)

We can nest the monopoly optimization and competitive equilibrium conditions into a common
framework by introducing a parameter θ ∈ [0, 1]. The parameter indexes the degree of competi-
tion in the market with θ = 0 under perfect competition and θ = 1 under monopoly. Equilibrium
prices are given by
                                   P(q) = θ [ MS(q) + MC (q)] + (1 − θ ) AC (q).                                           (1)

Below we discuss how Equation 1 is a reduced-form representation of two canonical models of im-
perfect competition. Formal derivations of these representations appear in Appendix A.

   1. Cournot: There are n symmetric firms that each choose a quantity qi > 0, taking the quantity
       chosen by other firms as given. Price is set by Walrasian auction to clear the market so that
       the price is P(q) where q = ∑i qi . If we assume that each firm gets a random sample of all
       consumers who purchase the product, then the equilibrium is characterized by Equation 1 with
             1
       θ ≡   n.   Intuitively, just as in the standard Cournot model, firms internalize their impacts on
       aggregate market conditions proportional to their market share ( n1 at equilibrium) and other-
       wise act as price- and average cost-takers. This model can easily be extended to incorporate
       conjectural variations as in Bresnahan (1989); see WF for details.

   2. Differentiated Product Bertrand: There are n single-product firms selling symmetrically differ-
       entiated products. Each firm chooses a price pi taking as given the prices of all other firms.
       Consumers have a type that determines their utility for each product and their cost. The dis-
       tribution of consumer types is symmetric in the interchange of any two products. In addition
       to these traditional assumptions of the symmetrically differentiated Bertrand model we add
       two additional assumptions proposed by White and Weyl (2012) that imply our representation
       is valid. First, the distribution of costs is orthogonal to the distribution of preferences across
       products given the highest utility a consumer can earn from any product. Second, the distribution
       of utility among the switching consumers that definitely will buy one product but are just in-
       different between any two products is identical to that among the set of all consumers who are
       currently purchasing. These two assumptions imply that the average cost of consumers that
       switch between firms in response to a small price change is the same as the average cost among
       all participating consumers.11
       In Appendix A we provide two micro-foundations for these assumptions. The first is a re-
       normalized version of the Chen and Riordan (2007) “spokes” model that generalizes Hotelling
       (1929)’s linear city model in which the dimensions of consumer’s type other than her spatial

                                                                     MC (q)− AC (q)
of the marginal distortion under perfect competition as AC 0 (q) =       q      .
  11 Even if this assumption fails, so long as average switching consumers have a cost that is strictly between that of average

exiting consumers and average purchasing consumers most of our results are left unchanged.


                                                              11
       position are orthogonal to her spatial position as in Rochet and Stole (2002). The second is a
       discrete choice, random utility model in the spirit of Anderson, de Palma and Thisse (1992)
       in which, rather than utility draws being independent across products as in Perloff and Salop
       (1985), the relative utility of different products is independent of the draw of the first-order statis-
       tic of utilities and the distribution of consumer costs is mean-independent of relative utilities
       conditional on the first-order statistic.
                                                                                     ∑ j6=i ∂Qi/∂p j
       In this case, again, our representation is valid if θ ≡ 1 − D where D ≡ −         ∂Qi/∂p        is the aggregate
                                                                                                i
       diversion ratio, which is independent of the i chosen at symmetric prices by symmetry. Note that,
       unlike in the previous case, θ will not be constant in this case; it will typically increase in price
       and thus decline in quantity (WF).


3.2    Selection (σ)

We model a change in the degree of selection as a flattening or steepening of the industry aver-
age costs curve, holding population average costs AC (1) constant. Our approach contrasts with the
approach taken by Starc (2014) in her analysis of market power and selection in the Medigap sup-
plemental insurance market. In her model, the markup of premiums over average costs depends on
the demand elasticity and an elasticity that measures the degree of adverse selection. To calculate
the counterfactual of eliminating selection, she sets this selection elasticity to zero, which results in
consumers having constant marginal costs equal to average costs at the observed equilibrium. She
finds that eliminating adverse selection in this manner raises prices and lowers consumer surplus.
      In our framework, Starc (2014)’s approach to reducing adverse selection corresponds to a coun-
terclockwise rotation of the average cost curve around the equilibrium quantity (and corresponding
shift of the marginal cost curve) until the point where marginal costs are constant and equal to aver-
age costs at the observed equilibrium value. Since marginal costs are below average costs, this causes
marginal costs to rise, accounting for Starc’s finding that eliminating selection raises equilibrium
prices. However, this rotation also raises population average costs because under adverse selection
equilibrium average costs are higher than average costs in the population. So while this exercise pro-
vides an natural accounting decomposition for markups over average costs, it does not correspond
to the standard ceteris paribus notion of changing selection (interpreted as the correlation between
willingness-to-pay and cost) holding other market primitives constant. In fact, because this rotation
leaves equilibrium average costs constant, it would leave prices constant under perfect competition,
a result that contrasts with the common intuition that, under perfect competition, adverse selection
causes prices to rise (Hendren, 2013).
      We, thus, believe that a natural benchmark is to model changes in selection as a rotation of the
average cost curve holding population average costs AC (1) fixed. We operationalize this concept by
adding a parameter σ to the model. This parameter indexes the degree of selection with σ = 0 rep-
resenting a situation in which costs are mean-independent of willingness-to-pay across individuals
with AC (q) = MC (q) = AC (1) and σ = 1 normalized to represent perfect correlation between costs
and willingness-to-pay as in the standard uni-dimensional model of heterogeneity in Akerlof (1970)

    This parametrization maps to the type of regression approach taken to estimate the degree of
selection in the empirical selection literature. Building upon work by Chiappori and Salanié (2000),
a growing literature estimates the correlation between demand and marginal costs in range of selec-
tion markets (e.g., Finkelstein and Poterba, 2004; Bundorf, Levin and Mahoney, 2012). Consider a
standard econometric model of product choice:

                                         v = βe0 + βe1 (c − µc ) + e.

Here willingness-to-pay v depends linearly on expect costs c, which are distributed normally in the
population c ∼ N (µc , Vc ), and a mean-zero
                                           idiosyncratic
                                                       taste parameter e, which is independent
                                                   2
of costs and normally distributed e ∼ N 0, Vv − β 1 Vc . In this formulation, we parameterize the
                                                  e
variance of v with Vv , rather than parameterizing the variance of e, so that the correlation between c
and v may be adjusted holding fixed the marginal distribution of v. Similarly, we normalize βe0 and
βe1 so that changing βe1 does not impact the mean of the marginal distribution of v.
    Consumers purchase the product if and only if their willingness-to-pay is greater than the price:

                               q = 1 ⇐⇒ v > p ⇐⇒ βe0 + βe1 c + e > p.

                                                                                 √         q
If we divide through by the standard deviation of the taste parameter Ve = Vv − βe21 Vc and de-
             √
fine β 2 = 1/ Vv − βe21 Vc and the coefficients β i = β 2 βei for i = 0, 1, the model can be estimated by a
Probit regression of product choice on expected costs and premiums, assuming we have a source of
exogenous variation in premiums:

                                  Pr(q = 1|c, p) = Φ( β 0 + β 1 c − β 2 p),

and the parameters µc and Vc can be estimated directly from the data: βe1 = β1/β2 and Vv = 1/β22 + βe21 Vc .
    Standard properties of the normal distribution and some algebra yield that
                                                                                                    !

we can write equilibrium conditions by replacing average costs with σAC (q) + (1 − σ) AC (1) and
marginal costs with σMC (q) + (1 − σ) AC (1) in Equation 1. Collecting terms this yields
                                     h                         i
                   P(q) = θ MS(q) + σ θMC (q) + (1 − θ ) AC (q) + (1 − σ) AC (1).                      (2)

Thus we have a representation of the first-order equilibrium condition where θ indexes the degree of
market power and σ indexes the degree of selection in the market.
    This linear interpolation between AC (1) and AC (q) or MC (q) obviously relies on the joint normal
structure of the example above. Another structure that yields the same results is if a fraction σ of the
population is drawn from some arbitrary joint distribution of cost and willingness-to-pay while a
fraction 1 − σ is drawn from the same marginal distributions of cost and willingness-to-pay but with
the two independently distributed of one another. More generally, reductions in parameterizations
of the dependence (i.e. “correlation”) between cost and willingness-to-pay, holding fixed population
average cost, often bring AC (q) and MC (q) towards AC (1) at each point, though not necessarily
linearly or proportionally. Given that all of the results in the next section depend only on this property
of moving towards AC (1) at each point, and not on the linear structure, our results apply more
generally than these examples.
    Nonetheless, we maintain this linear form in what follows both for expositional simplicity and
because it conveniently represents one of the most commonly policies used to correct the effects of
selection: risk adjustment. Medicare Advantage is a high-profile example. In the United States,
elderly individuals with government health insurance can choose to opt out of the public Traditional
Medicare (TM) program and purchase a private Medicare Advantage (MA) plan. For each enrollee,
MA plans receive a payment from the government that is supposed to equal average costs under TM,
partially risk adjusted to account for demographics and ex-ante health conditions.
    We can use our framework with one additional modification to model changes in the degree of
risk adjustment in this and other similar settings. Let 1 − σ indicate the fraction of the difference
between expected average and population average costs that is compensated for by risk adjustment.
The average risk adjustment payments in this setting are ARA(q) ≡ (1 − σ) [ AC (q) − AC (1)] with
σ = 0 indicating a setting where firms are fully compensated for any differential selection they receive
and σ = 1 indicating a setting where firms receive no risk adjustment. Firms’ perceived average costs
are the difference between their actual average costs and the average risk adjustment payments:

                          AC (q) = AC (q) − ARA(q) = σAC (q) + (1 − σ) AC (1).
                          d




                                                          14
Perceived industry marginal costs, as before, are the weighted average of marginal cost and AC (1):

                                        d (q) = σMC (q) + (1 − σ) AC (1).
                                        MC

      The effects of risk adjustment on equilibrium price and quantity—and thus consumer and pro-
ducer surplus—will be the same as a change in σ due to different correlations. However, the effect on
social surplus will be different because implementing risk adjustment in this manner is not budget
neutral. To reduce the degree of adverse selection, an exchange operator needs to make net payments
to insurance plans, and will therefore run a deficit. To reduces the degree of advantageous selection,
the exchange operator will run a surplus. As a result, social surplus depends only on whether quan-
tity moves towards the socially optimal level under the original, non-risk adjusted demand and cost
curves.


3.3    Interpretation of the Outside Option

Thus far we have focused on the case where a consumer who does not purchase from the industry
receives no product. Much of the literature considers a more general case when consumers choose
between two products of different quality levels and must choose one of the two. This has been
formulated in several ways, some of which fit our model and others which do not.
      The first setting, studied by EFC, is to view the product in the market as the incremental quality of
a high-quality product, such as supplemental insurance coverage to “top up” a low-quality base plan.
This model is fully equivalent to ours from a positive perspective. It is also equivalent from a norma-
tive perspective, so long as there are no externalities from the purchase of incremental quality on the
cost of providing the low-quality base product. Such externalities could be caused by moral hazard
in an insurance setting or by common-pool problems in a credit setting. For instance, Medigap sup-
plemental insurance, which provides incremental insurance for the deductibles and coinsurance in
the baseline Traditional Medicare, blunts patients’ incentives to control utilization, thereby imposing
an externality on baseline insurance provider (Cabral and Mahoney, 2013).
      A second, closely-related setting is when consumers choose between a high-quality product sup-
plied according to our model and low-quality, base product provided at a fixed, administratively-set
price (often zero). This is the approach employed in our motivating example on employer sponsored
health insurance in Subsection 2.1. Our model corresponds to this case if suppliers receive from the
low-quality provider baseline risk adjustment to account for consumers’ cost of service under the base-
line plan.12 This ensures that the low-quality provider is indifferent to how many customers she
retains and allows for an exclusive focus on the market for the high-quality product.
      To see what this baseline risk adjustment means, consider an example where costs under the
low-quality baseline health insurance plan are the high-quality costs scaled down by λ < 1, as would
occur with a linear actuarial rate in the absence of moral hazard (Weyl and Veiga, 2014). Let Pe(q) and
AC (q) be the high-quality plan’s price and average costs. Letting P0 be the administratively-set price
g
  12 Notethat by the neutrality of the physical incidence of taxes it is equivalent if the risk adjustment subsidy is given as
a voucher to the consumer or as a subsidy to the firm serving the consumer.

of the low-quality plan, the relevant price from the perspective our model is P = Pe − P0 , the net
                                                      AC (q) be the baseline risk adjustment payment,
price for the high-quality plan. Similarly, letting λ g
the relevant average cost is

                                          AC (q) − λ g
                                 AC (q) = g          AC (q) = (1 − λ) g
                                                                      AC (q),

which is the average cost net of baseline risk adjustment.
      Of course, baseline risk adjustment, which corresponds to σ = 1, is only one of many policies
an employer or other risk adjuster might decide to pursue. A risk adjuster could, for example, make
payments to fully account for costs under the high-quality plan or provide a flat subsidy and not risk
adjust at all. Risk adjustment to fully cover costs under the high-quality plan would correspond to a
subsidy of
                            h                i
            AC (q) + (1 − λ) g
           λg                 AC (q) − g
                                       AC (1) = Baseline Risk Adjustment + [ AC (q) − AC (1)] ,

which is full risk adjustment (σ = 0) in our model. Providing a flat subsidy equal to the population
average cost would correspond to
                      h                 i                                                 λ
   AC (1) = λ g
  λg                     AC (1) − g
              AC (q) + λ g        AC (q) = Baseline Risk Adjustment −                        [ AC (q) − AC (1)] .
                                                                                         1−λ

This can be thought about as negative risk adjustment in our model of an amount                  1− λ   or

                                                      λ     1
                                           σ = 1+        =     > 1.
                                                     1−λ   1−λ

      A final approach, adopted by Cutler and Reber (1998) and Handel, Hendel and Whinston (2014),
is to allow both the prices of the high-quality and baseline product to be endogenous. Extending this
approach to imperfect competition is more problematic, as it would require either an asymmetric
treatment of the two plans or an equilibrium model where both plans are imperfectly competitively
supplied. Such a model is an interesting direction for future research, but sufficiently different from
our analysis here that we view it as beyond the scope of our work.13


3.4    Technical Notes

In the next section, we study equilibria characterized by Equation 2. To ensure a unique equilibrium
exists, we impose global stability conditions that, while not necessary for our results, simplify the
analysis. In particular we assume that P0 < min{ AC 0 , MC 0 , 0} and MR0 < min{ MC 0 , 0}. Under
these conditions there is a unique equilibrium for a constant value of θ, the case we focus on below.
While θ is not constant in the Bertrand case, all of our results below can be extended to the case
of non-constant θ with appropriately generalized stability conditions at the cost of some notational
  13 See Weyl and Veiga for a more detailed discussion of the relationship among these models under perfect competition
and Veiga and Weyl (2014) for an alternative model of imperfect competition in selection markets with endogenous product
quality.

4     Results
In this section, we present results on the welfare effects of (i) market power in industries with selec-
tion and conversely (ii) selection in industries with market power. To do so, we build on the notation,
equilibrium and stability conditions of the previous section. To ease the exposition, all propositions
are stated verbally. When possible, the results are illustrated graphically assuming linear demand
and costs, and often focusing on the extreme cases of monopoly and perfect competition. Formal
statements and proofs of all results appear in Appendix C.


4.1    Imperfect Competition

Proposition 1. Market power increases producer surplus and decreases consumer surplus

      As firms gain market power, they increasingly internalize the impact of their output decisions on
equilibrium price and quantity. This leads them to raise their price so long as price slopes downward
more quickly than does average cost (AC 0 > P0 ), as implied by our stability assumptions. This inter-
nalization directly leads to higher producer surplus. The higher price that results reduces consumer
surplus by the logic of the envelope condition.

Proposition 2. Under adverse selection, social surplus falls with market power. Anytime a market would
collapse as a result of adverse selection no monopolist would choose to operate.

      With perfect competition, adverse selection leads to too little equilibrium quantity, as shown in
Panel (B) of Figure 5. Since market power reduces quantity, market power only further reduces social
surplus. An implication is that if the market collapses under perfect competition (Akerlof, 1970), and
therefore the market generates no social surplus, no amount of market power will restore the market
and enable it to contribute to aggregate welfare (Dupuit, 1844).
      Thus, at least under adverse selection, standard intuitions about the undesirability of market
power are confirmed. However, while these results are in this sense unsurprising, they contrast with
intuitions in the contract theory literature that market power may be beneficial under adverse selec-
tion. For example, Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) argue that imperfect competition may be necessary
to sustain the existence of markets under adverse selection when non-price product characteristics
are endogenous, and Veiga and Weyl (2014) show that imperfect competition can indeed restore the
first-best, albeit in a stylized model. However, these analyses focus on the impacts of market power
on product quality rather than on the fraction of individuals supplied. Our analysis indicates a trade-
off between these quality benefits of market power and its quantity harms.14
   14 In one extension of their baseline model, Veiga and Weyl consider a calibrated model that allows for both effects and

find that an intermediate degree of market power is able to achieve welfare near the first-best and that even market power
approaching monopoly leads to much higher welfare than does perfect competition. This suggests that, at least in some
settings, the quality benefits may be more important than the quantity harms we emphasize here.

 Note: This figure shows that under advantageous selection, there is a socially optimal degree of market power strictly
 between monopoly and perfect competition. The monopoly optimum (MR = MC) results in too little quantity, while
 perfect competition (P = AC) results in too much. There is intermediate level of market power θ ∗ , leading to an equi-
 librium θ ∗ MR + (1 − θ ∗ ) P = θ ∗ MC + (1 − θ ∗ ) AC, that results in the same equilibrium level of quantity as the socially
 optimum (P = MC).


     Under advantageous selection our analysis more directly contradicts conventional intuitions on
the impact of market power.

Proposition 3. Under advantageous selection, social surplus is inverse-U-shaped in market power. There is a
socially optimal degree of market power strictly between monopoly and perfect competition. Additional market
power is socially beneficial below this level and socially harmful if it is above this level. The optimal degree of
market power is increasing in the degree of advantageous selection.

     Perfect competition leads to excessive output under advantageous selection because, in an at-
tempt to skim the cream from their rivals, competitive firms draw higher marginal cost consumers
into the market (de Meza and Webb, 1987). On the other hand, a monopolist, who internalizes the
industry cost and revenue curves, will produce too little. As a result, there is an intermediate degree
of market power that leads to the optimal quantity being produced.
     Figure 6 shows this result graphically. The monopoly equilibrium, determined by MR = MC,
results in too little quantity. The perfectly competitive equilibrium, determined by P = AC, results in
too much. An intermediate level of market power θ = θ ∗ , which leads to the equilibrium determined
by θ ∗ MR + (1 − θ ∗ ) P = θ ∗ MC + (1 − θ ∗ ) AC, results in the same equilibrium level of quantity as the
equilibrium achieved by setting P = MC and is therefore socially optimal. Because advantageous
selection always pushes firms towards excessive production, the degree of market power required to
offset this selection and restore optimality increases with the extent of advantageous selection.

4.2    Selection

We begin our analysis of selection by considering the impact of changes in the degree of correlation
between willingness to pay and cost. Because the degree of correlation is a property of a market, and
not the result of a policy intervention, these results apply most directly to comparative statics across
markets rather than the impacts of policy interventions.15 Our results are easiest to state verbally for
the cases of monopoly and perfect competition. We thus confine our attention to these extreme cases.
Results for intermediate cases are an interpolation between these extremes and are stated and proved
in the formalization of these propositions in Appendix C.

Proposition 4. Under monopoly, reducing the degree of adverse selection raises profits but can raise or lower
consumer surplus. Less adverse selection harms consumers when demand is high (q? > q). If demand is very
   15 For example, Hendren (2013) compares outcomes in markets with different degrees of correlation under the assump-

tion of perfect competition; our comparative statics with respect to σ would allow such analysis to be extended to imper-
fect competition. Hendren’s analysis focuses on markets with very low quantities where the impact of reducing selection
is similar, according to our results, to that under perfect competition. However, our results in Section 5.2 suggest that the
presence of a realistic degree of market power could substantially alter comparative statics results like his in markets where
quantity is sufficiently high.



                                                             19
high (q? > q > q), and the monopolist’s pass-through is bounded above zero, less adverse selection lowers both
consumer and social surplus.

     Figure 7 shows the effect of reducing the degree of adverse selection in the market. Panels in
the left column show the scenario in which is there is adverse selection and thus the average and
marginal cost curves are downward sloping. Panels in the right column show the effect of reducing
the degree of adverse selection, depicted by a counter-clockwise rotation of the average cost curve
around the point AC (1) and a corresponding shift in the marginal cost curve. The resulting average
and marginal costs curves are horizontal and have unchanged population average costs (AC (1) is
the same). Panels in the top row show the effect of this shift when the equilibrium quantity is low
(q∗ < q) and panels in the bottom row show the effect when the profit-maximizing quantity is high
(q∗ > q).16
     When the equilibrium quantity is low, the reduction in selection lowers the cost of the average
marginal consumer. This lowers the price and raises equilibrium quantity. When the equilibrium
quantity is high, the reduction in selection raises the cost of the average marginal consumer, raising
the price and lowering equilibrium quantity. In this setting with linear costs, reducing the degree of
selection raises quantity whenever the profit-maximizing quantity is less than q = 12 . More generally,
reducing the degree of adverse selection reduces prices and increases quantity whenever the popula-
tion average consumer has a cost lower than the average marginal consumer at the profit-maximizing
level of quantity.
     By the envelope theorem, we can determine the effect of a reduction in adverse selection on a mo-
nopolist’s profits holding fixed the quantity the monopolist optimally chooses. Because a reduction
in selection lowers average costs, as those participating in the market are selected adversely, producer
surplus is necessarily increased. A reduction in the degree of adverse selection can lower welfare if
the reduction in consumer surplus is large enough to offset the increase in firm profits. This only
happens when profit-maximizing quantity is sufficiently high because in this case both the increase
in marginal cost is large and the change in average cost is small, as the firm’s average consumers are
nearly representative of the whole population. The weight placed on the former effect relative to the
latter effect in welfare terms is the monopolist’s pass-through rate, so it must be bounded above zero
at high quantities for the result to hold.
     When there is advantageous selection, the conditions under which a decrease in the degree of
selection raises consumer surplus are reversed.

Proposition 5. Under monopoly, reducing the degree of advantageous selection lowers a monopolist’s profits
but can raise or lower consumer surplus. Less advantageous selection benefits consumers when demand is high
(q? > q). If demand is very high (q? > q > q) and the monopolist’s pass-through is bounded away from zero,
less advantageous selection raises both consumer and social surplus.
  16 Ofcourse, anything that impacts equilibrium quantities must do so by shifting the demand or supply curve. The
necessary thresholds for these effects, q and q, can be defined as a function of the cost curves. We then interpret high and
low quantities in terms of vertical shifts of the demand curve that thus vertically shift the marginal revenue curve without
changing its shape.

                                                                                     21
      The graphs for this scenario are analogous to those for adverse selection and are shown in Ap-
pendix Figure A1. Reducing the degree of advantageous selection rotates the average cost curve
around AC(1) in a clockwise direction. When the profit-maximizing quantity is low (q? < q), this
rotation increases the cost of the average marginal consumer, raising prices and lowering equilib-
rium quantity. When the profit-maximizing quantity is high (q? > q), the reduction in the degree of
selection lowers the cost of the average marginal consumer, lowering prices and increasing quantity.
A reduction in advantageous selection lowers industry profits by the same envelope logic discussed
above. Reduced advantageous selection lowers welfare except when quantity is sufficiently high, in
which case the increase in consumer surplus outweighs the decrease in firm profits.
      Panels (B) and (C) of Table 1 summarize these results on the effects of selection in settings with
market power. The results under adverse and advantageous selection can be understood together
by noticing that a reduction in the degree of selection lowers the component of cost heterogeneity in
the population correlated to willingness-to-pay, moving average individuals at any willingness-to-
pay quantile q towards the population average cost. Because the monopolist internalizes the costs of
the average marginal consumer, reducing selection will reduce this marginal cost exactly when the
average marginal consumer is more costly than the population average consumer. Under adverse
selection the average marginal consumer has higher cost at lower quantity and under advantageous
selection the average marginal consumer has higher cost at higher quantity. Therefore, the benefits
from reducing selection occur at low equilibrium quantities under adverse selection and high equi-
librium quantities under advantageous selection.

Proposition 6. Under perfect competition, reducing the degree of adverse selection raises consumer surplus
and is socially beneficial. Reducing the degree of advantageous selection lowers consumer surplus and is socially
harmful. Producer surplus is always zero under perfect competition.

      Under perfect competition, firms make no profits and thus the effect of selection on welfare is
driven entirely by consumer surplus or equivalently prices. If consumers are adversely selected,
consumers are always more costly than the population average, and therefore reducing the degree
of selection always lowers average costs and prices, making consumers and society better off. If
consumers are advantageously selected, then by the same logic, reducing the degree of selection
raises average costs and prices, and reduces consumer and social surplus.


4.3    Risk Adjustment

We next consider the impact of risk adjustment, which, as discussed in the previous section, has the
same positive impacts as changing correlations but different normative implications.

Proposition 7. Under monopoly and assuming demand is strictly log-concave and satisfies a weak regularity
condition, using risk adjustment to eliminate adverse selection has effects that are defined by the thresholds q0
and q > q0 , where q is defined exactly as in Proposition 4. The equilibrium quantity q? is defined as its value
after risk adjustment.

Note: This figure shows the effects of risk adjustment of adverse selection in a market served by a monopolist provider.
Panel (A) shows a setting where full risk adjustment reduces price below the original marginal cost, leading to socially
excess quantity. Panel (B) shows a setting where full risk adjustment is beneficial but insufficient to achieve the social
optimal level of quantity. Panel (C) shows a setting where risk adjustment raises marginal costs perceived by the firm,
lowering quantity and social welfare.




                                                                                        23
      1. If q? < q0 then there is an interior optimal quantity of risk adjustment that achieves the socially optimal
         quantity. Social welfare is increasing in risk adjustment below this threshold and decreasing above it.

      2. If q0 ≤ q? < q then welfare is monotonically increasing in risk adjustment and full risk adjustment
         achieves the socially optimal quantity if and only if q? = q0 .

      3. If q? ≥ q then risk adjustment is weakly socially harmful, and is strictly socially harmful if the inequality
         is strict.

If demand is not log-concave (or violates the regularity condition) it may be that q0 = 0 so that behavior 1)
above is irrelevant or that there are multiple thresholds between 1) and 2), but one or the other always occurs
when q? < q.

       Figure 8 graphically depicts these results for the different quantity ranges. The results are also
summarized in Panel (A) of Figure 9. Social surplus depends on whether quantity is moved towards
the socially optimal level under the original, non-risk adjusted demand and cost curves. Since monopoly
results in too little quantity, risk adjustment that increases quantity is beneficial, so long as it does not
increase quantity beyond the socially optimal level.
       Panel (A) shows a setting where q? < q0 . In this case, risk adjustment is initially beneficial, but
full risk adjustment reduces price below the original marginal cost, leading to socially excess quantity.
Intuitively, this occurs at low quantity because this is where (under log-concavity) the monopoly
distortion MS(q∗ ) is smallest and where risk adjustment has the biggest effect on reducing perceived
marginal costs. Panel (B) shows a setting where q0 ≤ q? < q and where full risk adjustment is always
beneficial but insufficient to achieve the social optimal level of quantity. Indeed, in this setting it
would be optimal for the exchange operator to make excess transfers to the firms. Panel (C) shows
a setting where q? ≥ q, and risk adjustment raises marginal costs perceived by the firm, lowering
quantity and thereby reducing social welfare.

Proposition 8. Under monopoly and assuming that MS0 − MC 0 is globally signed, using risk adjustment to
eliminate advantageous selection has effects that are defined by the thresholds q and q00 > q, where q is defined
as in Proposition 5. The equilibrium quantity q? is defined as its value after risk adjustment.

      1. If q? ≤ q then risk adjustment is weakly harmful, and is strictly socially harmful if the inequality is
         strict.

      2. If q < q? ≤ q00 then welfare is monotonically increasing in risk adjustment and full risk adjustment
         achieves the socially optimal quantity if and only if q? = q00 .

      3. If q? > q00 then there is an interior optimal quantity of risk adjustment that achieves the socially optimal
         quantity. Social welfare is increasing in risk adjustment below this threshold and decreasing above it.

The threshold q00 may equal 1 in which case the last region irrelevant; this occurs if and only if MC (1) <
AC (1) + MS(1). If MS0 − MC 0 is not globally signed there may be back-and-forth between behaviors 2) and
3).

 Note: This figure summarizes the effects of risk adjustment for different ranges of the post-risk adjustment equilibrium
 level of quantity q? . Panel (A) shows these ranges in an adversely selected market. Panel (B) shows these ranges in an
 advantageously selected market.


    The results under advantageous selection are analogous to those under adverse selection with
the regions reversed and are summarized in Panel (B) of Figure 9. When q? ≤ q, quantity is below
the socially optimal level and risk adjustment further reduces quantity. When q < q? ≤ q00 , risk
adjustment increases quantity but is insufficient to achieve the socially optimal level. When q? > q00 ,
there is an intermediate level of risk adjustment that increases quantity to the socially optimal level.
    Under perfect competition, some risk adjustment is always beneficial although as before too
much risk adjustment can sometimes be detrimental.

Proposition 9. Under perfect competition and either adverse or advantageous selection:

   • If q? < q then there is an interior optimal quantity of risk adjustment achieving the socially optimal
      quantity and social welfare increases in risk adjustment below and decreases in risk adjustment above
      this threshold.

   • If q? ≥ q then welfare is strictly increasing in the quantity of risk adjustment. Full risk adjustment
      achieves the socially optimal quantity if and only if q? = q.

    Risk adjustment, at least initially, moves average cost towards marginal cost and thus moves
quantity towards the social optimum. However, when q? < q it may overshoot. Under adverse
selection, this occurs because AC (1) is below MC (q? ). When q? > q, even full risk adjustment is

                                                           25
insufficient. Under adverse selection, this occurs because AC (1) is above MC (q? ). When q? = q then
full risk adjustment exactly achieves the socially optimal quantity.
      In Subsection 3.3 we discussed a model where negative risk adjustment (σ > 1) is possible. Local
to a small amount of risk adjustment, negative risk adjustment has precisely the opposite effect of
positive risk adjustment. More globally there are various regions in terms of q where different effects
may occur. In the interests of brevity, rather than cataloging these results, we here simply discuss an
example that will prove relevant in our application in Subsection 5.2.
      Consider negative risk adjustment in the case of monopoly when q? > q, so that locally negative
risk adjustment is beneficial. If the social optimum involves full coverage (as it will in our appli-
cation), then any amount of negative risk adjustment is (weakly) beneficial as it always increases
quantity. If the social optimum involves partial coverage then there is a socially optimal amount of
negative risk adjustment (σ? > 1) that achieves the social optimum and further negative risk adjust-
ment leads to excessive insurance coverage.

4.4     Other Forces Impacting Selection

Correlation and risk adjustment are only two of many forces that impact the extent of selection. Other
commonly-discussed factors are changes in consumers’ knowledge of their own costs (Handel and
Kolstad, 2014) and changes in the permitted extent of risk-based pricing (Finkelstein and Poterba,
2006). Unlike the micro-foundations above, these interventions will not only result in a change in the
cost curves but will also shift the demand curves. In the first case, this is because greater knowledge
by consumers of their health risks will shift the distribution of willingness-to-pay for insurance. In
the second case, characteristics that are used to price risk can also be used to price discriminate.
      Because accounting for such effects requires a different analytical approach than the one we
adopt here, we do not treat these forces generally. Instead, we consider specific examples that il-
lustrate possible and plausible cases. First, in Appendix B, we show the discrimination allowed by
risk-based pricing can offset or even reverse the results we derived above about the effects of selec-
tion under market power. Second, in Subsection 5.2, we use our calibrated model of the insurance
market to study the impact of these changes. We find that allowing this price discrimination effect or
consumer misinformation actually strengthens our main results, especially our most counterintuitive
result that eliminating adverse selection may harm consumers.17


5      Applications
5.1     Merger Analysis

In this subsection we discuss how the results we developed above should change approaches to a
classic area of competition policy: the welfare evaluation of a merger. In particular, we examine a
    17 However, as discussed in Subsection 5.2, price discrimination will typically increase social welfare (Fabinger and Weyl,

2014a) and thus will not tend to generate the counter-intuitive social surplus results if one accounts for the payments made
by the government for risk adjustment. Poorly informed consumers may reinforce or mitigate this effect depending on
how welfare is evaluated.


                                                              26
number of central principles articulated in the most recent revision of the United States Horizontal
Merger Guidelines (United States Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, 2010) and
show that many qualitative findings are altered or reversed in an industry with selection.
    To facilitate the analysis, we focus on a symmetrically differentiated Bertrand industry in which
a potential merger changes the industry from a duopoly to a monopoly. This is not intended to be
a realistic applied merger model, but simply to illustrate our argument in the cleanest and simplest
case, which has also been emphasized in previous theoretical merger analysis (Werden, 1996; Farrell
and Shapiro, 2010a).

  1. Price-raising incentives are harmful: A basic principle of merger analysis is that the stronger are
     firms’ incentives to raise prices as a result of a merger, the more suspect antitrust authorities
     should be of the merger. However, to the extent that the incentive to raise prices is stronger
     because of selection, rather than because of demand-side substitution patterns, mergers are
     likely to be more beneficial the stronger the incentive to raise prices.
     To see this, consider the “first-order” incentive of a firm to raise prices after a merger (Farrell
     and Shapiro, 2010a; Jaffe and Weyl, 2013), or “Upward Pricing Pressure” (UPP), measured by
     the externality a firm imposes on its rivals when it increases its sales by one (infinitesimal) unit.
     When a firm increases its sales by one unit, it diverts D units from its rivals, where D is the
     aggregate diversion ratio. In a market without selection, the markup associated with this unit
     is M = P − MC so that the sale exerts a negative externality on its rivals of DM = D ( P − MC ).
     Suppose we naïvely calculate this object in a selection market. In a market with selection, the
     marginal cost perceived by an individual firm is

                       d (q) = σ ( D (q) AC (q) + [1 − D (q)] MC (q)) + (1 − σ) AC (1),
                       MC

     so one would then compute

                  DM = D ( P − MC
                               d ) = ( P − σ [ DAC + (1 − D ) MC ] − (1 − σ) AC (1)) ,

     where we have dropped arguments when possible for notational simplicity.
     In selection markets, this term does not capture the externality imposed by a firm on it rivals.
     Instead, our assumption that switching consumers are representative of all consumers and have
     costs given by AC means that the incremental profit from this unit is P − σAC − (1 − σ) AC (1)
     and the sale creates a negative externality on rivals of D [ P − σAC − (1 − σ) AC (1)]. As a result,
     the relevant UPP in selection markets is

     UPP in Selection Markets = D [ P − σAC − (1 − σ) AC (1)] =
                                 = D ( P − σ [ DAC + (1 − D ) MC ] − (1 − σ) AC (1)) + σD (1 − D ) ( MC − AC )
                                 = Standard UPP + σD (1 − D ) ( MC − AC ) ,



                                                   27
  which is the standard measure plus an additional term σD (1 − D )( MC − AC ).
  It is this additional term which reverses the standard logic. Increased advantageous selection
  (larger σ when MC > AC) creates more upward pricing pressure, yet is precisely the setting
  where market power can be a desirable check on cream-skimming externalities. Conversely,
  greater adverse selection (raising σ when MC < AC) reduces upward pricing pressure but, at
  the same time, is the setting where market power is most harmful because it further distorts
  the incentive to price above marginal cost. Thus, to the extent that it is selection rather than
  changes in D or M that generate upward pricing pressure, a merger is actually most desirable
  when pricing pressure is large rather than small. For the rest of this subsection, we assume
  σ = 1.

2. Competition-reduction is harmful: A second principle of merger analysis is when the merging
  firms’ products are close substitutes, antitrust authorities should be suspect of the merger.
  However, in settings with advantageous selection, mergers between firms producing highly sub-
  stitutable products are exactly the settings in which there may be too much competition and
  increases in market power may be beneficial.
  This point can be seen using the UPP framework discussed above. In standard analysis, a
  larger value of D suggests the merger is more problematic because it leads to a larger value of
  UPP = D ( P − MC ). However, recall that D = 1 − θ and that under advantageous selection
  social surplus is inverse-U-shaped in market power. Thus if D is sufficiently small, and as a
  result θ = 1 − D is larger than the optimal level θ ∗ , the resulting merger will further increase θ
  above its optimal level, and always be harmful. And if D is very large, and as a result θ = 1 − D
  is smaller than θ ∗ , the resulting merger will reduce cream-skimming externalities, and may
  be desirable. Thus, while under adverse selection the standard intuition is still valid, under
  advantageous selection mergers may be socially beneficial (absent other efficiencies) if and only
  if D is large enough.

3. Marginal costs should be used to calculate markups: A third principle of merger analysis is that
  a firm’s marginal cost, rather than average cost, should be used to assess the incentive they
  will have to raise prices upon merging. However, in selection markets, recall that the valid
  UPP is D ( P − AC ) and not D ( P − [ DAC + (1 − D ) MC ]). Thus, if we want to use the simple
  formula suggested by Farrell and Shapiro (2010a) to calculate UPP, we should use average cost
  not marginal cost to calculate firms’ markups.
  This result is partly an artifact of our assumption that firms have additive costs across con-
  sumers, which is analogous to firms having linear (i.e., constant marginal) costs in a standard
  market. Accounting for firm-level (dis)economies of scale from forces other than selection
  would require an adjusted notion of marginal cost. Nonetheless, even in this case, firm-level
  marginal costs would be inappropriate for predicting UPP. And, if selection is the primary
  source of non-linear cost, average cost will be more accurate in predicting UPP than the stan-
  dard notion of marginal cost.


                                               28
   4. Demand data is preferable to administrative data: As a result of the focus on marginal costs, demand
        side data is often preferred to administrative data to evaluate the impact of a potential merger
        (Nevo, 2001). The reason is that marginal costs are hard to measure from firm administrative
        data (Laffont and Tirole, 1986). Therefore, a standard approach to measuring marginal costs
        suggested by Rosse (1970) is to use demand-side data to estimate the firm’s markup and re-
        cover marginal costs from first-order conditions. For example, Nevo backs out markups from a
        structural model of pricing of cereals and uses these to conduct a merger analysis (Nevo, 2000).
        However, in markets with selection, the demand-driven approach identifies the markup in

                                         D ( P − [ DAC + (1 − D ) MC ])

        and not the relevant markup over average cost needed to calculate D ( P − AC ). Indeed, in
        selection markets, demand data is insufficient, and it is necessary to have administrative data
        that reveals P and AC to calculate valid UPP. This implies that the administrative data obtained
        in recent studies of selection markets (cf. Einav, Finkelstein and Levin, 2010) are likely to be
        useful not only for the measurement of selection but also for antitrust policy.

      Our discussion above focuses on the lowest-hanging fruit that can be derived from extending the
canonical model. Many other standard antitrust intuitions, both within and beyond merger policy,
should be reexamined in markets where selection is an important concern.


5.2     Health Insurance

In this subsection, we return to the calibrated model of health insurance choice, introduced in Section
2. In additional to quantifying the effects of risk adjustment on welfare, we also examine the effects
of other polices that could be used to impact selection, such as risk-based pricing and decision-aides
that could change a consumer’s knowledge of their costs under a given health plan.


5.2.1    Calibrated Model

We build a model of health insurance choice that matches key features of the U.S. employer-sponsored
health insurance market., focusing in particular on individual health plans with a duration of one
year. We assume that consumers are expected utility maximizers with constant absolute risk aver-
sion (CARA) preferences. Consumers are heterogeneous in their absolute risk aversion, denoted α,
and their health-type, denoted λ, which we assume are jointly log-normally distributed according to
                                        "        # "                  √      #!
                           ln α             µα             Vα     ρα,λ Vα Vλ
                                  ∼N              ,        √          √         .
                           ln λ             µλ         ρα,λ Vα Vλ       Vλ

      Consumers with health-type λ are exposed to a distribution of shocks with realized values c.
We assume that consumers health type and health outcomes are jointly log-normally distributed

This implies that a consumer’s realized health risk, conditional on their health-type, is distributed
according to
                                                   s                                         !

     The choice set of health plans is meant to resemble those offered by a large firm. There are a
number of symmetrically differentiated high-quality plans, such as Health Maintenance Organiza-
tion (HMO) or Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans, which are supplied by private insur-
ance companies, and have premiums determined by market forces. We define the outside option as
a low-quality plan, which is provided by the employer and has a premium fixed at zero. This is a
reasonable characterization of many High Deductible Health Plans (HDHP), which tend to be “self-
insured,” meaning that the employer bares the medical cost risk, and have administratively set at
premiums that are typically zero or a nominal amount.18
     As discussed in Subsection 3.3, we can fit our model to this setting by defining the products in
the market as the movement from the baseline to the high-quality plan. Let P be the incremental
premium of the high quality plan ( Pe − P0 ), and let the functions c H = κ H (c) and c L = κ L (c) describe
a consumer’s out-of pocket costs under the high- and low-quality plans. The willingness-to-pay v
for moving to the high-quality plan is the value that equates the consumer’s expected utility with the
high-quality plan to that with the outside option, defined implicitly by

                               Ec [u(−κ H (c) − v)|α, λ] = Ec [u(−κ L (c))|α, λ].

Consumers purchase the high-quality plan if and only if their willingness-to-pay is greater than the
premium (q = 1 ⇐⇒ v ≥ P). The distribution of willingness-to-pay provides us with inverse
demand and marginal revenue curves for the industry according to the standard identities.19
     To model industry costs, we assume that the employer pays the private plans the baseline risk-
adjusted subsidy for each consumer, that is one equal to that consumer’s expected costs in the low-
quality plan. Average costs perceived by the high-quality providers are then AC (q) = Ec [c − κ H (c)|v ≥ P(q)] −
Ec [c − κ L (c)|v ≥ P(q)] and marginal costs are MC (q) ≡ AC 0 (q)q + AC (q). As shown in Section 3,
equilibrium price for the high-quality plan is determined by Equation 2:
                                               h                           i
                               P(q) = θ MS(q) + θ MC (q) + (1 − θ ) AC (q)

  18 Inthe KFF EHBS, 56% of HDHP are self-insured. Twenty-three percent of HDHP are free, and 56% require employee
payments of less than $50 per month.

in our calibration.


Calibration. We calibrate the distributions of risk aversion using values from the literature and the
distribution of health types and medical spending using values from the 2009 Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey (MEPS). Table 2 summarizes the exact calibrated variables. Below we discuss the cali-
brated values in more detail.

    • Risk aversion (α). We calibrate the distribution of absolute risk aversion to the values estimated
      by Handel, Hendel and Whinston (2014), which are identified using over-time variation in the
      choice set of health insurance plans offered to employees at a large firm. These values are
      similar to those estimated by Cohen and Einav (2007). The mean value of α = 0.000439 implies
      indifference between a 50-50 gamble for {$100, −$96} and $0 with certainty.

    • Realized costs (c). We calibrate the distribution of realized medical costs c to match the pop-
      ulation mean and standard deviation of medical spending for non-elderly individuals in the
      2009 MEPS, excluding individuals with coverage from a public program such as Medicaid. The
      mean level of spending for this sample is $3,139 and the standard deviation in $10,126.

    • Health-type (λ). To calibrate the degree of private information, we assume that consumers
      knowledge of their future health costs is the same as that which can be predicted by standard
      risk adjustment software.20 The 2009 MEPS provides information on individual’s Relative Risk
      Scores, which is calculated using the Hierarchical Clinical Classification (HCC) model that is
      also used to risk adjust Medicare Advantage payments.

    • Correlation between risk aversion and health-type (ρα,λ ). We assume that risk aversion and health
      risk are uncorrelated in the population. This is probably a reasonable assumption given the
      diverging estimates of the sign of this correlation in the literature.

    • Correlation between realized costs and health-type (ρλ,c ). Following our model, we estimate the
      correlation ρλ,c with a regression of log realized health costs on the log Relative Risk Score,
      where both variables are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard
      deviation. We estimate a coefficient of ρλ,c = 0.498. This estimate, combined with information
      on the mean and standard deviation of the Relative Risk Scores and realized costs, allows us to
      simulate the joint distributions of λ and c.

    • Cost-sharing (κ H (c) and κ L (c)). We calibrate the cost-sharing of the high-quality plan to cover
      90% of the cost of medical care in the population on average, known as a 90% actuarial value
      (AV) plan. This is the level of coverage provided by a “platinum” plan on an Affordable Care
      Act (ACA) Health Insurance Marketplace. We calibrate the low-quality plan to have an 60% AV,
  20 This assumption follows standard practice in the literature (Handel, 2012; Handel, Hendel and Whinston, 2014) and is

supported by the finding from Bundorf, Levin and Mahoney (2012) of little private information conditional on an industry
standard measure of predicted health risk.


                                                           31
        which is typical for an HDHP, and would qualify as a “bronze” plan on an ACA Marketplace.
        The AV 90% plan has no deductible, 10% co-insurance, and an $8,000 out-of-pocket maximum.
        The AV 60% plan has a $500 deductible, 40% coinsurance, and an $8,000 out-of-pocket maxi-
        mum.

     • Market power (θ). We calibrate the level of market power to θ = 0.5. This corresponds to Cournot
        competition with two high-quality plans. While this is significantly higher than the represen-
        tative values we discussed in Subsection 2.1, we focus on this value for two reasons. First, in
        the EHBS, less than 1% of firms offer more than two non-HDHP options; thus the market-wide
        concentration indices derived from Dafny, Duggan and Ramanarayanan (2012)’s data may un-
        derstate effective market power. Second, with greater market power our results are more visi-
        ble. However, as we showed above for the case of risk adjustment, they are qualitatively true
        even with lower market power.

5.2.2    Results

Figure 10 shows the calibrated model graphically. Panel (A) shows the baseline equilibrium with the
degree of selection that results from the calibration (σ = 1). Panel (B) shows the equilibrium from
an alternative calibration where we keep the demand curve unchanged and reduce the variation of


                                                            32
health type λ, holding constant population average costs under the insurance contract.21 Because de-
mand is that same and there is less variation in costs, this exercise implements the same reduction in
the degree of correlation between willingness-to-pay and costs that we explored theoretically. Panel
(C) shows the equilibrium where an exchange operator implements full risk adjustment (σ = 0) so
that consumers have constant marginal costs equal to the population average. Panel (D) shows an
equilibrium with partial negative risk adjustment: in particular the exchange operator risk adjusts
subsidies by an equal and opposite amount to the full risk adjustment payments (σ = 2).22
     In the baseline scenario with no risk adjustment, premiums are $1,790 and 79.6% of the popula-
tion purchases a high-quality plan. Because marginal costs are below average population costs at this
equilibrium, reducing the degree of correlation increases the cost of the marginal consumer, raising
premiums to $1,820 and reducing quantity to 78.7%. Eliminating selection by means of perfect risk
adjustment further raises the price and reduces the quality provided by the market. Negative risk
adjustment, on the other hand, reduces premiums to $1,682 and raises quantity to 84.1%.
     Table 3 examines the normative implications of these counterfactuals. All values are presented as
a percentage of the first best total surplus under the baseline scenario. Under the baseline scenario,
shown in the first column, imperfect competition and selection combine to reduce total surplus to
85.7% of the first best level. Producers capture slightly less than half of this surplus, while employees
capture the remainder. By raising prices, reduced correlations, shown in the second column, lowers
employee surplus by 1.4 percentage points of the total surplus at the social optimum. Profits increase
by 3.7 percentage points due to the lower costs of providing coverage, more than offsetting the decline
in employee surplus and raising total surplus provided by the market. These results are consistent
with Proposition 4 in the setting where optimal quantity takes a high, but not very high, value (i.e.,
q > q? > q).
     Full risk adjustment, shown in column 3, exacerbates the effects of reducing correlations on em-
ployee surplus. Relative to the baseline scenario, full risk adjustment reduces employee surplus by
12.5 percentage points and increases profits by 9.0 percentage points of first best total surplus. More-
over, implementing full risk adjustment requires the employer to run a deficit equal to 8.9 percentage
points of the optimized social surplus. Negative risk adjustment, shown in column 4, has the op-
posite effect, raising combined employee-employer surplus by 13.2 percentage points and reducing
producer surplus by 8.1 percentage points relative to the baseline level. Thus, the calibrated results
indicate that risk adjustment has the counterintuitive effect of reducing surplus for employees and
surplus provided by the market, as described in Proposition 7 in settings where the optimal quantity
is high (i.e., q? > q).
     Segmenting the market, shown in the fifth column, not only allows prices to reflect cost differ-
ences across employees but also allows the insurance companies to price-discriminate by charging
different markups to different market segments. It, therefore, does not correspond cleanly to our pure
  21 Because of the non-linearity of the insurance contract, holding constant population average costs under the insurance

contracts requires us to adjust the mean population cost.
  22 Full negative risk-adjustment (σ = 3) has even more extreme effects in the same direction, but violates our stability

conditions and thereby creates some unnecessary expositional challenges.

cost-side parameter σ. To implement segmentation we partition the distribution of λ into quartiles
and allow the firms to charge the profit-maximizing price to each market thus defined. Appendix
Figure A2 shows plots which depict equilibrium price and quantity in each segment.
    We find that the segmented markets have essentially no selection (a more-or-less flat cost curve)
so that the results under segmentation reflect the elimination of selection as well as any price discrim-
inatory effects. Segmentation reduces employee surplus by 17.5 percentage points of the optimized
total surplus, which is more than the decline under full risk adjustment. The reduced selection com-
bined with the ability to price discriminate raises profits by a substantial 31.2 percentage points of
the optimized total surplus. Total surplus from the market is within 1 percentage point of first best
level, but the incidence is significantly skewed, with producers capturing more than two-thirds of
the surplus generated by the market. This suggests that employers’ reluctance to adopt risk-based
pricing may not only be due to legal restrictions and concerns about reclassification risk (Handel,
Hendel and Whinston, 2014), but may also stem from the more familiar concern that allowing for
price discrimination would transfer significant surplus from employees to insurance companies.
    These findings on risk adjustment and risk-based pricing are far from universal. As discussed
in Section 4, eliminating selection may raise or lower consumers and social surplus, and the same is
famously true of the price discriminatory effects of market segmentation (Aguirre, Cowan and Vick-
ers, 2010). However, in our calibrated model, (i) eliminating selection with risk adjustment and (ii)
allowing price discrimination have similar qualitative effects: Both reduce employee surplus while
increasing insurer profits, with an effect on total welfare that is determined by which effect is domi-
nant.
    We also use the model to examine the effect of a change in correlations that would result from a
change in consumer perceptions about the distribution of risk they face. For instance, an insurance-
choice decision-aide might reduce misperceptions of costs and therefore increase the degree of selec-

tion in the market. We model this potential misperception by generating a perceived health-type λ̂
that is jointly log-normally distributed with a consumer’s actual health-type λ with correlation ρλ,λ̂ .
We calculate equilibria where willingness-to-pay is determined by the consumer’s perceived health
type while costs are determined by the consumer’s actual health type. We calculate surplus under
perceived demand, which might be relevant if consumers are never de-biased of their mispercep-
tions, and under the actual demand curve. Appendix Figure A3 plots the equilibrium allocations
generated by the perceived demand and marginal cost curves for different values of ρλ,λ̂ .

 Note: This table shows the effect of a reduction in correlation that would result from consumer misperceptions of their
 health risks, modeled by allowing consumers’ perceived and actual health type to be jointly log-normally distribution
 with correlation parameter ρλ,λ̂ . The first column shows the setting where perceptions are fully accurate (ρλ,λ̂ = 1), the
 second column where perceptions are partially correlated (ρλ,λ̂ = 0.5), and the third column where perceived health risk
 is completely uncorrelated with the truth (ρλ,λ̂ = 0). We show employee and total surplus under the demand curves
 that result from the perceived health risk and actual health risk distributions. All values are presented as a percentage
 of the first best total surplus in the baseline scenario where perceptions are fully accurate.

    Table 4 shows the results of this exercise. The first column shows the setting where perceptions
are fully accurate (ρλ,λ̂ = 1). The second column shows a setting where consumers have perceptions
that are partially correlated with true health risk (ρλ,λ̂ = 0.5). The third column shows a setting
where perceived health risk is completely uncorrelated with the truth (ρλ,λ̂ = 0). As above, the
welfare values are shows as a percent of the optimized total surplus.
    Reducing the correlation between perceived and actual health risk has the effect of decreasing the
degree of selection in the market, as shown in Appendix Figure A3. This means that, similar to the
results above, increased misperceptions raise price and reduce quantity in the market, even under the
demand curves that result from perceived risk.23 Employee surplus is even lower, and social surplus
actually falls, under actual demand curves, since the misperceptions create an allocative inefficiency
in who receives insurance coverage. This pushes against the argument, made in a perfectly com-
petitive environment, that nudging (improving information) can hurt consumers by exacerbating the
degree of selection (Handel, 2012) and helps justify employer efforts to help employees optimize their
  23 Increasing misperceptions raises producer surplus, suggesting that policy efforts to de-bias consumers through deci-

sion aides may be opposed by the insurance industry.

5.3     Consumer Lending

We assess the potential for excess competition in consumer lending by using EJL’s model of subprime
auto lending, which they calibrate to proprietary data from a large firm. In their model, consumers
have preferences over the down-payment d and monthly loan-payments required to payoff the total
price p of the car. Costs to the firm depend on whether the consumer defaults on their loan, and
conditional on default, how many payments are made prior to default and the recovery value of the
car.
       We apply our framework to this setting by modeling the down-payment as the “price” of the
product, holding fixed the total size of the loan the consumer takes out and owes in the future. We
think this choice is appropriate for two reasons. First, consumers are substantially more sensitive to
down-payments than other characteristics of the loan.24 Second, EJL consider a model with no sav-
ings so that the lender’s future revenue from a borrower depends only on her type and the amount of
her loan. Thus holding fixed the loan size when changing the down-payment is the only formulation
consistent, in their model, with our assumption that the cost of a consumer depends only on her type
and not on the price she is charged.
       The market is adversely selected if lower down-payments, which increase quantity, decrease
average default rates, and thereby lower costs (AC 0 (q) < 0). The market is advantageous selected if
lower down-payments raise the average probability of default ( AC 0 (q) > 0).
       We recover the demand curve and degree of selection as perceived by the firm by considering the
effects of small increase in the down-payment d holding fixed the size of the loan l = p − d for the
modal car in the data.25 Demand is highly sensitive to the down-payment with a purchase elasticity
of -0.63. There is considerable advantageous selection, with the marginal borrower with respect to the
down-payment defaulting 79% of the time relative to a default rate of 59% among average borrowers.
       We assess the potential for socially excess competition by calculating the social markup as a func-
tion of industry competition. The social markup is defined as the difference between the equilibrium
price and the social marginal cost for the marginal borrower:

                         Social Markup = P − MC = θ MS + (1 − θ ) [ AC − MC ] .

When the social markup is positive, there is too little equilibrium quantity and social surplus is in-
creasing as the market becomes more competitive. When the social markup is negative, there is too
much equilibrium quantity, and greater market power would improve social welfare.
       The parameters of the social markup function can be recovered from the estimates of demand and
selection perceived by the firm, which following the notation in Section 3 are indicated with a “hat.”
Because of our symmetry assumption, average costs for the industry are equal to those perceived
  24 Usingthe same data, Adams, Einav and Levin (2009) find that consumers are indifferent between a $100 increase in
the down-payment and a $3,000 increase in the total amount borrowed.
  25 The modal car has a down-payment of $1,000 and a loan size of $10,000.

Section 2 plots the social markup thus calculated as a function of the degree of competition. There is
a large negative social markup at reasonable levels of competition, with an implied subsidy by $4,462
when θ = 0.2, suggesting that high levels of market power may be desirable.


6      Conclusion
This paper makes three contributions. First, we propose a simple but general model nesting a variety
of forms of imperfect competition in selection markets. Second, we derive from this model several
basic, yet often counter-intuitive, comparative statics. Third, we show the empirical and policy rele-
vance of these comparative statics by applying them to merger policy and calibrated models of health
insurance and subprime auto lending.
       Our work here suggests several directions for future research. We have shown calibrated and
empirical examples where the counter-intuitive comparative statics we derived are relevant. How-
ever, it is not clear how prevalent such examples are or the breadth with which the issues we raise
are first-order in determining optimal competition or selection policy. Further empirical research is
important to investigate this question.
       We have also focused on a small number of policy instruments: merger policy, risk adjustment,
cost-based pricing and consumer information campaigns. While these may be the most canonical
policies for addressing selection and market power, many others, such as price controls and restraints
on exclusive dealing, play an important role. Investigating the effect of market power on the first
policy and selection on the second would be informative.
       Finally our paper contributes to a growing literature, surveyed by Weyl (2014), that connects
issues of contemporary interest to classical price theory. While we primarily used this connection to
draw out the implications of contemporary interest, our results also have implications for the classical
theory of regulation of natural monopolies. In particular, our monopoly and competition models
correspond, respectively, to an unregulated monopoly and one bound to average cost pricing. To
the best of our knowledge, the welfare comparison of these cases in a region of a monopoly’s cost
curve where cost is increasing (corresponding to advantageous selection) have not been explored in
previous literature.

A     Model
This appendix provides formal micro-foundations for the representations in the text.

A.1    Cournot model
Potential consumers of a homogeneous service are described by a multi-dimensional type t = (t1 , . . . t T )
drawn from a smooth       and  non-atomic distribution function f (t) with full support on a hyper-box
 t1 , t1 × · · · t T , t T ⊆ R . Consumers receive a quasi-linear utility u(t) − p if they purchase the ser-
                              T

vice for price p. When the prevailing price is p, therefore, the set of       R consumers purchasing the service
is T ( p) = {t : u(t) ≥ p} and the number of purchasers Q( p) = T ( p) f (t)dt. T ( p) is clearly decreas-
ing in p in the strong set order so that by our assumption of full support Q( p) is strictly decreasing.
Thus we can define the inverse demand function P(q) as the inverse of Q( p).
      Each consumer also carries with her a cost of service, c(t) > 0 that must be incurred to supply
the service to her by any supplier. Thus the average cost of all individuals served when the aggregate
quantity is q is                                   R
                                                     T ( P(q))
                                                               c(t) f (t)dt
                                        AC (q) ≡                            .
                                                          Q ( P(q))
     There are n firms that can each choose a quantity qi of the service to supply non-cooperatively.
If q ≡ ∑i qi < 1 then the prevailing market price is set by by market clearing as P(q). If q > 1 then
price is 0. Clearly no equilibrium can involve q > 1 as all firms would make losses. Firms receive
a uniform random sample of all customers who are in the market at the prevailing prices and thus
earn profits qi [ P(q) − AC (q)]. Thus, to maximize profits non-cooperatively they must satisfy

                                                             MC (q) − AC (q)
                             P(q) − AC (q) + P0 (q)qi −                      qi = 0.
                                                                    q
                                              q
At a symmetric equilibrium where qi = n for all i this becomes
                                      
                                     1               MS(q)    MC (q)
                         P(q) − 1 −      AC (q) −           −        =0

as claimed in the text.

A.2    Differentiated Bertrand model
There are n firms i = 1, . . . n each selling a single service. Consumers are described by two types, each
possibly multidimensional, (t, e). t is drawn as in the Cournot case. e consists of two components:
e = (l, e) where l is an integer between 1 and L, with each value of l having equal probability, and e is
drawn from a real hyper rectangle in E dimensions. The distribution of e is atomless, symmetric in all
coordinates, independent of the value of l and given by the distribution function g. The distributions
of t and e are independent.
     Consumers may consume at most a single service and receive a quasi-linear utility from consum-
ing the service of firm i, ui (t, e) − pi , where pi is the price charged for service i. Let the first order statis-
tic of utility u? (t, e) ≡ maxi ui (t, e). We assume (without loss of generality yet) that u? (t, e) = u? (t);



                                                        43
that is that the value of the first-order statistic depends only on t and not on e. Second, and this does
entail a loss of generality, we make the following assumption.

Assumption 1. ui = u? (t) + ûi (e) so that all valuations shift up uniformly with a shift in u? induced by
changes in t.

     This implies that the relative utility of services other than the one the individual most prefers,
compared to that which she most prefers, are determined purely by e and not t. Third we assume,
with only a modest loss of generality, that u? (t) is smooth in t and that ∂u?/∂tT > k > 0 for some
constant k. This implies that raising t T sufficiently causes u? > u for any fixed u and lowering it
sufficiently causes the reverse to be true.
     Services are symmetrically differentiated in the sense that distribution of u (t, e) = (u1 (t, e) , . . . un (t, e))
induced by the distribution of (t, e) is symmetric in permutations of coordinates. The set of individ-
uals purchasing service i is

                     Ti ( p) = {(t, e) : ui (t, e) ≥ pi ∧ i ∈ argmaxi ui (t, e) − pi }
                                               R
and the demand for good i is thus Qi ( p) = T ( p) f (t, e)d(t, e).
                                                  i
    As in the Cournot example, the cost of serving a consumer depends on her type. However, we
make the substantive assumption now that cost depends only on t and not on e.

Assumption
         R      2. The cost of serving a consumer of type (t, e) is c(t) and thus the total cost faced by firm i is
Ci ( p) = T ( p) c(t) f (t, e)d(t, e).
            i


     This assumption states that only the determinants of the highest possible utility a consumer can
achieve, and not of her relative preferences across services, may directly determine her cost to firms.
Given the independence of t and e, this assumption implies a clean separation between determinants
of relative “horizontal” preferences across services and “vertical” utility for the most preferred service
that also determines the cost of service. Absent this assumption it is possible that the consumers that
firms attract from their rivals when lowering their price are very different in terms of cost from the
average consumers of the service more broadly.
     Let 1 ≡ (1, . . . , 1). Then by symmetry Qi ( p1) = Q j ( p1) ∀i, j and similarly for Ci and Cj . Let
the aggregate demand Q( p) ≡ nQi ( p1) for any i and similarly for aggregate cost. Then we define
the inverse demand function P(q) as the inverse of the aggregate demand. Average cost is then
              C ( P(q))
AC (q) ≡           q    and marginal cost MC (q) ≡ C 0 ( P(q)) P0 (q).
     We now describe two particular models satisfying these assumptions and show how they yield
the reduced-form representation we use in the text. Any other micro-foundation of these assump-
tions should also yield our representation, but the notation required to encompass different cases is
sufficiently abstract and not relevant enough to any results we derive. We thus omit it here and focus
on specific micro-foundations.
     First consider a random utility model in the spirit of Anderson, de Palma and Thisse (1992)
proposed by White and Weyl (2012) in the context of heterogeneity of preferences for non-price prod-
uct characteristics. L = n and the value of l represents which product is the individual’s favorite.
e = (e1 , . . . , eE ) and E ≥ n − 1. We assume that

                                                  ui (u? (t), l, e)

is increasing in ei? where i? is i if i < l and is i − 1 if i > l and that it is constant in all other ei where
i ≤ n − 1 and not i? . We also assume that ui is smooth in its arguments other than l, bounded and
that and that limei? →ei? ui (u? (t), l, e) = u? (t) and limei? →ei? ui (u? (t), l, e) = 0 for any value of the

                                                        44
other entries u? , l and e−i? where ei and ei are respectively the lowest and highest values of ei . This
implies that raising ei? sufficiently for any i while holding fixed the other components of e makes (in
the limit) service i equally desirable to the most desirable service for the individual and lowering it
makes it always uncompetitive with the best service regardless of the price differential.
     An individual firm i’s profits are pi Qi ( p1 , . . . pi , . . . pn ) − Ci ( p1 , . . . pi , . . . pn ). Thus the first-order
condition for the optimization of any firm i is

Because price does not appear in the interior of the integrals defining Qi and Ci , the derivatives
of these with respect to pi is, by the Leibniz Rule applied to multidimensional integrals (Weyl and
Veiga, 2014), given by the sum of the effects of the extensive margin effects from the change in the
boundaries of integration. There are many such boundaries, so we use a shorthand notation for
them. ∂TiX ( p) ≡ {(t, e) ∈ Ti ( p) : u? (t) = pi } denotes the set of exiting consumers        from product i
who are just indifferent between buying service i and no service. ∂TijS ( p) ≡ (t, e) ∈ Ti ( p) ∩ Tj ( p)
                                                                                         

denotes the set of switching consumers between services i and j who are just indifferent between the
two services, but prefer purchasing one over purchasing nothing. To formally define the density of
consumers on such boundaries it is useful to express the multidimensional integrals representing Qi
and Ci more explicitly.
     At symmetric prices p, every individual i with t T above this threshold buys from her most pre-
ferred services l and any individual below this threshold buys no service. If a single price pi is
elevated to pi + δ then all individuals with l 6= i continue to buy their preferred product as at sym-
metry. However, individuals with l = i and u? (t) ∈ ( p, p + δ) will stop consuming any service and
those with l = i and e j? sufficiently close to e j? will switch to purchasing service      j. Let t?T ( p; t−T ) be
defined implicitly by u? (t−T , t?T ( p; t−T )) = p and let e?j? ∆; u? (t), e−{1,...,n−1} be implicitly defined

where e−{1,...,n−1} is all components of e other than the first n − 1 and the dependence of u j on the
other components of e is dropped as these do not impact u j .
    Then when prices are symmetric except for price pi being above the other prices, we can write

     A second model that delivers our form builds on the Chen and Riordan (2007) “spokes” extension
of the Hotelling linear city model, combining it with modifications from Rochet and Stole (2002).
There are n firms i = 1, . . . , n. For every pair of firms, (i, j) with i < j there is a line segment of unit
length of potential consumers who will only consider purchasing either service i or service j. Thus
            n ( n −1)                                                                       i ( i −1)
there are 2 such segments and we denote the segment (i, j) by the integer 2 + ( j mod i ).
e = (l, e) where l is the integer representing the line segment on which the consumer lives and
e ∈ (0, 1) is the distance of the consumer from i or 1− her distance from j. In particular let i (l ) ≡
                    i ( i −1)
maxi∈Z: i(i−1) <l 2 and let j(l ) ≡ l mod i (l ); then e is the distance of the consumer from i (l ). There
          2
are an equal number of consumers on each segment so n(n2−1) of the consumers are on each segment.
    In addition to maintaining our assumptions about t and e, we make two modifications to the
set-up of Chen and Riordan:

   1. We modify the exact form of consumer utility. In particular, u? (t) is the utility a consumer earns
      from service i (l ) if e ≤ 12 and from good j(l ) if e ≥ 21 regardless of the other details of her position.
      This contrasts with the standard Chen and Riordan, and Hotelling (1929), model because it
      implies no transport cost to an individual’s most preferred service.

   2. Consumers’ highest possible utility is not constant across consumers but instead follows a dis-
      tribution u? (t).

   3. The gross utility a consumer derives from purchasing from j(l ) if e < 21 is u? (t) − (1 − 2e)t,
      where t is a transportation cost parameter absent in the Chen and Riordan model. If e > 21 the
      consumer derives gross utility of u? (t) − (2e − 1)t from purchasing from i (l ).

   4. We allow arbitrary smooth and symmetric-about- 12 distributions of e on the unit interval, as
      long as this distribution is the same for all l.

    Calculations to derive the representation in the text are tedious and extremely similar to those
in our modified Anderson, de Palma and Thisse model above. We therefore omit these calculations
and simply explain why there results are the same. At symmetric prices, every consumer purchases
from her most preferred firm, i (l ) if e ≤ 12 and j(l ) if e > 12 . All consumers with the same t make
the same purchase decision at this price because only u? impacts their total utility. Consumers with
e = 21 are “switchers” between a pair of firms (if u? (t) ≥ p) and have the same distribution of t
as all purchasers by the independence of e and t. Thus switchers will be representative of the full

population of consumers and exiters everywhere will be on average identical. This is precisely what
gave rise to our structure above.


B    Example with Large Demand-Driven Effects of Risk-Based Pricing
One intervention commonly applied in selection markets is cost-based pricing. In Subsection 5.2 we
showed that these discriminatory effects may reinforce the cost-based effects of selection. In this
appendix we discuss how price discriminatory effects of cost-based pricing may instead reverse the
results we established about the impact of changing the degree of selection in Section 4.
     Proposition 5 states that increasing advantageous selection increases monopoly profits. How-
ever, clearly allowing cost-based pricing may never hurt a monopolist as she may maintain uniform
pricing. It will generically aid the monopolist. Thus her gains from price discrimination swamp the
effects we highlight.
     To see that impacts on consumers may also be reversed by price discriminatory effects, consider
our result (Proposition 4 and 5) that decreasing adverse and advantageous selection may both benefit
consumers, depending on the equilibrium quantity. This may be true of cost-based pricing, but not in
one simple, extreme case. Suppose that there is only a single dimension of heterogeneity determining
both cost and valuation and that we move from uniform pricing to full cost-based pricing. This op-
erates as perfect, first-degree price discrimination, extracting all surplus from consumers regardless
of the equilibrium quantity and thus contradicting the natural extrapolation of our result.
     Thus cost-based pricing cannot cleanly be interpreted as an example of increasing selection in our
framework; price discrimination may be more important in some cases than are cost-based effects.
However, in the leading counter-intuitive case we emphasize, the two effects reinforce one another
to lower consumer surplus.


C    Proofs
Throughout we assume that θ, σ ∈ [0, 1], that selection is either globally adverse or advantageous
(either AC 0 , MC 0 > 0 or AC 0 , MC 0 < 0 for all q) and impose a global equilibrium stability condition:
P0 < min{ AC 0 , MC 0 , 0} and MR0 < min{ MC 0 , 0}. Most of the results may be obtained absent these
global monotonicity assumptions, but the additional expositional complexities add little insight. We
also assume that θ and σ are constant parameters, independent of q; all results can be extended to the
case when this fails, but again, the additional notation is cumbersome.

by our monotonicity assumptions. Thus by Lemma 1, ∂θ < 0 if q 6= 0 and weakly if q = 0. This
immediately implies that price rises in θ by monotonicity and thus that CS falls. Producer surplus is

                                       PS(q) = q [ P(q) − σAC (q) − (1 − σ) AC (1)]

so
                      PS0 (q) = P(q) − σAC (q) − (1 − σ) AC (1) + q P0 (q) − σAC 0 (q) =
                                                                                     

as MS + MC − AC, MS > 0 by the argument above so long as θ < 1. Thus at q? for any θ < 1,
PS0 < 0.

Proposition (Formal) 2. If AC 0 < 0 and θ ∈ (0, 1), ∂SS                    ?
                                                      ∂θ ≤ 0, strictly if q > 0.
               Rq
Proof. SS(q) = 0 ( P(q) − [σMC (q) + (1 − σ) AC (1)]) dq so SS0 (q) = P(q) − σMC (q) − (1 − σ) AC (1).
Thus
                     SS0 (q? ) = σ (1 − θ ) [ AC (q? ) − MC (q? )] + θ MS (q? ) > 0
                                          MC (q)− AC (q)
because MS > 0 and AC 0 (q) =                   q          < 0. Thus the result follows from the chain rule and the
            ∂q?
fact that   ∂θ    < 0 as shown in the proof of the previous proposition.

Proposition (Formal) 3. If AC 0 > 0 and q? > 0 for every (θ, σ) ∈ (0, 1)2 , ∃θ ? ∈ (0, 1) such that          ∂SS
                                                                                                              ∂θ   >

                             ∂σ > 0 if σ ∈ (0, 1).

Proof. By the logic of the previous proof, SS0 (q) = P(q) − σMC (q) − (1 − σ) AC (1) so

                SS00 (q) = P0 (q) − σMC 0 (q) = (1 − σ) P0 (q) + σ P0 (q) − MC 0 (q) < 0.
                                                                                   


Thus social surplus is concave in quantity. Quantity is below its optimal level at θ = 1 by the standard
monopoly argument and quantity is above its optimal level at θ = 0 by the argument in the proof of
the previous proposition. Thus the result follows from the fact, shown in the proof of Proposition 1,
     ∂q?
that ∂θ < 0.
                                 ∂q?
Proposition (Formal) 4. ∂σ has the same sign as AC (1) − θ MC (q? ) − (1 − θ ) AC (q? ). If AC 0 < 0 then
                                                                         ∂q?
providing a specific subsidy to the industry can only cause the sign of ∂σ to move from being negative to being
positive; a sufficiently large such subsidy guarantees this sign is positive. If θ = 1 then ∂PS
                                                                                             ∂σ has the same sign
                                                                                dP(q? )
as AC 0 . Again if θ = 1, AC 0 < 0 and if the pass-through rate, ρ(t) ≡ dt > M > 0 for some M and all t
such that q? ∈ (0, 1) then ∂PS                                                                    ?
                            ∂σ + ∂σ > 0 starting from a sufficiently large subsidy − t such that q < 1.
                                  ∂CS


Proof. With a specific tax (negative specific taxes are specific subsidies), the equilibrium condition is

                    P(q) − σ (θ MC (q) + (1 − θ ) AC (q)) + (1 − σ) AC (1) − θ MS(q) − t = 0.

Thus by the Implicit Function Theorem

                                     ∂q?
                         F 0 (q? )       − [θMC (q? ) + (1 − θ ) AC (q? ) − AC (1)] = 0 =⇒
                                     ∂σ

                                                               49
                                 ∂q?   θ MC (q? ) + (1 − θ ) AC (q? ) − AC (1)
                                     =                                         .                           (6)
                                 ∂σ                    F 0 (q? )
Because F 0 < 0 by Lemma 1, this has the same sign as AC (1) − θMC (q? ) − (1 − θ ) AC (q? ) regardless
                                                                 ∂q?
of the degree of tax or subsidy. By the same arguments as above, ∂t < 0. Thus if AC 0 , MC 0 < (>)0 the
sign of this expression can only move, with an increase in tax, from being positive to being negative
(from being negative to being positive).
     Furthermore as t (a sufficiently large subsidy) becomes arbitrarily negative (a sufficiently large
subsidy is give), q? → 1. Thus the denominator on the right-hand side of Equation 6 must approach
                                                            ∂q?
θMC (1) − AC (1), which is negative if AC 0 < 0 and thus ∂σ > 0 eventually.
     As before PS(q) = q [ P(q) − σAC (q) − (1 − σ) AC (1)]. When θ = 1 profits are maximized over
                                                                          ?                          ?
q so by the envelope theorem we can calculate ∂PS ∂σ while holding fixed q yielding AC (1) − AC ( q ).
For q? < 1 this clearly has the same sign as AC 0 . By the envelope theorem for consumers and this
result for producers

                          ∂CS                ∂q?
                              = −q? P0 (q? )     = −ρ(t)q? [ MC (q? ) − AC (1)] ,
                           ∂σ                ∂σ
where the second equality uses the fact that when θ = 1,

                              ∂q?            MC (q? ) − AC (1)
                   P0 (q? )       = P0 (q? )                   = ρ(t) [ MC (q? ) − AC (1)]
                              ∂σ                 F 0 (q? )

as the tax enters linearly into the expression for F. Thus

                    ∂CS ∂PS
                        +    = −ρ(t)q? [ MC (q? ) − AC (1)] + AC (1) − AC (q? ) .
                     ∂σ   ∂σ
As t becomes sufficiently negative, q? → 1 so that the second term vanishes and the first term is
bounded away from 0 as MC (q? ) − AC (1) grows in absolute value (becomes more negative) mono-
tonically in q? and ρ(t) > M > 0 by hypothesis.

    Note that this result is formulated in terms of subsidies, but these are equivalent to upward
demand shifts of we confine attention to in-market quantities and thus ignore the impact on the
subsidy provider, as we do here.

Proposition (Formal) 5. If AC 0 > 0 then giving a specific subsidy to the industry can only cause the sign
   ∂q?
of ∂σ to move from being positive to being negative; a sufficiently large such subsidy guarantees this sign is
                                                                       dP(q? )
negative. If θ = 1, AC 0 > 0 and if the pass-through rate, ρ(t) ≡ dt > M > 0 for some M and all t such
that q? ∈ (0, 1) then ∂PS                                                                    ?
                       ∂σ + ∂σ < 0 starting from a sufficiently large subsidy − t such that q < 1.
                            ∂CS


Proof. This follows exactly from the logic of the proof of Proposition (Formal) 4.

Proposition (Formal) 6. If θ = 0 then      ∂SS
                                            ∂σ   has the same signs as AC 0 .

Proof. At θ = 0 there is no producer surplus so only the impact on consumer surplus is relevant.
                                          ∂P(q? )
Because P(q) = σAC (q) + (1 − σ) AC (1), ∂σ has the same sign as AC (q) − AC (1) (given that
P0 > AC 0 by our stability assumptions) which is opposite to that of AC 0 . By the envelope theorem,
dCS                                                                                           0
 dP = − q. Thus the impact of σ on consumer and thus social surplus has the same sign as AC .

    For the following results, σ represents risk-adjustment rather than correlation. Again we use a
tax or subsidy to shift the demand curve and measure welfare now with respect to the primitive


                                                         50
demand and supply curves, including the tax/subsidy, excluding any impacts of the tax/subsidy on
the government budget and ignoring the risk adjustment (as this is just a transfer) except through
its impacts on equilibrium quantity. We let q?? denote the socially optimal quantity. In what follows
we treat the “specific tax” t a simply a uniform inverse demand/cost shifter and thus irrelevant to
welfare quantities.

Proposition (Formal) 7. Let q0 = q? when σ = 0 (full risk-adjustment). If θ = 1, AC 0 < 0 and MS0 >
MC 0 then there exist thresholds q0 < q that are invariant to the level of a specific tax t such that

                        ∂q?
   1. If q0 < q0 then   ∂σ    < 0 and there exists σ? ∈ (0, 1) such that at σ? , q? = q?? .
                        ∂q?
   2. If q0 = q0 then   ∂σ    < 0 and q? = q?? when σ = 0.
                               ∂q?
   3. If q0 < q0 < q then      ∂σ    < 0 and q? < q?? even when σ = 0.
                        ∂q?
   4. If q0 = q then    ∂σ    = 0 and q? < q?? .
                        ∂q?
   5. If q0 > q then    ∂σ    > 0 and q? < q??

    q0 > 0 if limq→0 P0 (q)q = 0. q0 ranges between 0 and 1 as a sufficiently large tax or subsidy is imposed.

    The additional discussion about the direction of welfare in the text follows from this result and
the observation that under our stability assumptions welfare is strictly concave in quantity.
    This proposition imposes two additional conditions not discussed previously: that MS0 > AC 0
and that limq→0 P0 (q)q = 0. Log-concavity of direct demand is sufficient, but not necessary, for
the first condition assuming that MC 0 < 0, as it implies MS0 > 0 (Weyl and Fabinger, 2013) and
thus clearly > MC 0 . We have typically assumed that when AC 0 < 0, MC 0 < 0 as well. The second
condition is neither necessary nor sufficient for log-concavity but is true of every log-concave demand
function we are aware of, as shown by Fabinger and Weyl (2014b). It also implies that demand is log-
concave at sufficiently high prices as, letting p ≡ limq→0 P(q) and Q be the direct demand,

                                                                             Q( p)
                                           lim P0 (q)q = 0 ⇐⇒ lim                    .
                                           q →0                       p→ p   Q0 ( p)
                                                                                         Q
Bulow and Pfleiderer (1983) show that the sign of the derivative of                      Q0   positive if and only if Q is
                                                            Q( p)
locally log-concave; clearly          Q0
                                       < 0 so      lim p→ p Q0 ( p)
                                                              only if in the limit this quantity is increasing
(towards 0). Thus it is closely connected to log-concavity and limq→0 P0 (q)q = 0 are closely-allied
concepts and thus we view the gap between them as being a “regularity” condition, as quoted in the
text.
     If the first condition fails it is possible that there are other points of switching between regimes 1)
and 3) from the proposition; this does not lead to qualitatively different behavior, but would be more
complex to state and thus we omitted discussing it in the text. If the second condition fails, then, as
discussed in the text, it is possible (though not necessary) that even at very low q0 full risk-adjustment
is still insufficient.

Proof. First note that risk-adjustment payments are pure transfers and thus social surplus is invariant
to them except in how they impact quantity. Second, note that their impact on quantity is precisely
as in Proposition (formal) 4 as the equilibrium equations are identical to there. This establishes the
               ∂q?
claims about ∂σ . Point 5) follows because quantity is always too low when AC 0 > 0 and becomes


                                                              51
                                                                                 ∂q?
only lower with risk-adjustment; it may never cross q because there ∂σ = 0 . Point 4) follows directly
from this observation: if q? = q if σ = 1, q? is invariant to σ. All of this is, as claimed, invariant to the
value of t by the same logic in the proof of Proposition (Formal) 4.
                                                          ∂q?
     On the other hand when q? < q if σ = 1 then ∂σ < 0 but by the same logic q? < q for all
σ ∈ [0, 1]. By the logic in the proof of Proposition (Formal) 3, social welfare is concave in quantity and
quantity is too low when σ = 1. Thus either social surplus monotonically increases as q falls or social
surplus reaches a peak and then declines beyond some point if q becomes too low. Which occurs is
determined by the sign of SS0 (q0 ) as, by concavity and monotonicity of q? in σ, SS0 (q? ) < SS0 (q0 )
for all σ > 0.
                      SS0 (q0 ) = P (q0 ) − MC (q0 ) = MS (q0 ) + AC (1) − MC (q0 ) .
Thus if MS (q0 ) > MC (q0 ) − AC (1) then q? ≤ q0 < q?? while if MS (q0 ) = MC (q0 ) − AC (1) then
q? ≤ q0 = q?? and if MS (q0 ) < MC (q0 ) − AC (1) then there is an interior optimal σ as there was
an interior optimal θ ? in Proposition (Formal) 3 and as described in point 1). Note that this is all
invariant to t as this has no impact on either MS or AC (1) − MC as it shifts the latter two in parallel.
     By definition of q, q0 < q implies that MC (q0 ) > AC (1). Thus if limq→0 MS(q) = 0 then for
sufficiently small q0 the second case holds. Conversely MS (q0 ) > 0 for all q0 > 0 and as q0 → q,
again by definition of q, MC (q0 ) → AC (1) and thus the first case holds.
     q0 is then simply defined as the threshold between these regimes, which exists by the assumption
that MS0 > MC 0 and thus MS0 − MC 0 + AC (1) has a single crossing of 0 (from below to above). The
range claim on q0 as a function of t follows from the fact that F 0 < 0.


Proposition (Formal) 8. Let q0 be defined as in Proposition (Formal) 7. If θ = 1, AC 0 > 0 and MC 0 − MS0
is signed globally, there exist thresholds q00 > q that are invariant to the level of a specific tax t, with q being
identical to its value in Proposition (Formal) 7, such that
                       ∂q?
   1. If q0 < q then   ∂σ    > 0 and q? < q?? even at σ = 1.
                       ∂q?
   2. If q0 = q then   ∂σ    = 0 and q? < q?? for all σ ∈ [0, 1].
                                ∂q?
   3. If q < q0 < q00 then      ∂σ    < 0 and q? < q?? even at σ = 0.
                         ∂q?
   4. If q0 = q00 then   ∂σ    < 0 and q? = q?? when σ = 0.
                         ∂q?
   5. If q0 > q00 then   ∂σ    < 0 and there exists a σ? ∈ (0, 1) such that at σ? , q? = q?? .

     q00 < 1 if and only if MC (1) − AC (1) < MS(1) and, as in Proposition (Formal) 7, adjusting t traces
out the full possible range of q0 .

    The additional conditions in this result have less intuitive content than those in the previous
proposition. Again MC 0 − MS0 being signed is necessary to ensure a simple structure on the regions
of potential outcomes. A sufficient condition for this is log-convexity of demand as in this case MC 0 >
0 > MS0 , assuming that MC 0 has the same sign as AC 0 . But MS0 > MC 0 > 0 would also satisfy the
condition and would have demand being very log-concave.
    The second condition has little intuitive content, but is only possible in the case when MC 0 >
MS0 . It states that the downward distortion from market power is smaller than the upward distor-
tion from advantageous selection (that would occur under perfect competition) when equilibrium

Proof. The proof follows precisely the logic of Proposition (Formal) 7, mutatis mutandis for the differ-
ences between the adverse and advantageous cases.
                                             ∂q?
Proposition (Formal) 9. If θ = 0 then        ∂σ    has the same sign as − AC 0 . If q0 ≤ q then there exists a
                                                                    ∂q?
σ? ∈ [0, 1) such that at σ? , q? = q?? . If q0 > q then SS0 (q? )   ∂σ    > 0 and q? − q?? has the sign of AC 0 for
σ ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. The first claim follows directly from the logic of Proposition (Formal) 6 and the fact that the
equilibrium conditions with θ = 0 are the same for a given σ under the two models as above.
     The second claim comes from a logic similar to the preceding two propositions. Social surplus
is still concave for the same reasons. At σ = 1 is it is always declining in σ because for AC 0 > 0
quantity is too high and for AC 0 < 0 quantity is too low. It is thus sufficient to verify whether this
sign is maintained or not at q0 . We just consider one of the four cases; the other three are analogous.
     Suppose that q0 < q and that AC 0 < 0. Then by definition of q, MC (q0 ) > AC (1).

                          SS0 (q0 ) = P (q0 ) − MC (q0 ) = AC (1) − MC (q0 ) < 0,

reversing the sign compared to SS0 (q? ) when σ = 1 and implying an interior optimum by the rea-
soning in the proof of the previous two propositions.

Note: This figure shows the effects of risk-based pricing, achieved by segmenting the market into quartiles using the
risk-type parameter λ. The first risk quartile corresponds to the set of consumers with the lowest expected costs and the
fourth risk quartile corresponds to the consumers with the highest expected costs in the market. See Subsection 5.2 for
more details.
