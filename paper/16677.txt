                                             ABSTRACT

Counter to extant stylized facts, using newly available data on country allocations in U.S. investors’
foreign equity portfolios we find that (i) U.S. investors do not exhibit returns-chasing behavior, but,
consistent with partial portfolio rebalancing, tend to sell past winners; and (ii) U.S. investors increase
portfolio weights on a country’s equity market just prior to its strong performance, behavior inconsistent
with an informational disadvantage. Over the past two decades, U.S. investors’ foreign equity portfolios
outperformed a value-weighted foreign benchmark by 160 basis points per year.

       A wave of research in the 1990s—the seminal works are Henning Bohn and Linda L.

Tesar (1996) (henceforth BT) and Michael J. Brennan and H. Henry Cao (1997) (henceforth

BC)—established three stylized facts that characterized the relationship between U.S.

international investment and returns: U.S. investors chase returns, do not rebalance their

international portfolios, and are at an informational disadvantage when they venture abroad.

These stylized facts still inform the literature; for example, the theoretical models in Massimo

Guidolin (2005), Rui Albuquerque, Gregory H. Bauer, and Martin Schneider (2007), and

Bernard Dumas, Karen K. Lewis, and Emilio Osambela (2010) are designed to incorporate some

of these relationships between U.S. investment and returns. The seminal BC and BT results

continue to resonate with researchers because similar, updated bilateral flows data and similar

empirical techniques produce similar results. Using flows data, U.S. investors still appear to

chase returns and not rebalance their international portfolios. And, consistent with an

informational disadvantage, flows into a country‘s equity market are still related to the

contemporaneous returns in that market.

       However, the theories in BT and BC concern portfolio adjustments, not bilateral flows.

Portfolio holdings data were not available—such data did not exist in the 1990s—so both studies

relied on data on international capital flows. But the link from changes in asset demands (i.e.,

portfolio adjustments) to bilateral flows is not straightforward. In particular, as discussed in BC,

changes in wealth could confound such analysis. Consider a situation in which domestic

investors experience an increase in wealth and allocate some of it to all markets (i.e., there are

positive bilateral flows to each market), but in the process reduce the portfolio weights of some

markets. If prior returns were high in a particular market, bilateral flows-based analysis would

characterize that as returns-chasing behavior, regardless of whether the portfolio allocation to
that country increased or decreased. BC tried to control for this by including a benchmark

domestic returns series in empirical tests, but acknowledged that this was an imperfect fix.

       Portfolio data and portfolio-based techniques, both better suited to address the

relationship between international investment and returns, are now available. We revisit the

analyses of BC and BT using monthly estimates of bilateral portfolio positions between the U.S.

and over 40 foreign countries—data maintained by the Federal Reserve—and the portfolio-based

techniques of Mark Grinblatt, Sheriden Titman, and Russ Wermers (1995), B. Espen Eckbo and

David C. Smith (1998), and Wayne E. Ferson and Kenneth Khang (2002). Our results are almost

completely counter to the extant stylized facts. We do not find evidence that U.S. investors chase

returns; rather, they appear to engage in a type of partial rebalancing by selling past winners. We

do not find that U.S. investors are necessarily at an informational disadvantage; rather, they shift

into markets just prior to their strong abnormal returns. Taken together, our analysis suggests that

foreign equities are a very attractive asset class for U.S. investors: On average, U.S. investors‘

foreign equity portfolio outperformed a value-weighted foreign benchmark by 160 basis points

per year over the past two decades.

       The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we discuss the seminal works and

present updated flows-based results that are consistent with their findings. In Section II we

explore the relationship between U.S. portfolios and past returns before directly examining

whether U.S. investors are at an informational disadvantage in foreign markets. Section III

compares the performance of U.S. investors‘ foreign equity portfolios with value-weighted

benchmarks. In Section IV we discuss some implications of our findings for theorists,

empiricists, and policymakers. Section V concludes.

                                 I. The Existing Stylized Facts



       The stylized facts that characterize the relationship between U.S. international investment

and returns come from the seminal BC and BT papers, which were written at a time of limited

data availability. Recognizing the limitations, BT tested a theory of portfolio reallocations using

the then-available bilateral flows data. Specifically, the authors test for a portfolio rebalancing

effect by examining the relationship between bilateral flows and contemporaneous foreign

returns (in excess of the rest of the portfolio‘s returns). In this setup, a negative relationship

between flows and contemporaneous returns would be consistent with portfolio rebalancing;

when returns in a country were high, U.S. investors would sell that country‘s equities (i.e.,

bilateral flows to that country would be negative) to prevent an increased allocation to that

country. However, BT found that for many countries the relationship is positive, indicative of a

lack of rebalancing. BT also test a returns-chasing hypothesis by examining the relationship

between bilateral flows and past (expected or actual) returns. For many countries the relationship

was positive, indicative of returns-chasing. BC estimated similar regressions, although in their

model a positive relationship between flows and contemporaneous returns would be evidence of

an information disadvantage; U.S. investors with poor information about a country would

purchase its equity market when its price increased. Similar to BT, BC found a positive

relationship between bilateral flows and contemporaneous returns, indicative of poor information

on the part of U.S. investors.

       BT- and BC-like regression analysis performed today, either with data from the time

periods they studied or with updated data, produces results similar to the seminal findings. We

replicate the BT analysis using the original January 1981 to November 1994 time period and the



                                                3
original 22 foreign markets (Table 1 columns 1-3). Results from bilateral regressions of U.S. net

purchases in foreign equity market i (scaled by the lagged size of the foreign portfolio) on

expected excess returns in market i (returns in excess of a one-month eurodollar rate) are in

column 1. As in BT, excess returns are forecasted using an information set consisting of lagged

values of the following: world returns, U.S. excess dividend yield, U.S. term structure, and the

foreign country‘s excess return and dividend yield. In the BT‘s reported baseline results, 7 (or

11, depending on the scale factor for flows) out of 22 coefficients on expected returns were

positive and significant. In our replication exercise, 7 of 22 coefficients are positive and

significant. In column (4) we re-estimate using updated data from January 1990 to December

2008; results are similar, with 8 of the 22 coefficients on expected returns positive and

significant. For contemporaneous returns updated data produce even stronger results; the

correlation between bilateral flows and contemporaneous returns (ρ0) is positive and significant

for 10 countries over the BT period and for 15 countries in the updated sample (columns 2 and

5). Finally, the correlation between flows and lagged returns (ρ1) is positive and significant for 6

countries using the old sample, 13 in the updated samples (columns 3 and 6). The stylized facts

continue to inform the literature in part because similar flows-based data and techniques would

lead to similar conclusions today (see, for example, Albuquerque, Bauer, and Schneider 2009).



      II. A Reassessment of Returns Chasing and Informational Disadvantages in U.S.

                                 International Equity Portfolios



       The theories in BT and BC are fundamentally about changes in asset demands. The

mapping from changes in asset demands to bilateral flows is straightforward if wealth is



                                                 4
constant. But financial wealth is not constant (Figure 1). A more direct test of the theories

requires data on portfolio allocations. We describe such data next, and then employ portfolio-

based techniques to re-examine the relationship between international investment and past and

prospective returns.



                                       A. The Portfolio Data



       A portfolio-based study of U.S. investors‘ trading style is made possible by the Carol C.

Bertaut and Ralph W. Tryon (2007) estimates of the monthly bilateral positions of U.S. investors

in the equities of a large set of foreign countries. The country-level dataset includes, for example,

a monthly time series of U.S. holdings of German equities (as well the U.S. holdings of equities

in many other foreign countries).

       Bertaut and Tryon (2007) form the data by combining high-quality low frequency

readings on positions, built from security-level benchmark surveys, with higher frequency

(monthly) flow data. In the process of combining positions and flows data, the reported flow data

is adjusted to alleviate the well-known financial center bias; in the reported flow data, because of

the U.S. government‘s data collection methodology far too many flows are attributed to financial

centers like the United Kingdom (see, among others Warnock and Chad Cleaver 2003).

Specifically, Bertaut and Tryon (2007) form monthly bilateral positions by starting with an initial

position as given by a benchmark survey, forming naïve monthly positions until the next

benchmark survey by using flow data and valuation adjustments (from, for foreign equity




                                                 5
markets, MSCI indexes), and then adjusting the estimates to eliminate the financial center bias

and other wedges between flows-based estimates and survey-based readings.1

          The resulting dataset is entirely consistent with officially reported data on U.S. holdings

of foreign equities published in U.S. Treasury‘s annual benchmark surveys and in BEA‘s U.S.

international investment position presentation, as well as with data in both the Philip R. Lane and

Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti (2007) dataset and the IMF‘s Coordinated Portfolio Investment

Survey (CPIS). In fact, an earlier version of the Bertaut Tryon dataset formed the basis for the

official U.S. entries in the CPIS for 2002, a year in which the United States did not conduct a

benchmark asset survey.2 Aggregate Bertaut and Tryon (2007) data—that is, aggregate foreign

positions in U.S. securities and aggregate (not bilateral) U.S. positions in foreign securities—

have been used in Curcuru, Tomas Dvorak, and Warnock (2008, 2010) and Curcuru, Thomas,

    Bertaut and Tryon (2007) includes a detailed discussion of the methodology.
2
    While the Bertaut and Tryon (2007) dataset is the best currently available for monthly U.S.
investment in foreign equities, in the future such data could be improved in two ways. First,
more frequent measurements of positions might become available; the less time between
measurements of positions, the more accurate are the interim estimates. In recent years, the
surveys have been annual, but in mid-2011 collection of monthly data on aggregate positions by
country will commence, which could improve the accuracy of interim holdings estimates.
Second, monthly estimates could become more accurate by incorporating more direct measures
of the returns U.S. investors earn in foreign markets. No such returns series currently exist, but
someone covered under the International Investment Act of 1987 could, in theory, construct
them. For now, we must rely on publicly available returns indices. Fortunately, within countries,
MSCI indices seem to be representative of U.S. investment; MSCI firms represent almost 80
percent of U.S. investors‘ foreign equity investment, and an examination of U.S. holdings in over
12,000 foreign firms as of a point in time (December 1997) showed that the correlation between
weights in the MSCI World Ex US Index and U.S. investors‘ foreign equity portfolios is quite
high at 0.77 (John Ammer et al. 2006).

                                                   6
and Warnock (2009) to show that (i) previous estimates of the differential between returns on

U.S. investors‘ foreign portfolios and returns on foreigners‘ U.S. positions were biased upward

and (ii) foreigners‘ U.S. portfolio returns were reduced by ill-timed switching between U.S.

bonds and U.S. equities, whereas U.S. investors‘ foreign returns were not degraded by switching

between asset classes.

       The bilateral holdings data provide the country weights in U.S. investors‘ portfolios.

Armed with these weights, and assuming that within each country the market (as represented by

MSCI firms) is held, the (unhedged) dollar returns earned by U.S. investors on their foreign

equity portfolios can be computed.



              B. The Relationship between Portfolio Reallocations and Past Returns



       Portfolio weights and returns enable an examination of the relationship between portfolio

reallocations and past returns using well-established portfolio-based techniques. To test for

momentum and portfolio rebalancing, we use the Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995)

momentum statistics to measure the degree to which U.S. investors actively change their

portfolio holdings in the direction of previous country-level stock returns. The statistics are

computed as follows. Specifically, define Xi,t as the active change in the weight of country i in

U.S. investors‘ foreign portfolio at time t:




(1)




                                               7
where ri,,t is the return on country i equities from period t-1 to t; rp,t is the return on U.S.

investors‘ foreign portfolio, defined as                         ; and wi,t is the weight of country i

at time t in U.S. investors‘ portfolio. If investors follow a buy-and-hold strategy, Xi,t would equal

zero. There are three momentum measures:



(2)

(3)

(4)



where Nt is the number of countries held in the portfolio at time t and k is the number of periods

the returns are lagged. A significant, positive LM measure indicates a momentum trading

strategy: U.S. investors on average increased the weights on countries whose equities performed

well (relative to the other markets) k periods ago. A significantly negative value of LM would be

evidence of contrarian trading, which is consistent with a portfolio balancing effect. The two

additional momentum statistics isolate trading when investors increase country weights (the BM

measure) from when they decrease country weights (the SM measure).

       The results are in Table 2. The LM measure is sometimes positive, sometimes negative,

but never statistically significant, indicating that when U.S. investors venture abroad, their

trading strategy can be characterized as neither momentum following nor contrarian. The BM

and SM lines show results when we split the sample into instances in which U.S. investors

increased the portfolio weight on country i (BM Buy Only) and instances when they decreased

the weight on country i (SM Sell Only). There is again very little evidence of momentum

trading; the coefficients on the BM statistic are usually (but not always) positive, indicating that

                                                 8
U.S. investors moved into markets that recently performed well, but the statistic is significant in

only two of nine cases. In contrast, there is strong evidence that U.S. investors can be

characterized as contrarian when selling; the SM (Sell Only) coefficient is negative for all

samples and lags, significantly so in eight of nine cases. In their international equity portfolios

U.S. investors sell past winners—consistent with a partial portfolio rebalancing effect—and this

behavior is apparent in both developed and emerging markets.3,4



              C. The Relationship between Portfolio Reallocations and Future Returns



          The conditional weight-based measure (CWM)—a portfolio-based measure developed by

Grinblatt and Titman (1993), Eckbo and Smith (1998), and Ferson and Khang (2002) that is

based on an estimate of the sum of the covariances between changes in portfolio weights and

3
    At first glance, our contrarian when selling results appear to contrast with Graciela Kaminsky,
Richard K. Lyons, and Sergio L. Schmukler (2004), who find that 13 Latin American mutual
funds exhibit momentum trading over the period from 1993 - 1999. However, most of their
evidence pertains to LM (Buy and Sell) at a zero lag; we do not analyze contemporaneous
momentum statistics because it is impossible to disentangle true momentum trading
(reallocations following price changes) from price pressure (price reacting to reallocations).
Moreover, Kaminsky, Lyons, and Schmukler (2004) do not compute BM and SM statistics, so
our studies are not directly comparable.
4
    One caveat about time series data on portfolios is that they include stock swaps that arise from
international mergers and acquisitions and can induce jumps in Xi,t that are not related to trading
(William L. Griever, Gary A. Lee, and Warnock 2001). There is no ideal way to deal with stock
swaps, so we reestimated (2), (3), and (4) omitting acquisitions via stock swaps. Excluding stock
swaps, the overall LM statistic remains insignificant in all cases, BM is positive and significant
in 4 out of 9 cases, and in 7 of 9 cases the SM statistic is negative and significant. Excluding
stock swaps, the weight of evidence still indicates that U.S. investors sell past winners.

                                                   9
future abnormal returns—is a direct measure of the relationship between portfolio reallocations

and prospective returns. The CWM is used in the literature as a gauge of private information or

an informational advantage. Under time-varying expected returns, a risk-averse investor with

non-increasing absolute risk aversion would move into (out of) a market when private

information indicates a positive (negative) abnormal return relative to that predicted using public

information, and in this case the estimate of the sum of the conditional covariances between

changes in portfolio weight and future abnormal returns would be positive.

        CWM is set up as follows. Define the estimate of the sum of the conditional covariances

as

where      is the benchmark weight of country i at time t. Let the benchmark be a buy-and-hold

weight of lag k defined as

                                                10
Equation (7) is an N vector of errors from estimating a linear function of future excess returns on

information variables when N is the maximum value of Nt for the full sample. Zt, a subset of        ,

are public information variables. We use three variables to proxy for public information: lagged

changes in the short-term interest rate (U.S. Treasury three-month yield); lagged changes in term

structure spread (U.S. Treasury 10-year yield minus U.S. Treasury 3-month yield); and lagged

world excess returns.5 Each error in equation (7) can be interpreted as an abnormal return.

Equation (8) is the error from estimating an average of the conditional covariances between

changes in portfolio weights and future abnormal returns. φp is the average conditional weight

measure across the full sample. We set up the following system of moment conditions



(9)



The vector of sample moment conditions g is a NL+L vector, where L is the number of

information variables, and the parameters are N vectors of L by 1 (bi) and the scalar φp . Because


5
    These information variables have been found to have robust predictive power for aggregate
country-level returns (Campbell R. Harvey, 1991; Ferson and Harvey, 1993; and Geert Bekaert
and Harvey, 1997). We also experimented with lagged local excess returns, but found that
including this variable does not change our results. We do not use the local or global dividend
yield. Ferson, Sergei Sarkisssian, and Timothy T. Simin (2003) illustrate that returns prediction
regressions with persistent variables such as the dividend yield tend to over-reject the null
hypothesis of no predictability. Moreover, John Y. Campbell and Motohiro Yogo (2006), who
account for this bias in a study of the U.S. market, and Andrew Ang and Bekaert (2007) and
Bekaert, Harvey, and Christian Lundblad (2007), who use Monte Carlo simulations for a range
of emerging and developed markets, find no predictive power for the dividend yield.

the starting date in our dataset varies by country, we follow Ravi Bansal and Magnus Dahlquist

(2000) and define an indicator variable Ii,t that denotes data availability for a country i at time t.

As long as Ii,t is independent of the error terms from equations (7) and (8)—for example, missing

data are not all in periods with abnormally high excess returns—the indicator variable can be

used to in effect fill in missing values with zeros. The augmented set of moments conditions is




(10)



       Table 3 shows estimates of the average conditional portfolio weight measure, φp,

estimated from the system of equations (7) and (8) against one-, two-, and three-month

benchmark buy-and-hold strategies (k=1, 2, 3, respectively). In the All Foreign Countries sample

and for Advanced Economies, the CWM statistic is positive and significant for all lags. U.S.

investors realize positive excess returns over a strategy that prohibits trading within their foreign

portfolios for one, two or three months; that is, they reallocate into markets just prior to positive

abnormal returns. For emerging markets, the evidence is less compelling; CWM statistic is

positive and large in magnitude, but is statistically significant only for k=2.

       The positive and significant estimate of the sum of the conditional covariances between

changes in portfolio weights (for the full sample and Advanced Economies) and future abnormal

returns can be interpreted as evidence of trading expertise from private information. Overall, the

main conclusion from the CWM analysis is that U.S. investors switch into markets prior to

abnormally strong returns, although the evidence from their emerging market portfolios is

somewhat weaker.

                         D. What Drives the Results: Data or Techniques?



        Relative to the seminal papers, our analysis differs along two dimensions. First, our data

differ not only because they are portfolio reallocations (consistent with theory) but also because

they correct a severe financial center bias in the as-reported bilateral flows data (Warnock and

Cleaver 2003). Second, the portfolio data enable the use of alternative portfolio-based

techniques; the main difference there is that each country is examined in conjunction with the

rest of the portfolio, not in isolation as in bilateral flows-based analysis.

        To determine what is driving our results, we rerun our analysis retaining the original

country-by-country techniques but using two alternative sets of data. First, we use ―restated‖

bilateral flows. Restated flows are not as-reported, but rather are consistent with the Bertaut and

Tryon (2007) dataset in that the financial center bias has been eliminated. Original empirical

techniques using restated bilateral flows (as opposed to TIC-reported bilateral flows) produce

results very similar to, if not stronger than, the results in the seminal papers (Table 4, columns 1-

3). Correcting for financial center biases does not yield results that differ from the old stylized

facts. Next, we conduct the same bilateral analysis but using portfolio reallocations (our X

variable from equation 1). Doing so results in many fewer positive and significant estimates

(columns 4-6).

        Relative to the seminal results, our results appear to be driven by the use of portfolio

reallocations instead of flows. This, in turn, suggests that the main problem with flows data is

that they do not account for changes in the size of (and reallocations within) U.S. portfolios.

Indeed, the correlation between flows and portfolio reallocations is quite low. If the mapping

from portfolio reallocations to flows were perfect, the correlation would be one. But across the



                                                   13
43 markets in our study, the correlation averages 0.28 and is less than 0.5 for all but five

countries. There is a link from portfolio reallocations to flows, but it is not straightforward in

theory and is not tight in the data.



                            III. Unconditional Portfolio Performance



        Results from the 1990s suggested that U.S. investors‘ foreign portfolios earned less than

the value-weighted benchmark; see, for example, evidence in BT. In contrast, updated data

indicates that in almost every year since 1990 U.S. investors‘ foreign portfolio beat a value-

weighted benchmark, constructed using MSCI market capitalization weights for the 43 countries

in our sample (Figure 2). The higher mean returns did not come at the expense of higher

volatility. Compared to the value-weighted foreign portfolio, U.S. investors‘ foreign equity

portfolio earned higher returns (0.21 percent monthly excess returns vs. 0.08 for the value-

weighted portfolio) with less volatility (4.7 vs. 4.9) for a significantly higher Sharpe ratio (Table

5). Relative performance within the set of developed countries is similar, with U.S. investors‘

portfolios earning higher returns with less volatility, producing a significantly greater Sharpe

ratio (4.1 vs. 1.3). In emerging markets, U.S. investors earned higher returns (0.82 percent per

month vs. 0.71 percent) but with slightly higher volatility (7.5 vs. 7.2). The unconditional

performance of U.S. investors‘ international equity portfolios has been quite good.



                                         IV. Implications




                                                 14
         An obvious implication of our results is that theoretical models of international portfolio

choice should not be explicitly designed to produce returns-chasing behavior, as some have in

the past (Guidolin, 2005; Albuquerque, Bauer, and Schneider 2007). Returns-chasing can arise

naturally from a rich model, such as in Victoria Hnatkovska (2010), but theorists should hesitate

before treating returns-chasing as a stylized fact a model should be designed to produce.6

         Somewhat more subtle but perhaps equally important is that theoretical international

macro models that incorporate international portfolio choice, which have recently become more

prevalent (e.g., Cedric Tille and Eric van Wincoop 2008, 2010; Michael B. Devereux and Alan

Sutherland 2010, forthcoming; Hnatkovska 2010), must take seriously the fact that fluctuations

in financial wealth are important. Tille and van Wincoop (2010) stress the role of portfolio

growth, but, following Aart Kraay and Jaume Ventura (2000, 2003), portfolio growth in their

model is essentially net national savings (net capital flows). Just as the empirical capital flows

literature has begun to focus on gross instead of net flows (Fernando A. Broner et al 2010;

Kristin J. Forbes and Warnock 2010), theorists must recognize that substantial variations in

financial wealth can confound some of the facts around which models are being built.

         Our analysis also suggests that empiricists should refrain from attaching labels like

herding behavior and returns-chasing when the basis for the analysis is flows data. For example,

Ken Miyajima and Huanhuan Zheng (2010), part of the IMF‘s October 2010 Global Financial

Stability Report, examines the relationship between (proprietary) bilateral flows and returns, and

reports that investors chase returns and exhibit herding. We find the exact opposite results using



6
    Even in models rich enough to deliver a clear prediction about the relationship between flows
and returns (e.g., Dumas, Lewis, and Osambela 2010), focusing on changes in portfolio weights
rather than flows might be more appropriate.

                                                 15
portfolio data. In our view, if the concept concerns portfolio adjustments, portfolio rather than

flows data should be employed.7

          Many empirical studies have found that foreigners perform poorly when investing in

countries ranging from Indonesia (Dvorak, 2005) and Korea (Hyuk Choe, Bong-Chan Kho, and

Stulz, 2005) to Germany (Harald Hau, 2001), so our finding that U.S. investors reallocate into

markets just prior to strong returns might appear puzzling. However, recall that our analysis

concerns country picking, not within-country timing and execution. Moreover, our results are not

inconsistent with empirical work on the predictability of equity prices, especially for one market

relative to another. Ferson and Harvey (1993) find some predictability of international equity

returns, Kenneth Kasa (1992) finds mean reversion (and, hence, some predictability) in two-

country equity portfolios, and Anthony J. Richards (1995) and Ronald Balvers, Yangru Wu, and

Erik Gilliland (2000) find that country-specific returns relative to a world index exhibit mean

reversion, suggesting that the contrarian strategy of Werner F. M. DeBondt and Richard H.

Thaler (1985) and Richards (1997) might be profitable. Thus, both partial rebalancing—the

selling of equity markets that performed well in the recent past—and switching into markets that

subsequently have high abnormal returns are consistent with the literature on the predictability of

international equity market returns. While it may well be difficult for a foreigner to time a

market, some skill at timing reallocations between markets is plausible and consistent with both

theory and our results.




7
    To be exact, our results concern the foreign portfolio. It is plausible that returns-chasing could
be absent in the foreign portfolio but present in the global portfolio, which includes domestic
holdings. However, there is also no evidence of returns-chasing in U.S. investors‘ global equity
portfolios (Curcuru et al. 2010).

                                                   16
                                          V. Conclusion



        Many of the stylized facts regarding U.S. investment abroad came out of an era when

appropriate data were not available. Many of the seminal results relied on bilateral capital flows

data, when the theories called for data on portfolio reallocations. Theory had progressed enough

so that researchers knew what relationships should be examined, but appropriate data did not

exist. A limitation of flows-based analysis is that it can be confounded by wealth effects.

Portfolio-based techniques are consistent with theories of international portfolio choice and are

not subject to this limitation.

        Using portfolio-based data and techniques, we find evidence that contradicts long-

standing stylized facts. U.S. investors do not chase past returns, nor do they refrain from

rebalancing their international portfolios. Rather, they sell past winners, a form of partial

rebalancing. U.S. investors do not appear to be at an informational disadvantage when they

venture abroad. Rather, consistent with having superior information, there is a positive

relationship between portfolio reallocations and future returns; U.S. investors increase portfolio

weights on a country‘s equity market just prior to its strong performance. Our results indicate

that U.S. investors beat the value-weighted foreign benchmark by an average of 162 basis points

per year from 1990-2008.

        Our analysis suggests researchers and policymakers should be cautious when using flow

data to examine portfolio behavior. Best is to use portfolio data. In cases in which flows data

must be used, controlling for changes in wealth is vital.

Means, standard deviations, and Sharpe ratios (mean divided by standard deviation) for

portfolios of foreign equities. Returns are in excess of a one-month Eurodollar interest rate and

are expressed in monthly percentage points. Value-weighted benchmarks are portfolios based on

MSCI market capitalization weights. U.S. investors’ portfolios are based on U.S. investors‘

holdings. The Chi-squared: Sharpe Ratio is a test statistic for the null hypothesis that Sharpe

ratios in the two columns are equal. Sample period is January 1990 through December 2008.

Asymptotic p-values computed from Newey and West (1987) standard errors are in brackets. *

Statistically significant at the 10 percent level.
