                                         ABSTRACT

A growing literature suggests that high-income countries export high-quality goods. Two
hypotheses may explain such specialization, with different implications for welfare, inequality,
and trade policy. Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011) formalize the Linder hypothesis
that home demand determines the pattern of specialization and therefore predict that high-income
locations export high-quality products. The factor-proportions model also predicts that skill-
abundant, high-income locations export skill-intensive, high-quality products. Prior empirical
evidence does not separate these explanations. I develop a model that nests both hypotheses and
employ microdata on US manufacturing plants' shipments and factor inputs to quantify the two
mechanisms' roles in quality specialization across US cities. Home-market demand explains as
much of the relationship between income and quality as differences in factor usage.

1       Introduction
The Linder hypothesis is the oldest theory of quality specialization in international trade.
Staffan Burenstam Linder (1961) posited that profitably exporting a product requires robust
demand for that product in the exporter’s home market. Since higher-income consumers
tend to purchase higher-quality products, he conjectured that local demand causes high-
income countries to produce and export high-quality products. This “home-market effect”
explanation of quality specialization was recently formalized by Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and
Helpman (2011) in a general-equilibrium model. In contrast, the canonical factor-abundance
theory of comparative advantage identifies high-income countries’ greater supplies of capital
and skills as the reason they produce and export high-quality products.1 These competing
theories have distinct implications for welfare, inequality, and trade policy. Empirical work
to date has not identified the importance of each mechanism in quality specialization.
    The empirical challenge is that the two theories make the same predictions about country-
level trade flows. Each predicts that high-income locations export high-quality products,
consistent with the finding that higher-income countries export products at higher prices
within narrowly defined product categories (Schott, 2004; Hummels and Klenow, 2005).2
Similarly, each predicts that non-homothetic preferences cause high-income locations to im-
port high-quality products, consistent with the finding that higher-income countries import
more from higher-price exporters (Hallak, 2006; Choi, Hummels, and Xiang, 2009). Combin-
ing these export and import patterns, each predicts that countries with more similar incomes
trade more intensely with each other, as found by Hallak (2010) and Bernasconi (2013).3
    In this paper, I use theory and data to quantify the roles of the home-market effect
and the factor-abundance mechanism in quality specialization across US cities. I develop a
model that yields an empirical approach to separate the two mechanisms. It exploits plant-
level data on shipments and inputs and location-level data on populations and incomes. I
implement the empirical strategy using data on US cities and manufacturing plants and find
that the home-market effect influences quality specialization across cities of different income
levels as much as factor abundance.
    To guide my empirical investigation, I introduce a theoretical framework that nests the
    1
     For example, Schott (2004, p. 676) suggests that “high-wage countries use their endowment advantage
to add features or quality to their varieties that are not present among the varieties emanating from low-wage
countries.” Linking quality specialization to relative factor supplies dates to at least Falvey (1981).
   2
     Throughout this paper, observed “prices” refer to unit values, which are shipments’ value-to-quantity
ratios. Like international trade data, the data used in this paper describe transactions’ values and quantities.
   3
     Hallak (2010, p. 459) notes that “several theories can explain a systematic relationship between per
capita income and quality production... The prediction of the Linder hypothesis about the direction of trade
can be founded on any of these theories.”



                                                       1
two mechanisms, each of which has been studied separately. Individuals have non-homothetic
preferences over a homogeneous and a differentiated good; higher-income individuals con-
sume higher-quality varieties of the differentiated good. This demand assumption makes
high-income locations import high-quality products and generates the home-market effect
when trade is costly. Individuals have heterogeneous skills, and goods can be ranked by
their skill intensities. This production assumption allows skill-abundant locations to have a
comparative advantage in higher qualities when quality is skill-intensive. The model serves
two purposes. First, it confirms that each mechanism alone can generate trade flows con-
sistent with the empirical findings described above. Second, the theory identifies a way to
separate the two mechanisms using plant-level data. Factor abundance affects specialization
exclusively through plants’ factor usage. Conditional on plant-level factor intensity, demand
alone determines quality specialization. Thus, plant-level data on shipments and inputs can
be combined with data on locations’ incomes to identify the home-market effect.
    To implement this empirical strategy, I use microdata on US manufacturing plants’ ship-
ments and inputs from the Commodity Flow Survey and the Census of Manufactures. These
sources provide microdata on plants in many cities with different income levels in a single
dataset. In contrast, I am not aware of a source containing plant-level shipment and input
data from many countries.4 I document that US cities exhibit the key patterns found in inter-
national data. Both outgoing and incoming shipments exhibit higher prices in higher-income
cities, and cities with more similar incomes trade more intensely with each other. I there-
fore proceed to use these data to distinguish between the two hypotheses by constructing
empirical measures of factor inputs and market access.
    Guided by the model, my empirical investigation yields two main results. First, observed
differences in plants’ inputs, which may be induced by either mechanism, explain only a
modest share of within-product specialization across cities of different incomes. Most of the
variation is within-factor-intensity variation. Second, a market-access measure that describes
the income composition of proximate potential customers is strongly related to the pattern
of within-intensity specialization. Quantitatively, I find that the home-market effect plays at
least as large a role as the factor-abundance mechanism in quality specialization by income.
    More specifically, in my empirical work I infer quality specialization from two empirical
measures commonly used in the literature: unit values and demand shifters. The first
measure is based on the idea that higher-quality products sell at higher prices and has been
widely used in the international trade literature (Hummels and Skiba, 2004; Schott, 2004;
   4
     My empirical approach thus follows the counsel of Krugman (1991, p.3): “if we want to understand
international specialization, a good place to start is with local specialization. The data will be better and
pose fewer problems of compatibility, and the underlying economic forces will be less distorted by government
policies.”


                                                     2
Hallak, 2006; Baldwin and Harrigan, 2011). The second measure follows Sutton (1991, 2012),
Berry (1994), Hummels and Klenow (2005), Khandelwal (2010), and others in identifying
a product as higher-quality when, conditional on price, it has higher market share. When
both measures are available in my data, they yield comparable results.
    The first empirical finding is that observed factor-usage differences explain a modest
share of within-product specialization. Guided by the model, I construct factor-intensity
measures using data on plants’ employees, equipment, and wages. Between-intensity vari-
ation explains about one quarter of the covariance between locations’ per capita incomes
and outgoing shipment prices. It explains a larger share of the covariance between in-
comes and demand shifters, but observed factor-usage differences never explain more than
half of the specialization by income per capita in any regression specification. Since the
factor-abundance mechanism operates only through between-intensity variation, this finding
bounds its explanatory power, at least in terms of observed factor usage.5
    The second empirical finding is that the home-market effect plays a quantitatively signif-
icant role in quality specialization, at least as large as differences in observed factor usage.
Using data on cities’ incomes and geographic locations, I construct two market-access mea-
sures describing the income composition of proximate potential customers. The first omits
the residents of the city in which the plant is located, so that it does not reflect any unob-
served local supply-side mechanisms. I find that this measure of demand is strongly positively
correlated with manufacturing plants’ outgoing shipment prices. In fact, this measure ex-
plains a larger share of the covariance between income per capita and outgoing shipment
prices, 36%, than plant-level factor usage. The second market-access measure follows the
model by including residents in the city of production. This demand measure consistently
explains a larger share of the observed specialization across cities of different incomes than
plants’ factor inputs. Within-intensity variation in market access explains 58% of the covari-
ance between product prices and incomes per capita, twice that attributable to factor-usage
differences.6 It explains a similar share, 48%, of the covariance between demand shifters
and incomes per capita.7 Market access is orthogonal to incoming shipment characteristics,
so proximity to higher-income consumers is associated with net exporting of higher-quality
varieties. I conclude that the home-market effect for quality plays a substantial role in the
economic geography of US manufacturing.
   5
     Section 5 discusses the particular properties unobserved inputs would need to exhibit in order to account
for my findings.
   6
     Using only within-intensity variation is conservative. Unconditionally, variation in market access ac-
counts for 77% of the price-income covariance.
   7
     Factor-usage differences explain 46% of the covariance between demand shifters and incomes per capita,
so there is considerably smaller residual variation in the decomposition of this measure.



                                                      3
    These findings are important because the two theories have distinct implications. In
predicting the quality of a location’s exports, one emphasizes its relative factor supplies
while the other stresses its relative proximity to high-income customers. These yield different
predictions, for instance, for poor countries that have rich neighbors.8 To the extent that
specializing in producing high-quality goods improves growth prospects, the home-market
effect found here suggests an advantage of proximity to high-income countries.9 And since
trade policy governs market access, governments may influence quality specialization.10
    My empirical strategy of using plant-level data from US cities of different income levels
links my results to a number of findings in urban and regional economics. I provide the first
characterization of production specialization within product categories across cities. Previous
empirical work describing variation in manufacturing across US cities has focused on inter-
industry specialization (Henderson, 1991; Holmes and Stevens, 2004; Davis and Dingel, 2014)
or described the products available to retail consumers without tracking production locations
(Handbury and Weinstein, 2015). The finding that the geography of demand plays a major
role in specialization complements a nascent literature describing the consumption benefits
of living in cities with high-income populations (Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz, 2001; Handbury,
2012; Diamond, 2016).
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the two competing hypotheses.
Section 3 introduces a model nesting both and shows how to separate them using plant-level
data. Section 4 describes the US microdata and pattern of specialization and exchange.
Section 5 reports the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.


2       Background
Burenstam Linder (1961) posited that demand differences can determine production special-
ization.11 Krugman (1980) formalized how economies of scale and trade costs can cause a
country with a larger home market for a product to be a net exporter of that good. First,
economies of scale cause each product to be produced in a single location and sold to many
markets. Second, producing in the larger market minimizes transportation costs. Krug-
man (1980) obtains this result by assuming exogenous differences in countries’ demand for
    8
     For example, Mexico and Turkey are developing economies that are proximate to high-income customers
in the US and EU, respectively. Verhoogen (2008) shows that increased incentive to export caused quality
upgrading by Mexican firms.

     Helpman and Krugman (1989, p.2): “It is clear that changing one’s view of why trade happens, and
how international markets work, ought to change one’s view of what kind of trade policy is appropriate.”
  11
     His informal narrative focused on the role of entrepreneurial discovery (p.89-90). He emphasized infor-
mational costs of distance more than transport costs and did not explicitly address economics of scale.

different industries’ products. Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011) show how in-
come differences can determine quality specialization within products when preferences are
non-homothetic. In their model, the composition of income determines the composition of
demand, since higher-income households purchase higher-quality varieties. Plants produce
higher qualities in higher-income locations because it is more profitable to produce in the
larger home market. In equilibrium, greater demand elicits a more-than-proportionate pro-
duction response, such that high-income locations are net exporters of high-quality products.
    The canonical factor-abundance theory of comparative advantage can yield the same set
of predictions when preferences are non-homothetic. An early example is Markusen (1986),
in which the income elasticity of demand for capital-intensive manufactures is greater than
one, so that high-income, capital-abundant countries specialize in manufactures that are
exported to other high-income countries.12 Many other models make analogous assumptions
about the alignment of comparative advantage and relative demand, so that “tastes and
capabilities are correlated” but not causally linked (Murphy and Shleifer, 1997, p. 6).13 In
these theories, higher-income countries are net exporters of higher-quality products if the
comparative-advantage mechanism exceeds differences in demand.
    Thus, both theories are consistent with the growing body of empirical evidence suggest-
ing that higher-income countries export and import higher-quality products. Schott (2004)
shows that unit values in product-level US import data are higher for higher-income, more
capital- and skill-abundant exporting countries; Hummels and Klenow (2005) find a positive
relationship between unit values and exporter incomes using data from 59 importing coun-
tries. Khandelwal (2010) estimates demand shifters using US import data and finds that
they are positively related to exporting countries’ GDP per capita and capital abundance.
Feenstra and Romalis (2014) and Hallak and Schott (2011), using other methods, also report
that higher-income countries export products inferred to be higher quality.
    These common predictions for country-level trade flows motivate this paper’s use of plant-
level data to separate the two mechanisms. In short, the challenge prior work has faced is
that customers and workers are the same people in country-level data.14 As my model
  12
     See also Bergstrand (1990). Strictly speaking, these are general-equilibrium models of intersectoral
specialization. Falvey (1981) introduced a partial-equilibrium model of within-industry specialization across
qualities by capital intensity consonant with the within-product interpretation of factor-abundance theory
suggested by Schott (2004).
  13
     Two recent papers study specialization across sectors using models with non-homothetic preferences.
Using aggregate trade flows, Fieler (2011) estimates a two-sector version of the Eaton and Kortum (2002)
Ricardian model. She infers that the more income-elastic industry has greater dispersion in idiosyncratic
productivities, causing higher-TFP countries to have comparative advantage in these luxuries. Examining
variation across 56 sectors, Caron, Fally, and Markusen (2014) find a positive correlation between industries’
income elasticities of demand and skill intensities. These perfect-competition models do not feature home-
market effects.
  14
     In addition to looking at country-level capital abundance, Schott (2004) shows that the unit values

                                                      5
demonstrates, assessing the factor-abundance hypothesis requires looking at the factors of
production employed by exporting plants. A series of studies using firm-level data have shown
that exporters and firms producing higher-quality products use more capital-intensive and
skill-intensive production (Verhoogen, 2008; Hallak and Sivadasan, 2013). These firm-level
findings are consistent with the factor-abundance explanation of quality specialization. But
they do not provide evidence that differences in factor abundance relate to differences in
output across locations, since they describe establishments in a single location.
    As a result, there is no prior empirical evidence distinguishing the home-market effect
for quality from factor-abundance-determined quality specialization. There is an empiri-
cal literature on the Helpman and Krugman (1985) home-market effect, in which a larger
home market causes specialization in the industry with greater economies of scale (Davis
and Weinstein, 1999, 2003; Hanson and Xiang, 2004). This work has relied upon using
observable sectoral characteristics, such as transport costs and demand elasticities. Such
cross-industry variation is unavailable when considering quality specialization within prod-
ucts. Moreover, since the distributions of income and human capital are closely related, both
across countries and cities, it is empirically difficult to distinguish the home-market effect
from factor-abundance theories of comparative advantage using aggregate data.
    I proceed to introduce a theoretical framework that incorporates both mechanisms and
their interaction in equilibrium. This allows me to derive an empirical strategy that relies
on observing plants’ inputs and outputs.


3     Theory
I introduce a theoretical framework in which both market access and factor abundance may
influence the pattern of production and exchange. I use a high-dimensional model with
many locations, qualities, and skills.15 It nests a version of the Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and
Helpman (2011, henceforth FGH) model and a factor-abundance model as special cases.
Nesting the two mechanisms in one framework allows me to analyze each in isolation and
their interaction. For brevity, details and derivations appear in appendix A.
    The theory delivers two results key to the empirical investigation. First, it confirms that
of exported products are positively correlated with the capital-labor ratio of the relevant three-digit ISIC
industry in the exporting country. However, much of the variation reflects cross-country differences in capital
abundance, a fact noted by Dollar, Wolff, and Baumol (1988, p. 33). The mean pairwise correlation between
the 28 industries’ capital-labor ratios across the 34 countries in the Schott (2003) data is 0.5. Moreover,
industry data necessarily aggregate heterogeneous plants and may not represent exporters’ factor intensities.
  15
     Matching the facts that both outgoing and incoming shipment prices are increasing in average income
necessitates a many-location model. Making comparisons across and within qualities of different factor
intensities, which is at the heart of my empirical strategy, necessitates many quality levels.


                                                      6
quality specialization is overdetermined. Each mechanism alone can cause higher-income
locations to produce, export, and import higher-quality varieties in equilibrium. Second,
the theory identifies an important distinction between the two mechanisms. Conditional on
plant-level skill intensity, any correlation between local income and plants’ output quality
is due to the home-market effect. This result is the basis of my empirical approach. The
model also informs my construction of empirical measures of the relevant objects.
    In the model, there are K locations indexed by k. Location k has a population of size Nk
made up of heterogeneous individuals whose skills, indexed by ω, are distributed according to
the density f (ω, k). These skill distributions are exogenous, a standard assumption in trade
theory that is innocuous for the purpose of distinguishing the roles of the two mechanisms.16
I assume that locations can be ranked by their skill abundance in the likelihood-ratio sense.
The density f (ω, k) is strictly log-supermodular, so high-k locations are skill-abundant.17


3.1      Preferences
Consumer preferences are non-homothetic, so demand varies with income. As in FGH,
individuals consume a homogeneous good and one unit of a differentiated good. Varieties of
the latter are indexed by j, with price pj and quality qj ∈ Q. For individual h, the utility of
consuming z units of the homogeneous good and a unit of variety j is

                                                  uhj = zqj + hj ,                                                   (1)

with idiosyncratic valuation hj drawn from a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution.
    A consumer chooses quantity z and variety j to maximize utility. The homogeneous good
is the numeraire. A consumer with income yh therefore chooses j to maximize (yh −pj )qj +hj ,
where z = yh −pj . As FGH show, if ’s GEV distribution has dispersion θq for q, this yields a
nested-logit demand system in which the fraction of consumers with income y buying variety
j of quality q can be expressed as ρj (y) = ρj|q · ρq (y). ρq (y) is the fraction with income y
                                                                  P
who choose a product of quality q, and ρj|q = exp (−pj q/θq ) / j 0 :qj0 =q exp (−pj 0 q/θq ) is the
fraction buying j among those buying quality q. The latter is income-invariant.
    This demand system has two important properties. First, the complementarity between
z and qj in equation (1) makes higher-income consumers more likely to choose higher-quality
  16
      Factor mobility would be relevant in considering counterfactuals, since individuals may migrate across
cities in response to economic changes. My empirics characterize the equilibrium observed in the data, and
there is substantial variation in both skill distributions and income levels across US cities.
   17
      I make extensive use of log-supermodularity as an analytical tool; see Costinot (2009) for an introduction.
In R2 , a function f (ω, k) is log-supermodular if ω > ω 0 , k > k 0 ⇒ f (ω, k)f (ω 0 , k 0 ) ≥ f (ω, k 0 )f (ω 0 , k) and
strictly log-supermodular when the inequality is strict. Using educational attainment data, Davis and Dingel
(2014) provide evidence that US cities’ skill distributions are broadly consistent with this assumption.

varieties. Market share ρq (y) varies with income according to ρq1(y) ∂ρ∂y
                                                                        q (y)
                                                                              = q − qa (y), where
qa (y) is the average quality consumed by individuals with income y. Second, if firms ignore
                                                                      ∂ ln ρ (y)
their own effect on the price index, the elasticity of demand is ∂ lnjpj = −pj qj /θq , so
producers of quality q charge a constant additive markup of mq ≡ θq /q.18


3.2     Production
Production involves employing workers of heterogeneous skills, so relative factor supplies may
be a source of comparative advantage. The homogeneous good is competitively produced and
freely traded. Differentiated varieties are produced by monopolistically competitive firms.
    Production of the homogeneous good exhibits constant returns to scale, so the total cost
of producing quantity x(z, k) at unit cost c(z, k) is x(z, k)c(z, k).19 Skill ω in location k
commands wage w(ω, k). Hiring `(ω) units of skill ω per unit of output, the unit cost is
                            Z                                    Z                                        σ
                                                                                                         σ−1
                                                                                             σ−1
          c(z, k) = min            `(ω)w(ω, k)dω      s.t.              b(ω, z)`(ω)           σ    dω           ≥ 1.
                     `(ω)   ω∈Ω                                   ω∈Ω


The technological coefficients b(ω, z) describe the contribution of each skill type in production
and therefore characterize the homogeneous good’s skill intensity. The elasticity of substitu-
tion across inputs σ is greater than one and finite. Cost minimization yields per-unit input
demands `(ω, z, k) = w(ω, k)−σ b(ω, z)σ wherever x(z, k) > 0.

     I use the nested-logit demand system in part because the constant-additive-markup property makes the
model analytically tractable. Only the first property, that high-income consumers are more likely to purchase
high-quality varieties, is necessary for the home-market effect to influence the pattern of specialization.

     I abuse notation using z to index the homogeneous good. In equation (1), z denotes the quantity of this

numeraire. Taking competitors’ behavior as given, the profit-maximizing prices charged by
firm j producing quality q in k are a constant markup over cost, pjk0 = c(q, k) + τqkk0 + mq .
    We can now identify the equilibrium sales level in location k 0 for a variety of quality
q produced in k, which I denote dqkk0 . If k 0 has Nk0 consumers with income distribution
g(y, k 0 ), this is dqkk0 = Nk0 ρj (y)g(y, k 0 )dy. Denote the number of firms producing varieties
                               R

of quality q in location k by nq,k . Plugging in optimal prices, sales dqkk0 can be written in
terms of (vectors of) the number of firms (n), unit costs (c), and trade costs (τ ).
                     Z
       dqkk0 = Nk0        ρj (q)ρq (y)g(y, k 0 )dy = exp(−(c(q, k) + τqkk0 )/mq )Nk0 Γk0 (q, n, c, τ )

The function Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ) describes the share of demand in location k 0 for quality q given
the equilibrium prices and locations of all producers. A firm’s sales of quality q to k 0 from k
depend on this demand share, population Nk0 , marginal cost c(q, k), and trade cost τqkk0 .20

In equilibrium, labor markets clear and firms earn zero profits. The full-employment condi-

tion for each skill ω in each location k is f (ω, k) = x(z, k)`(ω, z, k)+ q∈Q nq,k x(q, k)`(ω, q, k).
Plugging in firms’ labor demands and defining nz,k = 1, we can write this as
                                                   X
                          f (ω, k) = w(ω, k)−σ            nr,k x(r, k)b(ω, r)σ c(r, k)σ ,                 (2)

   The free-entry condition says that the profits from producing quality q in location k are
non-positive everywhere and zero where firms are active: πq,k ≤ 0 ∀k and nq,k > 0 ⇒ πq,k = 0.

3.4     Equilibrium pattern of specialization and trade
Given the geographic distribution of skills, individuals’ preferences, and the production tech-
nology, the equilibrium pattern of production and trade depends on two forces. Trade costs
  20
    The model therefore implies a gravity equation for exports of q from k to k 0 , but q is not an observable
characteristic. Since gravity equations do not aggregate by summation, the model does not deliver a closed-
form gravity equation for total exports of differentiated varieties from k to k 0 .

shape the pattern of market access and therefore the home-market effect. Skill intensities,
governed by b(ω, r), link output composition to skill supplies through labor-market clearing.
    I consider two cases for each force. The two trade-cost matrices are costless trade and
trade costs that are small but positive, τqkk0 > 0 for k 6= k 0 and τqkk = 0. The two skill-
intensity cases are uniform skill intensities, b(ω, r) = b1 (ω)b2 (r), and skill intensities that are
increasing in quality, b(ω, r) weakly log-supermodular.21
    I analyze the four cases in turn. When neither mechanism is active, the pattern of
production is indeterminate. Section 3.4.1 characterizes equilibrium when only the factor-
abundance mechanism is active, while Section 3.4.2 does likewise for the home-market effect.
In each case, high-k locations both export and import high-q varieties. Thus, each mechanism
alone could account for previously documented empirical patterns. Section 3.4.3 describes
equilibrium when both mechanisms are active and shows how to identify the home-market
effect after conditioning on plants’ skill intensities.
    To facilitate the analysis, define a skill-intensity index i(r) such that i(r) = i(r0 ) ⇐⇒
b(ω, r) ∝ b(ω, r0 ) and i(r) > i(r0 ) ⇒ r > r0 . This index groups together products so that
producers in the higher-i group employ relatively more skilled labor. Let i(r) equal the
lowest r in this set of products, so that b(ω, i) is strictly log-supermodular by definition.

3.4.1     Skill-intensive quality and costless trade

First, consider the case when trade is costless and b(ω, r) is weakly log-supermodular. Cost-
less trade (τqkk0 = 0 ∀q ∀k ∀k 0 ) means that πq,k in the zero-profit condition (3) depends on
k only through the c (q, k) term. In the absence of trade costs, variation in demand across
destinations k 0 is orthogonal to the location of production. Producing quality q is most
profitable wherever its unit cost c(q, k) is lowest.
    Skill abundance governs the pattern of production through labor-market clearing. Equa-
tion (2) and the strict log-supermodularity of f (ω, k) imply, for k > k 0 and ω > ω 0 ,

  21
     When b(ω, q) is log-supermodular, quality is skill-intensive. By allowing z to take any value, I make
no assumption on the skill intensity of the homogeneous good, but I assume that there is a value z making
b(ω, r) a log-supermodular function.
                                                                                                          f (ω,k0 )

    This inequality means that more skill-abundant (higher-k) locations produce more skill-
intensive

(Eω0 ,k b(ω0 ,i)σ is greater) and/or skilled labor in k is relatively cheaper ( w(ω 0 ,k)−σ is greater).

The latter implies skill-intensive products’ unit costs are relatively lower in k, and thus
k’s output must be more skill-intensive in equilibrium. When b(ω, q) is log-supermodular,
higher-quality varieties are more skill-intensive, so we interpret inequality (4) as saying that
k absorbs its greater supply of higher skills by producing higher-quality varieties.23
    This result describes the factor-abundance mechanism for quality specialization. Note
that specialization across qualities of the same skill intensity is indeterminate in this case,
because inequality (4) depends on i(q), not q. Skill-abundant locations produce higher-
quality varieties only because such products are more skill-intensive.24
    What about the equilibrium pattern of demand? Since trade is costless, varieties’ prices
and income-specific market shares do not vary across locations. Denoting the equilibrium
variety counts and factor prices by the vectors n̄ and c̄, sales volumes Γk (q, n̄, c̄, 0) vary with
location k solely due to differences in the composition of income. Demand for higher-quality
varieties is relatively greater in higher-income locations.
    Result. When trade is costless, there is no home-market effect. When quality is skill-
intensive and skill-abundant locations are higher-income locations, higher-income locations
both produce more of and have greater demand for higher-quality varieties in equilibrium.

3.4.2     Uniform skill intensities and costly trade

When skill intensities are uniform, unit costs are multiplicatively separable in (r, k) and can
                                σ
be written as c(r, k) = b2 (r) 1−σ c(k). The labor-market clearing condition (2) becomes
                                                              X                         σ
                       f (ω, k) = b1 (ω)σ w(ω, k)−σ c(k)            nr,k x(r, k)b2 (r) 1−σ .
                                                            r∈z∪Q


Since nothing inside the sum depends on skill ω, the factor-abundance mechanism imposes no
restrictions on the equilibrium composition of local production nr,k x(r, k). Any observed re-
  23
     This interpretation neglects the skill intensity of the homogeneous good. If the homogeneous good is
more skill-intensive, skill-abundant locations may produce more of the homogeneous good rather than higher-
quality varieties. When factor intensities vary both across and within goods, the factor-abundance mechanism
may operate along both margins. Empirically, Schott (2004) documents that there is little correlation
between countries’ factor supplies and across-good specialization. Assuming that the homogeneous good is
the least skill-intensive product is sufficient to guarantee that high-k locations specialize in high-q varieties.
  24
     This result has been derived without any reference to the demand system beyond the fact that costless
trade makes consumers’ locations irrelevant to the optimal production location. Thus, the empirical investi-
gation of whether the factor-abundance mechanism alone can explain the pattern of specialization does not
depend upon the functional form of the preferences in equation (1).

lationship between f (ω, k) and the pattern of specialization results from the demand channel
and reflects the connection between g(y, k) and f (ω, k).
    To characterize how specialization is determined by demand, I follow the approach taken
by FGH to determining the equilibrium pattern of production when trade costs are small
and locations specialize.25 With uniform skill intensities, the zero-profit condition is

                                    σ             X
          πq,k = mq exp(−b2 (q) 1−σ c(k)/mq )           exp(−τqkk0 /mq )Nk0 Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ) − fq ≤ 0.
                                                   k0


Through this condition, demand governs the location of production in equilibrium. Consider
two cases, depending on whether wages vary across locations.
     When factor prices equalize, c(k) = 1 ∀k and πq,k varies only with demand. If trade
costs are uniform (τqkk0 = τq ∀k 0 6= k), then profits vary only with home demand, πq,k >
πq,k0 ⇐⇒ Nk Γk (q, n, c, τ ) > Nk0 Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ). Provided that wages are increasing in skill,
high-k locations are high-income because they are skill-abundant, and they have greater
demand for high-q varieties. This makes producing high-q varieties more profitable in high-k
locations. When population sizes are equal, Proposition 6 of FGH describes the resulting
equilibrium: if location k produces quality q and location k 0 < k produces quality q 0 , then
q 0 < q. Similarly, since higher-k locations have greater demand for higher-q varieties, their
imports are higher-quality (see Proposition 7 of FGH). In the case of σ = ∞ and Nk = 1 ∀k,
the model under consideration reduces to that in section VII of FGH.
     When factor prices do not equalize, the location with the lowest c(k) is the most attractive
cost-wise for all producers. Firms locate in higher-cost locations only if these locations have
greater demand for their output so that they save on transport costs. In other words, when
trade costs are uniform, if nq,k > 0 and c(k) > c(k 0 ), it must be that Nk Γk (q, n, c, τ ) >
Nk0 Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ). When population sizes are equal and trade costs are sufficiently low, this
difference in demand is due solely to the income composition of the two locations. Thus,
higher-income locations specialize in producing higher-quality varieties and export them.
     Result. Suppose that population sizes are equal, skill intensities are uniform, and trade
costs are uniform and small. If k > k 0 , nq,k > 0, and nq0 ,k0 > 0, then q > q 0 and nq,k0 = nq0 ,k =
0. Higher-income locations are net exporters of higher-quality varieties because demand for
such qualities is greater in such locations. If consumers in k and k 0 import varieties of
qualities q and q 0 with q > q 0 , then k imports relatively more of quality q.
     Thus, the home-market effect yields equilibrium trade patterns that match the empirical
evidence summarized in section 2. Since we obtained the same result in the previous section
via the factor-abundance mechanism, quality specialization is overdetermined.
  25
       Appendix section A.4.2 discusses the case when trade costs are large and production is diversified.


                                                        12
   Result. Higher-income locations both exporting and importing higher-quality varieties is
consistent with the factor-abundance mechanism or the home-market effect operating alone.

3.4.3       Skill-intensive quality and costly trade

Now suppose both mechanisms are active. When quality is skill-intensive and trade is costly,
the labor-market clearing condition (2) and the zero-profit condition (3) jointly govern the
pattern of quality specialization. The critical result that underlies my empirical investigation
is that demand alone determines specialization across varieties of the same skill intensity.
    First, consider the labor-market-clearing inequality, which is governed by the factor-
abundance mechanism. As shown previously, inequality (4) implies that output of higher-i
varieties is relatively greater in higher-k locations. Thus, skill intensities govern the broad
pattern of production.
    Second, consider the zero-profit condition, which depends on potential customers’ incomes
through demand levels. To summarize demand, define a market-access term
                                            X
                              Mq,k (τ ) ≡        exp(−τqkk0 /mq )Nk0 Γk0 (q, n̄, c̄, 0),
                                            k0


where the costless-trade-equilibrium demand levels Γk (q, n̄, c̄, 0) were found in section 3.4.1.
When trade costs are small, the profits from producing a variety of quality q in location k
are approximately
                          πq,k ≈ mq exp(−c(q, k)/mq )Mq,k (τ ) − fq .                         (5)

With small trade costs, profits are not sensitive to the locational decisions of other firms.26
This means that all varieties of a given quality are produced in a single location, and we can
identify production locations using the profits expression.
    Within skill intensities, demand determines where varieties are produced. When two
qualities have the same skill intensity, i(q) = i(q 0 ), the location that minimizes the cost of
producing a variety of quality q also minimizes the cost of a variety of quality q 0 . Thus, if
varieties of the same skill intensity are produced in different locations, this must be due to
differences in market access, Mq,k (τ ). In particular, if c(q, k) 6= c(q, k 0 ), then firms produce in
the higher-cost location because its market-access advantage outweighs its cost disadvantage.
Proposition 1 (Within-intensity market access). When trade costs are small, if nq,k > 0,
nq0 ,k0 > 0, and i(q) = i(q 0 ), then Mq,k ≥ Mq,k0 or Mq0 ,k ≤ Mq0 ,k0 .
Proposition 1, proved in appendix A, establishes that market access alone governs special-
ization within qualities of the same skill intensity. An important component of Mq,k (τ ) is
  26
       With large trade costs, Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ) and thus profits depend on competition through firms’ locations n.

                                                          13
demand in the location of production, Nk Γk (q, n̄, c̄, 0).27 This is the home-market effect
explanation for why high-income locations specialize in high-quality products.
    This yields an empirical strategy for distinguishing the two mechanisms. Both the factor-
abundance mechanism and the home-market effect cause high-k locations to specialize in
high-q varieties, so variation across skill intensities is overdetermined. Variation within
skill intensities is driven by market access alone. We can therefore identify a lower bound
on the home-market effect by examining the pattern of specialization conditional on skill
intensities.28 My empirical strategy is to relate the pattern of specialization across locations
to variation in market access after controlling for plants’ factor usage.29


3.5     Taking the theory to plant-level data
The theory describes relationships between product quality (q), location (k), skill intensity
(i), and market access (Mq,k (τ )). These objects can be inferred from observables using the
model and some auxiliary assumptions. The following results are derived in appendix A.
    I infer product quality from shipments’ prices. Assume that b(ω, q) is strictly decreasing
in q, so that higher qualities have higher costs. If c(q, k) increases in quality faster than
mq declines in quality, the price of a variety pjk0 = c(q, k) + τqkk0 + mq is informative about
its quality. I validate this approach in appendix E.3 by calculating demand shifters to infer
product quality. Prices and shifters are strongly positively correlated in my data.
    I infer locations’ rankings from their per capita incomes, denoted ȳk . Under the assump-
tion that g(y, k) is log-supermodular, average income is a sufficient statistic for k.
    I infer skill intensities from the composition and wages of plants’ workers. The composi-
tion measure assumes that non-production workers are more skilled than production workers.
The wage measure assumes that wages are increasing in skill. When factor prices equalize,
ranking plants by their share of non-production workers or their average wage is equivalent
to ranking them by their factor intensities. When labor is cheaper where it is abundant,
plants of all intensities use more skilled workers in skill-abundant locations, so I include the
measure and its interaction with ln ȳk to control for skill intensity.
    My empirical counterpart to the model’s market-access term Mq,k (τ ) is the average of
  27
      When trade costs are uniform, as in FGH, differences in Mq,k (τ ) are due solely to differences in demand
in the location of production, Mq,k (τ ) > Mq,k0 (τ ) ⇐⇒ Nk Γk (q, n̄, c̄, 0) > Nk0 Γk0 (q, n̄, c̄, 0).
   28
      The strategy of using variation in demand within a set of goods of the same factor intensity is similar
to the approach used by Davis and Weinstein (2003) to integrate factor-abundance and home-market-effect
models. We differ when we go to the data. Whereas Davis and Weinstein (2003) assume that factor intensities
are fixed within 3-digit ISIC industries, I use plant-level information to infer factor intensities.
   29
      Proposition 1 implies cross-sectional comparisons of market access in levels. It does not, for example,
imply that I could exploit changes in market access over time, since nq,k is not a continuous function of Mq,k .
If πq,k > πq,k0 both periods, q is not produced in k 0 both periods, regardless of the change in πq,k − πq,k0 .

potential customers’ per capita incomes, weighted by population size and distance from the
location of production. In the model, per capita income is a sufficient statistic for relative
demand for qualities when trade costs are low.30 Weighting these incomes by population size
and distance reflects the fact that it is more profitable to produce in locations that are more
proximate to a larger number of consumers due to distance-related trade costs.
    I construct two such market-access measures. Denote log income per capita in destination
city d in year t by ln ȳ dt , population size by Ndt , and the mileage distance from origin o by
milesod . The first measure describes the composition of potential customers not residing

                                                        −η ln ȳdt . The second market-access measure

In constructing each measure, I use a distance elasticity of unity, η = 1. This is based on the
empirical relationship between transaction volumes and distance, which I estimate using a
gravity model in appendix C. These gravity estimates for trade between metropolitan areas
are consistent with the findings of the vast gravity literature on trade between nations.
    I now turn to the data to characterize the empirical relationships linking product qualities,
skill intensities, and market access following the model’s guidance.


4      Data and empirical setting
This section introduces the empirical setting in which I conduct my investigation. First,
I describe the data that I use to characterize the pattern of specialization and exchange
between US cities. Additional details are in appendix B. Second, I document that both
outgoing shipments and incoming shipments within fine product categories exhibit higher
prices in higher-income cities. Thus, this empirical setting is suitable for testing theories of
quality specialization.


4.1     Data
I combine microdata on US manufacturing plants’ production and shipments with data
describing cities and sectors. The two confidential microdata sources used are the 1997,
  30
     This exploits spatial variation in income levels to capture demand Γk0 (q, n̄, c̄, 0). With high trade costs,
this may be a poor approximation due to Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ) also depending on firms’ equilibrium locations. Trade
costs between US cities are lower than those between countries due to the common currency, language, and
policy environment. Glaeser and Kohlhase (2004) estimate that incurred transport costs are less than
4% of shipment value for most manufactures. My empirical results suggest that approximation (5) is not
underpowered in practice.

     Mot can be written as a weighted average of Mot     and ln ȳot . A city’s own income per capita has greater
weight in this average when it is more populous than and more distant from other metropolitan areas.


                                                       15
2002, and 2007 Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) and Census of Manufactures (CMF).The
CFS describes commodity shipments by a sample of business establishments in terms of
their value, weight, destination ZIP code, and transportation mode.32 Products are described
using the Standard Classification of Transport Goods, a distinct scheme that at its highest
level of detail defines 512 5-digit product categories. Each quarter of the survey year, plants
report a randomly selected sample of 20-40 of their shipments in one week.The CMF describes
a plant’s location, industry, employees, payroll, material inputs, and revenues. It covers the
universe of manufacturing plants, which are classified into 473 6-digit NAICS manufacturing
industries.33
    In most of the analysis, I define a product as the pairing of a 5-digit SCTG commodity
code and a 6-digit NAICS industry code. This results in more narrowly defined products
when the NAICS industry scheme is more detailed than the SCTG commodity scheme.
For example, footwear (SCTG 30400) produced by an establishment in “men’s footwear
(except athletic) manufacturing” (NAICS 316213) is distinct from footwear produced by
an establishment in “women’s footwear (except athletic) manufacturing” (NAICS 316214).
There are more than 5,000 commodity-industry-year triplets in my estimation sample.34
    The empirical analysis describes core-based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are 366
metropolitan and 576 micropolitan statistical areas defined by the Office of Management
and Budget. I refer to these geographic units as cities. Appendix B describes how data
using other geographies were assigned to CBSAs.
    I calculate cities’ per capita incomes using data on CBSAs’ total populations and per-
sonal incomes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s regional economic profiles for 1997,
2002, and 2007. In my baseline specification, I exclude the employees and income of all
establishments in the same 6-digit NAICS industry as the shipping plant when calculating
the population and per capita income of its CBSA.35 Since most manufacturing sectors’
workforces and payrolls are small relative to the total populations and incomes of the cities
in which they are located, the results obtained without making this adjustment to the per
capita income and population measures are very similar.
  32
     The Census Bureau defines an establishment as “a single physical location where business transactions
take place or services are performed.”The CFS covers manufacturing, mining, wholesale, and select retail
and services establishments. I analyze shipments by manufacturing establishments, which I call “plants.”
  33
     Information on small establishments is estimated from administrative records, not reported by the es-
tablishment. I exclude these administrative records and imputed observations. See appendix B for details.
  34
     My results are robust to defining products using only the SCTG commodity codes.
  35
     There is therefore variation across industries within a CBSA in the regressors I call “log origin CBSA
population” and “log origin CBSA per capita income.”

4.2     Pattern of specialization and trade
This section describes variation in manufacturing shipment prices across US cities.36 The
patterns mirror those found in international trade data. First, outgoing shipments exhibit
higher prices in higher-income cities. This pattern is consistent with quality specialization in
which higher-income cities produce higher-price, higher-quality varieties.37 Second, incoming
shipments exhibit higher prices in higher-income cities. This pattern is consistent with
non-homothetic preferences in which higher-income consumers demand higher-price, higher-
quality varieties.
    One concern with inferring qualities from prices is that products may be horizontally dif-
ferentiated, as in the model. With horizontal differentiation, two varieties of the same quality
can sell at different prices in the same destination, with the high-price variety simply obtain-
ing a smaller market share (Khandelwal, 2010). This raises the concern that high-income
locations’ specialization in high-price products may only reflect higher costs. However, this
objection is unlikely to be problematic for the empirical investigation here.
    Unit values are likely to be informative about product quality in this context for four
reasons. First, investigations of international trade data distinguishing between raw unit
values and quality-adjusted prices have shown unit values to be a meaningful, though im-
perfect, proxy for quality (Khandelwal, 2010; Feenstra and Romalis, 2014). I obtain similar
results in section E.3, where I find that demand shifters are positively correlated with unit
values. Moreover, these demand shifters exhibit patterns of specialization and factor usage
consistent with those found for unit values. Second, my empirical setting allows me to check
whether differences in prices across locations only reflect higher costs. Using plant-level data
on wages and workers, I can test whether plants shipping from high-income locations charge
higher prices only because they have higher labor costs. They don’t. Third, consistent
with the international evidence presented by Hallak (2006), I find a positive relationship
between shipment prices and destinations’ per capita income, suggesting that higher-price
products are those preferred by higher-income consumers.38 Fourth, in barcode-level re-
tail data, Hottman, Redding, and Weinstein (2016) and Faber and Fally (2016) find that
higher-price products have higher sales or appeal to consumers.
    The first feature of the US data matching international findings is that shipments origi-
  36
      Recall that all observed “prices” are in fact unit values, the ratio of a shipment’s value to its weight in
pounds. See data appendix B for details of the sample selection and variable construction.
   37
      I follow Schott (2004), who characterized specialization across products using quantities and specializa-
tion within products using average prices. The latter is necessary because quantities are reported by product,
so by definition we do not observe the quantities of different qualities within narrowly defined products.
   38
      A potential concern is that higher-income consumers pay higher prices for identical products because
higher-income consumers are less responsive to price changes (Simonovska, 2015). This would be a concern
if the observed price variation were primarily within-plant. Table 2 below shows that this is not the case.


                                                       17
nating from higher-income cities exhibit higher prices. To characterize how shipment prices
vary with origin characteristics, I estimate linear regressions describing a shipment s of prod-
uct k by plant j from origin city o to destination city d by transport mode m in year t of
the form

          ln pskjodmt = β ln ȳokt + α1 ln Nokt + α2 ln milesskjodmt + γmt + γkdt + skjodt ,          (6)

where pskjodmt is the shipment’s unit value, ȳokt and Nokt are per capita income and total
population in the origin CBSA excluding the industry of the shipping plant, milesskjodmt
is the ZIP-to-ZIP mode-specific mileage distance of the shipment, γmt are mode-year fixed
effects, and γkdt are product-destination-year fixed effects. Including both per capita income
and total population allows me to distinguish between income composition and scale, since
these are positively correlated across cities. The mileage and mode covariates allow prices
to vary with transport costs.39 The product-destination-year fixed effects mean that I am
comparing prices of the same product shipped to the same metropolitan area in the same year,
such as shipments of beer by breweries to Chicago in 1997. This is akin to the comparison
of US import prices with product-year fixed effects in Schott (2004).40
    Table 1 characterizes how variation in outgoing shipments’ unit values relates to origin
characteristics. The first column reports a large, positive origin-income elasticity of shipment
prices of 44%. Higher-income cities specialize in the production of higher-price varieties of
products, and this pattern is highly statistically significant. Conditional on the level of per
capita income, there is no economically meaningful correlation between origin population
size and outgoing shipments’ prices.
    I proceed to interact the regressors with two measures of the scope for product differ-
entiation. The Sutton (1998) measure, industrial R&D and advertising intensity, proxies
the scope for quality differentiation by the cost shares of differentiation-related activities.
The Khandelwal (2010) measure infers the scope for quality differentiation from the range
of estimated demand shifters in US imports. The second and third columns of Table 1
show that the positive relationship between origin income per capita and outgoing ship-
ment prices is stronger in products with greater scope for quality differentiation, as classified
by both measures. These patterns are consistent with higher-income cities specializing in
higher-quality products. In products with greater scope for quality differentiation, income
differences correspond to greater differences in output prices.
  39
     In the model, the constant-markup assumption makes plants’ free-on-board prices invariant to transport
costs. Including these covariates relaxes that assumption. The main results of this paper are robust to
omitting the population and mileage covariates and mode fixed effects.
  40
     Note that my unit of observation is a shipment. The paper’s main results are robust to aggregating to
the origin-destination-industry-product-year level.

    Table 2 reports regressions characterizing how variation in shipment unit values within
products relates to destination characteristics. The first column shows that the per-capita-
income elasticity of incoming shipment prices is 25%. Higher-income cities import higher-
price varieties, which suggests that preferences are non-homothetic. This pattern is at-
tributable to city income composition, not city size per se, as the coefficient on log population
reveals. The distance elasticity of incoming shipment prices is about 4%; longer shipments
exhibit higher prices.41
    The second and third columns show that the large majority of the correlation between
income per capita and incoming shipment prices is attributable to cities of different income
levels purchasing goods from different cities and plants. The second column introduces
fixed effects for cities of origin, θot . The destination per capita income elasticity falls by
about 10 percentage points, indicating that about 40% of this variation is attributable to
  41
    There are at least three possible explanations for the positive coefficient on shipment distance. First,
distance-related costs may be included in the reported shipment values. Second, the composition of plants
shipping to a destination may vary with distance. Third, plants may charge higher mark-ups when serving
more distant destinations. The third column of Table 2 suggests that this last channel could explain at most
one-third of such variation, since the within-establishment mileage elasticity is 1.5%.

are similar to those in the first column. The third column introduces fixed effects for each
plant-product, θkjt . The within-plant destination-income elasticity of shipment prices is
considerably lower, 5.1%. Selling the same product at a higher price therefore accounts
for at most one-fifth of price variation across destinations of different income levels. This
decomposition suggests that changes in markups are not responsible for the majority of the
observed correlation between shipment prices and destination incomes.
    These findings demonstrate that the composition of cities’ manufactures demand is
strongly linked to their income levels. This is consistent with numerous previous empiri-
cal studies of both households and countries. Such non-homothetic preferences are necessary
for the “home-market effect for quality” hypothesis.43
    Together, Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate patterns of specialization that are strongly linked to
cities’ income levels. Within narrowly defined product categories, higher-income locations
both export and import higher-price products than lower-income locations. In addition,
Appendix C shows that cities with more similar incomes trade more intensely with each
other. These findings mirror those found in international trade data and could be generated
by the factor-abundance mechanism or the home-market effect. I now use data on plants’
factor inputs to empirically distinguish between these potential explanations.


5      Empirical results
This section reports two main bodies of empirical evidence. First, observed factor-usage
differences explain about one quarter of the relationship between cities’ incomes and the
prices of outgoing shipments. This bounds the explanatory power of the factor-abundance
mechanism in terms of observed factor inputs. Second, the market-access measures describing
the income composition of proximate potential customers are strongly linked to outgoing
shipment prices. The estimated home-market effect explains close to half of the observed
price-income relationship.
    My regression results can be seen as decomposing the covariance between plant j’s outgo-
ing shipment price and origin o’s per capita income. The regressions in Table 1 demonstrate a
positive relationship between prices and incomes but omit both measures of factors employed
  42
    Appendix C shows that cities with more similar incomes trade more intensely with each other.
  43
    Non-homothetic preferences alone are not sufficient to produce the home-market effect, as discussed
in section 2 and shown in section 3.4.1. The home-market effect for quality stems from non-homothetic
preferences, economies of scale, and trade costs.

and market access. This “short”specification in equation (6) can be restated as

                                 ln pskjodmt = β S ln ȳokt + αS · Xskjodmt + Sskjodmt ,

where the superscript S denotes the “short” regression and the vector Xskjodmt contains
origin population, shipment mileage, and destination-product-year fixed effects. The prior
empirical literature has estimated β̂ S > 0, and this result has been interpreted as attributable
to differences in factor supplies or demand conditions. In the factor-supplies account, the
factor inputs employed in production are omitted variables that explain output prices and
are correlated with origin income per capita. In the market-access account, origin income
has a causal effect on output prices through its effect on the composition of demand.
    My empirical strategy is to introduce observable measures of both factor inputs and
market access, described in section 3.5, in order to identify their contribution to the positive
coefficient on origin income per capita. The factor-input measures address their omission
from the short regression. The market-access measures employ spatial variation in income
levels to capture spatial variation in demand, exploiting neighboring cities’ contributions to
Mq,k (τ ).44 Consider a “long” regression that incorporates factor-employment measures Fjt
and market-access measure Mot ,

                     ln pskjodmt = β ln ȳokt + α · Xskjodmt + δ · Fjt + λMot + skjodmt .                              (7)

   If this long regression is the correct specification, then the estimated β̂ S > 0 captures
how outgoing shipment prices covary with income per capita both directly (β) and indirectly
through factors of production and market access. This can be seen using the omitted variables
bias formula:
        "        #       "       #        ""           #                     #−1       ""           #            #" #

            αS               α                  X                                            X                     λ

β S > β to the extent that (1) skill-intensive products have higher prices (δ > 0) and
skill-intensive products are produced in higher-income locations (cov(ln ȳ, F |X) > 0) and
(2) higher-price products are produced where proximate potential customers’ per capita
incomes are higher (λ > 0) and higher-income locations are more proximate to higher-
income potential customers (cov(ln ȳ, M |X) > 0). Each of these channels is a potential
explanation because the economic mechanism (δ > 0 or λ > 0) is plausible, as shown by
  44
    While Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011) derive their theoretical results from a location’s own
contribution to its market access, I exploit geographic variation in nearby cities’ income levels to address
concerns about unobservables in the city of production relating to its income level.


                                                                  22
the model, and higher-income US metropolitan areas are both populated by more skilled
manufacturing workers and more proximate to high-income consumers.45
    In the model, these mechanisms are the only forces for specialization across income levels,
so β should be zero. In practice, prices and and incomes may be correlated after accounting
for factor inputs and market access due to additional omitted regressors or causal effects
of local income. The former might include unobserved differences in production conditions,
like entrepreneurial zeal or exogenous technological advantages, that could plausibly both
explain output prices and correlate with local income. The latter would be mechanisms
through which higher incomes cause locals to supply higher-quality varieties. Measurement
error in the observables Fjt and Mot may also leave residual covariance captured by β.
    I decompose β S by first introducing factor inputs F and then introducing market access
M . Introducing measures of plants’ employment of factors of production decomposes the
covariance between outgoing shipment prices and origin per capita income into between-
intensity variation and within-intensity variation.46 While the factor-abundance mechanism
operates exclusively through the former, the home-market effect may manifest in both, since
higher-income locations have greater demand for higher-quality varieties, regardless of qual-
ities’ skill intensities. Section 5.1 shows that the measured across-skill-intensities component
is modest, constituting 27% of the covariance between outgoing shipment prices and income
per capita.
    Introducing a measure of market access yields the long regression specified in equation
(7). Following Proposition 1, the coefficient λ describes how outgoing shipment prices covary
with potential customers’ income levels, conditional on differences in factors employed in
production. The coefficient β captures the residual covariance between prices and incomes
attributable to neither differences in skill intensity nor the market-access measure. In section
5.2, I find that within-skill-intensity variation in market access accounts for about 58% of the
  45
     In terms of skills, higher-income cities’ manufacturing plants exhibit higher non-production worker shares
and their manufacturing employees exhibit more years of schooling and higher wages. In terms of market
                                                                              1
access, cities’ income levels are spatially correlated, such that regressing Mot on log per capita income yields a
positive relationship with an R of about 20%. Note that these patterns only imply β < β S if the associated
                                  2

mechanism also accounts for price variation conditional on per capita income, that is, if δ > 0 or λ > 0.
  46
     Using the law of total covariance and omitting notation indicating that moments are conditional on X,
the covariance between plant j’s outgoing shipment price and origin o’s per capita income can be written as

                    cov(ln pj , ln ȳo ) = cov [E(ln pj |Fj ), E(ln ȳo |Fj )] + E [cov(ln pj , ln ȳo |Fj )]
                                           |              {z                 } |           {z               }
                                              between-intensity variation         within-intensity variation

My regressions are linear projections that approximate these conditional moments.

observed price-income relationship.47 This makes β̂ small relative to β̂ S and, in a number of
specifications, statistically indistinguishable from zero.
    After estimating this decomposition, I provide additional empirical evidence to support
these results. Section 5.3 summarizes two pieces of further evidence, which are described
at length in appendix E, that support an economically large role for home-market demand
in determining the pattern of quality specialization. First, the second moment of the lo-
cal household income distribution is linked to outgoing shipment prices. Second, demand
shifters exhibit the same patterns as outgoing shipment prices. Section 5.4 reports a series
of robustness checks that yield results consistent with the claim that market access explains
as much of the covariance of shipment prices and income levels as observed factor usage.


5.1        The factor-abundance hypothesis
This section identifies the share of within-product specialization attributable to differences
in observable plant-level factor usage. The canonical factor-abundance theory posits that
differences in locations’ outputs are explained by differences in the factors employed by their
producers. Within groups of products of the same factor intensity, the location of production
is indeterminate. That is, under the null hypothesis that differences in factor supplies are
the only source of comparative advantage, there should be no correlation between locational
characteristics and plants’ outputs after controlling for plant-level factor usage. In fact,
there is a very strong relationship between income per capita and outgoing shipments prices
after controlling for factor inputs. Observed factor usage explains only 27% of the observed
covariance between cities’ per capita incomes and outgoing shipment prices.
    To characterize how shipment prices vary with origin characteristics, I estimate linear
regressions describing a shipment s of product k by plant j from origin city o to destination
city d by transport mode m in year t of the form

                                                                                              Kjt

                                                                       Kjt

  47
       Following footnote 46, we can write the within-intensity variation as E [cov(ln pj , ln ȳo |Fj )] =

                  EF [covM (E(ln pjo |Fj , Mo ), E(ln ȳo |Fj , Mo ))] + EF [EM (cov(ln pj , ln ȳo |Fj , Mo ))]
                  |                     {z                           } |                {z                     }
                           within-skill-intensity market access                    residual covariance

Using regressions to approximate these conditional moments, the market-access component accounts for
about 58% of the overall cov(ln pj , ln ȳo ).




                                                                  24

where shareN jt is the ratio of the plant’s non-production workers to total employees, Ljtjt
is gross fixed assets per worker, and w̄jt is average pay per employee.48 The interactions of
plant-level factor-usage measures with origin income per capita address the case in which
factor prices do not equalize, as described in section 3.5.49 In theory, either ln shareN jt
and its interaction with ln ȳot or ln w̄jt and its interaction with ln ȳot would be sufficient to
characterize plants’ skill intensities. In practice, I include both and the capital measure to
maximize the potential explanatory power of observed factor-usage differences.
    Table 3 characterizes how variation in shipment unit values relates to origin characteristics
and plant-level observables. The first column relates outgoing shipment unit values to origin
characteristics controlling for destination fixed effects, as in Table 1. The next two columns
incorporate the plant-level measures of factor usage and their interactions with income per
                                                                                    K
capita. The second column introduces quantity measures of capital intensity ( Ljtjt ) and labor
usage, the non-production employment share (shareN jt ). The third column adds the average
wage measure and therefore corresponds to the regression specified in equation (8).
    These measures of factor usage are informative predictors of a plant’s shipment prices,
but they explain only a modest share of the observed origin-income elasticity of outgoing
shipment prices. Consistent with the premise that higher-price, higher-quality varieties are
more skill-intensive, the coefficients on log non-production worker share and log pay per
worker are positive and economically large. The negative coefficient on log assets per worker
is inconsistent with a model in which higher-price, higher-quality varieties are more capital-
intensive.50 The observed variation in factor usage helps explain some of the total variation
in outgoing shipment prices, but only a small share of the income-linked variation. While
introducing the quantity measures in the second column increases the R2 , it only reduces
the origin-income elasticity from 44% to 40%. Incorporating the wage measure in the third
column reduces this elasticity to 35%. Thus, the observed factor-usage differences can explain
about one-fifth of the origin-income elasticity of shipment prices in this specification.
    The fourth through sixth columns of Table 3 incorporate the control variables in more
flexible functional forms. The mileage, non-production worker share, assets per worker,
and pay per worker covariates now enter as cubic polynomials that vary by 3-digit NAICS
  48
     The theoretical model emphasized differences in the composition of skill across locations. I also include
gross fixed assets per worker as a measure of capital intensity, since this variable has been emphasized in prior
empirical work both across countries (Schott, 2004) and across plants (Verhoogen, 2008). Since I cannot
construct capital stocks using the perpetual-inventory method with quinquennial data, I use the book value
of assets as my measure of plant capital.
  49
     Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2013) infer that relative factor prices do not equalize within the US when
considering two factors, production and non-production workers.
  50
     Using very aggregate data, Torstensson (1996) obtains a negative partial correlation between prices and
capital per worker when distinguishing between human and physical capital.

    The results obtained using these more flexible functional forms are similar to those in the
first three columns of Table 3. The origin-income elasticity of 41% is reduced to 36% by the
introduction of the quantity controls and further to 31% by the full battery of plant-level
factor-usage measures. Thus, differences in plants’ observed factor usage explain about one-
quarter of the correlation between cities’ incomes per capita and outgoing shipment prices.
This suggests that the factor-abundance hypothesis has meaningful but modest explanatory
power for the pattern of within-product specialization across US cities.

specific quadratic in log mileage yields very similar results.

precise than the country-level covariates typically used to evaluate factor-abundance theories
of comparative advantage, which aggregate over plants, cities, and industries. Moreover,
the observed factor inputs are informative about outgoing shipment prices. There is a
considerable increase in the R2 between the fourth and sixth columns in Table 3. However,
these factor inputs do not vary across cities in a way that accounts for the link between
city-level income and shipment prices.
    Could city income per capita be informative about plant-level factor usage conditional
on the plant-level covariates? Plants with observationally equivalent workforces in terms
of non-production-to-production-worker ratios may exhibit unobserved differences in worker
quality. In particular, prior research has documented weak but systematic sorting of workers
across cities on unobservable characteristics correlated with higher wages (Davis and Dingel,
2012; De la Roca and Puga, 2013). However, these differences between workers should
appear in the plant-level wage measures included in the third and sixth columns of Table
3. The posited unobserved differences in input factor quality would therefore have to be
characteristics of workers that raise output quality, are not priced into their wages, and are
systematically correlated with city-level incomes, which seems an unlikely explanation for
the findings.
    These results are robust to introducing further information on the skills employed in
these plants. I construct city-industry-level measures of employees’ schooling from public-
use microdata from the Census of Population and American Community Survey. These
measures are available for a subset of the observations in the main estimation sample. The
results are reported in Appendix Table D.1. The partial-correlation origin-income elasticity
of 30.5% is quite similar to the 31% obtained in Table 3.
    Another potential concern is aggregation bias. Though my data describe hundreds of
manufacturing product categories, these are less detailed than the most disaggregated prod-
uct categories in international trade data. I address this concern using data from the Census
of Manufactures product trailer, which describes comparable number of product categories
and reports quantities for a subset of them. Appendix Table D.2 describes establishments’
average unit values from Census of Manufactures data on products for which quantities are
reported and reports results that are consistent with those reported in Table 3.52 Though
the origin-income elasticity is lower than that found in the CFS data, observed plant-level
factor usage explains only a small fraction of the total variation.
 52
      These plant-level average unit values necessarily include shipments destined for the origin CBSA.


                                                      27
    This section has shown that a modest share of the observed within-product variation in
outgoing shipment prices across cities of different income levels is attributable to observable
differences in plants’ factor usage. Under the null hypothesis that differences in factor
abundance alone explain within-product specialization, the partial correlation between origin
income per capita and outgoing shipment prices conditional on plant-level factor usage would
be zero. In the presence of a rich set of plant-level controls, the estimated coefficient β̂1 in
column six of Table 3 is 31%, roughly three quarters of its value in the absence of plant-level
controls. If we were to attribute the full decrease in the value of the coefficient on ln ȳot to the
factor-abundance mechanism, it would explain about one quarter of the observed variation.53


5.2     The market-access hypothesis
This section identifies the share of the covariance between incomes and prices not explained
by factor-usage differences that is attributable to home-market demand. I find that cities
with greater market access to higher-income households produce higher-price manufactures.
This within-intensity market-access variation explains more of the covariance between in-
comes and prices than differences in plants’ factor inputs.
    The “home-market” effect in fact depends on the composition of demand in all locations
potentially served from a location of production, as described in the model by market access
Mq,k (τ ). A city that is more proximate to another city with many high-income residents
has higher relative demand for higher-quality manufactures, ceteris paribus.54 Section 3.5
                                                                                N miles−η
described two market-access measures. The first, Mot1 = d6=o P dtN miles

                                                                                             −η ln ȳdt , omits

potential customers residing in the location of production. The identifying assumption when
using this measure is that variation across locations in neighboring cities’ incomes per capita,
after conditioning on plants’ inputs and income per capita in the city of production, is re-
lated to plants’ outputs only through variation in the composition of demand. The second

market-access measure, Mot2 = d P dt
                                P
                                                     −η ln ȳdt , includes all potential customers, con-

sistent with the model. The accompanying identifying assumption is that, after conditioning
on plants’ inputs, variation across locations in potential consumers’ incomes, including res-
  53
     To the degree that differences in skill intensities are causally induced by differences in demand, this
overstates the explanatory power of the factor-abundance hypothesis.
  54
     Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011) assume the cost of exporting to another location is the
same across all locations. Thus, in their model the home-market effect depends only on the difference in
income composition between the location of production and the rest of the world. When trade costs are not
uniform, the home-market effect depends on a production location’s access to every other market, as noted
by Burenstam Linder (1961, p.87) and Behrens, Lamorgese, Ottaviano, and Tabuchi (2009). Measuring
market access has received considerable attention in empirical assessments of the new economic geography
(Redding and Venables, 2004). See Lugovskyy and Skiba (2015) for a discussion of market access in the
context of quality specialization.



                                                      28
idents in the city of production, is related to plants’ outputs only through variation in the
composition of demand.55
    Table 4 demonstrates that market access plays a significant role in explaining the origin-
income elasticity of shipment prices. To facilitate comparisons, the first column is identical to
the sixth column of Table 3. The second column introduces the first market-access measure,
and its coefficient is positive and highly significant. Its inclusion reduces the origin-income
elasticity from 31% to 18%. Recall that flexibly controlling for the non-production worker
share, assets per worker, and average pay per worker initially reduced the elasticity from 41%
to 31%. Thus, the income composition of proximate potential customers other than those
in the city of production explains more of the covariance of income per capita and outgoing
shipment prices. In locations with better access to high-income customers, plants produce
higher-price products. This evidence suggests that the geography of demand influences the
pattern of within-product specialization.56
    The third column uses the second market-access measure, which includes the income of
residents in the city of production in the weighted average. This reduces the origin-income
elasticity to 9%, a reduction of 22 percentage points compared to the first column. In this
specification, market access explains about half of the observed relationship between income
per capita and outgoing shipment prices, which is substantially more than that attributable
to differences in plants’ factor usage.
    These results can be succinctly summarized as a decomposition of the covariance between
incomes and prices.57 After controlling for population size and shipment mileage, differences
in observed factor usage are responsible for 27% of the covariance between outgoing shipment
prices and origin income per capita. Conditional on factor usage, the first market-access
measure, which omits residents in the city of production, accounts for 36% of the total
covariance, leaving 37% as residual variation. The second market-access measure, which
follows the model by including residents in the city of production, accounts for 58% of the
total covariance, leaving 15% as residual variation.
    The fourth column of Table 4 reports a regression that incorporates the first market-
access measure while omitting factor inputs.58 Because market access is positively correlated
with these omitted regressors, the positive coefficient on Mot1 is about 15% larger than in
the second column.59 While within-intensity variation in market access accounts for 36%
  55
     This identifying assumption would be violated by unobserved quality-improving inputs or technologies
that were correlated with city-level income per capita conditional on my plant-level measures of inputs.
  56
     This result reflects income composition, not total income. I have confirmed that the inverse-distance-
weighted sum of total incomes, a “market potential” measure, does not explain variation in shipment prices.
  57
     Footnotes 46 and 47 report the decomposition that I approximate using linear regressions.
  58
     Table D.3 in the online appendix reports further specifications omitting factor inputs.
  59
     Similarly, adding classical measurement error to the factor-input covariates raises the estimated market-

of the total covariance, unconditional variation in market access can explain about 47% of
the price-income covariance.60 This result might reflect spurious correlation or an economic
relationship. If the correlation between market access and factor input usage is spurious,
then the regression in column four is misspecified and overstates the role of market access in
explaining the price-income covariance. If differences in market access cause firms to produce
varieties of different factor intensities, then market access explains more of the price-income
covariance than suggested by the conservative specification in column two that exploits only
within-intensity variation in market access.
    Market access does not predict incoming shipments’ prices. This is shown by the fifth
column of Table 4, which introduces the destination city’s income level and market access
as regressors and uses product-year and origin-year fixed effects rather than destination-
product-year fixed effects. Thus, it is the second column of Table 2 augmented by destination
market access. While higher-income destinations purchase higher-price incoming shipments,
destinations with higher-income neighbors do not exhibit higher incoming prices. The coeffi-
             1
cient on Mdt   is a precisely estimated zero.61 Since better market access predicts higher-price
outgoing shipments and unchanged incoming shipments, better market access is associated
with net exporting of higher-price varieties.
    Appendix section E.1 shows that the patterns found in domestic shipments are also
found in export shipments destined for foreign markets. The origin-income elasticity of
export prices is 42%. After controlling for plants’ factor inputs, this elasticity is 30%. After
controlling for both factor inputs and market access, this elasticity becomes negative and
statistically indistinguishable from zero.
    This section has established the role of market acess in explaining the pattern of outgo-
ing shipment prices. The income composition of proximate potential customers is strongly
associated with outgoing shipment prices. Consistent with the model, plants located near
higher-income potential customers sell products at higher average prices. The income compo-
sition of potential customers other than those in the location of production is quantitatively
more important for explaining the origin-income elasticity of outgoing shipment prices than
observed plant-level factor usage. When including individuals residing in the city of pro-
duction, the income composition of potential customers explains about half of the observed
origin-income elasticity of shipment prices. Incoming shipment prices are invariant to desti-
access coefficient.

     The respective numbers when using Mot        are 58% and 77%.

     This result also demonstrates the point made in footnote 45 that introducing Mot to equation (7) only
implies β < β S if λ > 0. The correlation between Mdt   1                                            1

yet the coefficient on ln ȳdt in the fifth column of Table 4 is statistically indistinguishable from its value in
the second column of Table 2.

nation market access. This is consistent with a model in which market access plays a large
role in quality specialization and makes high-income locations net exporters of high-quality
products.


5.3    Further evidence
This section summarizes two further pieces of evidence supporting the inference that home-
market demand plays a large role in quality specialization. First, the second moment of the
local household income distribution is linked to outgoing shipment prices. Second, I calculate
demand shifters and find that they exhibit the same patterns as outgoing shipment prices.
These findings are both described in more detail in Appendix E.
    Appendix section E.2 uses another moment of the income distribution to identify the
role of demand in quality specialization. Conditional on average income, cities with higher
dispersion in household income have higher incoming shipment prices. This suggests that
second moment of the income distribution is informative about the composition of demand.
I then show that cities with greater income dispersion have higher outgoing shipment prices,
and this is not due to greater dispersion in the wages or skills of workers employed at the
plants shipping these products. This is consistent with the home-market effect under the
Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011) demand system in an equilibrium in which
most individuals purchase low-quality varieties.
    Appendix section E.3 characterizes the pattern of quality specialization using demand
shifters instead of outgoing shipments’ unit values as the dependent variable. Due to data
constraints, I am only able calculate demand shifters for shipments in 2007. In the absence
of exogenous price variation to identify the demand system, I use price-elasticity estimates
from Feenstra and Romalis (2014) to calculate demand shifters. The empirical results are
consistent with the unit-value findings for the influence of market access, though factor
usage exhibits greater explanatory power. The origin-income elasticity of the plant-product
demand shifter is 41%. This covariance between income per capita and demand shifter
decomposes into factor-intensity differences (46%), within-intensity market-access differences
(48%), and residual variation (7%). The greater explanatory power of plants’ factor inputs
primarily reflects less residual variation, not a dramatically weakened role for the income
composition of proximate potential customers. Home-market demand plays a substantial
role in quality specialization, as large as that explained by the factor-abundance mechanism.

5.4     Robustness checks
This section reports robustness checks motivated by potentially empirically relevant mecha-
nisms that were omitted from the theoretical model. These include land prices, intermediate
inputs, and multi-plant firms. While the measured contributions of factor usage and market
access are not completely invariant to addressing these issues, all the robustness checks are
consistent with the claim that market access explains at least as much of the covariance of
shipment prices and income levels as observed factor usage.
    The model omits land, which is an input whose price variation across metropolitan areas
is correlated with income levels. While land has not been posited as relevant for quality
specialization in the prior literature, shipment prices might covary with land prices if higher-
quality varieties are less land-intensive or if land costs are passed through. To address this


                                                         33
omission, I use an industrial rent measure from Reis, a commercial real estate information
company, as an additional regressor. The measure, asking rent per square foot for industrial
properties, is available for only 44 metropolitan areas in the relevant years. Table 5 reports
the factor-usage and market-access regressions while controlling for this variation in local
industrial rents. Columns 1, 2, and 4 demonstrate that the factor-usage results for this
subsample of observations are comparable to those obtained in Tables 3. Columns 3 and
5 introduce the industrial rent covariate, which reduces the income elasticity by about five
percentage points in the flexible-control specification. Plants in locations with higher land
prices have higher outgoing shipment prices, and this variation in rents is correlated with
local income levels such that this explains some of the covariance between shipment prices
and incomes. After controlling for industrial rents, market access accounts for most of
the remaining covariance between prices and incomes, as the income elasticity becomes
statistically indistinguishable from zero. Thus, the previous results are robust to controlling
for land prices.
    In section 3, all goods are final goods sold to consumers. This absence of intermediate
inputs raises two concerns for the empirical evidence presented thus far. First, outgoing
shipments in the data are made up of both final and intermediate goods. Second, input
market access is an omitted variable that may be correlated with output market access.
Each of these concerns warrant additional examination.
    The formal theory is narrowly written in terms of quality-differentiated final goods, as in
Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011), while the evidence presented thus far includes
all manufacturing industries. Market access is potentially important for a broad class of
goods. Burenstam Linder (1961) posited that “there must be a home market for an export
good, whether it is a consumer good or a capital good”and that “there is a strong relationship
between the level of per capita income, on the one hand, and the types of consumer goods
and also capital goods demanded, on the other hand.”62 And Kugler and Verhoogen (2012)
suggest a complementarity between input quality and output quality that would generate
differences in demand for intermediate inputs. Nonetheless, to narrow the inquiry in line
with the final-goods-only model, Table 6 restricts the estimation sample to manufacturing
industries selling more than 50% of their output value to final consumers.
  62
     The relevance of the home market follows from economies of scale and trade costs. The potential role
for per capita income in the composition of capital demand is less familiar. Burenstam Linder (1961, p. 96):
“The relative amount of capital also determines the qualitative composition of the demand for new capital
goods. A capital-abundant country, i.e., a country which, with some likelihood, finds itself on a high level of
per capita income, demands more sophisticated capital equipment than a capital-scarce country. Although
there is no direct causal relationship, we might thus expect that the differences in the level of per capita
incomes would tell us at least something about what differences there will be in the structure of demand for
capital goods.”

                                                  35
    Table 6 shows that the contribution of market access to the covariance of per capita
income and outgoing shipment prices is relatively larger for final consumer goods compared
to all manufactures. The income elasticity of 33% reported in the first column falls to 19% in
the third column after flexibly controlling for observed plant-level factor usage. Introducing
Mot1 , the market-access measure that omits potential consumers in the location of produc-
tion, reduces the income elasticity to 12% in the fourth column and this point estimate is
statistically indistinguishable from zero. Using the Mot2 measure reduces the point estimate
to virtually zero, so that factor usage and market access jointly explain almost all of the ob-
served relationship between cities’ income levels and outgoing shipment prices in final goods.
Market access accounts for more than half of this covariance.
    Table 7 shows that the contribution of market access to the price-income covariance is
considerably smaller for shipments of intermediate inputs. For industries that sell less than
10% of their output to final consumers, factor inputs and within-intensity variation in market
access each explain about one-third of the price-income relationship. Unlike final consumer
goods, intermediate inputs exhibit considerable residual covariation. These findings are
consistent with the idea that household income levels better predict the composition of
demand for consumer goods than intermediate inputs.
    Another concern related to intermediate inputs is that the regressions in Table 4 do not
control for input market access. Plants in high-income cities may indirectly employ capital
or skill via the factor content of intermediate inputs, which would not be captured by the
plant-level factor-usage measures used above. In appendix section E.4, I use plant-level
wages and input-output tables to construct measures of upstream human capital to address
this concern. The findings of Table are 4 are little changed by controlling for input market
access in this way.63
    The model has single-product, single-plant firms, while in reality most manufacturing
output is produced by multi-product firms operating multiple plants. A potential concern
is that the prior regression results might reflect shipments by large, multi-plant firms whose
decisions are poorly described by the model.64 Appendix section E.5 addresses this concern
by restricting the estimation sample to non-large plants and single-plant firms. The results
are very similar to those in Tables 3 and 4. Introducing plant size as an additional regressor
also yields very similar results.
    In sum, robustness checks addressing land prices, intermediate inputs, and multi-plant
  63
     Addressing the intermediate-inputs concern by restricting the estimation sample to establishments with
high value-added shares also yields similar results.
  64
     This potential concern could not simply be transfer pricing of intermediate inputs, since Atalay, Hortaçsu,
and Syverson (2014) show that a small fraction of shipments by vertically integrated establishments are to
downstream units in the same firm.

firms yield results consistent with my main empirical finding that both factor abundance and
market access shape the pattern of quality specialization, with the composition of demand
playing a large role. Attributing these results entirely to factor-usage differences rather than
spatial variation in demand composition would involve assuming two conditions. First, my
plant-level microdata on factor inputs, which are relied upon in the literature to estimate
plant-level productivity and other important measures, would have to omit significant factor
usage. Second, these unobserved quality-improving inputs would have to be strongly corre-
lated with surrounding cities’ income levels, conditional on the income level in the city of
production. While my research design cannot disprove a hypothesis positing such spatially
correlated unobserved factor inputs, and my decomposition results should therefore be in-
terpreted with appropriate caution, such an argument would be quite far from the evidence
typically marshalled to support the factor-abundance hypothesis.


6    Conclusions
Two prominent theories predict that high-income locations specialize in producing and ex-
porting high-quality products. The Linder hypothesis, formalized by Fajgelbaum, Grossman,
and Helpman (2011), emphasizes the role of high-income customers’ demand for high-quality
products. The canonical factor-proportions theory focuses on the abundant supply of capital
and skills in high-income locations. Prior empirical evidence does not separate the contri-
butions of these mechanisms because each implies the same predictions about country-level
trade flows.
    In this paper, I combine microdata on manufacturing plants’ shipments and inputs with
data on locations’ populations and incomes to quantify each mechanism’s role in quality
specialization across US cities. I develop a model that nests both mechanisms to guide my
empirical investigation. The theory’s basic insight is that the factor-abundance mechanism
operates exclusively through plants’ input usage. Conditional on plant-level factor intensity,
demand determines quality specialization. I implement my empirical strategy using US
microdata because the Commodity Flow Survey and Census of Manufactures describe plants
located in many cities of varying income levels. In doing so, I document that US cities exhibit
the same patterns found in international trade data that have been interpreted as evidence of
quality specialization by income. My empirical investigation finds that home-market demand
explains as much of the specialization across US cities of different income levels as observed
differences in plants’ factor inputs. Cities with better access to higher-income customers are
net exporters of higher-price varieties.
    This finding is significant because the two mechanisms have distinct implications for wel-

                                              38
fare, inequality, and trade policy. The large share of quality specialization attributable to
market access suggests that a location’s capacity to profitably produce high-quality prod-
ucts depends significantly on the income composition of neighboring locations. As a result,
geography influences specialization in part because economic developments in neighboring
locations may shift local demand for quality. To the degree that demand shapes entry
and product availability, individuals may gain by living in locations where other residents’
incomes are similar to theirs. Finally, since market access is affected by trade policy, gov-
ernments may have scope to influence quality specialization.

This appendix contains details and derivations of the theoretical results summarized in sec-
tion 3. The order parallels that of the main text.


A.1     Preferences
In equation (1), hj is the individual’s idiosyncratic valuation of the variety. Varieties are
thus both vertically and horizontally differentiated (Beath and Katsoulacos, 1991, p.4-6).
Conditional on h , all consumers prefer higher-q varieties. If all varieties were the same
price, consumers would not be unanimous in their ranking of them due to h , so these
products are horizontally differentiated.
    An individual’s vector of idiosyncratic
                                          h Pvaluations,      h , is drawn from
                                                                               i the generalized ex-

set of qualities, Jq ≡ {j : qj = q} is the set of varieties of quality q, and θq governs the strength
of idiosyncratic differences among varieties in Jq . As shown in Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and
Helpman (2011), this specification yields a nested-logit demand system (McFadden, 1978).

A.2     Production
Both the homogeneous good and the differentiated good are produced using a constant-
elasticity-of-substitution technology, yielding the unit-cost functions given in the main text.
A firm producing a variety j of the differentiated good in location k solves the following
profit maximization problem:
                                       X
                            max πj =          djk0 (pjk0 − cqk − cqk τqkk0 ) − fq

                                                                       ∂ ln d 0
with j’s sales in k 0 given by djk0 = Nk0 ρj (y)g(y, k 0 )dy. Because ∂ ln pjk0 = −pjk0 /mq , the
                                         R
                                                                             jk
solution to this maximization problem is pjk0 = c(q, k) + τqkk0 + mq . Plugging these solutions

The function Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ) describes the share of demand in location k 0 for quality q given
the equilibrium prices and locations of all producers. Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman
(2011) introduce a similar function in their equation (22). Their expression subsumes τ by
adjusting n for trade costs to measure “effective varieties” and does not depend on c because
they assume factor prices equalize.


A.3      Equilibrium
In equilibrium, labor markets clear and firms earn zero profits. These conditions are given
in the main text by equations (2) and (3). The zero-profit condition for the homogeneous,
numeraire good is c(z, k) ≥ 1 ∀k and x(z, k) > 0 ⇒ c(z, k) = 1. The equilibrium local
income distribution density, which depends on equilibrium wages w(ω, k), is

A.4      Equilibrium pattern of specialization and trade
The skill-intensity index i(r) is defined such that i(r) = i(r0 ) ⇐⇒ b(ω, r) = h(r, r0 )b(ω, r0 ) ∀ω
for some function h(r, r0 ) and i(r) > i(r0 ) ⇒ r > r0 . It is convenient to choose the labels i(r)
such that i(r) is the identity of the lowest r in the set of products with this skill intensity. This
allows us to write b(ω, r) = h(r, i(r))b(ω, i(r)). It also makes b(ω, i) strictly log-supermodular
by definition, whether b(ω, r) is multiplicatively separable or weakly log-supermodular.

A.4.1     Skill-intensive quality and costless trade

Trade is costless and b(ω, r) is weakly log-supermodular. The absence of trade costs (τqkk0 =
0 ∀q ∀k ∀k 0 ) means that the zero-profit condition (3) reduces to
                                                                X

This makes demand conditions within the summation orthogonal to the production location.
    Skill abundance imposes structure on the pattern of production through the labor-market
clearing condition. In particular, equation (2), the strict log-supermodularity of f (ω, k), and
f (ω, k) > 0 ∀ω ∈ Ω ∀k together imply, for k > k 0 and ω > ω 0 ,

    Inequality (4) says that skill-abundant locations specialize in skill-intensive products. To
arrive at the result, we’ll first consider the case of factor-price equalization and then describe
the more general case.
    When wages are equal across locations, w(ω, k) = w(ω) ∀k, this inequality simplifies to

use-weighted shares of total output of r in location k. The inequality says that the average
skill intensity of output is higher in k than k 0 . This requires that φi (ω 0 , k) put more weight
on some higher values of i than φi (ω 0 , k 0 ) does so that the average skill intensity of output
produced in k is higher than in k 0 .65 This is the factor-abundance mechanism for quality
specialization.
    In the absence of factor-price equalization, a slightly longer chain of reasoning delivers
the same conclusion. Suppose that inequality (4) were true but φi (ω 0 , k) did not place greater
weight on higher values of i in higher-k locations (i.e. φi (ω 0 , k) = φi (ω 0 , k 0 )). If so, w(ω, k)−σ
must be strictly log-supermodular to satisfy this inequality. If w(ω, k)−σ is log-supermodular,
then c(r, k)−σ is log-supermodular, since c(r, k)1−σ = ω∈Ω b(ω, r)σ w(ω, k)1−σ dω and b(ω, r) is
                                                                R

log-supermodular (Lehmann, 1955). In the absence of trade costs, varieties of skill intensity
i are only produced in location k when c(i, k) = mink0 c(i, k 0 ). Thus, log-supermodularity
of c(i, k)−σ and the zero-profit
                                    condition
                                                    imply
                                                           that φi (ω 0 , k) is log-supermodular in (i, k).
                      b(ω,i)σ                b(ω,i)σ
As a result, Eω0 ,k b(ω  0 ,i)σ   > Eω0 ,k0 b(ω 0 ,i)σ   . Therefore skill-abundant locations specialize
in skill-intensive products.

A.4.2       Uniform skill intensities and costly trade

When skill intensities are uniform, b(ω, r) = b1 (ω)b2 (r), unit costs are multiplicatively sepa-
rable in (r, k) and can be written as
                                            Z                                    1
                                                                                1−σ
                                       σ                                                           σ
                  c(r, k) = b2 (r)    1−σ            b1 (ω)σ w(ω, k)1−σ dω             ≡ b2 (r) 1−σ c(k)
                                               ω∈Ω


    The main text considers the case of trade costs that are small and uniform, τqkk0 =
τq ∀k 0 6= k and τqkk = 0. When factor prices equalizes, profits vary only with home demand,
πq,k > πq,k00 ⇐⇒ Nk Γk (q, n, c, τ ) > Nk00 Γk00 (q, n, c, τ ). When trade costs are sufficiently low,
demands approach their costless-trade equilibrium levels Γk (q, n̄, c̄, 0). Provided that wages
are increasing in skill, demand share Γk (q, n, c, 0) is strictly log-supermodular in (q, k).

Lemma 1. When factor prices equalize and wages are increasing in skill, Γk (q, n, c, 0) is
strictly log-supermodular in (q, k).

Proof. The proof of this lemma is quite similar to the proof of Lemma 1 in Fajgelbaum,
                                                                                                              σ
                                                                                                     b(ω,i)
  65
     Note that the inequality of expectations holds for an arbitrary ω > ω 0 . Therefore, { b(ω          0 ,i)σ }ω,ω 0 ∈Ω,ω>ω 0

is a class of strictly increasing functions. If this class were all increasing functions, we would conclude that
φi (ω 0 , k) stochastically dominates φi (ω 0 , k 0 ), since Ex̃ (u(x)) ≥ Ex̃0 (u(x)) ∀u0 (x) > 0 ⇐⇒ Fx̃ (x) ≤ Fx̃0 (x) ∀x,
where F is the cumulative distribution function.

exp(yq) is strictly log-supermodular (SLSM), so Ψ(y, q, n, c, 0) is SLSM in (y, q). Since w(ω)
is increasing and f (ω, k) is SLSM, g(y, k) is SLSM. Since Ψ(y, q, n, c, 0) is SLSM in (y, q)
and g(y, k) is SLSM in (y, k), Γk (q, n, c, 0) is strictly log-supermodular in (q, k) (Lehmann,
1955).

    This property yields the result reported in the main text that high-k locations are high-
income because they are skill-abundant, and this causes them to have greater demand for
high-q varieties.
    Consider another case, in which trade costs are large and uniform. When trade costs
are sufficiently high, production is diversified, with every quality segment produced in every
location. With an additional assumption, that θq is increasing in q, Fajgelbaum, Grossman,
and Helpman (2011) characterize the pattern of trade that arises when factor prices equalize.
It can be shown that all firms producing a quality q make the same local sales and export
sales. Therefore, k is a net exporter of q if it has more firms producing q than the world
average, nq,k > K1 k0 nq,k0 . Lemma 2 and Proposition 5 in FGH show that, in this diversified
                    P

equilibrium, higher-income locations consume relative more of higher-quality varieties and
therefore host relatively more firms producing higher-quality varieties, making them net
exporters.

A.4.3    Skill-intensive quality and costly trade

Proof of Proposition 1:

Proof. Suppose not. That is, suppose Mq,k < Mq,k0 and Mq0 ,k > Mq0 ,k0 . If c(q, k) ≥ c(q, k 0 ),
then by approximation (5) πq,k0 > πq,k , which contradicts nq,k > 0 by the free-entry condition.
Similarly, if c(q, k) ≤ c(q, k 0 ), then by πq0 ,k > πq0 ,k0 , which contradicts nq0 ,k0 > 0.


A.5     Taking the theory to plant-level data
Denote the plant index j, so that, for example, plant j’s skill intensity is i(j).
   If b(ω, q) is strictly decreasing in q, higher-quality varieties are more costly to produce,

     If g(y, k) is log-supermodular, average income is a sufficient statistic for k. k > k 0 if and
only if g(y, k) likelihood-ratio dominates g(y, k 0 ), so Ek (y) > Ek0 (y) ⇐⇒ k > k 0 .
     The composition measure assumes that non-production workers are more skilled than
production workers. Denote the fraction of workers of skill ω labeled as non-production by
l(N, ω) and the fraction labeled production as l(P, ω) = 1−l(N, ω). Denote the share of non-
production
R
                 workers employed in a plant with skill intensity i in location k by shareN (i, k) ≡
 ω `(ω,i(q),k)l(N,ω)dω
   R                   . If l(N, ω) is strictly increasing in ω, then shareN (i, k) is strictly increas-
     ω `(ω,i(q),k)dω
ing in i.66 Inside the factor-price equalization (FPE) set, `(ω, q, k) = `(ω, q) ∀k and there-
fore shareN (i, k) = shareN (i) ∀k. Outside the FPE set, if w(ω, k)−σ is log-supermodular,
shareN (i, k) is strictly increasing in k.67 I therefore use shareN (j) × ln ȳk as an additional
control for skill intensity.
     The wage measure assumes that wages are increasing in skill, ω.68 If wages are increasing
in skill, we can infer the skill intensity of a plant’s variety from its average wage. The average
wage at a plant producing quality q with skill intensity i(q) in location k is
                                          Z                                     Z

               w̄(i, k) = w̄(q, k) =           R                        dω =         w(ω, k)ϕ(ω, i, k)dω,
                                           ω    ω0
                                                   `(ω 0 , i(q), k)dω 0          ω

                          `(ω,i(q),k)
where ϕ(ω, i(q), k) ≡ R 0 `(ω 0 ,i(q),k)dω 0 is a density that is strictly log-supermodular in (ω, i),
                        ω
which means that ϕ(ω, i, k) likelihood-ratio dominates ϕ(ω, i0 , k) if and only if i > i0 .69 The
average wage w̄(i, k) is therefore strictly increasing in skill intensity i. We can similarly
     66
      This assumption is analogous to Property (28) in Costinot and Vogel (2010), which connects observ-
able and unobservable skills. If l(N, ω) is strictly increasing in ω, then choosing the labeling scheme
of worker type t = N or t = P with N > P makes l(t, ω) a strictly log-supermodular function.
Since `(ω, i, k) is strictly    R log-supermodular in (ω, i) and strict log-supermodularity is preserved by in-
tegration,
R              the  integral R ω `(ω, i, k)l(t, ω)dω is strictly log-supermodular in (t, i). As a result, the ratio
  ω
    `(ω,  i, k)l(N,  ω)dω/     ω
                                  `(ω, i, k)l(P, ω)dω is strictly increasing in i. Therefore shareN (i, k) is strictly in-
creasing in i.
   67
      This follows from `(ω, i, k) log-supermodular in (ω, k) and l(t, ω) log-supermodular in (t, ω).
   68
      A sufficient condition is ∂ ln w(ω,k)
                                          ∂ω     = ∂ ln∂ω

                                                                        f (ω,k)

have greater absolute advantage than local abundance.

      w̄(i, k) and ϕ(ω, i, k) can be written in terms of the skill intensity i(q) because i(q) = i(q 0 ) ⇒

                                  `(ω 0 , q, k)l(P, ω 0 )dω 0

and an analogous average wage w̄N (i, k) for non-production workers with density ϕN (ω, i, k).
ϕP (ω, i, k) and ϕN (ω, i, k) are strictly log-supermodular in (ω, i), so these average wages are
strictly increasing in skill intensity i.
     Inside the FPE set, wages equalize across locations, w̄(q, k) = w̄(q) ∀k, and ranking
plants by their averages wages is equivalent to ranking them by their factor intensities,
w̄j > w̄j 0 ⇐⇒ i(j) > i(j 0 ). w̄P (q, k) and w̄N (q, k) also have these properties. This motivates
using these average wages as establishment-level controls for skill intensity. Outside the FPE
set, if w(ω, k)1−σ is log-supermodular, w(ω, k)ϕ(ω, i, k) is strictly log-supermodular in (ω, i)
and in (ω, k). As a result, w̄(i, k) is increasing in i, increasing in k, and log-supermodular.
I therefore use w̄j × ln ȳk as an additional establishment-level control for skill intensity.
     The approximation Mq,k (τ ) and its empirical counterparts describing the composition of
demand using per capita incomes exploit the fact that this is a sufficient statistic for relative
demand for qualities under the model’s assumptions. Lemma 1 in Fajgelbaum, Grossman,
and Helpman (2011) shows that, when g(y, k) is log-supermodular and trade costs are small,
relative demand for higher-q varieties is greater in the higher-k location. That is, when g(y, k)
is log-supermodular, Γk0 (q, n̄, c̄, 0) is log-supermodular in (q, k). As mentioned previously,
when g(y, k) is log-supermodular, income per capita is a sufficient statistic for k.
     If trade costs were large, expression (5) may not be a good approximation of profits.
The approximation characterizes market access Mq,k (τ ) using the composition of demand
Γk (q, n̄, c̄, 0) when trade is costless. When trade costs are high, Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ) also varies
across k 0 due to the equilibrium locations of firms. To the degree that trade costs are large,
Γk0 (q, n, c, τ ) may not be well predicted by Γk (q, n̄, c̄, 0) and therefore not well predicted by
variation in income per capita alone. In my empirical work, I find that my market-access
measures explain much of the variation in outgoing shipment prices that is related to origin
incomes, so they do not seem to be underpowered in practice.
     Mot2 can be written as a weighted average of Mot1 and ln ȳot . A city’s own income per
capita has greater weight in this average when it is more populous than and more distant
from other metropolitan areas.

B       Data appendix
B.1     Public data
B.1.1    Geography

All the reported results describe core-based statistical areas (CBSAs). ZIP-code tabulation
areas (ZCTAs), counties, and public-use microdata areas (PUMAs) were assigned to OMB-
defined CBSAs using the MABLE Geocorr2K geographic correspondence engine from the
Missouri Census Data Center. I use the CBSA geographies as defined in November 2008.
These consist of 366 metropolitan areas and 574 micropolitan statistical areas.
    In the gravity regressions and in constructing the market-access measures, I define the
mileage distance between two CBSAs as the geodetic distance between their population
centers. These population centers are the population-weighted average of the latitude and
longitude coordinates of all ZCTAs within the CBSA, using population counts from the
2000 Census. I define the mileage distance from a CBSA to itself as the population-weighted
average of the pairwise geodetic distances between all the ZCTAs within the CBSA. For
five CBSAs containing only one ZCTA, I generated this mileage distance to self using the
predicted values obtained by projecting mileage distance to self for the other 935 CBSAs
onto their land areas.

B.1.2    Locational characteristics

Data on CBSAs’ aggregate populations and personal incomes come from the BEA’s regional
economic profiles for 1997, 2002, and 2007, data series CA30.
    Data on the distribution of household incomes for the 1997 and 2002 samples were con-
structed from county-level estimates reported in U.S. Census Bureau, 2000 Census Summary
File 3, Series P052. Data on the distribution of household incomes at the CBSA level for
the 2007 sample were obtained from U.S. Census Bureau, 2005-2009 American Community
Survey 5-Year Estimates, Series B19001.
    City-industry college shares were constructed from the 2000 Census and 2005-2009 Amer-
ican Community Surveys microdata made available via IPUMS-USA (Ruggles, Alexander,
Genadek, Goeken, Schroeder, and Sobek, 2010). City-industry means and standard devia-
tions of years of schooling and wages from the 2000 Census and 2005-2009 American Com-
munity Surveys microdata made available via IPUMS-USA (Ruggles, Alexander, Genadek,
Goeken, Schroeder, and Sobek, 2010).
    Locations’ latitudes and longitudes were compiled from various sources. Latitude and
longitude coordinates for US ZIP-code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) were obtained from the


                                            8
2000 Census.70 The geodetic distances for export shipments in appendix section E.1 were
calculated using latitude and longitude coordinates for major Canadian cities, which were
constructed by aggregating Canadian dissemination areas’ populations and coordinates in
the 2006 Census Geographic Attribute File from Statistics Canada, and coordinates of each
nation’s capital or main city from Mayer and Zignago (2011).

B.1.3      Industrial and product characteristics

The Sutton (1998) R&D and advertising intensity measure of scope for vertical differentiation
is provided at the SIC72 level in Federal Trade Commission (1981). These were mapped to
1987 SIC codes using the Bartlesman, Becker, and Gray concordance from Jon Haveman’s
website and to 1997, 2002, and 2007 (via 2002) NAICS codes using concordances from the
US Census. For industries to which multiple SIC72 industries were mapped, I calculated the
weighted average of intensities, using 1975 sales as weights.
    The Khandelwal (2010) ‘ladder’ measure of scope for vertical differentiation was mapped
from HS10 product codes to 6-digit NAICS codes using the Pierce and Schott (2012) concor-
dance. For industries to which multiple commodities were mapped, I calculated the weighted
average of ladder lengths, using the initial period import values reported by Khandelwal as
weights.
    I use the Bureau of Economic Analysis Benchmark Input-Output Data to distinguish
between final consumer goods and intermediate inputs and to construct input-market access
measures. I use the 1997 and 2002 Standard Make and Use Tables at the detailed level to
compute each industry’s fraction of value produced that is sold to final consumers. I also
use them to construct input-market-access measures based on industries’ expenditure shares
for purchased inputs. I calculate share-weighted average wages using the input-output table
shares and local wages from the Longitudinal Business Data microdata.
    In calculating demand shifters, I mapped the Feenstra and Romalis (2014) estimates
of σ̂ and λ̂ from SITC revision 2 commodity codes to 5-digit SCTG product codes using
a United Nations SITC-HS concordance and a Statistics Canada HS-SCTG concordance.
When multiple parameter estimates mapped to a single 5-digit SCTG product code, I used
the median values of σ̂ and λ̂. The results are robust to using the arithmetic mean.


B.2       Confidential Census data
I use establishment-level microdata from the 1997, 2002, and 2007 editions of the Commodity
Flow Survey (CFS) and Census of Manufactures (CMF).

B.2.1     Commodity Flow Survey

I use data describing shipments by manufacturing plants from the Commodity Flow Survey,
a component of the quinquennial Economic Census. Each quarter of the survey year, estab-
lishments report a randomly selected sample of 20-40 of their shipments from a given week
and describe them in terms of commodity content, value, weight, destination, transporta-
tion mode, and other characteristics. The approximately 100,000 establishments sampled
by the CFS were selected using a stratified sampling design reflecting the Commodity Flow
Survey’s objectives (Bureau of Transportation Statistics and US Census Bureau, 2010); of
the approximately 350,000 manufacturing establishments in the United States, about 10,000
per year appear in my estimation sample.71
    These data are analogous to firm-level customs data with four important distinctions.
First, the data describe shipments at the establishment level rather than at the firm level.
Second, the geographic detail of ZIP-to-ZIP shipments is orders of magnitude more precise
than the distance measures used to describe international transactions. Each shipment’s
mileage was estimated by BTS/Census using routing algorithms and an integrated, inter-
modal transportation network developed for that purpose. Third, establishments report a
sample of their shipments in the survey, not a complete record of all transactions. Each
quarter of the survey year, establishments report a randomly selected sample of 20-40 of
their shipments in one week. The CFS data include statistical weights that can be used to
estimate aggregate shipment flows. Fourth, the CFS uses a distinct product classification
scheme, the Standard Classification of Transport Goods, that is related to the Harmonized
System used in international trade data. At its highest level of detail, five digits, the SCTG
defines 512 product categories.72
    The Commodity Flow Survey microdata include statistical weights so that observations
can be summed to obtain estimated totals that are representative. Each shipments’ asso-
ciated “tabulation weight” is the product of seven component weights (Bureau of Trans-
portation Statistics and US Census Bureau, 2010, Appendix C). The products of four of
these weights (shipment weight, shipment nonresponse weight, quarter weight, and quarter
nonresponse weight) scale up an establishment’s shipments to estimate the establishments’
total annual shipments. The other three component weights (establishment-level adjustment
weight, establishment weight, industry-level adjustment weight) scale up establishments’ to-
tal shipments to estimate national shipments. The 1997 and 2002 microdata report only the
  71
     The 2002 CFS sample is roughly half that of the 1997 and 2007 surveys, sampling about 50,000 establish-
ments in total and a proportionate number that appear in my estimation sample (Bureau of Transportation
Statistics and US Census Bureau, 2004).
  72
     By comparison, the HS scheme has 97 2-digit and about 1400 4-digit commodity categories.



                                                    10
tabulation weights, while the 2007 microdata report all seven component weights.
     The demand estimation performed in section E.3 requires measures of establishments’
market shares, which are calculated from estimates of their total sales of that product in
a destination market. These shares are estimated using the first four component weights.
These establishment-level measures should not be scaled up by the latter three component
weights, such as the probability of the establishment being selected into the CFS sample.
As a result, it is only possible to calculate the plant-product demand shifters using the 2007
microdata, which include the component weights required to estimate market shares.
     The CFS classifies shipments’ commodity contents using the Standard Classification of
Transported Goods (SCTG), a coding system based on the Harmonized System (HS) clas-
sification that was introduced in the 1997 CFS. At its highest level of detail, five digits, the
SCTG defines 512 product categories. By comparison, the HS scheme has 97 2-digit and
about 1400 4-digit commodity categories. I exclude from my analysis all SCTG product
categories whose 5-digit product codes end in 99, since these are catch-all categories such as
24399 “Other articles of rubber.”
     I calculate shipment unit values by dividing shipment value by shipment weight. All my
analyses of these unit values are within-product comparisons or regressions incorporating
product fixed effects. These unit values are proxies for producer prices, because they do not
include shipping costs or shelving costs that may appear in the retail consumer price.
     Each shipment is reported to have been sent by any combination of eight transportation
modes. In much of the analysis, including all the shipment price regressions, I restrict at-
tention to unimodal shipments and the five most common multimodal shipments. Unimodal
shipments constitute more than 80% of shipments by value and 90% by weight (Bureau of
Transportation Statistics and US Census Bureau, 2010).

B.2.2    Census of Manufactures

Each manufacturing plant appearing in the Commodity Flow Survey also appears in the Cen-
sus of Manufactures, which describes plant-level characteristics such as wage bills, production
and non-production employees, and capital stocks. The CMF also identifies the county in
which an establishment is located. Very small establishments do not report detailed produc-
tion data to the CMF. Instead, the Census Bureau uses data from administrative records
from other agencies, such as tax records, to obtain information on revenues and employment.
It then imputes other variables.
    The product trailer of the CMF describes the products produced at each establishment.
For all products, establishments report the total value of their annual output. For a subset



                                              11
of products, establishments report both values and quantities.73 I calculate unit values by
dividing product value shipped by product quantity shipped; these unit values are used in
appendix Table D.2.

B.2.3      Longitudinal Business Database

I also use information from the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), which is a census of
US business establishments and firms with paid employees. Microdata from the 1997, 2002,
and 2007 editions are a combination of survey and administrative records. I use the LBD
for three purposes. First, I use the records in linking establishments across the 2002 CFS
and CMF data sets. Second, I use an establishment’s first year appearing in the LBD, which
is a comprehensive census, to calculate plants’ ages. Third, I use the LBD in constructing
input-market-access measures.

B.2.4      Combining the CFS and CMF

I matched shipment-level observations in CFS data to establishment-level characteristics in
CMF data using unique establishment identifiers called Census File Numbers (1997) and
Survey Unit Identifiers (2002, 2007). I also used information in the LBD to address the
switch from CFNs to SUIs in 2002.
    Each data source contains information on the geographic location of an establishment.
The CMF reports the county in which an establishment is located. The CFS reports the ZIP
code and state in all survey years and some information about core-based statistical areas
in 2002 and 2007.

B.2.5      Sample selection

Though the CFS and CMF data are very rich descriptions of establishments and their ship-
ments, some of the observations exhibit limitations that warrant their exclusion from the
estimation sample.
    CFS & CMF: I exclude SCTG5-NAICS6 pairs in which fewer than five establishments
report shipping a commodity.
    CFS: I restrict the sample to shipments whose mode of transportation is unimodal or
one of the five most common multimodal combinations. I exclude shipments with unit
values more than two standard deviations from the product mean. I exclude destination-
product pairs for which only one establishment ships that product to that destination. I
 73
      The set of products for which product quantity shipped data are collected has shrunk over time.




                                                     12
exclude shipments that are the unique instance of that commodity being shipped by that
establishment.
    CMF: I exclude establishments not belonging to a OMB-defined CBSA as identified
by their county location in the CMF and the November-2008-vintage CBSA definitions. I
exclude establishments whose information in the Census of Manufactures are derived from
administrative records rather than directly reported. I exclude establishments whose employ-
ment levels or wage bills are imputed in the 2002 and 2007 CMF.74 I exclude establishments
with wages that lie below the 1st percentile or above the 99th percentile of the wage distri-
bution for manufacturing establishments.


C      Gravity regressions appendix
This appendix characterizes the pattern of manufactures shipments between US cities using
a gravity model of shipment volumes. Gravity regressions relate the volume of trade to the
origin’s economic size in terms of output produced, the destination’s economic size in terms
of consumer expenditure, and trade frictions between the origin and destination.75 Hallak
(2010) and Bernasconi (2013) use gravity models of trade flows between countries to assess
whether locations with more similar income levels trade more with each other, controlling for
origin characteristics, destination characteristics, and bilateral trade frictions. They find that
countries with more similar income distributions trade more with each other, as predicted
by Burenstam Linder (1961). I find a similar pattern of trade flows between US cities.
    The baseline gravity specification is

                  ln Xodt = −η · ln milesod + β · | ln ȳot − ln ȳdt | + γot + γdt + odt

where Xodt is the volume of manufactures shipments from origin o to destination d in year
t, milesod is the distance between the two locations, | ln ȳot − ln ȳdt | is the difference in their
log per capita incomes, γot and γdt origin-year and destination-year fixed effects, and odt is
a residual reflecting both random sampling and potential measurement error.76
    This baseline specification is estimated using observations with strictly positive shipment
  74
     The 1997 CMF does not identify variables that have been imputed, so I am unable to exclude such
observations.
  75
     See Anderson (2011) and Bergstrand and Egger (2011) for surveys of the gravity literature. Importantly,
the correct notions of economic size account for “multilateral resistance” terms that depend on the locations’
bilateral trade frictions with all trading partners. These are captured by fixed effects in my regressions.
  76
     Observations of Xodt include sampling error since a representative sample of shipments is used to estimate
the total shipment volume. See the data appendix B for details. Noise in the dependent variable will not
bias the estimated coefficients of interest.



                                                      13
volumes. In fact, there are many zeros in the trade matrix, and these non-positive shipment
volumes reflect economic mechanisms, like trade costs. For example, every city ships a
positive amount to itself Xoot > 0 ∀o∀s∀t.
   I use two approaches to correct for the non-random nature of zeros. First, I implement
the Heckman (1979) two-step selection correction. The first-step probit regression, which
has the same regressors on the right-hand side, yields an estimated probability of a strictly
positive shipment volume for each origin-destination-sector-year. The second-step estimating
equation is

                                                                   φ(Φ−1 (ρ̂odt ))
       ln Xodt = −η · ln milesod + β · | ln ȳot − ln ȳdt | + δ                   + γot + γdt + odt ,
                                                                      ρ̂odst

where ρ̂odt is the predicted probability from the probit regression, φ and Φ are the probability
                                                                          −1 (ρ̂
and cumulative density functions of the normal distribution, and φ(Φ ρ̂odt      odt ))
                                                                                       is the inverse
Mills ratio. The second approach I use to address zeros is the Poisson pseudo-maximum
likelihood estimator introduced by Silva and Tenreyro (2006) to estimate the gravity equation
in levels.

                          E(Xodt ) = miles−η                      β
                                          od | ln ȳot − ln ȳdt | exp(γot + γdt )


This estimation approach allows me to include observations for which Xodt = 0.77
    Table C.1 reports the result of estimating this gravity regression for aggregate manu-
factures shipment volumes. The first column reports the result of estimating the baseline
gravity specification via OLS. The second column uses the squared difference in incomes,
(ln ȳot − ln ȳdt )2 , as a regressor instead of the absolute difference. The third column adds the
two-step Heckman (1979) correction for selection into strictly positive trade flows. The fourth
column uses the Silva and Tenreyro (2006) Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator
for all observations. This final estimator is my preferred specification.
    In all specifications, the difference between two cities’ average income levels is nega-
tively correlated with the level of trade between them. The Linder pattern of trade, in
which locations with more similar incomes trade more intensely with each other, holds true
for manufactures shipments between US cities. The finding that locations disproportion-
ately demand products that are produced in locations of similar income levels suggests two
elements that any model explaining within-product specialization must incorporate. First,
preferences are non-homothetic, so the composition of demand varies with locations’ incomes.

     Silva and Tenreyro (2006) emphasize that their estimation procedure addresses a concern that higher
moments of exp(odt ) are correlated with the regressors, which would cause the estimated coefficients in the
log-linear specification to be inconsistent.

Second, high-income locations have comparative advantage in producing products that are
particularly attractive to high-income consumers. As described in section 2, these patterns
are compatible with the factor-abundance mechanism or home-market effect determining the
pattern of within-product specialization.
    The distance elasticity of trade is estimated to be near negative one, although the two-
step Heckman specification implies that shipment volumes are notably more sensitive to the
distance between origin and destination. An elasticity close to negative one is consistent
with the central tendency of the vast international literature summarized by Disdier and
Head (2008) and the elasticity of domestic shipments reported in Table 1 of Hillberry and
Hummels (2008) for geographically aggregate shipment volumes. In section 3.5, I use the
fact that sales volumes are inversely proportionate to distance to construct market-access
measures.

CBSA distinct from the origin CBSA. All regressions include SCTG5 × NAICS6 × destination × year fixed
effects and mode × year fixed effects. The third through fifth columns include 3-digit-NAICS-specific cubic
polynomials in log mileage.



E      Empirical results appendix
This appendix reports further empirical evidence consistent with the results presented in
section 5. First, export shipments exhibit patterns consistent with those found in domestic
transactions. Second, cities with greater income dispersion have higher outgoing shipment
prices, consistent with the model’s demand system in an equilibrium in which most indi-
viduals purchase low-quality varieties. Third, demand shifters exhibit the same patterns
as outgoing shipment prices. Fourth, the reported results are robust to controlling for in-
put market access. Fifth, the reported results hold in samples that exclude large plants or
multi-plant firms.


E.1     Export shipments
This section examines export shipments. My empirical investigation was motivated in part
by a growing international trade literature on quality specialization. I implemented my
empirical strategy using plant-level data from US cities of varying income levels. The analysis
above described shipments destined for US cities, which account for the vast majority of
US manufactures output, to characterize how shipments’ characteristics are related to the


                                                    18
characteristics of their production locations. This section shows that the patterns found in
domestic shipments are also found in export shipments destined for foreign markets.
    Export shipments by US manufacturing plants exhibit price patterns consistent with
those observed in domestic shipments. Table E.1 presents results for regressions analogous to
those presented in Tables 3 and 4 using shipments sent to foreign destinations. The sample
size is considerably smaller, since exports represent less than 8% of shipments by value
and 4% by weight (Bureau of Transportation Statistics and US Census Bureau, 2010).78 I
calculate the mileage distance from origin CBSA to foreign destination using latitude and
longitude coordinates.79
    The estimated coefficients are consistent with those reported for shipments to domestic
destinations. The origin-income elasticity of export prices is 42%. After controlling for plant-
level factor usage, the origin-income elasticity is 30%. Upon introduction of the market-access
measures, the origin-income elasticity becomes negative and statistically indistinguishable
from zero. The dispersion of household income in the origin CBSA is positively related
to export shipment prices, though this relationship is statistically insignificant, presumably
due to the small sample size. Thus, the empirical relationships between export shipment
prices, factor usage, and the demand measures are in line with those found for shipments to
domestic destinations.




  78
    This small sample size prevents me from calculating demand shifters using export shipments.
  79
    For Canadian destinations, I use the coordinates of major Canadian cities. For other countries, I use
the coordinates of the capital or main city. See data appendix B for details.

E.2      Income dispersion
This section documents the relationship between the second moment of the income distribu-
tion and shipment prices. Cities with greater dispersion in household income exhibit higher
prices for both incoming and outgoing shipments. The latter is not explained by dispersion
in workers’ wages or skills. These findings are consistent with a demand-side mechanism
linking local income distributions to the pattern of quality specialization.
    In the Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011) model, income inequality is linked to
quality specialization because the income distribution determines the composition of local
demand for quality. In general, the effect of greater income dispersion on relative demand
for quality is ambiguous. The authors’ Proposition 2(iii) shows that, when there are two
qualities and the majority of individuals at all income levels consume the low-quality variety,
a mean-preserving spread of the income distribution raises local relative demand for the
high-quality variety in their demand system. Since the converse would hold if a majority
of individuals consumed high-quality varieties, there is no general theoretical result for the
correlation between income dispersion and relative demand for quality.
    A few theories link income dispersion to specialization through supply-side mechanisms
that are absent from the model in section 3. In Grossman and Maggi (2000) and Bombardini,
Gallipoli, and Pupato (2012), locations with more diverse skill distributions have comparative
advantage in sectors in which skills are more substitutable.80 In Grossman (2004), imperfect
labor contracting causes locations with more diverse skill distributions to have comparative
advantage in sectors in which the most talented individuals’ contributions are more easily
identified. Applying these models to the question at hand involves reinterpreting them as
theories of intrasectoral specialization. For example, if different skills were less substitutable
in the production of higher-quality products, these models would predict that locations
with greater skill dispersion would specialize in lower-quality varieties.81 If they were more
substitutable, the reverse prediction would result.
    In light of these theoretical ambiguities, I rely on the distinction between income dis-
persion among local consumers and skill dispersion among local workers to empirically dis-
tinguish between the demand-side and supply-side mechanisms. Income dispersion among
all potential customers influences the demand channel. In the supply-side theories (appro-
  80
     Though both papers describe locations with greater skill dispersion specializing in sectors with greater
substitutability of skills, these two papers differ considerably. Grossman and Maggi (2000) compare two
countries and two sectors, one in which output is supermodular in the two workers’ talents and another
in which output is submodular in talents. They assume that talent is perfectly observed. Bombardini,
Gallipoli, and Pupato (2012) describe imperfectly observed skills and CES production functions that vary
in their elasticities of substitution between skills.
  81
     Grossman and Maggi (2000, p.1255,1271) cite quality control as an example of supermodular production
in which less dispersion yields comparative advantage.


                                                     21
priately reinterpreted to describe specialization within sectors), only skill dispersion among
those working in the industry in question is relevant. Thus, I construct two types of empiri-
cal measures: the standard deviation of household income within each city and the standard
deviations of years of schooling and weekly wages within each city-industry pair. The former
proxies for the demand-side mechanism; the latter for the supply-side. I proceed to include
these measures, which are available for most but not all metropolitan areas in the sample,
in linear regressions describing shipment prices.
    Table E.2 documents how shipment prices are related to income and skill dispersion in the
destination and origin cities. The first two columns report the result of adding the standard
deviation of household income in the shipment destination to multivariate regressions like
those appearing in Table 2. The first column includes observable origin-city characteristics;
the second column includes origin-city fixed effects. In each case, the standard deviation
of household income is strongly positively related to the price of incoming shipments. This
is consistent with an equilibrium in which a more dispersed income distribution has more
households in the right tail of the distribution who purchase higher-price, higher-quality
varieties.
    The next three columns of Table E.2 relate outgoing shipment prices to income and skill
dispersion in the shipment origin. These regressions all include destination-product-year
fixed effects and control variables with industry-specific third-order polynomials, like those
regressions appearing in the last column of Table 3. The third column introduces the stan-
dard deviation of household income as a regressor alongside origin characteristics, shipment
mileage, and the three plant-level factor-usage controls. The standard deviation of house-
hold income in the shipment origin is strongly, positively related to the outgoing shipment
price. This is consistent with models in which income dispersion generates demand for high-
price, high-quality varieties or skill dispersion generates comparative advantage in high-price,
high-quality varieties. The fifth and sixth columns introduce city-industry-level measures of
skill dispersion are available so that we can contrast income dispersion amongst potential
customers with skill dispersion amongst workers employed in production. The key result
is that controlling for the logs of the standard deviations of years of schooling and weekly
wages at the city-industry level leaves the coefficients on origin characteristics virtually un-
altered. Skill dispersion on the supply side appears unrelated to outgoing shipment prices.
These findings suggest that a demand-side mechanism links the local income distribution to
specialization.

E.3       Demand shifters
This section characterizes the pattern of within-product specialization across US cities and
its determinants using estimated demand shifters. As previously described, consumer love
of variety in the presence of horizontal differentiation breaks the price-quality mapping by
allowing high-cost varieties to sell alongside low-cost varieties of the same quality. Section
5 addresses this concern by including a variety of plant-level cost measures, which were
not available to researchers analyzing aggregate trade flows between countries. This section
addresses the concern a second time by estimating demand shifters for each plant-product
pair. The empirical results are consistent with the unit-value findings.
    The demand-shifter approach assigns higher quality valuations to products that have
higher market shares, conditional on price (Berry, 1994; Khandelwal, 2010; Sutton, 2012).
As described in the data appendix, it is only possible to calculate plants’ market shares in


                                                              23
the 2007 edition of the Commodity Flow Survey. This considerably reduces the number of
observations compared to the number underlying the previously presented results.
   To compute demand shifters in the absence of instruments for producer prices, I use the
“non-homothetic CES preferences” of Feenstra and Romalis (2014).82 In this specification,
the sales volume sjd of product j in destination market d in 2007 is described by



                         ln sjd =(σ − 1)(ln qj + λ ln ȳd ln qj − ln pjd ) + γd + jd

where qj is the product-quality shifter, pjd is price, ȳd is per capita income in market d, γd
captures both aggregate expenditure and the price index in the destination market, and jd
captures both idiosyncratic demand shocks and measurement error. The parameter λ governs
how consumer valuation of quality varies with income; the parameter σ is the elasticity of
substitution and price elasticity of demand. In the demand system, pjd is the price paid by
the consumer, while in my data the observed price p̌jd excludes shipping costs.83 I therefore
include the shipment mileage from establishment to destination and the shipment mileage
                                        1
interacted with price, ln milesjd and p̌jdt ln milesjd , as additional regressors to control for
shipping costs.84 I use sectoral estimates of λ̂ and σ̂ from Feenstra and Romalis (2014) in
order to estimate qj in the linear regression

             ln sjd + (σ̂ − 1) ln p̌jd                                      1
                                         = ln qj + η1 ln milesjd + η2           ln milesjd + γ̃d + ˜jd
              (1 + λ̂ ln ȳd )(σ̂ − 1)                                     p̌jd

where γ̃d and ˜jd are rescaled versions of γd and jd . These regressions are estimated product-
by-product, for products defined by SCTG5-NAICS6 codes, for the 2007 sample.85
    Table E.3 describes how these estimated demand shifters relate to the observable charac-
teristics of products, plants, and cities. The first column reports that the estimated demand
shifters are strongly positively correlated with plants’ prices. This validates the use of prices
  82
     One merit of this demand system is its computational simplicity. Because the nested-logit demand system
used in the Fajgelbaum, Grossman, and Helpman (2011) model uses quality levels as nests, its estimation
would require a computationally intensive iterative approach. Products must be assigned to quality nests in
order to estimate the demand system, and product qualities must be inferred by estimating demand.
  83
     In international trade parlance, demand depends on the “cost-insurance-and-freight” price while my
data reports the “free-on-board” price. If the consumer price reflects both multiplicative and additive trade

           and τjd                    m

                                         + τjd                          m
                                               and ln pjd ≈ ln p̌jd + (τjd − 1) + p̌1jd τjd
                                                                                         a                   m
                                                                                            . Assuming that τjd      a

are functions of the shipment distance motivates the inclusion of ln milesjd and p̃jd ln milesjd as regressors.
  84
     Omitting these regressors has very little impact on the estimated demand shifters and the subsequent
results relating these shifters to city and plant characteristics.

     I obtain very similar results if I define products using only 5-digit SCTG codes. See the appendix section
B for details of how I mapped the Feenstra and Romalis (2014) parameter estimates to these product codes.

in inferring the pattern of quality specialization earlier in the paper. The second column
shows that plants with higher estimated demand shifters are located in cities with higher per
capita incomes. The 41% origin-income elasticity of the estimated demand shifter is simi-
lar to the 44% origin-income elasticity of outgoing shipment prices. The third and eighth
columns demonstrate that this positive relationship persists after controlling for plants’ in-
put usage. Qualitatively consistent with the result in section 5.1, observed differences in
plant-level factor usage explain less than half of the observed correlation between plants’
output characteristics and per capita incomes. The fourth and ninth columns replicate the
finding that the income composition of proximate potential customers, excluding those in
the city of production, is strongly positively associated with a plant’s output profile. The
11-percentage-point decline in the origin-income elasticity caused by introducing the first-
market access measure after controlling for factor-usage differences suggests that proximity
to these customers explains at least one-quarter of the observed variation. The sixth column
demonstrates that introducing the first market-access measure prior to controlling for factor
usage would result in a change in the origin-income elasticity of essentially the same mag-
nitude as controlling for factor usage. The fifth, seventh, and tenth columns demonstrate
that the second market-access measure, which includes residents in the city of production,
has greater explanatory power. The eleventh column replicates the findings of section 5.2 by
demonstrating a positive relationship with origin CBSA income dispersion and the market-
access measure.
    These results can be succinctly summarized as a decomposition of the covariance between
incomes and shifters. After controlling for population size, differences in observed factor us-
age are responsible for 46% of the covariance between per capita incomes and estimated
demand shifters. Conditional on factor usage, the conservative market-access measure that
omits residents in the city of production accounts for 25% of the total covariance, leaving 30%
as residual variation. The model-consistent market-access measure that includes residents in
the city of production accounts for 48% of the total covariance, leaving 7% as residual vari-
ation.86 Thus, the observed pattern of specialization and inferences about its determinants
obtained using estimated demand shifters are similar to those obtained by examining unit
values.

ling for spatial differences in the factor content potentially embedded in intermediate in-

       are the interactions of log origin income per capita with the three input variables.



puts purchased from suppliers. To account for “upstream human capital”, I construct a
city-industry-level measure of the average wage at potential input suppliers, using pay per
worker in the Longitudinal Business Database and the input shares reported in the BEA’s
Benchmark Input-Output data. Since the factor content embedded in inputs may be sourced
from other cities, I also calculate such an average wage using all plants in cities within 200
miles to account for input market access.
    Table E.4 introduces these input-market-access measures as additional regressors and
shows that the prior results are largely unchanged. The first column, included to facilitate
comparisons, is identical to the first column of Table 4. The average wage in upstream indus-
tries in the city of production, the regressor aimed at controlling for upstream human capital
that is introduced in the second column, has little explanatory power. The input-market-
access measure, introduced in the third column, is statistically significant as a regressor but
does not meaningfully alter the estimated income elasticity of outgoing shipment prices. The
fourth column shows that the coefficient on Mot1 , the output-market-access measure, is not
sensitive to controlling for this input market access. The fourth through eighth columns
demonstrate that these findings hold when flexibly controlling for plant-level factor usage
and input market access.

      Notes: Manufacturing establishments in the CFS and CMF. All shipments are to a domestic
      destination CBSA distinct from the origin CBSA. All regressions include SCTG5 × NAICS6 ×
      destination × year fixed effects and mode × year fixed effects. Columns 1 through 3 restrict the
      sample to plants below the 75th percentile in plant sales and firms below the 75th percentile in
      firm sales. Columns 4 through 6 restrict the sample to “single-plant firms” (SPF), which are
      plants that are the only plant in the Census of Manufactures owned by their parent.



    This section attempts to address the concern that the regression results might be driven
by shipments from plants whose decisions are poorly described by the model if, for example,
large firms impose uniform pricing across plants irrespective of local conditions. Table E.5
restricts the estimation sample to non-large plants and single-plant firms. The first through
third columns show that findings for non-large plants owned by non-large firms are similar
to those found in the sample as a whole. The fourth through sixth columns show that
relative contributions of factor usage and market access are also similar in the subsample of
single-plant firms.
