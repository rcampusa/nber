                                           ABSTRACT

In this paper, we examine the impact of poor water quality on avoidance behavior by estimating the
change in bottled water purchases in response to drinking water violations. Using data from a national
grocery chain matched with water quality violations, we find an increase in bottled water sales of 22
percent from violations due to microorganisms and 17 percent from violations due to elements and
chemicals. Back-of-the envelope calculations yield costs of avoidance behavior at roughly $60 million
for all nationwide violations in 2005, which likely reflects a significant understatement of the total
willingness to pay to eliminate violations.

                     Water Quality Violations and Avoidance Behavior:
                       Evidence from Bottled Water Consumption

                  Joshua Graff Zivin, Matthew Neidell, Wolfram Schlenker

       The provision and public dissemination of information about health hazards has become

an increasingly important part of state and federal programs designed to manage environmental

and health risks. Examples include the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxics

Release Inventory, the US Food and Drug Administration’s fish advisories, and California’s

‘smog alerts’ program. The central idea behind each of these programs is that the provision of

information allows the public to engage in behavioral responses to minimize exposure should the

costs of that exposure exceed its benefits. Whether such information is a substitute or

complement to environmental standards is an open question. In either case, understanding

responses to such informational approaches is critical for determining both the costs and the

effectiveness of these programs.

       One important area where informational approaches play a key role is in the management

of drinking water quality. The EPA, under the auspices of the Safe Drinking Water Act

(SDWA), places strict limits on roughly 90 chemicals or contaminants in community drinking

water systems, which is accessed by nearly 270 million people in the United States. Despite

these limits, roughly one in ten Americans is served by a drinking water system that exceeds

these limits on at least one dimension (Duhigg, 2009). Such violations must be disclosed to

consumers under the SDWA Amendments of 1996. This paper examines avoidance behavior in

response to these disclosures regarding drinking water violations.

       Matching geocoded violations data for Northern California and Nevada from 2001-2005

with sales data from a major supermarket chain, we estimate the change in bottled water

                                                                                                 1
purchases as a result of tap water violations. Since the behavioral response in this case is a

market-based one, it is straightforward to calculate the costs of avoidance behavior. We find a

statistically significant increase in bottled water sales of 22 percent from violations due to

microorganisms and 17 percent from violations due to elements and chemicals.1 Combining

these store-level estimates from Northern California and Nevada with national sales data on

bottled water consumption, we compute back-of-the-envelope costs of avoidance behavior at

roughly $60 million for all violations in 2005, noting this figure likely reflects a significant

understatement of the total costs of avoidance behavior, and thus willingness to pay to eliminate

violations.

I. Data

           The SDWA Amendments of 1996 require 150,000 community water districts (CWDs)

throughout the US to actively monitor contaminants levels. If contaminants exceed maximum

contaminant level (MCL) standards, a CWD must notify the EPA of the violation and adhere to

the Public Notification Rule. This rule requires CWDs to notify customers within 24-hours if the

responsible contaminant poses an immediate health threat (primarily microorganisms and

nitrates) and within 30 days for other health threats. CWDs must notify customers through

various social media outlets, posting in public places, and personal delivery. Relevant for our

analysis, these notifications must include a description of the violation and potential health

effects, the population at risk, actions consumers can take, when the violation occurred, when a

resolution is expected, and language encouraging broader distribution of information regarding

the violation.2

    Nitrates and nitrites violations result in reductions of similar magnitude, but are not statistically significant.

    Unfortunately for our analysis, we do not have data on the exact details of the notification provided by districts.
                                                                                                                          2
       The Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) maintained by the EPA contains

detailed records of all violations. After filing a Freedom of Information Act request, we obtained

historical information on all violations that occurred in the US from 2001-2005. These data

include the start and end date of the violation, the contaminant responsible for the violation, as

well as characteristics about the CWD, including the county and population served. We

contacted all water districts in California and Nevada that serve at least 100 people and obtain

the zip codes they serve. If a water district serves more than one zip code, we split the

population served between zip codes based on their overall population. For example, if a water

district serves customers in two zip codes, where zip code 1 has twice the population of zip code

2, we assigned two-thirds of the population served to zip code 1 and one-third to zip code 2.

       We combine individual violations into three broadly defined groups based on their

potential health effects, which is also consistent with the public notification rule.

“Microorganisms” pose immediate gastrointestinal health threats to all individuals; this largely

consists of coliform bacteria and can be removed by boiling tap water. “Nitrates” pose

immediate threat of “blue-baby syndrome” to infants and can not be removed by boiling.

“Elements/chemicals,” which includes natural occurring elements, such as arsenic,

manufacturing chemicals, such as tetrachloroethylene, and disinfection byproducts from

removing microorganisms, also can not be removed by boiling. The health effects from

elements/chemicals, which include cancer and toxicity to various organs, typically arise from

longer-term exposure and do not require immediate notification. Table 1 displays the number of

violations for each group along with the mean duration of each violation for both the US and our

final sample for the years 2001-2005.

       Our data on bottled water consumption uses weekly sales (Wednesday-Tuesday) from a

                                                                                                     3
national grocery chain for their stores in Northern California and Nevada for weeks starting

October 31, 2001 until November 2, 2005. The data includes sales in dollars as well as quantity

sold for 308 Universal Product Codes (UPC). These UPCs cover still water (e.g., Aquafina,

Dasani), sparkling water (e.g., Pellegrino, Perrier), and flavored sparkling water (e.g., Calistoga

lemon flavored sparkling water). Different sizes of the same product (e.g., 16oz versus 1 gallon)

have distinct UPCs, although the size of a bottle is unfortunately not identified in the UPC

database for most codes. Aggregating quantities is complicated by the fact that an increase in

demand might be met by switching from smaller to larger bottles while holding the number of

units sold constant. Thus, we aggregate sales in dollars for all 308 UPCs by store and week as

our dependent variable.

       Store level sales were linked to water violations by matching water districts with stores

that are located in the zip code that is served by the district. Our baseline model uses zip-codes,

and not a distance measure, to match water districts to zip codes. Such an algorithm better

captures the relevant customer base of a store because zip codes are much larger in rural areas

and customers may drive further to reach a store than customers in urban areas.

       Table 2 displays community characteristics by violation frequency. We define “high

(low) violations” as being above (below) the median number of violations for the time period

studied. In areas with more violations, residents on average consume less bottled water and

come from lower socio-economic status (SES). This pattern is consistent with poorer provision

of public goods in lower SES areas and that bottled water consumption is a normal good. Both

indicate the importance of accounting for the endogeneity of violations.

II. Methods

       In a standard utility maximization setup, we can think of the demand for bottled water as

                                                                                                      4
a function of the price of bottled water, the price of tap water, the price of substitutes (all quality-

adjusted), income, and both time-varying and time-invariant individual preferences. If a

violation occurs, the quality-adjusted price of tap water increases, thus increasing the demand for

bottled water.

        We empirically model this relationship between violations and bottled water sales

according to the following specification:

(1)     yswt = β1 + β2*violationswt*(popwz/popz) + β3*weatherswt + αsw + δt + εswt

where y is log(weekly sales of bottled water) at store s in water district w (both located in zip

code z) in week t. The fraction of time a store-water district combination was in violation for

each of the three types of violations in week t is captured by the vector violation. We multiply

this by popwz/popz, the estimated fraction of the population in zip code z that is served by water

district w, since not all customers in a zip code are faced with a violation. This provides a

measure of the zip code exposure to violations, and enables us to interpret β2 as the percentage

change in sales at each store from a violation affecting all people in the zip code. Controls for

weekly mean maximum and minimum temperature and total precipitation, which account for

potential time-varying preferences for bottled water, are included in weather. Store-water

district fixed effects αsw capture time-invariant factors that affect the demand for bottled water,

such as income and personal preferences. Temporal and seasonal trends in bottled water

consumption are accounted for by year-week fixed effects δt. Finally, εswt is an error term that

consists of a store specific term, a water district specific term, and an i.i.d. component. This

multi-cluster approach allows for arbitrary serial correlation in sales within stores and for

correlation between multiple zip codes served by one water district (Cameron, Gelbach and

Miller, 2011).

                                                                                                       5
        Although we do not include prices in this econometric model, we contend that prices are

unlikely to change in response to local water warnings. Prices are set weekly by a centralized

marketing department of the grocery chain, and hence are unlikely to incorporate local

conditions. Using data from the same chain, Schlenker and Villas-Boas (2009) found negligible

changes in beef prices when Mad Cow disease resulted in drops of meat purchases by 20 percent.

Changes in beef consumption were observed at all stores and hence a coordinated price response

would have been much easier than store-specific responses to local shocks in water demand.

Nonetheless, we create a price index at the store-week level to approximate local prices, and both

use it as an independent and dependent variable in our estimation of equation (1).3

III. Results

        Panel A of Table 3 presents our main results. Column 1 shows cross-sectional

correlations, which should be interpreted with caution because violation frequency is correlated

with other determinants of bottled-water consumption (as shown in Table 2). Accordingly, we

do not find a statistically significant response to water quality violations, with coefficients on

two of the violations having counterintuitive signs. Column 2, which includes store-water

district fixed effects, indicates that controlling for the endogeneity of violations is essential. We

obtain a 22 percent increase in bottled water sales from a microorganism violation, a 26 percent

increase in response to nitrate violations, and a 17 percent increase from an element/chemical

violation, with only the nitrate violation not statistically significantly different from zero. A

larger response to microorganisms and nitrates is consistent with differences in reporting

requirements (i.e., within 24 hours), though these differences are not statistically significant.

3
 We computed the price index as follows: 1) calculate the total quantity sold for each UPC-store combination; 2)
calculate price level: price (at store-UPC-week) divided by average price (store-UPC); and 3) take the weighted
average of price levels in (2) using the fixed basket of (1) as weights.
                                                                                                                   6
         In Panel B, we explore the potential impact of violations on the price of bottled water

using our created price index. In both the cross-sectional and fixed effects regressions, we do not

find a statistically significant relationship between violations and prices, suggesting that local

grocery stores did not change prices in response to the surge in demand from water quality

violations. We also included the price index as an explanatory variable in a revised sales

regression (not shown), and the violation coefficients remain unchanged.4

         Heterogeneous responses to these violations may arise for at least two reasons: 1) more

vulnerable individuals will have greater incentives to respond to violations to which they have a

greater sensitivity; and 2) more forward looking individuals will be more responsive to violations

that generate negative health consequence far into the future. As crude proxies for these, we

separately include violations interacted with three Census measures of the zip code that a water

district serves: median household income, the percent of population under age 5, and the percent

of population over age 65. Table 4 shows the estimated responses to each type of violation for

the bottom and top quartile of the zip code characteristic, along with a p-value from a t-test for

whether the responses are the same across the two quartiles.5 We find a greater response to

microorganisms in communities with a larger elderly population, which is consistent with a

greater response by vulnerable populations. However, we do not find a corresponding increase

for communities with more young children. Consistent with element/chemical violations posing

longer term health risks, we find that communities with wealthier households and a smaller

number of individuals over age 65 had a larger response. We find no support for a differential

4
  We also explore several other alternative specifications, such as controlling for county-specific seasonality, and
found our results to be generally robust to these alternatives. Our baseline regression in column 1 does not include
price since it may be endogenous.
5
  We dropped the results showing interactions with percent under age 5 from Table 4 because all interaction terms
were statistically insignificant (results are available upon request).

                                                                                                                       7
response to nitrates/nitrates, perhaps because they only pose a risk to bottle fed children that may

not be well captured by our simple measure of child exposure in each zip code.

        A considerable advantage from using bottled water sales as a measure of avoidance

behavior is that it reflects a market-based activity that can be used to provide estimates of the

cost of avoidance behavior. We perform the following back-of-the-envelope calculation to

provide estimates of total expenditures on bottled water sales in the US from all violations in

2005:

(2)     Total costs =     ˆ    2    sales ct  violationcwt  ( pop wc / pop c )
                          c   t



where ˆ 2 is the adjusted estimated coefficient from model (1).6 Salesct are interpolated sales on

week t in county c, where we distribute the yearly US total in 2005 of $14.9 billion

(Datamonitor, 2005) evenly among all 52 weeks of the year, and then distribute the weekly sales

volume across counties based on population. The fraction of days in week t that a violation

occurred in each water district in each county for each of the types of violations is measured by

violationcwt. Finally, popwc/popc is the estimated fraction of population in county c that is served

by water district w. This yields a rough approximation of a county-week time series of

population exposure to violations, which when multiplied by the first two terms yields an

estimate of weekly county expenditures in response to violations. We sum this across all

counties and time periods to yield the total expenditures for the entire nation.

        Clearly these estimates involves several unverifiable assumptions, namely that 1) our

estimated responses to violations from Northern California and Nevada are representative of


6
 We adjust this coefficient by multiplying it by the exponent of the mean squared residual divided by two to
account for Jensen’s inequality.

                                                                                                               8
changes throughout the country and at all bottled water retailers, and 2) consumption of bottled

water sales are distributed throughout the year and county as we specify. Since 61.3 percent of

all bottled water sales occurred at supermarkets (Datamonitor, 2005), we can scale our estimates

accordingly if we are concerned that responses at supermarkets are different than responses at

other retail establishments. Beyond that, there is unfortunately little more we can do with the

data at hand. It nonetheless provides a useful starting point for discussing policy implications

from water quality violations.

       Our estimates indicate that, in 2005, people spent $11.34 million in response to

microorganism violations, $1.77 million in response to nitrate violations, and $47.15 million in

response to element/chemical violations. These estimates likely represents a lower bound of the

true costs of avoidance behavior because it does not include other responses to violations, such

as purchasing alternative beverages (e.g. juice), other actions people may have taken (e.g. boiling

water), and more permanent responses (e.g. installing water filters).

IV. Discussion

       This paper builds upon a nascent literature that examines the impacts of informational

approaches to environmental regulation (Mansfield et al., 2006; Shimshack, Ward, and Beatty

2007; Neidell, 2009) to examine responses to warnings about drinking water violations. Unlike

Shimshack, Ward, and Beatty (2007), who find a broad response to mercury warnings regardless

of vulnerability, our work provides some evidence for a differentiated response across

consumers. Neidell’s (2009) examination of responses to smog alerts finds some evidence of a

differentiated response based on vulnerabilities, but like Shimshack, Ward, and Beatty (2007)

does not assess the costs of avoidance behavior. Mansfield, Johnson, and van Houtven (2006)

rely on stated preference methods to provide estimates of the costs of avoidance behavior for

                                                                                                   9
children in response to high ozone-pollution days.7 Our work combines features of each of

these, but adds a considerable innovation by using market-based responses to information to

provide estimates of avoidance costs. Moreover, unlike many other forms of pollution, drinking

water quality violations are quite common. As a result, our estimates are quite large – US

consumers paid nearly $60 million in response to water violations in 2005 alone.

         Even if bottled water purchases captured most of the behavioral response to violations,

this figure clearly understates the willingness to pay to avoid water violations because it ignores

the health consequences faced by those who did not limit their exposure (Harrington and

Portney, 1987).8 Since nearly 20 million Americans become ill from consuming drinking water

contaminated with parasites, bacteria, or viruses each year (Reynolds, Mena, and Gerba, 2008), a

complete measure of willingness to pay would be considerably larger. Of course, the value of

avoiding violations must be compared to the costs of eliminating them.9 Assessing the costs of

violations reductions and how they vary across water systems is an important direction for future

research.
