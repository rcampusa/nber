                                             ABSTRACT

This paper presents a new approach to the measurement of the effects of spatial mismatch that takes
advantage of matched employer-employee administrative data integrated with a person-specific job
accessibility measure, as well as demographic and neighborhood characteristics. The basic hypothesis
is that if spatial mismatch is present, then improved accessibility to appropriate jobs should shorten
the duration of unemployment. We focus on lower-income workers with strong labor force attachment
searching for employment after being subject to a mass layoff – thereby focusing on a group of job
searchers that are plausibly searching for exogenous reasons. We construct person-specific measures
of job accessibility based upon an empirical model of transport modal choice and network travel-time
data, giving variation both across neighborhoods in nine metropolitan areas, as well as across neighbors.
Our results support the spatial mismatch hypothesis. We find that better job accessibility significantly
decreases the duration of joblessness among lower-paid displaced workers. Blacks, females, and older
workers are more sensitive to job accessibility than other subpopulations.

                    Job Displacement and the Duration of Joblessness:
                              The Role of Spatial Mismatch

                                       I.      Introduction
       The spatial mismatch hypothesis (SMH) encompasses a wide range of research questions,
all focused on whether a worker with locally inferior access to jobs is likely to have worse labor
market outcomes. The literature grew out of two papers by Kain (1964, 1968), which proposed
that persistent unemployment in urban black communities might be due to a movement of jobs
away from those areas, coupled with the inability (due to housing discrimination) for those
residents to relocate closer to jobs. One corollary of this hypothesis is that improving spatial
access to jobs would lead to better outcomes. In addition to broad national policies aimed at
reducing housing discrimination, this logic has inspired urban planning policies aiming to (1)
move jobs closer to neighborhoods with high unemployment, as is intended with Employment
Zones (Neumark and Kolko 2010); (2) enhance transportation links between high unemployment
neighborhoods and locations with an abundance of jobs, as is done with transit expansions
(Holzer et al. 2003); and (3) relocate residents of high unemployment neighborhoods to job-
abundant neighborhoods, as might occur with a housing voucher program (Katz et al. 2001).
       Despite these well-intentioned policies, continued urban concentrations of lower-income
and minority populations continue to have higher than average unemployment rates. Study of the
SMH thus remains highly relevant while there nonetheless remains uncertainty about its relative
importance. Glaeser (1996) and others have pointed out that cross-section models omit
unobserved person characteristics that may be correlated with neighborhood location as well as
employment outcomes. This phenomenon may bias impact estimates of job accessibility that rely
on neighborhood-specific effects, though the degree to which it biases cross-section outcomes is
open to question.
       This paper presents a new approach to the measurement of the effects of spatial
mismatch. We address several outstanding issues in the literature, with an emphasis on
identification strategies that mitigate the impact of (endogenous) residential self-selection.
Central to our approach to spatial mismatch is the ability to combine data sources to produce
improved, person- and location-specific measures of job accessibility.



                                                                                                     2
        Our results support the spatial mismatch hypothesis. We find that better job accessibility
significantly decreases the duration of joblessness among lower-paid displaced workers. This
result is strongest for non-Hispanic blacks, females, and older workers.
        The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews the spatial
mismatch literature with a focus on identification issues. Section III presents our model and
identification strategy. Section IV describes the data, accessibility measures, and sample
construction. Section V presents our main estimation results along with the economic
significance of our findings and Section VI provides our conclusions.


                                     II.     Related Literature
        “Spatial mismatch” was first described as a breakdown of the standard urban land use
model. Observing 1950s data, Kain (1964, 1968) found that the location of jobs for blacks was a
poor predictor of their residences. Kain’s argument was that racial discrimination in the suburban
housing market prevented central city blacks from moving to suburbs, where jobs were moving
to, driving up their unemployment rate (and also their rents). Thus, at the core of the SMH is job
accessibility, that is, distant jobs are more difficult to obtain due to high costs of search and
commuting (see, e.g., Brueckner and Zenou 2003).
        Kain’s work has spawned a huge subsequent empirical literature, almost exclusively
focused on cross-section analysis, and most recently summarized by Kain (1992, 2004),
Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist (1998), and Gobillon et al. (2007). Although the synthesis articles have
been critical of some work, there is nevertheless considerable evidence that poor job accessibility
is partially responsible for poor labor market outcomes for inner-city low-skilled ethnic
minorities. However, there is considerable disagreement about the magnitude of the spatial
mismatch effect and about which groups of workers are most affected by it (Ihlanfeldt 2006).
Arguably, much of the disagreement stems from limitations of the underlying data, which we can
better address in this paper due to detailed and comprehensive location-specific longitudinal
data.
        A central problem for spatial mismatch research, highlighted by Ihlanfelt (1993) and
Glaeser (1996), among others, is the endogeneity of employment outcomes and residential
location. One approach to mitigate these problems is focusing on youth who live with their
parents (see Raphael 1998; O’Regan and Quigley 1996a, 1996b). However, if parents and

                                                                                                    3
children share the same unobserved heterogeneity, then this approach mitigates but does not
solve the problem. In a related manner, measures of job accessibility that vary only by
neighborhood will tend to correlate with other neighborhood characteristics that may also be
relevant for labor market outcomes. Yet another problem highlighted by Ihlanfeldt and Sjoquist
(1998) is that job accessibility measures should control for the number of competing searchers.
        Our new approach departs from the existing work that focuses on cross-sectional
variation by using longitudinal data on workers who have experienced an involuntary job
displacement. We argue that finding a job after a spell of involuntary unemployment is
exogenous to the previous residential location decision. That is, the mass layoff event per se is
the impetus for the job search, rather than local job opportunities. There is a substantial literature
in labor economics studying the impact of job displacement following the seminal paper of
Jacobson et al. (1993). Using matched employer-employee data for the state of Pennsylvania,
Jacobson et al. showed that workers separating from a sharply contracting employer experience a
substantial and persistent loss in earnings. A closely related literature has shown that separations
from a sharply contracting business are more likely to be associated with a layoff (an involuntary
separation) as opposed to a quit (see Davis et al. 2012 for a summary of this literature).
        We are not the first to explore the role of spatial mismatch on job search duration. Studies
by Rogers (1997), Dawkins et al. (2005), Johnson (2006), and Gobillon et al. (2011) look at
search duration in this context and find that greater job accessibility reduces search duration.
Relative to this existing literature we make several contributions. In particular, this is the first
paper in this area to focus on workers displaced from a mass layoff, which is a critical aspect of
our identification strategy since it almost guarantees that these individuals have strong labor
force attachment and that residential location remains exogenous to the short-run re-employment
problem these workers face. Second, previous studies are based on relatively small samples of
workers without the information we exploit on job history and without the ability to control for
employer fixed effects. Third, most previous studies are for a single urban area or a small set of
cities, and often do not include suburban areas, while our study casts a much wider geographic
net.
        Our research is also intended to address important issues raised by Houston (2005) and
others (e.g., Perle et al. 2002) about the proper measurement of job accessibility in testing the
SMH. Researchers have emphasized the importance of using commute times instead of distance

                                                                                                       4
in measuring accessibility, accounting for local job competition, disaggregating job counts into
those most relevant for a searcher, and including locational characteristics.1 Raphael and Stoll
(2001) emphasize the importance of auto ownership. They find that having access to a car is
particularly important for blacks and Latinos. Several other studies also emphasize the
importance of vehicle ownership on finding employment, including Baum (2009), Ong and
Miller (2005), Johnson (2006), and Korsu and Wenglenski (2010). They all find that vehicle
ownership improves job accessibility. Our analysis incorporates both automobile and public
transit transportation modes.


                             III.     Methodology and Empirical Strategy
        We test for spatial mismatch by employing an empirical specification that relates duration
of joblessness to an index of job accessibility and other control variables. In this section we
demonstrate how our specification can be derived from a simple job search theoretic framework.
We also discuss how we address various econometric issues that can otherwise invalidate
inference.
        A. Theoretical Motivation
        Following closely the theoretical exposition in Rogerson et al. (2005), consider an
individual searching for a job in continuous time. This individual seeks to maximize the expected
             ∞
value of [∫𝑡=0 𝑦𝑡 𝑒 −𝑟𝑡 ], where 𝑟 𝜖 (0,1) is the discount factor, and 𝑦𝑡 is the income at 𝑡. Income is
𝑦 = 𝑤 − 𝑐 if employed with wages 𝑤 and commute costs 𝑐, and 𝑦 = 𝑏, if unemployed. To
introduce a spatial dimension, we depart slightly from the standard job search model that
assumes that job offers are heterogeneous with respect to wages. Instead, we assume
heterogeneity in terms of the location of the prospective employer and that the value of a given
job offer depends on the associated commute costs.
        An unemployed individual receives independently and identically distributed job offers at
a Poisson arrival rate of 𝑎 from a known distribution 𝐹(𝑐). If the offer is rejected he remains
unemployed. If accepted, he remains employed forever.2 Hence, we have the Bellman equations
(Bellman 1957):

1
  Other literature reviews of accessibility measures are Handy and Niemeier (1997), Bhat et al. (2000), El-Geneidy
and Levinson (2006), and Bunel et al. (2013).
2
  Although the empirical implications would be largely unchanged, the model can easily be extended to incorporate
job separations (see Rogerson et al. 2005).

                                                                                                                     5
(1)                                      𝑟𝑉(𝑐) = 𝑤 − 𝑐
                                              ∞
(2)                           𝑟𝑈 = 𝑏 + 𝑎 ∫0 𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑈, 𝑉(𝑐)}𝑑𝐹(𝑐)
where 𝑉(𝑐) is the payoff from accepting a job with a commute costs of 𝑐 and 𝑈 is the payoff
from rejecting a job offer. Since 𝑉(𝑐) = (𝑤 − 𝑐)/𝑟 is strictly decreasing, there is a unique value
of 𝑐 = 𝑅, such that 𝑉(𝑐) = 𝑈, with the property that the worker should reject the job offer if 𝑐 >
𝑅 and accept if 𝑐 ≤ 𝑅. Substituting 𝑈 = (𝑤 − 𝑅)/𝑟 and 𝑉(𝑐) = (𝑤 − 𝑐)/𝑟 in the expression for
𝑈 we obtain
                                     𝑎    ∞
(3)                    𝑤 − 𝑅 = 𝑏 + 𝑟 ∫0 𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑤 − 𝑐, 𝑤 − 𝑅}𝑑𝐹(𝑐).

Using integration by parts and simplifying gives the following expression for the reservation
commute costs
                                              𝑎   𝑅
(4)                           𝑅 = 𝑤 − 𝑏 − 𝑟 ∫0 𝐹(𝑐)𝑑𝑐.

Equation (4) demonstrates that the reservation commute costs, i.e., the level of commute costs
associated with a job offer at which the unemployed worker is indifferent between accepting and
rejecting the offer, are increasing in the wage level, decreasing in unemployment benefits, and
decreasing in the option value of continued search.
       The probability that worker has not found a job after a spell of length 𝑡 is 𝑒 −𝐻𝑡 , where the
hazard rate 𝐻 = 𝑎𝐹(𝑅) equals the product of the job offer arrival rate and the probability of
accepting a job. The expected duration of unemployment, 𝐸(𝐷), is given by
                                          ∞               1
(5)                           𝐸(𝐷) = ∫0 𝑡𝐻𝑒 −𝐻𝑡 𝑑𝑡 = 𝐻 .

       B. Empirical Specification
       By the law of total probability, the total hazard rate of individual 𝑖 residing in location 𝑗
𝐻𝑖𝑗 = ∑𝐾
       𝑘=1 𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 equals the sum across the 𝐾 destination-specific hazard rates. Consistent with

how the destination-specific hazard 𝐻𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 𝑎𝑘 𝐹(𝑅𝑖𝑗𝑘 ) is defined, we assume that the arrival rate
is proportional to some measure of employment opportunities, 𝐸𝑘 , at each destination, with 𝑎𝑘 =
𝛾 𝐸𝑘 . (As shown in the next section, our measure of job accessibility is individualized and
normalized with respect to competing searchers.) We parameterize the acceptance probability as
𝐹(𝑅𝑖𝑗𝑘 ) = 𝑒 −𝜃𝑑𝑗𝑘 −𝒙𝑖 𝜷 where 𝑑𝑗𝑘 is the commute time (a cost measure) between the origination
and destination tract, 𝜃 captures the associated commute costs, 𝑥𝑖 is a vector of individual-




                                                                                                       6
specific variables affecting the reservation commute cost (also discussed in the next section) and
𝛽 is the associated vector of parameters.
         This specification captures the potential for spatial mismatch since the destination-
specific hazard incorporates location-specific (and person-specific) heterogeneity in the
accessibility of jobs. We have discussed the formal model in terms of heterogeneity across
locations arising from heterogeneity in commuting times. It may be that there are also spatial
frictions in the probability of obtaining a job offer. That is, it may be that both the job offer
arrival rate a and the commute costs depend on the time to commute to the job’s location. But we
note that this distinction is only important for how to interpret the commute cost parameter in the
empirical model we estimate below; to the extent that both types of frictions are relevant our
specification captures both effects.3
         Under these assumptions the total hazard of individual 𝑖 residing in location 𝑗 is given by
                                                              −𝜃𝑑𝑗𝑘
(6)                                 𝐻𝑖𝑗 = 𝑒 −𝒙𝑖 𝜷 𝛾[∑𝐾
                                                     𝑘=1 𝐸𝑘 𝑒       ].
We insert equation (6) into the expression in equation (5) for the expected duration of
unemployment, take the natural logarithm of both sides, and append a residual ε assumed to be
distributed 𝑁(0, 𝜎𝜀 ). The resulting regression specification,
                                                            −𝜃𝑑𝑗𝑘
(7)                        ln(𝐷𝑖𝑗 ) = 𝑥𝑖 𝛽 − ln[𝛾 ∑𝐾
                                                   𝑘=1 𝐸𝑘 𝑒       ] + 𝜀𝑖𝑗 ,
relates duration of joblessness to a gravity index measure of job accessibility (relative job
opportunities) within square brackets and individual-specific factors that impact the reservation
commute costs. Equation (7) serves as the foundation for our empirical analysis.
         Following the previous literature, we assume a specific functional form of the gravity
index (discussed in the next section). As a result, the model in equation (7) is linear in the
measure for relative job opportunities. In principle, we could treat 𝜃 as a parameter to estimate
and apply non-linear least squares, but the feasibility of such an approach is hampered by the
dimensionality of the gravity index of job accessibility.4 However, for robustness we check that
results are qualitatively similar using alternative specifications of this index.



3
  Since we have no data on job offers, only whether a job is accepted or not, we have no ability to separately identify
spatial frictions in the form of job offers and commute costs.
4
  That is, the estimation of parameters would, based on the updated parameter values in each iteration, require the
calculation of the gravity index across the 𝐾destinations. A more feasible approach would be to reduce the
dimensionality of the problem by defining a limited number of concentric rings based on commute times for each
observation.

                                                                                                                      7
            A feature of our data is censoring of the dependent variable. In particular, the actual
duration of joblessness (measured in quarters) is only observed if the displaced worker has found
a job within 2 years, or 9 quarters of joblessness (including the quarter of job separation). A
significant fraction (over 20 percent) of the displaced workers in our sample have no reported
                                                                                                  ̂-
earnings within these first 2 years after separation. Thus, the observed duration of joblessness, 𝐷
𝑖𝑗 ,   is related to the latent joblessness according to
                                      ln(𝐷𝑖𝑗 )   if 𝐷𝑖𝑗 ≤ 8
(8)                        ̂ 𝑖𝑗 = {
                           𝐷                                .
                                       ln(9)     if 𝐷𝑖𝑗 > 8
The regression model in equation (7) with a fixed transportation cost parameter and censoring of
the dependent variable governed by the process in equation (4) defines a Tobit model. In
comparison, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates can be expected to be attenuated towards
zero (Green 1980). To account for the impact of censoring we estimate the parameters of the
model by maximum likelihood. We account for upper censoring of search duration by censoring
the Tobit at >8 quarters – as far as we follow the workers. We also account for clustering of same
quarter new jobs, with a duration of zero, by imposing a lower censoring limit.5
            A key econometric challenge for research on spatial mismatch is that local job
accessibility also affects the geographical distribution and sorting of populations of job seekers.
In cross-sectional data, this type of reverse causality translates into a positive correlation between
local job accessibility and labor market outcomes and makes it very difficult to disentangle the
exogenous impact of local job accessibility in the job search process. In contrast, we identify the
effect of local job accessibility in the job search process by explicitly attempting to restrict the
population of job searchers to those who did not become job searchers because of the locally
available job opportunities. As discussed above, we identify workers who separated from their
previous employer during a mass layoff event. Estimates of the impact of local job accessibility
on job search-related outcomes for displaced workers should be less subject to reverse causality
induced by local job opportunities also affecting the local pool of job seekers. We follow the
displacement literature by focusing on workers with strong labor force attachment (at least 4
quarters of tenure with the firm before displacement) who experience a displacement. Focusing

 Because we use quarterly earnings data to measure duration, we assume that a job is obtained midway through a
quarter; in practice, we add 0.5 quarters to duration before taking logs.

                                                                                                                 8
on workers with strong labor force attachment subject to a mass layoff thus yields a group of at-
risk searchers who are plausibly searching for exogenous reasons.
        As will become clear below, we also control for a host of other factors. That is, we
control for demographic, household, employment history, and neighborhood characteristics, for
quarter of separation, and for metropolitan area-by-year effects for the metropolitan area of
residence and quarter of separation.6 In our most stringent specification, we also control for
employer fixed effects.

                 IV.      Data and the Measurement of Job Accessibility
        In this section, we describe the data sets used in this project, the measurement of job
accessibility, and the construction of an estimation sample of job seekers. We also present
summary statistics and compare job accessibility within and across populations.
        A. Data sources
        The technical advances in this study are made possible by the richness of the
Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure files. The LEHD program
at the Census Bureau constructs the infrastructure files from integrated administrative and survey
data and releases public use data products (see Abowd et al. 2009).7 The data frame provides
virtually universal coverage of workers covered by unemployment insurance. In recent reporting
periods, the LEHD data infrastructure tracks on a quarterly basis more than 140 million jobs held
by over 120 million unique workers at more than 6 million employers. The LEHD infrastructure
files provide precise address information for most employers and workers, which have been
geocoded to Census geographic units. We use the place of residence information to assign
measures of job accessibility to workers at the time of a job loss, which we observe as the
termination of earnings to a worker from an employer. Lastly, we identify if and when a
separated worker obtains a new job.


6
  We include metropolitan area by year fixed effects in our specification, but cannot report them because of
agreements with the states which supplied the employee data.
7
  At the core of the LEHD dataset are two administrative records files provided by state partners to the Census
Bureau on a quarterly basis: (1) unemployment insurance wage records, giving the earnings of each worker at each
employer, and (2) employer reports giving establishment-level data, known as the Quarterly Census of Employment
and Wages (QCEW). Public use datasets derived from the LEHD include the Quarterly Workforce Indicators and
the LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES), available through the web application OnTheMap.
The microdata in the LEHD data infrastructure are confidential and protected by U.S.C. Titles 13 and 26. External
researchers may access the LEHD dataset for approved statistical purposes at one of the Census Bureau’s Research
Data Centers. See <http://www.census.gov/ces> for information on the application process.

                                                                                                                9
        In addition to extracting the sample of job seekers from the LEHD infrastructure files, we
use the LEHD data to measure the spatial distribution of employment and competing workers.
From the infrastructure files, we aggregate LEHD jobs data to workplace and residence census
tracts.8 We limit the extract to primary, or highest earning, jobs of a worker, and to private sector
jobs only. In order to make the jobs data most relevant to the sample of lower-earning job
searchers, we only consider jobs with annualized earnings of less than $40,000.
        This study uses morning, peak-period travel time to provide a better approximation than
straight-line distance of the cost of traveling to a job opportunity from a place of residence.
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) estimate both automobile and public transit travel
times between all points in an urban area in order to assess transportation needs, and they have
provided their estimates to us for research purposes. Their modeling incorporates traffic
congestion, so the data approximates “rush hour” conditions where commutes may be slower.
(See Appendix A for more detail on the travel time data.9)
        Lastly, we incorporate several neighborhood characteristics available from tabulated data
from the 2000 Census. In particular, we use (long form sample-based) census tract measures of
poverty, home ownership, population density, building vintage, and use of public transit. We
include these variables in estimation models to control for neighborhood characteristics other
than relative job accessibility that may also be related to employment outcomes.
        B. Sample Construction
        We construct a sample of lower-income job seekers who resided in nine large “Great
Lakes” metropolitan areas. The metropolitan areas we use are those that include the following
cities (listed from west to east): Minneapolis-St. Paul MN, Milwaukee WI, Chicago IL,
Indianapolis IN, Detroit MI, Columbus OH, Cleveland OH, Pittsburgh PA, and Buffalo NY.10 A
major undertaking was to obtain and integrate the MPO data for all of these metro areas into our

8
  Our aggregation has a similar structure and degree of geographic detail as the LODES data.
9
  To evaluate the quality of this data, we compared the MPO data with morning travel times reported in the 2000
Decennial Census “long form,” made available as public tabulations in the Census Transportation Planning Package
(see Table A1). We find that for the set of commute routes available in the CTPP data, automobile travel times are
very similar between the two sources. Transit travel times provided by MPOs are somewhat longer than for
comparable commutes reported in the CTPP. A crucial advantage of the MPO data over the CTPP is that the MPOs
provide a complete matrix of commute times, rather than just those that are actually travelled by the 1-in-6 sample
of households responding to the long form. For calculating proximity to potential jobs, we need to know all
commute times even if those trips are unlikely.
10
   The sets of counties do not correspond exactly with Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs). For
example, the Chicago-Naperville-Joliet CMSA includes counties in Illinois, as well as Wisconsin and Indiana. We
only use counties with MPO travel time data, which are all in the same state as the principal city.

                                                                                                                 10
data infrastructure. An advantage of restricting our attention to these areas is that they are in the
same broad region of the U.S. (the Great Lakes) and as such are broadly comparable in many
ways. All nine metropolitan areas have over one million inhabitants and have a broadly similar
spatial configuration of commercial, industrial, and housing location and vintage. They generally
also have clearly discernible central business districts along with substantial suburbanization
over the past 60 years. Although the amount of public transit varies, it usually consists of bus
and/or light rail, and some have heavy rail (e.g., subways). Since early studies and later work on
spatial mismatch focused on cities in this region, using a similar set of cities will facilitate
comparisons to earlier findings. We focus on job searches originating from separations.
        Table 1 presents the restrictions used to arrive at our estimation sample, with rounded
sample sizes. We start by extracting a set of almost 10 million workers employed in the states
including our metropolitan areas, and who separated between 2000 and 2005.11 In the LEHD
Employment History File, jobs are identified as an earnings spell for a unique person identifier
from an employer, known by its State Employer Identification Number (SEIN). We identify a
job separation as a termination of earnings where the worker does not resume earning at that
employer for at least 2 full years (and, for cases of multiple simultaneous separations, we retain
only the highest earning separation record). We require that a worker have at least 4 quarters of
tenure prior to the separation to demonstrate attachment both to that employer and to a
residential location that may have been set in relation to the job.
        We determine residency within the nine metropolitan areas by linking worker records to
the Composite Person Record (CPR), an annual database produced from federal administrative
data at the Census Bureau providing residential locations for individuals, which can be linked to
LEHD workers using personal identifying information. Because job loss could occur at any point
in a year, and we do not know to which month the CPR address refers, we use place of residence
in the year prior to job loss. Thus, the place of residence of the workers in our sample is not
conditional on job separation, avoiding any concern that a worker relocated as a result of the
separation. Because this study requires neighborhood-level measures of job accessibility, we
only retain workers with a place of residence precise to the census tract level and drop a further
11.6 percent of jobs.


11
  Our data are reasonably contemporaneous. Beyond the earnings records, we use demographic and neighborhood
information from the 2000 Decennial Census and MPO travel times from the 2000s.

                                                                                                          11
        We link the sample of separated workers to the “Hundred Percent Edited Detail File”
(HEDF), which provides short form responses to the 2000 Decennial Census. We are able to link
over 85 percent of the remaining separated workers sample to the HEDF, which provides
demographic and household information. We then limit the worker sample to those aged 20 to 64
at the time of job loss.
        We apply further restrictions to establish labor market attachment. We calculate LEHD
earnings of the worker over the previous year (from all jobs), and only retain workers with total
earnings between $15,000 and $40,000, about 35 percent of the job loss sample. The lower limit
requires that the worker is working in at least a full-time, minimum wage job. The upper bound
focuses the analysis on lower-earning workers, who have been the principal focus of spatial
mismatch research and who are likely to be more sensitive to local differences in job
accessibility than higher earning workers.12 We also require that the lost job accounted for at
least half of previous year total earnings, and that the job can be linked to the LEHD Employer
Characteristics File, which provides industry, size, and location information for the employer
SEIN.
        Lastly, we retain only jobs that can be defined as resulting from a “mass layoff event.”
We use employer-reported workforce size from the Employer Characteristics File to identify
employers that lost over 30 percent of their workforce over a year, with at least 25 workers at the
start of the year. Almost two-thirds of separations occur during such an episode. However, some
of these declines could be specious. A restructuring business might retain its employees but
report the earnings using a new SEIN. Using rules employed in processing of the LEHD
infrastructure files for identifying restructuring, we rule out 59.6 percent of the separations.13 The
remainder we classify as separations due to a mass layoff event. Note that the sample of job
separators also excludes any worker who returns to the same employer within 2 years, such as
through a recall, which underscores the involuntary nature of the displacement. While the
resulting sample of approximately 247,000 job seekers formerly at medium-sized and large firms
is much reduced from the original set of separators, we consider these sample reductions as



12
   According to Raven et al. (2011) workers with a college education have almost double the interstate migration
rate as those with high school or less education. High earning workers also migrate marginally more.
13
   The LEHD program compiles a Successor-Predecessor File to document transitions across SEINs for a set of
workers (Benedetto et al. 2007).

                                                                                                                   12
necessary to meet the identification standards to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of job
accessibility on unemployment duration.
         C. Job Opportunities, Competing Searchers, and Job Accessibility
         We measure each job seeker’s job accessibility at the time of his or her separation using a
proximity-weighted index of nearby job opportunities and competing searchers for those jobs.
Worker i, residing in tract j, in year t, may commute by mode m (automobile or transit) to any
tract k in metro area M, indexed from 1 to KM. We define effective job opportunities, 𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚 , as
the sum of jobs in all tracts discounted by an impedance function based on a mode’s travel time
to each tract. We use a composite job opportunities measure weighted by the probability of a job
seeker using automobile or transit to reach each tract, calculated as:
                               𝐾𝑀                                                      𝐾𝑀
                                                               𝐸𝑘𝑡
(9)                𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚̂ = ∑ ∑ 𝑝̂ 𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑚                                           = ∑ 𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑘𝑚̂
                               𝑘=1 𝑚            exp (𝜃 ∙ max(0, 𝑑𝑗𝑘𝑚 − 𝜏))            𝑘=1

        ̂ signifies the use of predicted commute mode. The predicted probability of worker i
where m=𝑚
using either mode, m, to reach tract k is 𝑝̂ 𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑚 , with ∑𝑚 𝑝̂𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑚 = 1. In a case where only
automobile travel is an option, job opportunities would simply reduce to a function of auto travel
time, which would be written 𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡(auto) . We describe the mode choice model in subsection D.
         We consider total employment in each census tract, Ek, to be a proxy for the number of
job offers available at that location in year t. As is discussed above, we use the count of LEHD
primary jobs on April 1 of each year as our measure of total employment.14 We use an
impedance function in the denominator of (9) to discount employment more as travel time (d)
from i’s home increases. For this analysis, we use a discounting formula that imposes no
discount for the first 10 minutes of travel. Thus for these short commutes, where djkm ≤ τ, the
denominator of equation (9) equals one and there is no discount. For commutes beyond the travel
time threshold, we use an exponential function of the product of a factor 𝜃 and the surplus travel




14
  Examining the Quarterly Workforce Indicators at the county level, we find that the quantity of new hires has a
correlation of 0.986 with the stock of beginning-of-quarter jobs. It is reasonable to think about using net job creation
to measure job opportunities. However, net job creation only has a correlation of 0.535 with new hires. Shen (2000)
also finds that the great majority of job openings occur in locations with an abundance of jobs. Furthermore,
competing job seekers is more comparable to job opportunities when the latter is measured as all jobs rather than
new hires, since we do not know how many currently employed individuals are true job seekers.

                                                                                                                     13
time. For the principal analysis, we follow several recent implementations and set 𝜃 = 0.1.15 To
illustrate this functional form, consider 100 jobs located in tract j=k (zero distance), 100 in a tract
where djkm =10 minutes, and another 100 where djkm =20 minutes. While the first two tracts
would each contribute 100 jobs to the job opportunity index, the third would only contribute the
equivalent of 36.7 jobs, reflecting the increased cost of commuting there. The impedance
function has no monetary component, and only considers travel time costs.
         We chose this functional form for several reasons. First, compared to other weighting
                                               2
schemes, such as an often-used denominator of 𝑑𝑗𝑘𝑚 , the exponential discounting approach
described above is more gradual.16 Second, a technical advantage of using the threshold, τ, is that
it does not depend on the precision of travel time estimates for very short commutes, which may
be more dependent on modeling assumptions of vehicle access time or within-census tract
location. Third, there are precedents in both the empirical and theoretical literature for not
discounting jobs in one’s immediate vicinity. In the empirical literature, no discounting is often a
simplifying assumption and accompanied by complete discounting for jobs beyond that area,
such as jobs outside of a jurisdiction (for example Hellerstein et al. 2008). In a theoretical
analysis of urban spatial job search, Zenou (2009) assumes that search effort does not dissipate at
all until after a certain distance from a business district.17
         While the presence of nearby job opportunities may improve job search, the presence of
nearby competing searchers for those same jobs may hinder a searcher.18 To present a more
complete picture of the tightness of a local labor market, we also calculate a measure of
competing searchers, defined as:
                                                             𝐿𝑀
                                  1       𝐾𝑀                           𝑊𝑙𝑡
(10)                𝐶𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚̂   =         ∑     [𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑘𝑚̂ ∑                                                 ]
                                𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚̂   𝑘=1             exp (𝜃 ∙ max(0, 𝑑                       − 𝜏))
                                                             𝑙=1                       𝑙𝑘(auto)



15
   El-Geneidy and Levinson (2006) compute this same parameter for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area as 0.1 and Shen
(2000) computes this as “approximately 0.1” for the Boston area. Yang and Ferreira (2005) assume this parameter to
be 0.1 for their model of Boston.
16
   For example, 100 jobs in a tract 20 minutes away would be discounted to the equivalent of only 1.0 job with a 10-
minute threshold, and 0.3 jobs with no threshold. Given that most commutes are within a range of 20 to 40 minutes,
such steep discounting may be unreasonably punitive.
17
   The travel time literature also finds that commuters’ value of time is low in the initial stage of a trip but is
sensitive across intermediate distances (Johansson et al., 2003).
18
   Raphael (1998) explores the roles of information disadvantages and competing searchers. He controls for the
intervening opportunities and intervening labor supply for origin-destination pairs. This decreases the negative effect
of distance on the labor flow between zones by almost 90 percent. Johnson (2006) uses competing searchers to scale
a job accessibility measure.

                                                                                                                    14
where Wlt gives the count of workers residing in tract l who can arrive at jobs in census tract k in
dlkm minutes. Having little information on the characteristics of competing searchers, we assume
they all commute by automobile. As with employment above, equation (10) uses the count of
LEHD workers by place of residence as a proxy for the count of potential job seekers. For these
seekers, we use the same discounting formula as in equation (9). To approximate the expected
number of competing searchers per job offer, we weight effective competing searchers for each
tract by the share of a searcher's effective job opportunities located in that tract. Thus, competing
searchers will have a larger weight if they are close to a large mass of jobs, or job opportunities
that are nearby a searcher. As a result of the weighting, the count of effective competing
searchers is of comparable magnitude to the count of effective job opportunities.19
         To reflect the relative magnitudes of both of these sums for a given job seeker, we
normalize job opportunities with competing searchers. In equation (7), the sum of employment
was multiplied by a proportionality constant, 𝛾. We extract competing searchers from this
constant and use it as a normalizing factor, so that the variable of interest becomes the log
                                                                                    𝐽𝑂   ̂
number of effective job opportunities per competing searcher, or ln (𝐶𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚 ). The log of the ratio
                                                                                         ̂
                                                                                      𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚

is consistent with the empirical setup and has the advantage of providing symmetric
differences.20 However, we modify the specification slightly by replacing the natural logarithm
of the gravity index with a symmetric change measure, defined as:
                                                          (𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚
                                                                ̂ − 𝐶𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚
                                                                         ̂)
(11)                                         𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚̂ = 1⁄                      .
                                                          2∙(𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚        ̂)
                                                                  ̂ + 𝐶𝑆𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚

The chief advantage of this job accessibility measure is that it is bounded by -2 and 2, and less
sensitive to extreme values.21 Another advantage of this measure is that it is scale invariant, so
differences in labor market tightness can be measured on the same scale for both large and small



19
   In a boundless metropolitan area with a uniform density of jobs and workers, or a city where all tracts are within
the discounting threshold from one another, each worker will have an equal number of job opportunities and
competing searchers.
20
   For more on the advantage and use of log differences, see Törnqvist et al. (1985).
21
   Davis et al. (1996) use the symmetric growth rate measure to study job creation and destruction, where firm births
and deaths play an important role in overall changes. The ratio is bounded in the closed interval of -2 (when there
are no job opportunities) to 2 (when there are no competing searchers). For ratios of job opportunities to competing
searchers close to 1, the symmetric growth rate is very close to the log of the ratio. The two measures can be related
through a first-order Taylor series approximation of the natural logarithm of the ratio of job opportunities over
                               𝐽𝑂           𝐽𝑂−𝐶𝑆           (𝐽𝑂−𝐶𝑆)

metropolitan areas. Substituting the job accessibility ratio from (11) into the regression
specification in (7), we obtain the estimation model,
(12)                                ̂𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑚̂ + 𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝛽 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 .
                                    𝐷
where 𝛼 is the parameter of interest. In practice, we only retain the first or only observation of
job search for each displaced worker, so there is a direct mapping between i, j, and t.
         D. Mode choice prediction
         A unique feature of our approach is that we construct person-specific job accessibility
measures taking into account not only the heterogeneity across locations but also person-specific
differences in mode choice, 𝑝̂𝑖𝑗𝑘𝑚 . A detailed description of the estimation of the predicted mode
choice probabilities is in Appendix B but we provide a brief description here. We estimate
logistic models for vehicle ownership and mode choice using journey-to-work responses from
the 2000 Decennial Census long form combined with the MPO travel time data, by mode, and
LEHD earnings records. We then use the parameter estimates to make out-of-sample predictions
of vehicle ownership and mode choice probabilities for each possible commute destination for
each person in the displaced worker sample. Because automobile travel is faster on most routes,
that is, 𝑑𝑗𝑘(auto) < 𝑑𝑗𝑘(transit) , it is usually true that a car driver can reach more jobs in the same
time (though at greater cost), making 𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑘(auto) > 𝐽𝑂𝑖𝑗𝑡𝑘(transit). Thus, a worker with a higher
probability of vehicle ownership and automobile use will tend to have more effective job
opportunities in a given destination, and greater job accessibility overall.22
         Estimation results from the vehicle ownership and mode choice model are intuitive (See
Appendix Table B3). For the vehicle ownership model, we find that larger and higher-earning
households, and households in neighborhoods with poor quality transit are more likely to have
vehicles; blacks and households in densely populated areas are less likely to own. For the mode
choice model, we find that lower income workers are more likely to use public transit on a route,
even if there is poor transit access on the route, while higher income workers tend to use transit
only if it is competitive with automobile travel times.


22
  Raphael and Stoll (2001) approach spatial mismatch by asking if increasing minority automobile ownership rates
can narrow inter-racial employment gaps. Making a comparison across metropolitan areas, they find that having
access to a car is particularly important for blacks and Latinos, and that the difference in employment rates between
car-owners and non-car-owners that is greater among blacks than among whites. Johnson (2006, p. 361) finds that
“access to a car while searching is estimated to increase the weekly hazard of successfully completing a job search
by 49.8%.”

                                                                                                                   16
        E. Summary Statistics
        For the estimation sample outlined in Table 1, we present summary statistics on relative
job accessibility and other characteristics. Table 2 provides the distribution of several job search
outcomes for the estimation sample. Among displaced workers, 32 percent find a new job in the
same quarter, and almost 80 percent do so within the subsequent 2 years.23 The next two
measures require that a single, new job account for a particular share of pre-displacement
earnings. Because we do not know when in a quarter a worker is hired, we allow this earnings
threshold to be passed either in the quarter of hire, or in the next quarter. Column two requires
new job earnings to be 75 percent of pre-displacement earnings, while column three requires 90
percent. Accessions to these higher earning jobs are less frequent and only 22 and 19 percent of
workers, respectively, obtain such jobs in the first quarter. Duration spells for these measures are
also more often censored, with only 65 and 60 percent obtaining such jobs within 2 years.
        As is assumed in equation (4), a worker will not accept a job offer for a wage that does
not surpass the reservation commute costs. In practice, a displaced worker could find it optimal
to accept a temporary job that does not satisfy the reservation commute cost, while continuing
the search for a permanent job. The second and third measures aim to capture accessions to a job
that may be acceptable in the longer run. We choose the 75 percent threshold to be
approximately in line with the typical experience of a displaced worker. Von Wachter et al.
(2009) found an average earnings loss of 20 percent in the first year compared to not-displaced
co-workers. We chose the 90 percent threshold to identify searchers finding a new job that is
approximately comparable to their pre-displacement job.
        Table 3 presents means for explanatory variables other than the job accessibility ratio.
The relatively large share of black workers reflects both the large numbers of blacks in the
metropolitan areas in the Great Lakes region and their greater likelihood of having lower
incomes. The sample is spatially distributed almost evenly across zones defined as: the central
city of each metropolitan area, the remainder of that county, and the surrounding counties. The
residence patterns by race are also representative of the Great Lakes region, with blacks
constituting over a third of the central city population but only 5.8 percent of the peripheral zone.
We identify 25 percent of workers as being married based on whether, in the year of

23
  The job search durations reported here are broadly in line with other analyses of displaced workers. For example,
Fallick et al. (2012) used LEHD data and found that 37 percent of distressed separators in 2001 found a job in the
same quarter, and over 80 percent within 1 year.

                                                                                                                 17
displacement, they were still residing with a spouse listed on the 2000 Decennial Census
response. We then attribute LEHD earnings to each spouse to construct household earnings
variables and to classify a person as a primary or secondary earner in the household. We group
workers by displacing employer industry into five broad categories.24 Almost 40 percent of
displacements are from goods-producing industries, and 28 percent of job losses occurred during
and following the 2001 recession. Displacements were evenly spaced throughout the year. Using
the travel time measures and establishment locations from the ECF, we produce indicators of
whether a previous job’s commute was <20, 20 to 40, or >40 minutes drive time, and find a
roughly even distribution across those ranges.25 From the LEHD data, we find that displaced
workers had, on average, well over a year of tenure, and lost a job with annual earnings of
approximately $27,000.26 Neighborhood variables from the 2000 Census show an average
poverty rate of 10.7 percent in their residence census tract, with 7.4 percent of neighbors using
transit.
           Figure 1 and Table 4 provide information on the distribution of the job accessibility
variable, using the measure based on predicted travel mode, per equation (11). The normalization
of job opportunities and competing searchers allows us to compare job accessibility levels across
a significant range of (large) metropolitan area sizes, even though the absolute count of jobs and
searchers may vary considerably depending on metropolitan area size. We include no controls,
but explore subsamples to highlight differences in job accessibility. Figure 1 presents the percent
distribution of displaced workers by bins of width 0.25 across the full range of -2 to 2. The
median job accessibility of 0.036 is greater than zero, but the overall distribution skews slightly
higher in the area below zero; that is, on average, competing searchers slightly exceed job
opportunities for jobs earning $15,000-$40,000.
           Table 4 provides information on how job accessibility varies by location and across
subsamples. There is considerable spatial variation in our measure of accessibility. The median is
0.339 for workers living in the central city, 0.098 for workers living in the central county (but not
the central city), and -0.285 for workers living outside the central county. This distribution is in
keeping with the spatial structure of large, older Great Lakes metropolitan areas. In most cases,

24
   Industries aggregated as follows: Goods-Producing and Distribution (North American Industrial Classification
System sectors 11,21,22,23,31-33,42,48,49), Local Services (44,45,56,71,72,81), Professional Services
(51,52,53,54,55), Education and Public (61,92), Health Care (62).
25
   The national average one-way travel time for U.S. workers was 25.5 minutes in 2000 (McKenzie 2013).
26
   Recall that we restricted the sample to workers earning between $15,000 and $40,000.

                                                                                                                  18
there is a great deal of employment in the central business district and adjoining areas even
though substantial suburbanization of jobs has occurred. In those cases, measures of job
accessibility can be seen as a set of concentric circles with accessibility declining as distance
from the central business district increases. While the exact shape of these circles will vary
according to highway and transit patterns, the general pattern will remain (for an example from a
large, older metropolitan area, see Fisher et al. 2009). Our job accessibility measure, of course,
also includes competing searchers. The number of competing searchers for central city lower-
income jobs exceeds the comparable number in suburban locations. However, as reflected in our
job accessibility index, job opportunities relative to competing searchers are higher in central
areas and lower in suburban areas.27
         Given the overall spatial pattern of job accessibility, it is not surprising that our
accessibility index varies across demographic groups due to differing residential location
patterns. While blacks have higher median job accessibility than white non-Hispanics and
Hispanics, this largely reflects their concentrated residence in neighborhoods that are typically
closer to a high-employment central business district; 71 percent of the blacks in our sample
reside in central cities, compared to 36 percent of the full sample. Put differently, while blacks
constitute 19 percent of the full sample, they make up 37 percent of the sample residing in the
central city of each metropolitan area (see Table 3).28 In fact, central city whites actually have
higher job accessibility (0.439) than blacks (0.333). This may reflect whites’ higher likelihood of
commuting by auto. Our use of predicted mode choice lowers the job accessibility measure for
blacks, who are much more likely to be users of public transportation due to their lower rates of
vehicle ownership.


                V.       Results for Unemployment Duration and Spatial Mismatch
         In this section, we empirically test whether the job search model that incorporates the
gravity index of local job accessibility explains the variation in the duration of joblessness
among displaced workers. If estimation of our model provides support for a causal negative link
27
   One concern might be that our sample of displaced workers is not representative. In results not presented here, we
also calculate the median job accessibility across all Census tracts, using the 2000 Census population and 2000
Census labor force for weights, and find little difference.
28
   The finding of higher job accessibility for blacks varies across studies, which vary widely in measures employed
and metropolitan areas considered. Hellerstein et al. (2008) finds higher overall job accessibility for blacks, but
lower accessibility to lower-education jobs. Note also that many downtown jobs require higher education levels that
are not compatible with the $40,000 earnings threshold imposed for this sample.

                                                                                                                   19
between job accessibility and duration of joblessness, then we will have provided support for the
spatial mismatch hypothesis along with an estimate of the strength of this phenomenon. Table 5
presents the main upper- and lower-censored Tobit estimation result relating job search success
(as measured by the log of quarters of search duration) to the job accessibility ratio and control
variables, as specified in equation (12). We define success as in Table 2 – finding any job (in
column one), finding a job that provides more than 75 percent of earnings at the previous job (in
column two), or finding a job that provides more than 90 percent of earnings at the previous job
(in column three). We calculate job accessibility as in equation (11), using predicted travel times
to weight the contribution of jobs and competing searchers. A negative coefficient signifies that
better access reduces the duration of joblessness.
        For each dependent variable specification, we find that greater job accessibility reduces
job search duration, with greater effects for jobs with incomes approaching the earnings of the
lost job. In the center of the distribution, an increase of one unit in job accessibility (from -0.5 to
0.5) is approximately equal to an increase from the 20th to the 80th percentile of job accessibility
(see Figure 1). Such an increase is associated with a 5.0 percent reduction in search duration for
finding any job, and a 6.6 and 8.3 percent reduction for accessions to a new job with 75 and 90
percent of prior job earnings, respectively. The greater effect for the higher earnings thresholds is
consistent with reduced noise in the dependent variable as the “any new job” outcome in column
one includes temporary jobs, that is, a job that a displaced worker would not maintain in the long
term. The results for higher earning jobs may also better reflect the tradeoff of offer value and
commute distance faced by a job seeker. Imposing the threshold is equivalent to reducing the
offer arrival rate given by equation (5), which is expected to increase search duration. Only new
jobs within the same state are included, so long distance relocations resulting in a new job are
considered a failure to find a local job.29
        To evaluate the importance of focusing on mass layoff events, we also estimate the
search model for a comparable sample of over 300,000 non-displaced separators (not presented
here). For non-displaced searchers, we can find no statistically significant relationship between



29
   All of the metropolitan areas we consider are in a CMSA that is either entirely or mostly contained within one
state (the exceptions are 5 of 14 counties in Chicago-Naperville-Joliet IL-IN-WI and 2 of 13 in Minneapolis-St.
Paul-Bloomington MN-WI). As is discussed earlier, the MPOs used to define residence counties are only in the state
of the principal city.

                                                                                                               20
job accessibility and search duration. This finding highlights the importance of focusing on
persons who are searching for plausibly exogenous reasons.
       The specifications presented in Table 5 include controls for demographic characteristics,
for previous employer’s industry, for each metropolitan area by year, and for the quarter of job
loss. The total impact of the controls signifies the importance of controlling for other factors
related to selection of a residence location. Although it is not always possible to determine a
prior expectation, none of the coefficients associated with the control variables have signs that
are unusual, and the effects are highly significant, suggesting that the model is well-specified and
that the controls are helping with identification. The directions and magnitudes of the control
variables vary little across specifications. Men, white non-Hispanics, and younger workers tend
to have shorter search duration. Workers with greater lost earnings find jobs faster, but those
with greater annual earnings or annual household earnings take more time, corresponding to a
higher reservation wage or a greater financial cushion. Workers having held many jobs in the last
2 years find a new job faster, as do those who commuted farther to a previous job, suggesting a
lower reservation commute cost. Residents of high poverty tracts take longer to find a job while
those in high homeownership and more recently developed tracts find a job faster. Workers
previously employed in goods-producing industries, including manufacturing, and those in
education or public services, take longer to find a new job.
       Although not shown here, the control variables are helpful in identifying the main effect.
Dropping the neighborhood variables reduces the main effect by one-half, and dropping the
employment history variables reduces it by one-half again. As is discussed in Appendix C, this
primary result of reduced search duration associated with increased job accessibility is robust to
variation in the specification of the gravity index and choice of outcome variable. We find
similar results employing other statistical models (such as the ordered logit, and variations in
censoring.
       Table 6 presents the main estimate from Table 5, along with other estimates to evaluate
the robustness of this result to employer selection. As discussed above, one concern is that the
unobserved ability of a job seeker may be related to job search outcomes and place of residence.
To control for a potential indicator of ability, we estimate a specification with fixed effects for
the previous employer, which controls for sorting to employers with respect to unobserved
characteristics. The linear non-censored specification shown in column three includes 31,000

                                                                                                      21
fixed effects for workers sharing an employer; other control variables remain the same, but
industry and metropolitan area effects fall out. We again find a significant negative effect of job
accessibility in column three for both the 75 percent and 90 percent of previous job earnings
outcomes (the “any new job” outcome also has a negative but not a significant coefficient). To
compare the magnitude of this effect with the result in column one, we also estimate a non-
censored model using OLS, with no employer effects (column two). Based on what has been
observed to be a powerful empirical regularity (Green 1980), we can rescale the OLS result by
dividing the estimated coefficient by the share that is not censored in the Tobit regression (42.7
percent for the 75 percent earnings threshold). For each outcome, the rescaled OLS coefficient in
column four is similar in magnitude to the censored Tobit estimate in column one. Finally, we
rescale the fixed effects estimate using the same factor, providing the estimate in column five.
The rescaled fixed effects estimates for the 75-percent and 90-percent earnings thresholds are
approximately half the magnitude of the primary result.
         One drawback of the fixed effects model is that, because many workers reside relatively
nearby to where they work, the degree of variation in job accessibility among co-workers will be
substantially less than among the full population. We conclude that the robustness of the main
result to employer fixed effects underscores our spatial mismatch finding, but we focus on the
Tobit model without employer effects for other extensions and interpretation.
         Table 7 presents the distribution of expected search durations given job accessibility at
the median (with a value of 0.036), and the expected change in durations associated with a jump
from the 25th to the 75th percentile of job accessibility (values of -0.403 and 0.438 respectively).
As with Table 2, expected search duration rises with the earnings threshold. Job seekers with
median accessibility are expected to find any new job (column 1), or a job with the 75 and 90
percent earnings thresholds (columns 3 and 5) in the same quarter with a probability of 0.41,
0.29, and 0.25 respectively.30 Around these medians, the 75-25 difference columns show that
substantially greater job accessibly would improve same quarter job finding by about 1
percentage point (0.74, 0.78, and 0.89 percentage points, respectively).


30
   The expected probabilities from the Tobit model are skewed towards earlier new jobs compared with the
population averages in Table 2. The expectations at mean job accessibility are very similar to those at the 50 th
percentile. The difference of Tables 6 and 2 is likely due to the linear functional form imposed by the Tobit model.
For an ordered logit model, where the number of search quarters is the dependent variable, expectations are closely
in line with the population averages.

                                                                                                                   22
        Overall, the Table 5 results imply that an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of
job accessibility is associated with a 4.2 percent reduction in search duration for finding any job,
and a 5.6 and 7.0 percent reduction for accessions to a new job with 75 and 90 percent of prior
job earnings, respectively. The greater magnitude of the high earning outcome reflects the higher
sensitivity of obtaining such a job to spatial mismatch.
        The magnitude of our estimated effect of job accessibility can be put into perspective by
comparing it against the effect of other neighborhood characteristics. For example, the 25th and
75th percentiles of the census tract poverty rate for our sample are 0.037 and 0.142 (with a mean
of 0.106 and a median of 0.070). In Table 5, we find a positive effect on job search duration for
neighborhood poverty, so moving from a high to low poverty neighborhood, a decrease of
0.105, would be expected to reduce job search time by 1.5, 4.6, and 6.4 percent respectively for
the three job search outcomes. While demographic and job history factors still play the principal
role in determining job search outcomes (blacks take 24 percent longer to find a comparable job),
the similarity in magnitudes of these census tract effects suggests that job accessibility is an
important metric for characterizing a neighborhood. Job accessibility captures a different
dimension of a neighborhood than is represented by tabulations of resident data, with a
correlation of only 0.15 with poverty share (conditional on metropolitan area), and similarly low
relationships with other neighborhood variables.
        Table 8 presents results for various subsamples, with the job accessibility estimate from
an independent regression in each cell. As with the main results, estimates for the effect on
finding any job tend to be less significant and more attenuated, while estimates for earnings
greater than 90 percent of previous job estimates are strongest. These subsample results highlight
some groups that are especially sensitive to spatial mismatch, but also suggest that job
accessibility is broadly relevant for all job seekers. Larger magnitude effects may reflect both
greater sensitivity to job accessibility or differences in the suitability of the job accessibility
measure across groups. We cannot be certain of the explanation for any particular group, but
offer some interpretation below.
        Panel A of Table 8 shows results disaggregated by race and ethnicity, a reference point of
particular interest for the spatial mismatch literature, which has often focused on outcomes for
lower-earnings inner-city blacks. We first note that non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Hispanics are all sensitive to job accessibility. However, we do find that for obtaining

                                                                                                      23
comparable jobs, blacks are especially sensitive evaluated at the point estimates. For finding any
job, a job at 75 percent of previous earnings, or a job at 90 percent of previous earnings, blacks
are more sensitive to job accessibility than whites. Table 8 shows that the relative white-black
coefficients for these three cases are -0.042 versus -0.072, -0.072 versus -0.083, and -0.086
versus -0.116, signifying that blacks are approximately 71, 15, and 35 percent more sensitive
than whites for the three earnings levels examined (although the differences are not statistically
different from each other). We also note that Hispanic job seekers are most sensitive for finding
any job. This could possibly be due to Hispanics being more likely to take a lower earning job
that is accessible rather than holding out for a higher earning job (that is, they have a lower
reservation wage). Put in terms of Table 7, an increase from the overall 25th to 75th percentiles of
job accessibility would be expected to increase a white, black, and Hispanic job seeker's
probability of finding a comparable new job at 75 percent of previous earnings in the first two
quarters by 0.94, 1.10, and 0.98 percentage points respectively, around outcomes of 41.7, 36.6,
and 36.6 percent at median job accessibility for the three groups.
       Panel B of Table 8 shows results by sex and age. While men and women have little
difference in outcomes for finding any job, women are especially sensitive to job accessibility
for finding a comparable job, with an effect that is 71 percent greater than that for men. This
result may suggest that men are more likely to accept a long commute to retain lost earnings.
Workers aged 55 to 64 are substantially more sensitive to job accessibility for all earnings
outcomes, with the effect on obtaining a comparable job being almost three times greater than for
those aged 34 to 54. Again, this would suggest that younger workers might be more willing to
commute, or perhaps to relocate locally in order to obtain a new job. A 25th the 75th percentile
change in job accessibility for a female or older job seeker would be expected to reduce search
times for a job earning 75 percent of their previous job by 6.9 and 15.1 percent respectively.
       Panel C shows differences by household type and earnings level. Among married
households, there is suggestive evidence that secondary workers, or the lesser earner in a
household, may be more sensitive to spatial mismatch. This sensitivity would be consistent with
a higher reservation wage or a comparative advantage in household production. Not-married
workers, or those for whom we could not establish spousal co-residence, also appear to have
more sensitivity. Workers with greater pre-displacement earnings (those earning $30,000-
$39,999) are actually more sensitive than lower-earning workers ($15,000-$29,999). Again, this

                                                                                                     24
result would suggest that spatial mismatch is not just a concern in regards to those with very low
incomes, but is relevant to search outcomes for workers at somewhat higher incomes as well.31
         In Panel D, we find that all displaced industry groups are sensitive to job accessibility,
especially when search outcomes are defined as a comparable job. Those displaced from typical
blue-collar industries, labeled here as “goods-producing” (including construction, manufacturing,
utilities, and distribution), are especially sensitive to spatial mismatch. Workers displaced from
public sector and education jobs are also highly sensitive. Health care workers have a similar
accessibility effect across all outcome types, suggesting that such workers are primarily finding
new jobs with similar earnings to their previous jobs. The lower magnitude effect for local
services workers may simply reflect a greater accumulation of job search experience by workers
in a high turnover industry. Alternately, given that the job opportunities in local services are
more spatially distributed, job accessibility may be less of a constraint.
         In Table 9, we provide estimates for the effect of job accessibility in the same
race/ethnicity or industry as the job searcher as a means to further refine the set of job
opportunities and competing searchers that might be most relevant. Racial mismatch may be
important (see Hellerstein et al. 2008), which would make race/ethnicity-based accessibility
measures more relevant than the overall measures. Similarly, skills specific to industries might
make industry-based measures more relevant. While our analysis on these dimensions is only
exploratory, the results in Table 9 show that the same-type results for race-ethnicity and industry
are largely similar to the overall job accessibility effects. 32 In short, we do not find evidence that
the impact of spatial mismatch is greater if we refine the accessibility measures to same-type
measures on these dimensions. If anything, we find somewhat weaker results for blacks when
using same-type measures. Part of the reason for these findings is that there is a high degree of
correlation between accessibility for all jobs, and same race/ethnicity jobs, with a correlation of




31
   One should not necessarily infer that even higher earning workers would be yet more sensitive, as responsiveness
to job accessibility with respect to earnings or skill levels may be non-linear.
32
   One difference for the industry results is that those laid off from the public and education sectors are not
especially sensitive to opportunities in those industries. One reason for this attenuation may be that we exclude state
and local government jobs from our job accessibility measure, because such jobs are often measured with less
geographic precision (for example, local school jobs are sometimes reported in one central administrative location
rather than distributed to worksites).

                                                                                                                     25
0.99 for whites, and 0.92 for blacks (conditional on metropolitan area).33 Likewise, we find
similarly high correlations of all and same-sector jobs.


                                               VI.      Conclusions
         The spatial mismatch hypothesis (SMH) encompasses a wide range of research questions,
all focused on whether a worker with locally inferior access to jobs is likely to have worse labor
market outcomes. The literature grew out of two papers by Kain (1964, 1968), which proposed
that persistent unemployment in urban black communities might be due to a movement of jobs
away from those areas, coupled with the inability due to housing discrimination for those
residents to relocate closer to jobs. A voluminous literature has ensued in an attempt to address
the existence and extent of spatial mismatch. A primary concern has been how to state the
problem and appropriately test for it.
         Numerous contributions have advanced this literature, including, for example, explicit
recognition of the value of automobile availability for search and commuting, use in some cases
of commute times instead of distance, and consideration of competing searchers. But no study
has combined and built upon these advances, using appropriate data and satisfactorily dealing
with identification. Furthermore, the existing literature has been primarily cross-sectional, and
despite efforts to account for endogenous residential location, has come under considerable
criticism. More recent efforts at longitudinal analysis by Dawkins et al. (2005), Johnson (2006),
and Rogers (1997) find evidence of spatial mismatch but have smaller samples and identification
challenges.
         Relative to this existing longitudinal literature, the analysis in this paper is the first to
focus on workers displaced from a mass layoff, which is a critical aspect of our identification
strategy. The basis of our approach is that if spatial mismatch is present, then the duration of
search for a new job after a displacement event should be related to accessibility to appropriate
jobs. In this paper, we provide a new approach to the measurement of the effects of spatial
mismatch that combines methodological innovation with unique longitudinal and cross-sectional
data for nine, major US metropolitan areas. We take advantage of rich, matched employer-


33
  These high correlations persist even when the impedance function in equations (9) and (10) uses a shorter
discounting threshold of 5 minutes, rather than the default of 10 minutes. This might have been relevant as
Hellerstein et al. (2008) focus on job accessibility measures based on jobs in adjacent zip codes to the place of
residence.

employee administrative data on job histories and search outcomes integrated with worker
characteristics and neighborhood data from the Decennial Census and comprehensive
transportation network data from nine large Great Lakes metropolitan areas. In addition, our
study casts a much wider geographic net to include suburbs and multiple large metropolitan
areas.
         In summary, the key methodological advances we incorporate are (1) deriving a space-
dependent theoretical model consistent with the job search literature; (2) linking data from
several sources to create a large and rich dataset as the basis for estimation, allowing for controls
at the census tract level across nine metropolitan areas and six years; (3) employing a
longitudinal worker history for lower-paid workers with strong labor force attachment to control
for unobservable characteristics of potential workers that may be correlated with residential
location; (4) following a large sample of involuntarily displaced workers, which permits treating
their residential location as exogenously determined; (5) creating an individual-specific job
accessibility measure that accounts for job opportunities, competing searchers, and modal choice
(automobile versus public transit); and (6) using a censored Tobit model to account for censoring
in the dependent variable (unemployment duration).
         Our results support the spatial mismatch hypothesis. We find that better job accessibility
significantly decreases the duration of joblessness among lower-paid displaced workers. In the
center of the job accessibility distribution, an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of job
accessibility is associated with a 4.2 percent reduction in search duration for finding any job, and
a 5.6 and 7.0 percent reduction for accessions to a new job with 75 and 90 percent of prior job
earnings, respectively. While job accessibility is only one of many factors affecting job search
outcomes, it appears to play an especially important role for blacks, who have long been a focus
of this research area. We find that blacks are approximately 71, 15, and 35 percent more
sensitive to job accessibility than white job seekers for these three hiring measure respectively.
We also find that job accessibility is especially important for females and older workers.

upper- and lower-censored Tobit models is the McFadden’s pseudo R-square measure, and is not
directly comparable to the R-squared of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model. R-squared for
the employer fixed effects model includes both within and between variation. Tobit and OLS
specifications include all control variables present in Table 5; the fixed effects model drops
industry and metropolitan area effects. Columns 4 and 5 (shown in italics) adjust the coefficients
of the models in Columns 2 and 3, which did not apply censoring, by dividing the coefficients by

APPENDIX A: Estimated Travel Time

         This study makes use of point-to-point travel time estimates provided by Metropolitan
Planning Organizations (MPOs) in nine metropolitan areas. The MPOs use transportation
planning models to estimate driving and transit travel times between transportation analysis
zones at different times of day.34 We first translate the analysis zones into census tracts using
crosswalk files or proximity. For driving trips, we use only the travel times at the morning peak
period, when routes may be most congested. Reported public transit times may refer to trips by
bus, rail, tram, and other modes, depending on the metropolitan area.35
         We impose several data edits to make the MPO data more representative of potential
travel times and more comparable across metropolitan areas. For both automobile and transit, we
assume zero travel time to jobs within a census tract. Because some MPOs effectively impose a
minimum transit time of approximately 10 minutes, we impose that minimum for all MPOs, but
also drop 5 minutes from all transit times to harmonize with auto travel, for which most MPOs
indicate zero vehicle access time.
         We apply some deterministic imputations in the case of missing or invalid travel times.
For automobile travel, we impose a travel time one would infer from an assumed driving speed
of 20 miles per hour (great circle distance) - the average reported speed. Because of incomplete
transit networks, about two-thirds of tract pairs have no transit travel time. For both auto and
transit travel times that are slower than walking (assumed to be 3 miles per hour) we substitute
walking travel time for the reported or edited value. For potential “transit” commutes that are off
the network, we always impose the walking travel time, which makes travel time to all but the
nearest such tracts prohibitively long.
         Table A1 presents summary statistics for travel times between directional, origin-
destination pairs. In addition to median travel times, the table reports median distances traveled

34
   The MPO estimates of driving and transit travel times for large metropolitan areas are generally created by using a
model that draws on the 2000 Census Transportation and Planning Package (CTPP) and local transit surveys. The
models used by about 40 large US metropolitan areas are fairly similar, and are derived from one of two standard
commercially-available sources. We thank the following MPO’s for providing us with commute times:
Comprehensive Metropolitan Agency for Planning (Chicago), Greater Buffalo-Niagara Regional Transportation
Council, Indianapolis Metropolitan Planning Organization, Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (Columbus),
Minneapolis Metropolitan Council, Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (Cleveland), Southeast
Michigan Council of Governments (Detroit), Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (Pittsburgh), Southeastern
Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (Milwaukee).
35
   Although some MPOs provide information on “park-and-ride” commute times, where one drives to a transit stop,
we only consider routes that are entirely transit-based.

                                                                                                                   41

and median implied speeds. Based on the latitude and longitude of an internal point in each
census tract, we calculate the great circle distance between pairs of points. The distance
presented here is a minimum distance, because the road network will often be less direct. Using
the travel time and distance together, we calculate an implied speed in miles per hour, which is
also likely to be a lower bound on road speed (roads are often less direct). The first row lists the
count of directional pairs represented in each column, with a domain of 5.267 million pairs. We
weight statistics by the LODES commute flow along each route.36

NOTES: The domain includes 5,266,871 tract-to-tract pairs within the set of metropolitan areas. Tract-to-tract
distances, MPO travel times and speeds are weighted by LODES job flows between pairs. Columns 1 and 5 list only
MPO-reported commutes and edits for automobile and transit travel respectively. Columns 2 and 6 list all
commutes, including imputed travel times. The remaining columns list only commutes with CTPP travel times.


           Columns 1 and 5 give the commute statistics for the reported MPO commutes, with times
edited as described above, while columns 2 and 6 also include imputed commutes and represent
all possible pairs. The median auto travel time of about 25 minutes changes little with the
addition of imputed routes, because MPOs report auto times for almost all routes. In contrast,
median transit time rises from over an hour to almost an hour and a half, because for the half of
routes with no transit available, we impute based on walking speed.
           In columns 3, 4, 7, and 8, we compare MPO travel times to a representative survey
sample for the set of metropolitan areas. The Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) -
built from the 2000 Decennial Census - provides reported travel times, but only for the routes

     For the census tract pairs presented here, LODES provides the count of workers using each route in 2005.

actually traveled. Comparing CTPP travel times to MPO travel times provides an objective
evaluation of whether MPO travel times are a good representation of proximity. To minimize
measurement error from the survey travel times, we include only the census tract pairs with at
least 10 CTPP commutes by automobile or transit (also excluding within-tract commutes).37 For
the automobile pairs, we find an MPO median travel time of about 17 minutes, very close to the
CTPP median travel time of about 16 minutes. The transit travel times are more divergent, with
MPOs giving an average travel time of 42 minutes compared to only 35 minutes in CTPP. For
the same pairs of tracts, we find an MPO-CTPP correlation of 0.59 for automobile travel times
and 0.47 for transit travel times.




37
  The CTPP automobile times are for commuters driving their own vehicle to work, leaving between 5:00 a.m. to
8:59 a.m. The CTPP transit times are for all other modes.

APPENDIX B: Individualized Travel Time Predictions
        This section describes the development of the personalized prediction of transit use on
each potential commute route. The goal is to generate an expectation of whether a particular job
seeker would use automobile or transit to commute to a job in any tract. Because LEHD jobs
data and the MPO travel time data have no information on an individual’s commute choices, we
obtain commute choices from the 2000 Census long form responses – the Sample Edited Detail
File (SEDF). We estimate models of vehicle count and mode choice for respondents, and use the
parameter estimates to predict whether individuals in the job seeker dataset are likely to
commute by public transit. We use this predicted probability of auto or transit use to weight
accessibility to jobs in a tract, with accessibility of each mode depending on travel time for that
mode.
        We combine the 2000 Census long form responses with the same datasets used to create
the sample of displaced workers. We first extract a sample of approximately 693,000 employed
respondents from the SEDF, who commute to a job in one of the nine metropolitan areas in our
sample.38 As with the displaced worker sample, we match these records to neighborhood,
commute time, and earnings data, with sample restrictions documented in Table B1.39 Because
we are focusing on mode choice, we limit the sample to residents of tracts with a feasible transit
option by requiring that at least 5 percent of residents report commuting by transit and that at
least 10 percent of routes to workplaces from that tract have an MPO transit travel time.40 These
restrictions reduce the sample by a cumulative 84.3 percent, resulting in a sample of
approximately 109,000 workers who might plausibly use either mode.




38
   We are limited to records with a (de-duplicated) Personal Identification Key (PIK) and define employment based
on an Employment Status Recode of ‘1’ and a Class of Worker of ‘1’ to ‘4’, including private sector and state and
local government employees. We also limit to the age range in 2000 to 20-64, to those commuting (we exclude those
working from home) to a job in an MPO county with LEHD data in 2000 (all but two study states), and to those with
household information (a small share of records do not match to the household file). We exclude Michigan and Ohio
cities from this estimation because they lack sufficient pre-2000 earnings histories.
39
   We match by PIK to the Composite Person Record file of administrative residence data for the year 2000, and
require residence in one of the MPO counties. We then match the respondent to MPO travel time data by place of
work and place of residence census tract, and to the Summary File 1 neighborhood data by residence census tract.
We limit to those having LEHD earnings in each quarter from 1999:2 to 2000:2, and require that earnings from
1999:2 to 2000:1 be between $15,000 and $40,000.
40
   MPOs report estimated auto travel times between almost all tract pairs, but sometimes omit transit. Some MPOs
have explained that they do not provide transit times when that mode is not available.

                                                                                                              44

        We use the combined datasets to construct the mode choice variables, as well as variables
that are identical to those available for the displaced worker sample. Table B2 presents the cross-
tabulation of the vehicle count categories and transit use for the linked sample described in B1,
which we derive from responses on the long form.41 We define transit as any mode besides
car/truck/van, taxicab, or motorcycle (with those working at home excluded). Thus, walking and
bicycle riding are included in transit use. Even for this transit-feasible subset, the dominance of
automobile use is evident – 91.5 percent have at least one vehicle and 82.6 percent travel by car.
Note that even among workers with no vehicle of their own, over a third commute by car
(presumably many of these workers participate in carpools).

  From the long form question “How many automobiles, vans, and trucks of one-ton capacity or less are kept at
home for use by members of your household?” we construct an automobile count of up to three or more vehicles for
a household. From the long form question “How did this person usually get to work LAST WEEK?” we construct a
commute mode variable indicating whether a worker used transit.

                                                                                                              45

        From the merged MPO travel times we construct a variable of transit inefficiency to a
worker’s current workplace, measured as MPO transit time divided by auto time. We use the
LEHD earnings data for a worker and household members to measure the count of persons,
earners, annual worker and household earnings, and earnings per worker. We construct
demographic variables from the 2000 SEDF and from linked measures of neighborhood
characteristics.
        Our approach includes two stages of estimation for variables available only in the SEDF-
based sample. First, for all workers, we estimate the number of vehicles in a worker’s household
with an ordered logistic model, for the categorical values in Table B2. Using these estimates, we
predict vehicle count within-sample, and create a variable for the probability that a worker has at
least one car. These same estimates are then used to predict vehicles for the out-of-sample
displaced workers. Second, for all workers, we run two binary logistic regressions with transit
use as the dependent variable. The first logit weights each worker by his or her predicted
probability of having a car, and the second one weights by the complement.
        Table B3 presents estimates from the both stages, and shows how some factors affecting
transit use depend on the likelihood of having a vehicle. Column 1 presents the first stage, where
we find, unsurprisingly, that households with more earners, persons, and higher earnings have
more cars. A worker with an inefficient transit commute is especially likely to be in a household
with cars. Dense neighborhoods and those with high public transit use are less likely to have
cars. Columns 2 and 3 present the second stage, where we find that workers with inefficient
transit routes are less likely to use transit, as are those with higher earnings. The interaction of
transit inefficiency and annual worker earnings shows that as transit becomes less practical,
higher earning workers are especially likely to switch to auto commuting. This finding is
consistent with higher earners having a higher value of travel time and being more willing to pay
for auto travel, which typically saves time but costs more. We find that women, non-Hispanic
whites, older workers, and those in high public transit neighborhoods are more likely to use
transit. Some coefficients have different magnitudes and signs across the two logits, which is due
to the differences in probability of having a car. Young workers are less likely to use transit if
their household has a car. More dense neighborhoods reduce transit use when a household is
more likely to have a car.

          For the displaced worker sample, we use the estimates from Table B3 to calculate
expected transit use for each possible route. Because the displaced worker sample has identically
constructed variables, it is possible to make this out-of-sample prediction. First, we calculate the

expected probability of the job seeker’s household having a vehicle, using the estimates from
Column 1. Then, for the same worker, we calculate probability of transit use with the estimates
in Column 2 and 3. Lastly, we use the expected probability of having a car to create a weighted
average of the probability of using public transit on each route. This probability of transit use
feeds into the predicted job accessibility ratio calculation in equation (11). Using the same rules
as described above for transit feasibility, we only apply these probabilities to workers residing in
the 41 percent of Census tracts with feasible transit options. We assume all other workers posses
a car and drive to potential job opportunities.
       The results presented here are informative about the factors affecting transit use.
However, as is explained before, auto availability and usage is widespread. Ultimately, the
minimal use of transit limits the efficacy of this approach in adding personalized variation to
travel time measures.

APPENDIX C: Robustness Tests

           Table C1 presents the variance/covariance and correlations for various job accessibility
ratios with varied assumptions on the use of automobile and transit, providing some intuition on
the importance of equation (11) employing predicted mode use. The first two measures,
calculated assuming either 𝑝̂ 𝑖𝑗𝑘(auto) = 1 or 𝑝̂ 𝑖𝑗𝑘(transit) = 1 are only weakly correlated (0.25),
suggesting that in theory, incorporating transit usage could add information to the job
accessibility measure. However, the predicted job access ratio, which incorporates the weighted
likelihood of using each mode, turns out to mostly composed of variation from automobile
commutes. This should not be very surprising, given that only 7 percent of workers use transit in
the relevant residential census tracts. In Column 3 of each panel, note that the contribution of
auto access to the combined measure accounts for most of the variation and has a correlation of
0.96, while the transit contribution has a correlation of only 0.21. Column 4 shows that these
auto and transit contributions are actually slightly negatively related to one another. The last
element of each panel, which is used for all the main results in this paper, gives a predicted
access ratio where only workers in tracts with a feasible transit option are given any possibility
of using transit.

        Table C2 demonstrates the robustness of the main result to variations on the job
accessibility measure. Rows 1 to 3 present a range of discounting thresholds where 𝜏 = 5
minutes and 𝜏 = 15 minutes, rather than 𝜏 = 10 minutes as used in the main text (repeated in in
row 2). This variation in the threshold has little effect on the estimates. Row 4 substitutes an
automobile-based proximity measure, that is, 𝑝̂ 𝑖𝑗𝑘(auto) = 1. As might be expected given the high
correlation of auto accessibility and predicted accessibility shown in Table C1, the automobile
estimates are similar, with slightly lower magnitude. Rows 5 and 6 limit the sample to searchers
residing in tracts with feasible transit (only 102,000 observations), to focus on the importance of
predicted job accessibility for these searchers. For these transit-feasible searchers, both the auto-
only and predicted job accessibility measures reduce search duration, but the predicted measure
has a larger magnitude. The last specification disaggregates the auto and transit components of
job accessibility, by calculating accessibility separately for the first and second terms of the
predicted job opportunities calculation in equation (9). These estimates show that auto
accessibility is the dominant factor in the job accessibility effect.
