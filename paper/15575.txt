Banking System Control, Capital Allocation, and Economy Performance

                                              ABSTRACT

We observe less efficient capital allocation in countries whose banking systems are more thoroughly
controlled by tycoons or families. The magnitude of this effect is similar to that of state control over
banking. Unlike state control, tycoon or family control also correlates with slower economic and productivity
growth, greater financial instability, and worse income inequality. These findings are consistent with
theories that elite-capture of a country’s financial system can embed “crony capitalism”.

1.      Introduction
Economic growth correlates strongly with financial development (King & Levine 1993ab; Demirguc-

Kunt & Levine 1996; Levine 1996; Levine & Zervos 1998; Rajan & Zingales 1998; Demirguc-Kunt &

Maksimovic 1998; Beck et al. 2000; Levine et al. 2000; Beck & Levine 2002). But financial development

is neither inevitable nor irreversible. Many countries never sustained dynamic financial systems; and

more surprisingly, many that once did ceased doing so (Rajan & Zingales 2003).

        One explanation for financial underdevelopment is that growth can undermine the positions of the

already wealthy (Schumpeter 1912, 1951; Morck, Stangeland & Yeung 2000, Fogel et al. 2008). Thus,

Rajan & Zingales (2004) argue that early 20th century financial development enriched an initial cadre of

tycoons who, in many countries, then successfully oversaw financial development reversals that deprived

potential competitors and innovative upstarts of capital. This, they posit, locks in a status quo favoring the

initial tycoons and their heirs. Morck, Wolfenzon, & Yeung (2005) further argue that many countries

block financial development entirely to forestall competition that threatens entrenched economic elites.

        Consistent with these theses, economies that entrust more of their economies to old-moneyed

business families grow slower and sustain lower living standards than otherwise similar countries,

suggesting that protecting these families imposes costs on the broader economy (Morck, Stangeland &

Yeung 2000). Such countries also have more corrupt government, less efficient judiciaries, and more
bureaucratic red tape (Fogel 2006) – all likely barriers to entrepreneurs. However, the most direct way to

limit competition from new entrepreneurs is probably to limit their access to capital by controlling the

country’s financial system (Rajan & Zingales 2004).

        Such situations are described as elite capture. This arises if an elite – a minority such as the very

wealthy, political insiders, or an ethnic group – controls an economic, political, or other institution to

advance the minority’s interests, rather than general social welfare (Glaeser, Scheinkman & Shleifer

2003; Hellman, Jones & Kaufmann 2003; and others). Elite capture of a country’s financial system might

occur in various ways, but would be incomplete without control over banks, which Beck et al. (2008)

show to be an essential source of capital for small businesses across countries We measure the potential

elite capture of each country’s banking system by the fraction of its largest banks, listed and unlisted,

controlled by tycoons and business families. For brevity, we refer to this as family control.




                                                      1
        Controlling for banking system size, stock market size, and other relevant factors we find that

more predominantly family-controlled banking systems allocate capital less efficiently, measured either

by Wurgler’s (2000) cross-industry correlation of capital spending growth with value-added or by non-

performing loans. The efficiency loss is comparable to what La Porta et al. (2002), Caprio et al. (2007)

and others find for state-controlled banking systems. However, family-controlled banking systems also

correlate with financial instability and slower per capita GDP and productivity growth; while state-

controlled banking systems do not. These findings are highly robust - including to reasonable sources of

endogeneity. Family control of banks also correlates with proxies for crony capitalism (Murphy et al.

1991, 1993; Shleifer & Vishny 1993; Shleifer & Vishny 1998b; Haber 2002; Krueger 2002; Rajan &

Zingales 2004; Daniels & Trebilcock 2008; Fisman & Miguel 2008; and others), such as high income

inequality and barriers to entry.
        We conclude that, on average, entrusting the governance of large banks to tycoons or families

provides efficiency losses comparable to those of state-controlled banks, augmented by the inequality

consequences associated with crony capitalism. Of course, our results imply neither that tycoon and
family control are always inefficient nor that banking systems predominantly controlled by tycoons or

families always harm their countries. Our results do, however, indicate such cases to be atypical and

therefore especially deserving of study.



2.      The economics of bank control
The social purpose of the financial system is to allocate the economy’s savings to its highest value uses
(Tobin 1989; Wurgler 2000) – especially to innovative upstart firms (Schumpeter 1912). A healthy

banking system is therefore key to sustained prosperity (King & Levine 1993a). Consequently, bank

governance affects not only banks, but the whole economy. Indeed, policies that maximize the bank

owners’ wealth – such as excessive risk taking to exploit deposit insurance or probably bailouts – might

adversely affect the overall economy. Such externalities divorce efficient bank governance from

maximizing bank shareholder valuations (Saunders et al. 1990). Keeping this distinction in mind, we
focus on the implications of bank control for the overall economy, rather than for banks’ shareholders.




                                                    2
         Our results build on large body of previous work exploring state-controlled banking and family-

controlled firms, and on a much smaller literature investigating family-controlled banks. We now review

the most relevant parts of these literatures.



2.1      State-controlled versus private sector banks
State-controlled banks can rise above market forces to allocate capital where it advances social goals,

rather than where it creates the greatest bank-level profit. Such considerations allow that state-controlled

banking systems might not only better promote social goals, such as income equality or equality of

opportunity, but also allocate an economy’s capital more efficiently than private-sector banks (Lewis,

1950).

         However, like all state-owned enterprises, state-controlled banks are vulnerable to a range of
“government failure problems” (Shleifer & Vishny 1998a). Thus, Krueger (2002, p. 15) writes that state-

controlled banking often means “cronies can be favored through the granting of domestic credit when that

credit is allocated at rates significantly below market.” Even where such overt corruption is rare, populist

political entrepreneurs might still use state-controlled banks to buy political support with unsound lending

(Dornbusch & Edwards 1992; Dinc 2005).

         Which arguments weigh more heavily in a typical country is thus an empirical question. At the
bank level, state control correlates with poor financial performance, and privatizations increase financial

performance (Megginson et al. 2004; Boubakri et al. 2005). This is consistent with both social goals

trumping profit and crony lending. However, at the economy level, greater state control of banking
correlates with lower per capita income levels, growth rates and worse financial sector instability (La

Porta et al. 2002), and with greater capital misallocation (Wurgler 2000, Taboada 2008).

         The weight of the evidence is thus consistent with state-controlled banking having major costs in
terms of depressed living standards, capital misallocation, and systemic instability, and thus of policy

options favoring private bank ownership (La Porta et al. 2002). To explore these issues further, we

distinguish two flavors of private ownership – widely held banks versus family held banks, which are

described below.



2.2      Widely Held Banks

                                                     3
Career concerns are thought to force professional CEOs of widely held firms to maximize shareholder

value (Fama 1977), and market forces are thought to fine-tune such CEOs’ incentives towards this end

(Demsetz & Lehn 1985). Free of government pressure to advance political or social goals and free of

pressure to advance business family interests, widely held banks’ CEOs should allocate capital more

efficiently than state or family-controlled banks. Most importantly, widely held banks’ professional

managers, bent on maximizing shareholder value, should offer loans to established and upstart firms alike

at similar risk-adjusted rates.

        On the other hand, diffuse ownership and professional management induce well-known

governance problems (Shleifer & Vishny 1997). Professional managers have interests other than

shareholder value (Jensen & Meckling 1976; Jensen 1986), can become entrenched (Stulz 1988). CEOs

at widely held firms are thought to shun risk – either to protect firm-specific human capital (Kane 1985)
or to enjoy “quiet lives” of high status and multimillion dollar compensation packages (John et al. 2008).

The empirical evidence indicates that widely held banks outperform both state and family banks (Caprio

et al., 2007) and carry lower risk (Laeven & Levine 2009). However, as we argued above bank level
performance and economy level performance may differ. Thus, whether or not a more widely held

banking system leads to more desirable economy-level outcomes remains an open issue.



2.3     Family Banks
Most large firms in most countries have controlling shareholders, and these are usually wealthy old-

money business families (La Porta et al. 1999; Bebchuk et al. 2000; Khanna et al. 2000; Morck,

Stangeland & Yeung 2000; Khanna & Yafeh 2005). Such families wield equity control blocks in most

listed firms in East Asia (Claessens et al. 2000; Claessens et al. 2002), India (Khanna & Palepu 2000;

Bertrand et al. 2002), Latin America (Hogenboom 2004; Rogers et al. 2007; Adolfo 2008; Cueto 2008),

Turkey (Ararat & Ugur 2003; Orbay & Yurtoglu 2006), and most other developing economies. Family

control is also important in Canada (Morck, Percy, Tian, & Yeung 2005), continental Europe (Faccio &

Lang 2002), Israel (Lauterbach & Vaninsky 1999; Maman 1999), Japan (Nakamura 2002), and others.

Though not unknown, family control over large firms is more tenuous and far rarer in the United

Kingdom (Franks et al. 2005) and United States (Villalonga & Amit 2006, 2008), where most large firms




                                                    4
are independent and widely held. Many countries’ major banks are also controlled by such families

(Caprio et al. 2007).

        The ubiquity of family control suggests underlying economic advantages. Firms, including banks,

with powerful shareholders are potentially immunized against utility-maximizing CEOs neglecting

shareholder value (Shleifer & Vishny 1986). Banks, even more than most other firms, rely on

relationships (Diamond 1984), and business families’ relationship networks are considered a key asset

(Khanna & Palepu 2005). Family control can be a feasible second best solution to information asymmetry

and agency problems (Shleifer & Vishny 1986), especially absent legal systems that reliably enforce

arm’s-length contracts and protect passive investors (Burkart et al. 2003) 1 . In endemically corrupt

economies, business families can acquire reputational capital (Khanna & Yafeh 2007) and the strength to

counter predatory governments effectively (Fisman & Khanna 2004).

        But large shareholders, as well as CEOs, presumably maximize their utility, which can include

tangible and intangible private benefits of control, and thus need not align with public shareholder value

(Nenova 2003; Dyck & Zingales 2004). Indeed, entrenched large shareholders appear to be a more

commonplace governance problem than entrenched professional mangers in most countries (Djankov et

al. 2006).

        Moreover, what is good for large established businesses need not be good for economies (Fogel et
al. 2008). Especially in banking, where externalities imposed on other firms separate bank level

performance from banks’ contribution to economy-level performance (Saunders et al. 1990), firm-level

advantages of family-control of banks may well have economy-level downsides. Almeida & Wolfenzon

(2005) argue that easier financial transactions between a family’s firms, though good for those firms, can

decrease overall welfare by inefficiently depriving other firms of capital. This plausibly imposes broader

economy-level costs. Economic growth primarily arises from creative upstarts with new products or

processes arising and destroying established businesses in what Schumpeter (1942, p. 84) calls a

“perennial gale of creative destruction” (King and Levine 1993ab; Aghion and Howitt 1997; Fogel et al.

2008). Old-money business families, whose patrimonies are their economy’s established large businesses

 Empirical studies generally find that family (heir controlled) firms outperform in countries where these issues are
important (Khanna & Rivkin 2001; Khanna & Yafeh 2005a, 2007), but underperform in countries such as Canada
(Morck, Stangeland &Yeung 2000), Denmark (Bennedsen et al. 2007), and the US (Villalonga and Amit 2006).


                                                         5
and whose comparative advantage is no longer creativity, might want a windbreak from Schumpeter’s

gale (Morck, Wolfenzon & Yeung 2005) by limiting capital to entrants.

        Rajan & Zingales (2004) argue that many countries first developed dynamic financial systems

and then systematically dismantled them to erect such a windbreak. They posit that, after building great

business empires, a first generation of tycoons, or their heirs, used political influence to cripple their

countries’ financial systems precisely to deny upstarts capital. A growing body of evidence links such

windbreaks to persistent underdevelopment (Acemoglu, Johnson & Robinson 2005; Morck, Wolfenzon &

Yeung 2005; Perotti & Volpin 2006; Stulz 2005).

        A wide range of policies erect effective barriers to entry. Thickets of costly regulation (Djankov

et al. 2002), tax disincentives to entrants (Gentry & Hubbard 2000), subsidies or regulatory favors to

established businesses (Krueger 2002), trade barriers (Krueger 1974; Krueger 2004), and many other

windbreaks are effective. But innovative entrants’ most critical need is typically capital (Schumpeter

1912; Levine 1991, 1992; King & Levine 1993ab; Beck et al. 2000). Because stock markets are important

sources of capital for new firms in only a handful of countries, controlling major banks may thus provide

incumbents uniquely effective shelter from Schumpeter’s gale.

        Not only does bank control let established business families deny potential entrants’ capital, it

also lets them shift losses to banks when contagion risks justify governments bailing out banks but not
other firms (Perotti & Vorage 2008; Perotti & Volpin 2006).2 La Porta et al. (2003) link business family

control of privatized Mexican banks to pervasive capital misallocation and risk shifting. Laeven & Levine

(2009) link family control of banking to higher bank risk taking, consistent with strong shareholders

forcing more aggressive gaming of deposit insurance and leverage regulations.

        Politicians might acquiesce because of rent-seeking (Krueger 1974; Morck & Yeung 2004;

Perotti & Vorage 2008); or even actively assist because of business family ties (Krueger 2002; Faccio
2006; Faccio et al. 2006). This raises the possibility of “elite capture” of the banking system being an


2
  These considerations do not escape astute politicians. For example, Singapore’s then Deputy Prime Minister Hsien
Loong in a speech at The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) on Jun 21st 2001 stated that, “with banking and
non-banking activities inter-meshed within a conglomerate, there will be a strong tendency to stretch any safety net
intended for the banking system also to cover non-bank operations in the group.” Reflecting this concern Singapore
mandates a “separation of financial and non-financial businesses within the banking groups, and to further improve
corporate governance through a clearer and more transparent ownership and control structure.” Other countries’
banking regulations reflect similar concerns. For example Canada mandates low voting caps on chartered banks,
effectively forcing them to be widely held.

                                                         6
important element of “crony capitalism” and all its attendant economic problems (Murphy et al. 1991,

1993; Shleifer & Vishny 1993; Shleifer & Vishny 1998b; Haber 2002; Krueger 2002; Rajan & Zingales

2004; Daniels & Trebilcock 2008; Fisman & Miguel 2008 and others). Haber et al. (2003) argue that elite

capture of Mexican banks in the early twentieth century stunted development for decades afterwards.

           In contrast, family control could also have efficiency consequences for the overall economy if

families facilitate “big push” industrialization (Morck & Nakamura 2007) by using “tunneling” (Johnson

et al. 2000) to orchestrate the same cross-industry subsidies a disinterested central planner would impose

(Rosenstein-Rodan 1943; Murphy et al. 1989). In addition, family-controlled banks might mitigate

financial crises if they continued advancing credit, even if only to other firms controlled by the same

families.

           Thus, the existing literature on bank control and bank level performance can usefully be extended
by exploring potential links between bank control, economy performance, and indicators of elite capture

or crony capitalism.



3.         Sample, Data, and Variable Construction
To this end, we construct a set of economy level measures of banking system control and economy

performance. This section describes their construction, and that of various control variables we also
require.



3.1        Sample
We start with the 2001 global sample of 244 banks Caprio et al. (2007) use to study banks’ market

valuations and equity ownership structures. Although this covers 83 percent of the total banking assets in

44 large economies (Caprio et al., 2007), it omits unlisted banks – a potentially important subsample for

our study because these firms are especially likely to be family-controlled.

           We therefore augment these data to include every country’s ten largest banks, listed or unlisted,

as ranked by 2001 assets in The Banker (2001).3 If The Banker lists fewer than ten large banks in a
country, we add all those not already included but covered by Bankscope. This yields 427 banks from 44


3
 Including smaller banks would be desirable, but greatly magnifies data collection problems. Since we need to
gauge economy-level banking system control, focusing on large banks is defensible as a first pass.

                                                        7
countries. After merging our data with the Caprio et al. (2007) sample we have fewer than ten banks in

some countries and more than ten banks in others.

         We then identify the controlling shareholder, if any, for each bank. Caprio et al. (2007) detail the

control structures of the 244 banks in that sample, so we need only fill in control data only for the

additional banks. Bankscope provides this information – in most cases for 2001, and more

comprehensively for 2002 and subsequently. This leaves us with a grand total of 324 listed and unlisted

banks whose controlling owner we can identify. A controlling owner is identified by 2001 for 79% of our

sample and by 2003 for 94% of the sample.



3.2      Defining and Classifying Banks’ Controlling Shareholders
We ascertain each bank’s ultimate owners, if any, as in Caprio et al. (2007) and La Porta et al. (2002).
That is, we first identify all shareholders with voting blocks of five percent or more. If these are state

organs or biological persons, we call them ultimate owners. However, most blockholders in most banks

are corporations. We identify these corporations’ owners, their owners’ owners, and so on until reaching

either discernable ultimate owners (state organs or biological persons) or diffusely held entities. We then

work through these chains, aggregating voting blocks of common ultimate owners by assuming members

of a family act in concert and state organs obey a single authority. At each link in these chains, we assign
control to the ultimate owner with the largest combined voting block of ten percent or more, combining

direct ownership with indirect ownership by dint of controlling other corporations owning shares in the

corporation in question. If no ten percent voting block exists, we say the corporation in question has no

controlling shareholder.

         We define each bank’s controlling shareholder, if one exists, as the ultimate owner commanding

the largest voting block of ten percent of more. Since the transparency of ownership structures varies
across countries, this mechanical procedure is imperfect.4 We expect to underestimate the prevalence of

control blocks in countries with less stringent reporting requirements.

         After determining the controlling shareholder we assign banks to one of three categories. We say

a bank is state-controlled if its controlling shareholder is a government entity, and family-controlled if its

4
 Different countries have different blockholder reporting thresholds. In the US, all insider stakes and all owners of
5% or more must be disclosed. Comparable thresholds range from 2% to 25% across other countries (Schouten and
Siems, 2009).

                                                          8
controlling shareholder is a tycoon or family. All others, denoted widely held banks, lack a controlling

shareholder – because they are either widely held or controlled by ten percent plus blockholders that are

widely held corporations or cooperatives.

        Finally, we construct three country-level bank governance indexes: fractions of the banking

system, weighted by total net credit, whose governance is entrusted to the state, to business tycoons or

families, or to professional managers. For brevity, we call these the state-controlled, family-controlled,

and widely held shares of countries’ banking systems. Table 1 displays these indexes.



        [Table 1 about here]



        Our bank categorization rules have shortcomings. For example, control by founders versus heirs
has different performance implications (Villalonga & Amit 2006), so our combining banks controlled by

self-made tycoons and old-moneyed families likely includes some for which the entrenchment effects

discussed above may not pertain. However, in most countries, control blocks do signal old-moneyed
family control (La Porta et al. 1999; Morck, Wolfenzon & Yeung 2005). An opposite problem arises for

Svenske Handelsbanken, a widely held Swedish bank that holds extensive control blocks in industrial

firms (Högfeldt 2005), which it might be tempted to treat specially. Another possible distinction would
separate widely held publicly traded banks from cooperative (customer or member owned) banks.

However, all save nine of our widely held banks are cooperative banks but not publicly traded, so we

cannot explore this distinction. All of these imperfections induce noise in our bank control measures, and

thus cut against our finding significant differences between them. We return to these and other

shortcomings of our measures in the robustness section below.



3.3     Financial System Efficiency Measures
We estimate efficiency of a country’s financial system in the following ways:



Capital allocation efficiency
Following Wurgler (2000), we associate more efficient capital allocation with a country’s capital

investment being more predominantly concentrated in industries with faster value-added growth. We


                                                    9
operationalize this by estimating a simple elasticity of gross fixed capital formation to value added

growth for each country using its industry-level data. That is, country’s Wurgler’s elasticity is the

coefficient ηc in the regression


               I ict                 V
[1]      ln            = α c + η c ln ict + ε ict
              I ict −1               Vict −1


with i denoting industry, t time, I fixed capital investment, and V industry value added.

        Comparable industry level investment and value-added data are available through 2003 from

United Nations' General Industrial Statistics (UNIDO) database,. We estimate each country’s capital

allocation efficiency twice. Our first Wurgler’s elasticity estimate uses data for 1993 through 2003 – the
ten years closest to our observation of the bank control. We would ideally base our capital allocation

efficiency measurements of data subsequent to 2001, the earliest date at which we can assemble a broad

international cross-section of bank control data; however, this leaves too short an estimation window. Our
second Wurgler’s elasticity uses all available UNIDO data (1963 through 2003). The longer window

raises the number of countries with enough data to estimate the coefficient η from 33 to 39 and permits

more precise estimates if capital allocation efficiency changes little through the window. If not, the first
version is preferable. Table 4 shows that the two measures are highly correlated.

        Since value-added growth across all sectors, by definition, sums to GDP growth, this measure

gauges the strength of the link between capital spending in each industry and that industry’s contribution

to overall economic growth. Its weakness is that it fails to capture investments that respond to new growth

opportunities yet to affect values added.



Nonperforming Loans
We next use nonperforming loans, measured as a fraction of the value of total gross loans outstanding, to

gauge the banking system’s ability to pick winners, or at least avoid losers. These data are from the World

Development Indicators database (WDI), provided by the World Bank, and are averaged across 1993

through 2003 to yield one observation for each country to smooth out cyclical variations. In our




                                                     10
regressions, we logistically transform each dependent variable a bounded within the unit interval to â

ranging across the real line. That is, we transform a ∈ [0,1) into:


                ⎛ a ⎞
[2]      aˆ = ln⎜     ⎟ ∈ ℜ,
                ⎝1− a ⎠


        A more efficiently-run banking system should make fewer loans to ex ante unqualified borrowers,

and should therefore bear fewer nonperforming loans. State banks pressured by politicians into lending to

financially unqualified but politically favored borrowers often run up huge nonperforming loan problems.
Banks controlled by oligarchic families can get into very similar problems by lending to related parties

who, despite daunting pedigrees, are ill qualified managers (Krueger 2002).

        However, this logic is imperfect. Because screening borrowers is costly, we should observe some
nonperforming loans. Too few might actually indicate inefficiently cautious lending. Also, different

financial reporting practices across countries could render nonperforming loans data noisy, or even induce

bias if, for example, family banking correlates with lower transparency. The last would work against

finding significant results.



Banking Crises
Our third banking efficiency measure, the number of banking crises the economy experiences, is also

directly tied to quality of banks’ governance and their financial health. Although many factors can trigger

banking crises (Allen & Gale 2007), financial history reveals extensive accumulated capital misallocation

a near universal theme (Kindleberger & Aliber 2005). We therefore expect fewer banking crises in

countries where bank loans are allocated more efficiently, all else equal.

        Our first banking crises variable is the number of banking crises in each country covered in
Demirguc-Kunt et al. (2006) or Dell'Ariccia et al. (2008) after 1993. Dell'Ariccia et al. (2008) presume a

banking crises if one of the following happens: extensive depositor runs; an emergency measure (e.g.

bank holiday or nationalization); bank rescues costing 2% of GDP or more; or non-performing loans

rising to 10% or more of bank assets. These papers do not include the 2008 banking crisis, so we

construct an alternative measure banking crises + 2008 , which increases countries’ crises counts by one


                                                     11
where the IMF Global Financial Stability Report (April 2009) indicates that governments directly

intervened to rescue large financial institutions in 2008 or 2009. Unfortunately, data to replicate the

criteria used in previous papers are as yet unavailable, so we treat this variable with circumspection.



Economy Stability
A country’s banking system is a fundamental channel through which monetary variables affect its real

economy. Consequently, macroeconomic stability correlates with the health and governance of the

banking system. Banking systems that allocate capital less efficiently might be more vulnerable to
negative economic shocks, and curtail credit more sharply in response. This might magnify the effect of

economic shocks on the overall economy. We gauge macroeconomic volatility by growth volatility – the

standard deviation of log first differences in real per capita GDP for each country from the Penn World

Tables, averaged from 1993 through 2004.



3.4     Economy Performance Measures
A country’s economic performance is commonly measured by growth in per capita income, productivity,

or capital. These are important metrics, but economies can also be plausibly described as better-

performing if they provide more egalitarian incomes or opportunities. We therefore consider a

constellation of economic growth measures augmented by measures of equality indexes.



Economic Growth
Our first set of performance measures capture the pace of economic growth. As in Beck et al. (2000), we

use Penn World Tables data (1993-2004), which allow us to decompose income growth into productivity

growth and capital accumulation growth.
        Income growth is the arithmetic mean of log differences in per capita GDP for each country. This

is obtained by regressing each country’s log real per capita GDP on a constant and a time trend, and

taking the time trend as its income growth rate.

        TFP growth is the economy’s total factor productivity (TFP) growth rate: the growth rate in the

value of the outputs it can generate from inputs of a fixed value. To estimate this, we assume output in

each economy obeys the aggregate production function.


                                                     12
[3]      Yt = AK tα L1t−α ,


with Yt, Kt, and Lt designating its GDP, capital stock, and labor force, respectively at time t; and with the

capital share, α, assumed to be 30% for all countries (Beck et al. 2000). Using logarithms of first

differences in time, we estimate the rate of change in A for each country and interpret this as its TFP

growth rate.

         Capital accumulation is the rate at which the economy’s aggregate stock of capital assets grows

through time. To estimate this, we assume its real capital stock at time t, denoted Kt, is its previous year’s

capital stock adjusted for depreciation at a rate δ and for new capital investment, It. That is,



[4]       K t = (1 − δ ) K t −1 + I t


         We assume all capital to depreciate at seven percent per year, and assume 1964 capital stocks as

starting points (Beck et al. 2000). We then apply [4] recursively to generate subsequent years’ capital

stocks moving forward.



Economic Equality
Rapid economic growth whose benefits accrue to tiny elite might be less socially desirable than slower

growth whose fruits are more evenly distributed across the population. State or family-controlled banks

might distribute wealth more evenly than widely held banks if the bureaucrats or families place social

goals ahead of profits. Alternatively, either state or family-controlled banks might distribute wealth less

evenly if they favor firms controlled by cronies or relatives. Indeed, elite capture of a country’s banking

systems ought to concentrate wealth the hands of a well-connected elite, skewing its income distribution.

We therefore consider several measures of economic inequality.

         We gauge income inequality by a country’s average Gini coefficient from 1993 through 2003.5
Another measure of inequality is the concentration of economic power in the hands of a small oligarchy,

5
 This measures the deviation of the country’s income distribution from a uniform distribution, with a zero Gini
coefficient indicating a perfectly egalitarian income distribution, and larger coefficients indicating greater inequality
(Gini 1921).

                                                           13
as reflected in the fraction of the country’s top ten businesses or business groups controlled by old

moneyed families (Fogel 2006). “Old money” here is defined as second or subsequent generation wealth.

The top ten rankings are based on total employees, and are the largest domestically-controlled private-

sector businesses or business groups, including listed and unlisted firms. In regressions, we normalize

both the income inequality and oligarchy variables using a logistic transformation, as in [2].

        Broad access to options for improving one’s life is arguably at least as socially important as

equality of outcomes (Sen 1992). We are especially interested in equality of opportunity for small

entrepreneurs, for which we consider two sets of proxies.

        The first set gauges access to information, such as personal computers per thousand population

averaged from 1993 through 2003. Khanna (2008) and others argue that an information technology

revolution in the 1990s fundamentally changed China, India, and other developing economies by letting
their small entrepreneurs access information and markets previously unavailable to them.

        While the breadth of computer ownership is a defensible measure of this access; there are

alternatives. We thus use internet connections, telephone lines and car ownership per capita as robustness
checks. While we defend all these variables as proxies for equality of opportunity for small entrepreneurs,

we recognize that they also reflect the size and wealth of a country’s “middle class”, and thus can be

interpreted as measures of consumption equality, which is a valid alternative to income inequality
(Gordon & Dew-Becker 2007).

        Our second set of equality of opportunity measures gauges overt entry barriers blocking new

businesses. These variables are the number of bureaucratic procedures a start-up must complete to

operate legally, as well as the time (in business days) and cost (all identifiable official costs) required to

do this. Cost is expressed as a fraction of per capita GDP, and all three variables are for 1999 and from

Djankov et al. (2002).
        The owners of incumbent businesses are thought to erect entry barriers that protect them from

upstart rivals, and might control banks to constrict financing to rivals and potential rivals. If control over

the banking system complements other means of effecting economic entrenchment, we should see more
such hindrances where wealthy business elites control banking systems. However, we might also see

fewer such barriers if control of the banking system is sufficient to lock in the status quo, rendering other

entry barriers superfluous. Also, state control over banks may indicate general government activism, and


                                                     14
a heavier overall regulatory burden, so this variable might also correlate with the procedures, time and

cost of establishing a new company.



3.5     Control Variables
Our regressions use a collection of control variables to isolate the relationship of the banking system

control measures described in section 3.3 to the economy performance variables in section 3.4. This

section explains the purpose, construction, and sources of each control variable.

        Initial general development, gauged by the logarithm of the country’s per capita GDP in 1992,

appears in all of our regressions. In our growth regressions, initial general development controls for the

possibility that countries already at high standards of living have less scope for very high growth rates

than do poorer countries in the process of “catching up” (Solow 1956; Mankiw et al. 1992). Because
Barro (1997) argues for a nonlinear relationship between economic growth and initial GDP, we also

control for the square of the logarithm of the country’s per capita GDP in 1992. More generally, initial

economic development is also associated with higher quality institutions (North 1989, La Porta et al.

1999), which could limit the scope for capital misallocation by providing more effective checks on bank

mis-governance.

        Wurgler (2000) shows that financial development is an important determinant of capital
allocation efficiency. We control for a country's general financial development with measures of the sizes

of its equity and credit markets relative to its GDP, following King & Levine (1993), La Porta et al.

(1997), Rajan & Zingales (1998), and Wurgler (2000). Stock market size is the country’s total stock
market capitalization as a fraction of GDP, averaged across 1993 through 2003 to smooth out any cyclical

variations. Banking system size is the total bank credit outstanding as a fraction of GDP, likewise

averaged across 1993 through 2003. We control for stock market size because stock markets provide
alternatives to banks for firms seeking capital (Levine 2002). Consequently, a country with a large

efficient stock market might allocate capital efficiently regardless of what sort of banking system it has.

        In growth regressions we supplement the above variables with additional controls for human

capital (Barro & Lee 1996; Barro 2001), trade openness (Krueger 1998), and a sub-Saharan African

dummy (Barro 1991), which are also shown to be important for economic growth. In our robustness tests,




                                                     15
we also control for inflation, government size, black market premium, average number of coups, average

number of assassinations, and ethnic diversity individually and all together, as in Beck et al. (2000).



3.6     Persistence Issues
During crises, banks may be nationalized and then quickly privatized, making bank control data from a

period without major crises preferable for our purposes. We therefore follow Caprio et al. (2007) and

Laeven & Levin (2009) in using bank control data from 2001. These are the earliest available data with

reasonably wide coverage after the 1997 Asian Crisis was resolved.

        However, our dependent variables are generally estimated using data windows ending in 2003 or

2004 because UNIDO data, on which our investment efficiency measures are based, exist only through

2003, and the Penn World Tables end in 2004. This has two unfortunate consequences. First, we cannot
run lead and lag causality tests between bank control and economy performance. Second, our bank

control data do not precede the period in which we observe economy level performance. This timing

mismatch is important if the category of ultimate controlling shareholder changes frequently, but less so if

bank control is highly persistent.

        To check this, we scan BankScope data from 2001 through 2007 for bank control changes.

Although banks’ controlling shareholders and the sizes of their equity blocks both change during this
period, the category of controlling shareholder rarely changes; family-controlled banks tend to remain

family-controlled, state-controlled banks tend to remain state-controlled, and widely held banks tend to

remain widely held. Indeed, we identify only 14 banks (4.3% of the total 324) switching category from
2001 to 2007. Two family-controlled banks become state-controlled and four become widely held. Four

state-controlled banks become widely held. Two widely held banks become family-controlled and two

becomes state-controlled. Laeven & Levine (2009) perform a similar exercise, checking private banks for
controlling shareholder changes from 2001 to 2005, and reach at the same conclusion: banks’ ownership

categories are very stable through time.

        We are especially concerned about temporary bank nationalizations amid financial crises. For

example, Sweden nationalized many of its major banks in 1992, but promptly privatized them again, and

their controlling shareholders categories reverted to their pre-crisis values. One major financial crisis in

our sample period is the 1997 Asian crisis. Djankov et al. (2005) analyze the resolution of financial


                                                     16
distress after this crisis in the three most affected countries, Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand. In

these, only one Indonesian bank in our sample is nationalized. Our investigation of other East Asian,

Latin American, and East European countries’ banking systems also reveals no substantial changes in

country-level controlling shareholder categories.

        Another obvious problem could be bank control changes during privatization episodes. We have

data on 283 bank privatizations from Megginson (2004), and work backwards from 2001 to explore how

these affect our data. For example, Italy’s Banco Nazionale del Lavoro is labeled widely held in our data,

but was state-controlled until November 1998. This exercise reveals 16 changes in bank control between

1993 and 2001 in our sample. We return to this issue below by directly controlling for privatizations in

recalculating our bank control measures.

        These exercises suggest that country-level banking system control is likely to be highly persistent.
Although this validates our use of 2001 banking system control measures, it also prevents us from using

changes in banking system control for identification. We must therefore contend with endogeneity

problems, such as reverse causality or latent factors affecting both control over countries’ banking sectors
and their economies’ performance. We return to these issues below.



3.7     Descriptive Statistics
Table 3 summarizes the definitions and sources of all our main variables; and Table 2 presents simple

descriptive statistics for each.



        [Tables 2 and 3 about here]



4.      Empirical Findings
We examine the correlations between our indices of bank control and various measures of economic

performance – including banking system efficiency, economic growth rates, and macroeconomic stability

– as well as factors correlated with crony capitalism.



        [Table 4 about here]




                                                     17
4.1     Simple Correlations
Table 4 presents simple correlation coefficients of each main variable with all the others. Several patterns

emerge. First, the three bank control indexes sum to unity, so each should correlate negatively with the

other two – purely as an algebraic artifact. However, their relative magnitudes are informative

nonetheless. Family control is not significantly negatively correlated with state control, but widely held

banks are significantly (p < 0.01) rarer wherever either state or family control is more prevalent. Thus, the

primary difference across countries seems to be widely held banks on the one hand versus state or family-

controlled banks on the other.
        Second, capital allocation efficiency correlates negatively and significantly with state-control of

the banking system (1963-2003), as in Wurgler (2000). However, efficient capital allocation is positively

significantly correlated with widely held banks and negatively and significantly, if measured between

1993 and 2003, correlated with family-controlled banks.

        Third, more prevalent family-control over banks is associated with more non-performing loans,

more banking crises, slower economic growth, slower capital accumulation, and worse macroeconomic
volatility. In contrast, a more widely held banking system correlates with fewer non-performing loans,

fewer banking crises, faster capital accumulation, and less macroeconomic volatility. A more thoroughly

state-controlled banking system correlates only with more non-performing loans and slower capital
accumulation.



4.2     Main Regression Results
Figure 1 graphs capital allocation efficiency against the fractions of banks designated family-controlled,

state-controlled, and widely held. The figure shows clear general tendencies in the data, indicated by solid

lines; but surrounded by substantial scatter. This suggests other variables at work in the background. We

therefore turn to more formal multivariate tests to clarify the patterns in the data.



[Figure 1 about here]




                                                      18
Financial System Efficiency
Table 5 explores our first question: whether or not bank control correlates with capital allocation

efficiency. The first four columns show capital allocation efficiency, measured as in Wurgler (2000) and

across either 1993-2003 or 1963-2003, clearly correlated with control over banking systems. Countries

with more widely held banking systems allocate capital more efficiently. Countries that entrust their

banking systems to either families or the state exhibit less efficient capital allocation.



        [Tables 5 about here]



        The scatter evident in Figure 1 is considerably reduced by the control variables, for the regression

R2 statistics range from 33% to 61% – indicating that the variables in the regression now explain
substantial fractions, by the standards of cross-sectional regression analysis, of the variation in capital

allocation efficiency across countries.

        The next two columns in Table 5 regress nonperforming loans on the bank control measures. A

more widely held banking system is significantly correlated with fewer non-performing loans; while more

predominantly state or family-controlled banking systems both correlate with more nonperforming loans.

        Next we test the relationship between bank control and the number of banking crises the country
experienced after 1993. Banking crises are more common in countries whose banking systems are more

predominantly family-controlled (p=0.00). In contrast, widely held banks are negatively correlated with

the number of banking crises and state-controlled banks seem uncorrelated with the incidence of crises.

State-controlled banks could be enjoying the implicit guarantee of the state.

        However, when we include the 2008 crisis, the coefficient on family control becomes less

significant (p = 0.09) and that on widely held banks loses significance. Obviously, family control over
banks does not explain 2008 crisis, which began in the United States, whose banking system is

predominantly widely held, and spread to other countries with largely widely held banking systems, such

as the United Kingdom. However, this does not belie the strong correlation of family control with

previous crises.

        The final two columns of the table checks whether family control of banks correlates with the

stability of economic growth. The standard deviation of a country’s real per capita GDP growth rate is


                                                      19
positively associated with family control over banks (p = 0.01), indicating less stable economic growth

where family banks predominate.

        These results are also economically significant. One standard deviation increase in the fraction of

family-controlled banks corresponds to 25% (1993-2003) and 15% (1963-2003) decrease in capital

allocation efficiency, 25% more nonperforming loans, and 27% larger standard deviation of growth. For

comparison, a one standard deviation increase in the fraction of banks controlled by the state corresponds

to 26% decrease in capital allocation efficiency (1963-2003) and 27% more nonperforming loans. These

results survive a wide range of robustness checks, detailed below.

        In summary, Table 5 shows countries where family-controlled banks are more predominant to be

less efficient in allocating capital, to have banking systems with larger fractions of nonperforming loans,

and to have less stable economic growth. Although family bank control correlates strongly with more
financial crises prior to 2008, this correlation weakens if we extend the data to include the 2008 crisis.



Economic Growth
Since our banking system control measures correlate with capital allocation efficiency and banking

system efficiency, we expect them to correlate with economic growth as well. Table 6 therefore regresses

our economic growth measures – per capita income growth, TFP growth, and per capita capital

accumulation – on our country level bank control measures, revealing lower real per capita GDP growth

and TFP growth where banking systems are more family-controlled. The coefficient of family control in

explaining capital accumulation is negative, but insignificant. In contrast, capital accumulation correlates
negatively with state-controlled banks and positively with widely held banks.



        [Table 6 about here]



        These results are economically significant: a one standard deviation higher family control

corresponds to 53% lower real GDP per capita growth (the average growth rate in our sample is 1.92%).

They also survive a substantial battery of robustness checks, described below. In summary, Table 6 shows

slower economic growth in countries with more predominantly family-controlled banking systems.




                                                     20
4.3     Endogeneity and Identification
Tables 5 and 6 link family-controlled banking to, respectively, inefficient capital allocation and slow

unstable economic growth. However, since banking control is persistent and is, in any case, measured

contemporaneously to the outcome variables, the tables cannot resolve endogeneity. Family-controlled

banking might impede and destabilize growth; or slow unstable growth might favor family-controlled

banks; or a third latent factor might “cause” both.

        We employ instrumental variables regressions to mitigate endogeneity concerns. Because bank

control is persistent, we employ deep historical instruments: the origin of each country’s legal system; the
fraction of its population adhering to each major religion, and its latitude.

        Countries whose legal systems derive from the Common Law seem more able to sustain large

financial systems than are countries whose legal systems derive from the Napoleonic Code; with systems

derived from the German Civil Code and Scandinavian codifications occupying the middle ground (La

Porta et al. 1997, 1998; Levine et al. 2000). Legal systems have deep historical roots – the spread of the

Common Law, Napoleonic Code, and German Civil Code predates the widespread rise of dispersed
ownership; and the Scandinavian codifications, though more recent, reflect similarly deep-rooted legal

traditions. Non-Western countries generally either inherited their colonial legal systems or adopted a

Western legal system before developing large stock markets (La Porta et al. 2008). Legal origin is
therefore defensible as an instrument in that it is “predetermined” (Beck et al. 2000). Our four legal origin

indicators are one for each of a Common Law, Napoleonic Code, German Civil Code, or Scandinavian

legal origin, respectively; and zero otherwise.
        Stulz & Williamson (2003) show that religion explains substantial cross-country variation in

creditor rights, and attribute this to different religions’ differing views on debt and interest. Although

whole countries abruptly switched religions in the distant past, current changes are relatively slow. The

religion variables are therefore also defensible as instrument candidates, in that they are mostly

“predetermined”.

        Hall & Jones (1999) argue that latitude is correlated with Western influence, which they argue

leads to institutions amenable to economic development. Acemoglu et al. (2001) support the validity of

this instrument by showing it has no effect on economic performance, save via measures of institutional

development. While Western countries’ latitudes are clearly exogenous, where they established,


                                                      21
conquered, or defended colonies reflects their governments’ decisions. However, those decisions were

taken in the distant past, making latitude – defined as the distance of a country’s geographic center from

the equator in degrees – a plausible instrumental variable.



        [Table 7 about here]



        A valid instrument must be highly correlated with banking system control, and uncorrelated with

the residuals in the correctly specified second stage regressions. Table 7 Panel A1 shows widely held

banking systems to be markedly rare in French Civil Code countries, whose banking systems are on

average 41% family-controlled. Widely held banks constitute 70 percent of the typical Protestant

country’s banking system, but total only five percent in the typical Muslim country. Countries in the
highest quartile of absolute latitudes have the highest mean fraction of widely held banks (83%) and the

lowest mean fractions of family-controlled and government-controlled banks. These differences suggest

that our instruments’ likely relevance to bank control. Panel A2 shows likelihood ratios of the first stage
Tobit regressions using these variables as instruments for our bank control measures to have p values

sufficiently low to refute concerns about weak instruments.6

        Valid instruments must also be uncorrelated with the true residuals of the correctly specified
second stage regressions. These are unobservable; however, assuming the observed residuals represent the

true residuals allows approximations of these tests. For example, using the residuals of the second stage

regression of capital allocation efficiency (estimated over the long window) on family and state-

controlled banking system fractions yields a Hansen’s J statistics of 2.29 (p = 0.69), consistent with

exogeneity. If the dependent variable is income growth, the Hansen’s J statistics is 4.12 (p = 0.39). In

every case, these tests fail to reject exogeneity of the instruments.

        We therefore take the predicted values from the Tobit regressions in panel A2 as first stage

estimates of exogenous components of our banking system control measures. Panels B and C then rerun

the regressions in Tables 5 and 6, but using these estimated exogenous components of our banking control

measures, rather than the measures themselves.


6
 In specifications with only one endogenous variable (independent banks), we can directly utilize Stock & Yogo
(2004) critical p-values for weak instruments. All our instruments pass this test.

                                                       22
        The second stage coefficients of the bank control measures resemble those in Tables 5 and 6.

Family control again correlates significantly with less efficient capital allocation, more nonperforming

loans, slower economic growth, more volatile economic growth, and more banking crises. Widely held

banking systems correlate with more efficient capital allocation (using the longer estimation window,

though not using the shorter one), fewer nonperforming loans, faster economic growth, less volatile

economic growth, and fewer banking crises (though not if we include the 2008 crises). State control over

banks correlates only with more nonperforming loans and growth rate volatility.

        Obviously, instrumental variables cannot completely preclude reverse causality or missing latent

variable effects. However we conclude that our findings are at least consistent with causation running

from bank control measures to economy level variables, as discussed above.



4.4     Robustness
Our main results (Tables 5 and 6) pass a wide battery of robustness checks, in that alternative approaches

to estimation generate qualitatively similar results, by which we mean the banking system control
measures attract the same patterns of signs and significance as in the tables. Where this is not so, we

describe how the robustness checks’ results differ from those shown in the tables. The relationships

between bank control measures and our banking crises count that includes 2008 is only marginally

significant in the tables, so we do not consider it in the robustness tests.

        Our results are unlikely to be driven by outliers. We check this using an iterative reweighted least

squares algorithm that successively deemphasizes observations farther from the trend line until

converging. The algorithm does not converge for regressions explaining the number of bank crises, and so

cannot be applied to these. In all other cases, it converges. This exercise leads to a much stronger negative

correlation of family control with capital accumulation (p = 0.02); and also renders more state-controlled

banking significantly correlated with higher growth rate volatility. Widely held banking systems are

revealed dampening growth rate volatility and improving capital accumulation. In all other regressions,

controlling for outliers in this way yields qualitatively similar results.

        Our economy performance variables end in 2003-2004. Our next set of robustness checks

ascertains that our findings are robust to extending this time window. Since the Penn World Tables and

UNIDO data are made available with a lag of several years, we cannot extend our TFP growth rates,

capital accumulation rates, or Wurgler’s elasticity to windows after our bank control data. However, using

estimation endpoints different from those used in the tables generates qualitatively similar results

throughout. Data for per capita GDP growth and volatility, and for nonperforming loans, are available

through 2007 in the WDI database. We therefore reconstruct these variables using windows from 1993 to

2007, a window extending our data up to six years after our bank control cross section. Outlier robust

regressions yield qualitatively similar results to those shown.

        We measure banking system control as of 2001. Above, we showed that the banking control

measures are highly persistent between 2001 and 2007 (by checking for all changes in bank control) and

before 2001 (by using bank privatization data to work backwards from 2001). However, we can do more

with our privatization data from Megginson (2004), which indicates that 16 banks in our sample are

privatized: 6 become family-controlled and 10 become widely held. In the tables, we count these banks
using their 2001 (post-privatization) control categories. An alternative approach is to calculate a duration-

weighted measure of banking system control for 1993 through 2003. If a bank is state-controlled for the

five years from 1993 to 1998, and then sold to a family, which controls it through 2003, we say it is 50%
state-controlled and 50% family-controlled when tallying up our country-level bank control measures.

This exercise generates qualitatively similar results to those shown, save that widely held banking

systems are now positively correlated with growth, negatively correlated with growth rate volatility, and
insignificant in explaining the efficiency of capital allocation in the shorter window.

        We follow La Porta et al. (1999) and Caprio et al. (2007) in presuming the largest equity voting

block of 10% or more to confer control. Increasing this to 20%, and recalculating our bank control

measures generates qualitatively similar results to those shown.

        Another alternative construction of our bank control measures would use different weights. We

calculate country-level bank control measures weighting banks by total net credit. Credit issued is a
plausible gauge of the importance of a bank as a capital allocator; but others are possible. We therefore

reweight banks by total assets and reconstruct our bank control measures. This generates qualitatively

similar results to those shown, save that widely held banking systems now correlate negatively with
growth volatility and lose significance in explaining capital allocation efficiency in the shorter window.

        We posit above that entrusting the governance of the banking system to wealthy business families

might impede efficient capital allocation because those families might divert capital to their own firms


                                                     24
and away from upstarts and competitors. These problems could arise even if the families that control the

banks do not control other firms, for Faccio (2006) and others reveal numerous connections between

wealthy families. However, they may well be more serious where the families that control banks also

control large nonfinancial corporations. The Orbis dataset identifies other companies owned by our

banking families. We augment this with an extensive online media search using family names and bank

names to verify matches in Orbis and identify other firms controlled by our banking families. This

admittedly crude approach probably underestimates the non-financial interests of these families, but

nonetheless confirms that 90% of the families that control banks in our data also control other firms. We

use this information to recalculate our bank control measures assuming banks controlled by families with

no other firms are equivalent to widely held banks. Under this definition, 100% of Mexican banks become

widely held – a call many students of the Mexican economy might find low. Rerunning our regressions
yields qualitatively similar results.

        The statistical tests in all our regressions employ heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.

Using standard OLS regression t-tests generates qualitatively similar results; except for the capital
allocation efficiency measure based on 1993 to 2003 data.

        Our capital allocation efficiency measures, Wurgler’s (2000) elasticities, are estimated, not

observed. We therefore rerun regressions using these variables weighting observations by the inverses of
the standard errors of our elasticity estimates. These weighted least squares regressions generate

qualitatively similar results to those in the tables.

        We can obtain data for only a few banks in some countries. If these have only a few banks, this is

not necessarily a problem; but if we are missing data for these countries, their banking control measures

may be estimated less precisely. We therefore repeat our tests after dropping the countries represented in

our data by fewer than three banks: Finland, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. This exercise renders widely held
banking systems positively correlated with income growth and state-controlled banking negatively

correlated with capital accumulation; and leaves all our bank control measures insignificant in explaining

capital allocation efficiency in the shorter window, though the coefficient magnitudes are roughly
preserved.

        Table 6 controls for initial banking system size, stock market size, per capita GDP, per capita

GDP squared, mean years of schooling, trade openness, and adds a Sub-Saharan Africa dummy. These


                                                        25
control variables are commonly used in the economic growth literature; but others are sometimes added.

We therefore repeat the income growth regressions of Table 6 including other controls used in Beck et al.

(2000) mean inflation rates, government as a fraction of GDP, the black market exchange rate premium,

the number of coups, the number of assassinations, and ethnic diversity, individually and all together.

Qualitatively similar results ensue; family control is always negatively significantly associated with

growth.

          Table 5 shows that including the 2008 financial crisis in our crisis counts greatly weakens the

correlations of family control with instability and widely held banks with stability. Banking crises are rare

events, so further checking the broader generality of our findings requires extending our time period back

in time. We do this by counting all the crises covered in Demirguc-Kunt et al. (2006) plus Dell'Ariccia et

al. (2008), rather than just those dated after 1993. This extends our window back to 1980. We perform
this robustness check both with and without 2008 crises added to the total counts. Both generate

qualitatively similar results: family bank control is highly significant in explaining the number of banking

crises. For instance, when the 2008 crises is included, family bank control has a coefficient of 1.03 (p =
0.02). Many factors contribute to financial crises (Allen & Gale 2007); however, this evidence supports

bank control being numbered among them (Saunders et al. 1990; Laeven & Levine 2009), at least in some

time periods and some countries.



4.4       Efficiency versus Equality
Our findings above are consistent with family control over banks impairing financial system efficiency
and thereby both slowing and destabilizing economic growth. This aligns with arguments that economies

are subject to economic entrenchment, sometimes called crony capitalism, wherein incumbent business

leaders erect barriers to entry that lock in the advantageous (to them) status quo to the determinant of their

countries (Murphy et al. 1991, 1993; Shleifer & Vishny 1998b). Our findings also align with the thesis of

Rajan & Zingales (2004) and its supporting country case studies (Haber et al. 2003; La Porta et al. 2003),

that this entrenchment can be effected by elite capture of countries’ financial systems.
          But other explanations of our findings must also be considered. For example, family-controlled

banks might simply be less competent capital allocators. Or, family-controlled banks might elevate social

goals, such as equality, above economic efficiency, consistent with the solidarity, or social capital


                                                     26
strengthening, advantages attributed to family businesses by e.g. Lester & Cannella (2006). However,

both of these seem implausible given that Caprio et al. (2007) find higher valuations for banks with

controlling shareholders.

        We apply Ockham’s razor by testing for links between family-controlled banking systems and

economy characteristics correlated with crony capitalism. First, crony capitalism is associated with

extreme inequality. If family bank control abets crony capitalism, it should therefore correlate negatively

with measures of equality. Crony capitalism is also associated with high barriers to entry. Thus, if control

of the banking system alone is insufficient to achieve crony capitalism, family bank control should be

positively correlated with barriers to entry. Family bank incompetence, in contrast, has no clear prediction

regarding these variables; and the solidarity explanation would presumably imply greater income equality

and equality of opportunity.



[Table 8 about here]



        The first two columns of Table 8, employing countries’ Gini coefficients, reveal significantly less

egalitarian income distributions in countries whose banking systems are more extensively controlled by

families. In contrast, state-controlled banking systems significantly correlate with more egalitarianism in
income distributions, as do widely held banking systems.

        The next two columns gauge economic inequality by the economic importance of each country’s

greatest business families, as assessed by Fogel (2006). Family-controlled business empires are more

important in countries whose banking systems are more extensively controlled by families.

        The remaining columns use various measures of equality of opportunity. Family control over

banks correlates negatively with PCs per thousand people, a measure of the breadth of access to new
economy employment and market opportunities. Alternative measures – car ownership, internet

connections, and telephone lines per capita – generate qualitatively similar results (not reported). Family-

controlled banks correlate with fewer, not more opportunities. Since these measures also likely correlate
with middle class purchasing power, they also reinforce our finding, based on Gini coefficients, that

family-controlled banking correlates with worse income inequality.




                                                    27
        The last six columns relate banking system control to measures of barriers to entry directly due to

government bureaucratic procedures. All three measures – the number of procedures, time and cost

required to set up a new company legally – correlate positively with family-controlled banking and

negatively with widely held banking systems. In contrast, state control over banks is insignificant, except

for correlating with a higher cost of setting up a new firm.

        These findings survive the battery of robustness checks enumerated in the previous section. All

the robustness checks used above generate qualitatively similar results to those shown in the table with

the following exceptions. If we restrict “family control” to mean control by tycoons or families who also

control other firms, family control remains significant except in regressions of the cost of starting a new

business and regressions controlling for privatizations of the number of procedures, the time required to

start a new business, and our oligarchy measure. However, if we use the instrumental variables in Table 7
to estimate the exogenous component this modified family banking control measure, it reasserts

significance throughout, save in regressions of the oligarchy measure.

        Family control correlates positively with inequality, regardless of which dimension of inequality
we measure. Of course, correlations do not resolve causation; however correlations with third variables

relevant to one causal explanation and not others can further sharpen Ockham’s razor. We interpret these

findings as reinforcing the plausibility of family control over banking systems reflecting crony capitalism.



5.      Conclusions
Banks are vital intermediaries allocating capital in an economy; and in many economies, banks are the
only intermediaries available. Who controls the banks therefore matters. Controlling for capital market

development and initial GDP per capita, we find that national banking systems controlled more

predominantly by tycoons and families correlate with worse economy-level outcomes: less efficient

capital allocation, more nonperforming loans, more frequent bank crises, greater macro volatility, and

slower income and productivity growth rates. Of course, our results imply neither that all controlling

tycoons and families are entrenched nor that their control has these associations in all time periods and all
financial crises.

        Recent work links crony capitalism, and the slow growth it entails, to elite capture of countries

financial systems (Morck, Stangeland & Yeung 2000, Rajan & Zingales 2003, Morck, Wolfenzon &


                                                     28
Yeung 2005, Acemoglu, Johnson & Robinson 2001, 2005). Rajan & Zingales 2003 posit a detailed

mechanism for this, whereby an initial cadre of entrepreneurs (or their heirs), made rich by their country’s

newly developed financial system, actively reverse that development to lock in their dominance by

starving entrants of capital. Since banks provide essential capital for new and small firms across countries

(Beck et al. 2008), control over the banking system is an obvious place to look for this effect. Consistent

with these arguments, we find family control over banks correlated with traditional signs of crony

capitalism, such as high inequality and barriers to entry.

Panel A. Bank control
Family          Total 2001 credit-weighted fraction of listed and unlisted banks controlled by an individual or
                family. Control is imputed to the largest blockholder whose voting control, direct and indirect,
                sums to at least 10% for 2001 or the nearest year with data. Indirect control is inferred using the
                “weakest link” method, as in La Porta et al. (1999). Sources: Caprio et al. (2007), BankScope.
State            Total credit-weighted fraction of banks controlled by state organs. Constructed analogously to
                 Family.
Widely held      Total credit-weighted fraction of banks with no controlling shareholder. Constructed analogously to
                 Family.

Panel B. Financial system efficiency
Capital         The efficiency of capital allocation is the estimated elasticity of manufacturing investment to value
allocation      added, estimated as in Wurgler (2000). Note: Two versions of this variable are used, one using all
efficiency      available data and the other using data for 1993 through 2003 only.

Panel C. Economic Growth
Income         Real per capita GDP growth is the coefficient in an OLS regression of log real per capita GDP time
growth         trend and intercept as in Beck et al. (2000). Data are for 1993 through 2003, and are from Penn
               World Tables.
TFP growth       Each country’s total factor productivity (TFP) growth is A in the production function Y = A Kα L1-α,
                 with Y, K, and L the country’s GDP, capital stock, and labor force, respectively; and with capital
                 share α = 0.03 as in Beck et al. (2000). Data are for 1993 through 2003, and are from Penn World
                 Tables.
Capital          Average growth rate in capital stock from 1993 to 2003, assuming 1964 capital stocks are in steady
accumulation     state and using aggregate real investment and 7% depreciation recursively to generate capital stock
                 estimates going forward, as in Beck et al. (2000). Data are from World Penn Tables.

Panel D. Crony Capitalism
Income         Average Gini coefficients measure the deviation of income distribution from uniformity (Gini
inequality     1912), from 1993 through 2003, where data are available. Otherwise it is the average across
               available data. Data are unavailable for most countries after 2001. In regressions and correlations,
               this variable is log normalized by the formula: normalized [x] = ln [x/(1-x)]. Source: WDI.
Oligarchy        Fraction of the top ten largest (according to number of employees) non-financial private-sector
                 domestically-controlled freestanding businesses or business groups, including listed and unlisted
                 firms, controlled by business failies in 1996. In regressions and correlations, this variable is log

The first 6 and final 2 columns show cross-country OLS regressions with robust standard errors. In the next two columns the coefficients are from negative binomial regressions
with robust standard errors. Next two columns are from Poisson regression because the negative binomial does not converge. Dependent variables are in columns and independent
variables are in rows. Variables are as defined in Table 3. P values are in parentheses.

                                   Instrumental Variable Regressions
Panel A1 summarizes the control structure of banks by a country’s legal origin, largest religion and capital
city latitude. Numbers reported are fractions of top ten banks classified as widely held, family, or state-
controlled. Religion dummies are one for the most commonly practiced in that country and zero for all
others. Latitude dummies represent membership in latitude absolute value quartiles, with one designating
lowest latitudes. Panel A2 reports LR statistics first stage Tobit regressions (censored at 0 and 1) predicting
bank control proportions, one LR for each set of control variables used. Panels B and C replicate Tables 5
and 6 respectively, but as second-stage regressions using the first-stage estimated bank control proportions.
Numbers in parentheses are p-levels. Variables are as defined in Table 3.
