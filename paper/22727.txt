Research in international trade has changed dramatically over the last twenty years, as attention
has shifted from countries and industries towards the firms actually engaged in international
trade. The now-standard heterogeneous firm model posits measure zero firms that compete under
monopolistic competition and decide whether to export to foreign markets. However, much of
international trade is dominated by a few “global firms,” which participate in the international
economy along multiple margins and account for substantial shares of aggregate trade. We
develop a new theoretical framework that allows firms to have large market shares and to decide
simultaneously on the set of production locations, export markets, input sources, products to
export, and inputs to import. Using U.S. firm and trade transactions data, we provide strong
evidence in support of this framework's main predictions of interdependencies and
complementarities between these margins of firm international participation. Global firms
participate more intensively along each margin, magnifying the impact of underlying differences
in firm characteristics, and increasing their shares of aggregate trade.

1    Introduction

Research in international trade has changed dramatically over the last twenty years, as attention has shifted
from countries and industries towards firms. An initial wave of empirical research established a series
of stylized facts: only some firms export, exporters are more productive than non-exporters, and trade
liberalization is accompanied by an increase in aggregate industry productivity. Subsequent theoretical
research emphasized reallocations of resources within and across firms as well as endogenous changes
in firm productivity in a setting in which measure zero firms compete under monopolistic competition
and self-select into export markets (e.g., Melitz (2003)). This new theoretical research generated additional
empirical predictions, which in turn led to a further wave of empirical research and an ongoing dialogue
between theory and evidence.1
    In this paper, we argue that this standard paradigm does not go far enough in recognizing the role
of “global firms,” which we define as firms that participate in the international economy along multiple
margins and account for substantial shares of aggregate trade. We develop a new theoretical framework
that incorporates a wider range of margins of participation in the international economy than previous
research. Each firm can choose production locations in which to operate plants; export markets for each
plant; products to export from each plant to each market; exports of each product from each plant to
each market; the countries from which to source intermediate inputs for each plant; and imports of each
intermediate input from each source country by each plant. Firms that participate so extensively in the
international economy are unlikely to be measure zero and indeed account for substantial shares of ob-
served trade. Therefore we allow these global firms to internalize the effects of their pricing and product
introduction decisions on market aggregates. Despite allowing for such effects on market aggregates and
incorporating a rich range of firm decision margins, our model remains tractable and amenable to em-
pirical analysis. The key contribution of this review relative to our previous surveys (cited in footnote 1)
is that we use this new theoretical framework to derive four sets of key predictions on which we present
empirical evidence. Some of this evidence updates previous findings for earlier years, in which case we use
our framework to draw out new insights and highlight changes over time. Other evidence is distinctive to
this review and relates directly to the predictions of our new theoretical framework.
    Our empirical work is organized around the following four sets of theoretical predictions. First, firm
decisions for each margin of participation in the international economy are interdependent. For example,
importing decisions are interdependent across countries, because the decision to incur the fixed costs
of sourcing inputs from one country gives the firm access to lower-cost suppliers, which reduces firm
production costs and prices. These lower prices in turn imply a larger scale of operation, which makes
it more likely that the firm will find it profitable to incur the fixed costs of sourcing inputs from other
    1 For earlier surveys of this theoretical and empirical literature, see Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007), Bernard,

Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2012), Melitz and Trefler (2015), Melitz and Redding (2014a) and Redding (2011). For broader surveys
of firm organization and trade, see Antràs (2015), Antràs and Rossi-Hansberg (2009) and Helpman (2006).



                                                               1

countries (as in Tintelnot (2016) and Antràs, Fort, and Tintelnot (2014)). Exporting and importing decisions
are also interdependent with one another, because incurring the fixed exporting cost for an additional
market increases firm revenue, which makes it more likely that the firm will find it profitable to incur the
fixed cost of sourcing inputs from any given country. This interaction between exporting and importing
in turn implies that exporting decisions are interdependent across countries. Incurring the fixed exporting
cost for an additional market increases firm revenue, which makes it more likely that the firm will find it
profitable to incur the fixed cost of importing inputs from another country. This in turn reduces variable
production costs and prices, and thereby increases revenue. which makes it more likely that the firm will
find it profitable to incur the fixed exporting cost for another market. More generally, the choices of the
set of markets to serve, the set of products to export, and the set of countries from which to source inputs
(the “extensive margins”) affect variable production costs and prices, which implies that they influence
exports of each product to each market and imports of each input from each source country (the “intensive
margins”). In a world of such interdependent firm decisions, understanding the effects of a reduction in
trade costs on any one margin (e.g. exports of a given product to a given country) requires taking into
account its effects on all other margins (through the organization of global production chains that involve
imports as well as exports).
   Second, firm decisions along multiple margins of international participation magnify the effects of
differences in exogenous primitives (e.g. exogenous components of firm productivity) on endogenous
outcomes (e.g. firm sales and employment). More productive firms participate more intensively in the
world economy along each margin. Therefore small differences in firm productivity can have magnified
consequences for firm sales and employment, as more productive firms lower their production costs by
sourcing inputs from more countries, and also expand their scale of operation by exporting more products
to each market and exporting to more markets. Similarly, small changes in exogenous trade costs can have
magnified effects on endogenous trade flows, as they induce firms to serve more markets, export more
products to each market, export more of each product, source intermediate inputs from more countries,
and import more of each intermediate input from each source country.
   Third, firms that participate so intensively in the international economy are unlikely to be measure
zero, and hence their choices can affect market aggregates, which gives rise to strategic market power.
Firms with larger market shares have greater effects on market aggregates, and hence they face lower
perceived elasticities of demand, which implies that they charge lower markups of price over marginal
cost. This mechanism for variable markups operates across a range of different functional forms for de-
mand, including constant elasticity of substitution (CES) preferences. These variable markups provide a
natural explanation for empirical findings of “pricing to market,” where firms charge different prices in
different markets. Such price differences arise because firm markups vary endogenously across markets,
depending on firm sales shares within each market. Variable markups provide a natural rationalization
for empirical evidence of “incomplete pass-through,” whereby cost shocks are not passed through fully


                                                     2

into consumer prices. The reason is that as cost shocks are transmitted to prices, they result in endoge-
nous adjustments in sales shares, which lead to offsetting changes in firm markups. In addition to this
strategic market power, when firms participate in international markets by exporting multiple products,
they internalize the cannibalization effects from the introduction of new products on the sales of existing
products. Hence multi-product firms make systematically different product introduction decisions from
single-product firms.
    Fourth, the magnification of exogenous differences across firms through multiple, interdependent and
complementary margins of international participation implies that aggregate trade is concentrated in the
hands of a relatively small number of firms. Therefore our framework offers new insights for under-
standing the skewed distribution of sales across firms that has been the subject of much attention in the
industrial organization literature (e.g. Sutton (1997) and Axtell (2001)). To infer the underlying distribution
of firm productivity from the observed distribution of firm sales requires taking into account the multiple,
interdependent and complementary firm decisions (such as to enter export markets, supply products and
source intermediate inputs) that affect firm sales.
    Our paper is related to the influential line of research that has modeled firm heterogeneity in differenti-
ated product markets following Melitz (2003).2 In this model, a competitive fringe of potential firms decide
whether to enter an industry by paying a fixed entry cost which is thereafter sunk. Potential entrants face
ex ante uncertainty concerning their productivity. Once the sunk entry cost is paid, a firm draws its pro-
ductivity from a fixed distribution and productivity remains fixed thereafter. Firms produce horizontally
differentiated varieties within the industry under conditions of monopolistic competition.3 The existence
of fixed production costs implies that a firm drawing a productivity below the “zero-profit productivity
cutoff” would make negative profits from producing and hence chooses instead to exit the industry. Fixed
and variable costs of exporting ensure that only those active firms that draw a productivity above a higher
“export productivity cutoff” find it profitable to export.4 Following multilateral trade liberalization, high-
productivity exporting firms experience increased revenue through greater export market sales; the most
productive non-exporters now find it profitable to enter export markets, increasing the fraction of export-
ing firms; the least productive firms exit; and there is a contraction in the revenue of surviving firms that
only serve the domestic market. Each of these responses reallocates resources towards high-productivity
firms and raises aggregate productivity through a change in industry composition.5
    Our contribution relative to this theoretical research is to develop a framework that incorporates a

   3 For  alternative approaches to firm heterogeneity, see Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum (2003) and Yeaple (2005).
    4 While the original model focuses on exporting, this framework is extended to incorporate foreign direct investment (FDI) as

an alternative mode for servicing foreign markets in Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004).
    5 While firm productivity is fixed in the Melitz (2003) model, subsequent research has incorporated endogenous decisions that

affect firm productivity through a variety of mechanisms, including technology adoption (Constantini and Melitz (2008), Bustos
(2011) and Lileeva and Trefler (2010)), innovation (Atkeson and Burstein (2010), Perla, Tonetti, and Waugh (2015) and Sampson
(2015)), endogenous changes in workforce composition (Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010) and Helpman, Itskhoki, Muendler,
and Redding (2016)) and endogenous changes in product mix (Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010, 2011)).



                                                               3

wider range of firm margins of international participation than in prior research. Each firm chooses the
set of export market to serve (as in Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2011)) and the set of products to supply to
each export market (as in Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010, 2011) and Hottman, Redding, and Weinstein
(2016)).6 Each firm also chooses the set of countries from which to source intermediate inputs and which
inputs to import from each source country (as in Antràs, Fort, and Tintelnot (2014) and Bernard, Moxnes,
and Saito (2014)).7 We provide the first framework that simultaneously encompasses all of these margins
of international participation and we show how this framework can be used to make sense of a number
of features of U.S. firm and trade transactions data. As firms that participate in the international economy
along all of these margins can account for large shares of sales in individual markets, we allow firms
to internalize their effects on market aggregates then choosing prices, as in Atkeson and Burstein (2008),
Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012), Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2012), Gaubert and Itskhoki (2015), Hottman,
Redding, and Weinstein (2016), and Sutton and Trefler (2016).8
    Our research is also related to the large empirical literature that has examined the relationship between
firm performance and participation in international markets following Bernard and Jensen (1995). Early
empirical studies in this literature used firm and plant-level data to document a number of stylized facts
about exporters and non-exporters. In particular, exporters are larger, more productive, more capital-
intensive, more skill-intensive and pay higher wages than non-exporters within the same industry (see
Bernard and Jensen (1995, 1999)). Subsequent empirical research has used international trade transactions
data to establish additional regularities about firm trade participation following Bernard, Jensen, and Schott
(2009). Much of the variation in aggregate bilateral trade flows is accounted for by the extensive margins
of the number of exporting firms (see Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2004)) and the number of firm-product
observations with positive trade (see Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2009)). While the extensive
margins of export firms and products are sharply decreasing in proxies for bilateral trade costs such as
distance, the intensive margin of average exports per firm-product observation with positive trade exhibits
little relationship with these proxies because of changes in export composition (see Bernard, Redding,
and Schott (2011)). We show how our theoretical framework accounts for these properties of firm export
behavior and for a broader range of features of firm participation in the global economy.
    Within this empirical literature on export participation, our paper is related to several studies that have
focused on the largest firms in the international economy. Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009) documents
the concentration of activity in the largest exporting and importing firms for the U.S. and argues that the

and Neary (2010), Feenstra and Ma (2008), Mayer, Melitz, and Ottaviano (2013) and Nocke and Yeaple (2014).
    7 Firm importing is also examined in Amiti and Konings (2007), Amiti and Davis (2011), Blaum, Lelarge, and Peters (2013,

2014), Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik, and Topalova (2010), De Loecker, Goldberg, Khandelwal, and Pavcnik (2015) and Halpern,
Koren, and Szeidl (2015).
    8 A related body of research examines the idea that firms can be “granular,” in the sense that idiosyncratic shocks to individual

firms can influence aggregate business cycle fluctuations, as in Gabaix (2011) and di Giovanni, Levchenko, and Mejean (2014).

Shimomura (2012).



                                                                 4

“most globally engaged” firms are more likely to trade with difficult markets and perform foreign direct
investment. Mayer and Ottaviano (2007) establishes a set of regularities for European firms and finds that
the export distribution is highly skewed. Freund and Pierola (2015) examines “export superstars” and finds
that very large firms shape country export patterns. Among 32 countries, the top firm on average accounts
for 14% of a country’s total (non-oil) exports; the top five firms make up 30%; and the revealed comparative
advantage of countries can be created by a single firm.
    Although our theoretical framework incorporates a wider range of margins of international partici-
pation than in previous research, it is necessarily an abstraction and cannot capture all features of firms’
business strategies. In particular, we do not model the formation of individual trading relationships be-
tween buyers and sellers, as in the recent literature on networks in international trade, including Bernard,
Moxnes, and Saito (2014), Bernard, Moxnes, and Ulltveit-Moe (2015), Chaney (2014, 2015), Eaton, Kortum,
Kramarz, and Sampognaro (2014), Eaton, Jinkins, Tybout, and Xu (2016) and Lim (2016). We also abstract
from “carry along trade,” in which a firm exports products that it does not produce, as examined in Bernard,
Blanchard, Beveren, and Vandenbusshe (2015). Our theoretical framework incorporates multinational ac-
tivity to rationalize the trade between related parties that we observe in the U.S. trade transactions data.
Our paper is therefore related to the large literature on multinational firms, including Arkolakis, Ramondo,
Rodriguez-Clare, and Yeaple (2015), Becker and Muendler (2010), Cravino and Levchenko (2015), Hanson,
Mataloni, and Slaughter (2005), Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004), Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare (2013),
as reviewed in Antràs and Yeaple (2009). However, as discussed further below, a caveat is that we do not
have data on the overseas production activity of multinational firms, and we only observe related-party
trade when one party to the transaction is located in the United States.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops our theoretical framework. Sec-
tion 3 introduces the data. Section 4 provides empirical evidence on the key predictions of our theoretical
framework. Section 5 concludes.


2    Theoretical Framework

We consider a world of many (potentially) asymmetric countries. Firms are heterogeneous in productiv-
ity and make three sets of decisions: which markets to serve (typically indexed by m), which countries
in produce in (usually denoted by i), and which countries to source inputs from (generally indicated by
j). For each destination market, firms choose the range of products to supply to that market (ordinarily
referenced by k). For each source country, firms choose the range of intermediate inputs to obtain from
that source (most often represented by `). We assume that consumer preferences exhibit a constant elas-
ticity of substitution (CES). However, we allow firms to be large relative to the markets in which they sell
their products, which introduces variable markups (because each firm internalizes the effect of its pricing
choices on market aggregates). We use the firm’s profit maximization problem to derive general proper-
ties of a firm’s decisions to participate in international markets as a function of its productivity that hold

regardless of the way in which the model is closed in general equilibrium.

is the set of products supplied by firm f to market m from production country i.
      There are a few features of this specification worth noting. First, we allow firms to be large relative
to sectors (and hence internalize their effects on the price index for the sector). However, we assume that
each firm is of measure zero relative to the economy as a whole (and hence takes aggregate expenditure Em
and wages wm as given). Second, the assumption that the upper-level of utility is Cobb-Douglas implies
   9 For expositional clarity, we use the superscripts G, F and K to denote sector, firm and product-level variables. We use the

subscripts m, i and j to index the values of variables for individual markets, production countries and source countries respectively.
We use the subscripts g, f and k to index the values of variables for individual sectors, firms and products respectively.
  10 Much of the existing empirical literature in international trade and industrial organization refers to any shifter of demand

conditional on price (such as λmi F ) as “quality,” as in Shaked and Sutton (1983); Berry (1994); Schott (2004); Khandelwal (2010);
                                    f
Broda and Weinstein (2010); Hallak and Schott (2011); Manova and Zhang (2012); and Feenstra and Romalis (2014). But this
demand shifter can also capture more subjective differences in taste, as discussed in Di Comite, Thisse, and Vandenbussche (2014).
We use the term “appeal” to avoid taking a stand as to whether the shift in demand arises from vertical quality differentiation or
subjective differences in consumer taste.


                                                                                6

that no firm has an incentive to try to manipulate prices in one sector to influence behavior in another
sector. The reason is that each firm is assumed to be small relative to the aggregate economy (and hence
cannot affect aggregate expenditure) and sector expenditure shares are determined by the Cobb-Douglas
            G alone. Therefore the firm problem becomes separable by sector, which implies that the
parameters λmg
divisions of a firm that operate in multiple sectors can be treated as if they were separate firms. The firm’s
overall size, performance and participation in international markets is determined by the aggregation of
its decisions across all of the sectors in which it is active. When we present our empirical results below,
we report both results for the firm as a whole and for the firm’s separate activities for each sector and
product. To simplify the exposition throughout the rest of this theoretical section, we refer to the divisions
of multi-sector firms that operate in different sectors as simply firms.
    Third, our framework incorporates multinational activity, because we allow firms to simultaneously
choose the set of markets to serve, the set of countries in which to produce, and the set of countries
from which to source inputs. Multinational activity occurs whenever a firm locates a production facility
in a foreign country. We allow for such multinational activity to rationalize the trade between related
parties that we observe in the U.S. trade transactions data. However, a caveat is that we only observe such
trade when one party to the transactions is located in the United States, because we do not have data on
the overseas production activity of multinational firms or on related-party trade between pairs of foreign
production facilities.
    Third, we allow for horizontal differentiation across both firms f and production locations i, because
                                                   F ) is allowed to depend on the production location
the appeal parameter for each firm f in market m (λmi f

i from which that market is served. Therefore a given firm’s products supplied from different production
locations are imperfect substitutes, which enables the model to rationalize a firm supplying a given market
from multiple production locations. We allow the strength of consumer preferences for the firm’s products
to depend on the production location in which they are produced. For example, Canadian consumers can
have different preferences for Toyota cars depending on whether those Toyotas are produced in Canada
or Japan.
                                                                                     F ) cannot be

2.2     Final Goods Production Technology

A final goods firm f is defined by its productivity (ϕi f ) in each potential country of production i, con-
                                                                                                 F ),

and consumers’ perceptions of the appeal of each product k supplied by that firm from that production

country to that market (λmik

                                    αg               1 − αg

where α g is the share of labor in final production costs; ηg is the elasticity of substitution across interme-
diate inputs for sector g; more productive firms (with higher ϕi f ) generate more output for given use of
        K ) and intermediate inputs Y K
labor (Lik                           ik (`). We characterize below the properties of the final goods firm’s
profit maximization problem as a function of its productivity (ϕi f ) regardless of the functional form of the
distribution from which that productivity is drawn. Therefore we are not required to impose a particular
functional form for the distribution of final goods productivity.
      To open a plant in production country i, firm f must incur a fixed production cost of FiP > 0 units
                                                                             X > 0 units of labor to
of labor. We also assume that the firm must incur a fixed exporting cost of Fmi
export to market m from production country i, after which it can supply that market subject to iceberg
                         X > 1, where d X > 1 for m 6 = i and d X = 1. Additionally, we assume that the
variable trade costs of dmi             mi                      mm
firm must incur fixed sourcing costs of FijI > 0 units of labor to obtain intermediate inputs in production
country i from source country j, after which it can obtain these inputs subject to iceberg variable trade
costs of dijI > 1, where dijI > 1 for i 6= j and diiI = 1. The fixed costs of production, exporting and
sourcing (FiP , Fmi
                 X and F I ) are incurred in terms of labor in country i and must be paid irrespective of the
                        ij
number of products exported or the number of inputs used. To rationalize firms only exporting a subset
                                                                                   K ) for each product k
of their products to some markets, we also assume a fixed product exporting cost (Fmik
exported from production country i to market m. We allow the variable trade costs to differ between final
                         X 6 = d I ). For simplicity, we assume that the final goods variable trade costs
and intermediate goods (dmi     mi
  X ) are the same across products k, and the intermediate inputs variable trade costs (d I ) are the same
(dmi                                                                                     ij
across inputs `, although it is possible to relax both these assumptions. Consistent with a large empirical
literature, we assume that fixed and variable trade costs are sufficiently high that only a subset of firms
from each production country i export to foreign markets m 6= i and that only a subset of these firms from
production country i import intermediate inputs from foreign source countries j 6= i.

2.3     Intermediate Input Production Technology

Intermediate inputs are produced with labor according to a linear technology under conditions of perfect
competition. If a final goods firm f in production country i has chosen to incur the fixed importing costs
for source country j, the cost of sourcing an intermediate input ` from country j for product k is:

                                                                     w j dijI
                                                    aij f k (`) =                 ,                                         (11)
                                                                    zij f k (`)

where recall that w j is the wage in country j and zij f k (`) is a stochastic draw for intermediate input pro-
ductivity. We assume that intermediate input productivity is drawn independently for each final good firm
f , product k, intermediate input `, production country i and source country j from a Fréchet distribution:
                                                                                  K
                                                                      − TjkK z−θk                                           (12)
                                                  Gij f k (z) = e                     ,

where TjkK is the Fréchet scale parameter that determines the average productivity of intermediate inputs
from source j for product k; θkK is the Fréchet shape parameter that determines the dispersion of interme-
diate input productivity for product k.
      Although intermediate input productivity (zij f k (`)) is specific to a final goods firm, we assume that
all intermediate input firms within source country j have access to this productivity, which ensures that
intermediate inputs are produced under conditions of perfect competition.12 Although intermediate input
productivity draws are assumed to be independent, we allow the scale parameter TjkK to vary across both
products and countries. Therefore, if source country j has a high value of TjkK for product k and also has a
               K for another product n 6 = k, this variation in the Fréchet scale parameters will induce a
high value of Tjn
correlation between intermediate input productivity draws for products k and n.

2.4     Exporting and Importing Decisions

Firm decisions in this framework involve the organization of global production chains.13 Each final goods
firm chooses the set of production countries in which to operate plants, taking into account the location of
these facilities relative to final goods markets and their location relative to sources of intermediate inputs.
Each final goods firm also chooses the set of markets to supply from each plant, the range of products to
export from each plant to each market, the set of countries from which to source intermediate inputs for
each product in each plant, and imports of each input for each product in each plant.
      We analyze the final goods firm’s optimal exporting and importing decisions in two stages. First,
for given sets of countries for which the fixed production costs (FiP ), fixed exporting costs (Fmi
                                                                                                 X ) and fixed

  12 We  thus abstract from issues of incomplete contracts and hold-up with relationship-specific investments, as considered in
Antràs (2003), Antràs and Helpman (2004) and Helpman (2006). Within our framework, final goods firms are indifferent whether
to source intermediate inputs within or beyond the boundaries of the firm.
   13 The determinants and implications of global production chains are explored in Antràs and Chor (2013), Alfaro, Antrás, Chor,

and Conconi (2015), Baldwin and Venables (2013), Costinot, Vogel, and Wang (2013), Dixit and Grossman (1982), Grossman and
Rossi-Hansberg (2008), Johnson and Noguera (2012), Melitz and Redding (2014b) and Yi (2003).

sourcing costs (FijI ) have been incurred, and for a given set of products for which the product fixed exporting
        K ) have been incurred for each production location and market, we characterize the firm’s optimal
costs (Fmik
decisions of which intermediate inputs to source from each country, how much of each intermediate input
to import from each source country, and how much of each product to export to each market. Second, we
characterize the firm’s optimal choices of the set of countries for which to incur these fixed production,
exporting and sourcing costs.

2.4.1   Importing Decisions for a Given Set of Locations

We begin with the final goods firm’s sourcing decisions for intermediate inputs. Suppose that firm f has
chosen the set of production countries i in which to locate plants (Ω NP
                                                                      f  ⊆ Ω N ), the set of markets m
to which to export from each plant (ΩiNX
                                      f  ⊆ Ω N ), the set of source countries j from which to obtain
intermediate inputs for each plant (ΩiNf I ⊆ Ω N ), and the set of products k to export from each plant to
              K ). Given these sets of countries and products, we now characterize the firm’s optimal
each market (Ωmi f
intermediate input sourcing decisions for these sets. Using the monotonic relationship between the price
of intermediate inputs (aij f k (`)) and intermediate input productivity (zij f k (`)) in (11) and the Fréchet
distribution of this productivity (12), the firm f in production country i faces the following distribution of
prices for intermediate inputs for each product k from each source country j ∈ ΩiNf I :
                                                                                          K   K
                                                                     − TjkK (w j dijI )−θk aθk

The firm sources each intermediate input for each product from the lowest-cost supplier within its set of
source countries j ∈ ΩiNf I . Since the minimum of Fréchet distributed random variables is itself Fréchet
distributed, the corresponding distribution of minimum prices across all source countries j ∈ ΩiNf I is:

    We refer to Φi f k ΩiNf I as firm supplier access, because it summarizes a final goods firm’s access to
intermediate inputs around the globe as a function of its choice of the set of source countries (ΩiNf I ). Other
things equal, firm supplier access is decreasing in the number of source countries: NiIf = ΩiNf I . Firm
supplier access also depends on wages (w j ) and intermediate input productivity (TjkK ) in each source country
j ∈ ΩiNf I and the variable trade costs of importing intermediate inputs from those source countries (dijI ).
The firm’s total cost function (including fixed sourcing costs and taking into account the firm’s output
choice) for product k is:

      Finally, an implication of the Fréchet assumption for intermediate input productivity is that the average
prices of intermediate inputs conditional on sourcing those inputs from a given source country are the same
across all source countries. Therefore the probability (µij f k (ΩiNf I )) that a firm f in production country i
obtains an input for product k from source country j (15) also corresponds to its share of expenditure on
inputs from that source country in its total expenditure on inputs for that product.

    Our framework generates these variable markups with CES demand by departing from the assump-
tion of monopolistic competition and instead allowing firms to internalize the effects of their decisions on
sectoral price indices in each market, as in Atkeson and Burstein (2008), Eaton, Kortum, and Sotelo (2012),
Edmond, Midrigan, and Xu (2012), Hottman, Redding, and Weinstein (2016) and Sutton and Trefler (2016).
More productive firms have larger market shares, so that their pricing decisions have a larger effect on
sectoral price indices, which implies that they have a lower perceived elasticity of demand.15 An alter-
native approach to generating variable markups would have been to assume non-CES demand, as in the
quasi-linear preferences of Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), the constant absolute risk aversion preferences of
Behrens and Murata (2012), and the indirectly additive preferences of Simonovska (2016). Our approach
allows size differences between firms to affect markups across a wide range of different functional forms
for demand (including CES), because firms internalize that their decisions affect sectoral aggregates within
each market. From equations (21) and (22), as a firm’s market share becomes small within a sector and
         F
market (Smi f → 0), its markup converges to that for the special case of monopolistic competition.
    Our framework’s prediction of variable markups receives support from a substantial empirical liter-
ature in industrial organization, including Trajtenberg (1989), Goldberg (1995), Nevo (2001), De Loecker
and Warzynski (2012), De Loecker, Goldberg, Khandelwal, and Pavcnik (2015), as reviewed in Bresnahan
(1989). From equations (21) and (22), the markup charged by each firm differs across markets, depending
  14 Although  we assume that firms choose prices under Bertrand competition, it is straightforward to consider the alternative
case in which firms choose quantities under Cournot competition. In this alternative specification, firms again charge variable
markups that are common across products within a given sector and market, but the expression for the perceived elasticity of
demand differs, as shown in Atkeson and Burstein (2008) and Hottman, Redding, and Weinstein (2016).
  15 Although firms can be large relative to sectors within markets, and therefore internalize the effect of their decisions on sectoral

price indices, we assume that firms remain small relative to each market as a whole, and hence take aggregate expenditure and
wages as given. In this sense, firms are “large in the small and small in the large,” as in Neary (2003, 2016).

on its share of expenditure within the sector in that market. This property of the model is consistent with
the literature on “pricing to market,” where firms charge different prices for the same good across mar-
kets, including Krugman (1987), Bergin and Feenstra (2001), Atkeson and Burstein (2008), Goldberg and
Hellerstein (2013), Fitzgerald and Haller (2015), as reviewed in De Loecker and Goldberg (2014). Finally, the
variable markup in equations (21) and (22) implies that an increase in marginal costs is not fully passed on
to consumers in the form of a higher price, because the fall in market share induced by a higher price leads
to a fall in markup. A large body of empirical research confirms such “incomplete passthrough,” as reviewed
in Goldberg and Knetter (1997), with implications for monetary policy and the international transmission
of shocks, as examined in Smets and Wouters (2007), Gopinath and Itskhoki (2010), Berman, Martin, and
Mayer (2012) and Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings (2014).
    The property that the final goods firm charges a common markup across all products within a given
sector and market is a generic feature of nested demand systems. The intuition for this result can be
garnered by thinking about the firm’s profit maximization problem in two stages. First, the firm chooses
                  F ) to maximize the profits from supplying its consumption index (C F ), which implies a
the price index (Pmi f                                                               mi f
markup at the firm level within a given sector and market over the cost of supplying its real consumption
index. Second, the firm chooses the price for each product to minimize the cost of supplying its real
                    F ), which requires setting the relative prices of these products equal to their relative
consumption index (Cmi f
marginal costs. Together these two results ensure the same markup across all products supplied by the firm
within a given sector and market. Nonetheless, firm markups vary across markets within a given sector
(with the firm market share in those markets). As the firm’s profit maximization problem is separable
across sectors, firm markups also vary across sectors within a given market (with the firm market share
and elasticity of substitution across products within those sectors).16
    Using the equilibrium pricing rule (20) in the firm problem (19), equilibrium profits for final goods firm
f from production location i within sector g can be written in terms of sales from each product k in each
market, the common markup across products within each market, and the fixed costs:

    As in Antràs, Fort, and Tintelnot (2014), incurring the fixed sourcing cost for a new source country
(expanding ΩiNf I ) has two effects on imports from existing source countries for each product. On the one
hand, the addition of the new source country reduces imports from existing source countries through a
substitution effect (from the expenditure shares (15)). On the other hand, the addition of the new source
country improves supplier access (Φi f k ), which reduces production costs and expands firms sales (from
the revenue function (25)), which raises imports from existing source countries through a production scale
effect. Which of these two effects dominates, and whether source countries are substitutes or complements,
                              
depends on whether σgK − 1 1 − α g /θkK is less than or greater than one respectively.

    We now examine the properties of final goods firm variables with respect to productivity using the firm
expenditure share (7), price index (6) and pricing rule (20). We derive these results from the firm’s profit
maximization problem. We hold constant wages (wm ) and aggregate expenditure (Em ) in all countries m

production country i to each market m in each sector g (Ωmi f
plant (ΩiNf I ). These choice sets and wages are themselves endogenous. Therefore these results should
be interpreted as partial derivatives of firm variables with respect to productivity, holding constant these
choice sets and wages.17 Finally, we also hold fixed all other model parameters, including firm appeal
  F ), product appeal (λ K ) and intermediate input productivities (T K ).

Proof. See the appendix.

      Higher final goods firm productivity reduces prices in each market, which leads to higher sales and
output of each product in each market, and hence higher total sales and output of each product across all
markets. This higher total output for each product in turn implies higher imports of intermediate inputs for
each product. Therefore a key empirical prediction of the model is that higher final goods firm productivity
leads to an expansion of the intensive margins of exports of each product and imports of each input. The
expansion of firm sales in each market in turn implies a reduction in the firm’s perceived elasticity of
demand in each market and hence higher firm markups. Thus there is “incomplete passthrough” of the
higher firm productivity to consumers in the form of lower prices.

from each plant to each market served (Ωmi f

      This expression for the final goods firm’s problem has an intuitive interpretation. For each set of
production, market and source countries and each set of products exported, the firm first solves for its
                                                                                                F ) and
equilibrium variable profits as determined in the previous subsection (in terms of the markup (µmi f
        K )). Having computed this solution for each set of production, market and source countries and
sales (Emik
each set of products exported, the firm then searches over all possible combinations of production, market
and source countries and products exported for the combination that maximizes total profits.
      Although conceptually straightforward, this firm problem is highly computationally demanding. First,
the choice set is high dimensional (for each production location i, the firm chooses sets of export markets
and intermediate input sources from N countries and chooses its sets of products for each market). Second,
the choices of these sets of production locations, markets, source countries and products are interdepen-
dent. One dimension of this interdependence is in importing decisions across source countries. Incurring
                                                                                                               
the fixed sourcing cost (FijI ) for an additional source country j increases firm supplier access (Φi f k ΩiNf I )

and hence reduces variable unit costs (17) and prices (20). These lower prices in turn imply higher output
from the revenue function (9), which makes it more likely that the firm will find it profitable to incur the
fixed sourcing costs for another country h 6= j. Another aspect of this interdependence is between export-
                                                                  X ) for an additional export market m
ing and importing decisions. Incurring the fixed exporting cost (Fmi
increases firm output. This increased output makes it more likely that the firm will find it profitable to in-
cur the fixed sourcing cost (FijI ) for any given source country j. Finally, this interaction between exporting
and importing makes exporting decisions interdependent across markets. Incurring the fixed exporting
       X ) for an additional market m increases firm revenue, which makes it more likely that the firm will
cost (Fmi
find it profitable to incur the fixed importing cost (FijI ) for any given source country j. This in turn reduces
variable production costs and prices, and thereby increases revenue, which makes it more likely that the
firm will find it profitable to incur the fixed exporting cost for another market h 6= m. Our framework
thus captures the idea that importing can facilitate exporting and exporting to one market can promote
exporting to another market.
    Providing a general characterization of the solution to (26) becomes all the more demanding once the
final goods firm’s problem is embedded in general equilibrium, which requires solving for the endogenous
sets of firms and values for wages. However, without explicitly solving for the full general equilibrium,
we can again establish some properties of the firm’s profit maximization problem that hold regardless of
the way this problem is embedded in general equilibrium. We begin with the firm’s decisions of the set of

Proof. See the appendix.

    Taking Propositions 2-4 together, a key empirical prediction of the model is that higher final goods
firm productivity leads to an expansion of the extensive margins of the number of products exported to
each market, the number of export markets and the number of source countries for intermediate inputs.
Combining these results with those from Proposition 1, the model implies that more productive firms
participate more in the international economy along all margins simultaneously: higher exports of each
product, higher imports of each intermediate input, more products exported to each market, more export
markets and more import sources. Therefore we should expect to see that all these margins of international
participation co-move together across firms: more exports and imports on the intensive margins should
be systematically correlated with more export and import participation on the extensive margins.
    This correlation implies that a given exogenous difference in productivity between final goods firms
has a magnified impact on endogenous differences in firm performance, such as sales and employment,

                                                                     19

because it induces firms to simultaneously expand along each of the margins of international participation.
Therefore our framework suggests that the skewed size distribution across firms studied in the industrial
organization literature (see for example Sutton (1997), Axtell (2001) and Rossi-Hansberg and Wright (2007))
is in part driven by these magnification effects. Furthermore, the correlation between these margins of
international participation has implications for measured firm productivity. As more productive firms
import intermediate inputs from a wider range of source countries, this improves their supplier access
and reduces their production costs, magnifying the endogenous difference in costs between firms relative
to the exogenous difference in productivity.18 Together, the expansion by more successful firms along
multiple margins of international participation, and the magnification of primitive productivity differences
by endogenous sourcing decisions, help to explain the extent to which international trade is concentrated
across firms, with a relatively small number of firms accounting for a disproportionate share of trade.


3      Data

To provide empirical evidence on these predictions of the model, we use the Linked-Longitudinal Firm
Trade Transactions Database (LFTTD), which combines information from three separate databases col-
lected by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Customs Bureau. The first dataset is the U.S. Census of
Manufactures (CM), which reports data on the operation of establishments in the U.S. manufacturing sec-
tor, including information on output (shipments and value-added), inputs (capital, employment and wage-
bills for production and non-production workers, and materials) and export participation (whether a firm
exports and total export shipments).19
      The second dataset is the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), which records employment and sur-
vival information for all U.S. establishments outside of agriculture, forestry and fishing, railroads, the U.S.
Postal Service, education, public administration and several other smaller sectors.20 The third dataset in-
cludes all U.S. export and import transactions between 1992 and 2007. For each flow of goods across a
U.S. border, this dataset records the product classification(s) of the shipment (10-digit Harmonized System
(HS)), the value and quantity shipped, the date of the shipment, the destination or source country, the
transport mode used to ship the goods, the identity of the U.S. firm engaging in the trade, and whether the
trade is with a related party or occurs at arms length.21
    18 Although we focus on firms international sourcing decisions, because we observe these decisions in our international trade
data, similar forces are likely to be at work across regions and firms within countries, further reinforcing these magnification
effects. For example, Bernard, Moxnes, and Saito (2014) find that the number of domestically-sourced products rises more than
proportionately with firm productivity.
   19 For further discussion of the CM see, for example, Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010).
   20 See Jarmin and Miranda (2002) for further details on the LBD.
   21 See Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009) for a detailed description of the LFTTD and its construction. Related-party trade refers

to trade between U.S. companies and their foreign subsidiaries as well as trade between U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies
and their foreign affiliates. For imports, firms are related if either owns, controls or holds voting power equivalent to 6 percent of
the outstanding voting stock or shares of the other organization (see Section 402(e) of the Tariff Act of 1930). For exports, firms
are related if either party owns, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the other party (see Section 30.7(v) of The Foreign
Trade Statistics Regulations).

      In our main results, we aggregate the establishment-level data from the CM and LBD and the trade
transactions data up to the level of the firm. We thus obtain a dataset for each firm that contains information
on firm characteristics (e.g. industry, employment, productivity and total shipments) as well as on each
of the margins of firm international participation considered above (exports of each product, the number
of products exported to each market, the number of export markets, imports of each input, the number
of imported inputs from each source country, and the number of source countries). We also report some
additional results, in which we use the information on exports and imports by firm, product, destination
and year in the trade transactions data.22


4      Evidence on Global Firms

We now provide empirical evidence on our model’s predictions for the margins of firm international par-
ticipation. Section 4.1 examines the frequency of firm exporting. Section 4.2 compares exporter and non-
exporter characteristics. Section 4.3 considers the prevalence of firm importing. Section 4.4 contrasts the
characteristics of importers, exporters, and other firms. Section 4.5 investigates the extensive margins of
the number of exported products, the number of export markets, the number of imported products, and
the number of import countries. Section 4.7 provides further evidence on the correlations between firm
decisions to participate in international markets along each of the intensive and extensive margins.

4.1      Firm Exporting

As in the literature on heterogeneous firms following Melitz (2003), our model emphasizes the self-selection
of firms into exporting, such that only some firms export within each industry. Table 1 examines these
predictions for U.S. manufacturing industries using data from the 2007 LFFTD. In Column (1), we provide
a sense of the relative size of each industry, by reporting the share of each three-digit North American
Industrial Classification (NAIC) industry in the number of manufacturing firms, which ranges from 0.3
percent for Leather and Allied Products (316) to 20.6 percent for Fabricated Metal Products (332).
      In Column (2), we confirm the prediction that only some firms export within each industry. For the
U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole, around 35 percent of firms export. However, this fraction of ex-
porters varies substantially from around 75 percent of firms in Computer and Electronic Products (311) to
around 15 percent of firms in Printing and Related Support (323). This variation across sectors is roughly
in line with the idea that the U.S. has a comparative advantage in high-skill and capital-intensive sectors
such as Electrical Equipment, Appliance (335), which have exporter shares more than twice as large as
those of labor-intensive sectors such as Apparel Manufacturing (315). In our model in Section 2, compar-
ative advantage is driven by productivity differences and the geography of access to intermediate inputs.
More broadly, Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2007) develop a model that combines firm heterogeneity with
    22 Relatively little research has examined the properties of the trade transactions data at finer levels of disaggregation than firm,

product, destination and year, with some exceptions such as Hornok and Koren (2014) and Hornok and Koren (2015).

                 distribution of manufacturing firms across three-digit NAICS manufacturing industries.
                 Column (2) reports the share of firms in each industry that export. Firm exports are measured
                 using customs information from LFTTD. Column (3) reports mean exports as a percent of
                 total shipments across all firms that export in the noted industry.

                                                 Table 1: Firm Exporting

   In Column (3), we report the average share of exports in firm shipments for each sector. In a world
of identical and homothetic preferences and no trade costs, this share of exports in firm shipments would
equal the share of the rest of the world in world GDP (see also Brooks (2006)). However, we find an
average export share for manufacturing as a whole of 17 percent, which is substantially lower than this
frictionless benchmark. A natural explanation is variable trade costs. In our theoretical framework, these
trade frictions reduce the share of exports in firm shipments through both the extensive margins (the
number of countries to which a firm exports and the number of products the firm exports to a given
country) and the intensive margin (exports of a given product to a given country).
   As apparent from Column (3), this average share of exports in firm shipments also varies substantially
across sectors, from a a high of 47 percent in Electrical Equipment (335) to a low of 6 percent in Paper
Manufacturing (322). In the theory developed above, such variation in average export shares is driven
by differences in trade costs across industries and the pattern of comparative advantage, as determined


                                                               22
                                                         Global Firms


by productivity differences and the geography of access to intermediate inputs. In the model of Bernard,
Redding, and Schott (2007), differences in average export shares across industries also reflect the interaction
of cross-industry differences in factor intensity and cross-country differences in factor abundance.
      Comparing the results for 2007 in Table 1 with those for 2002 in Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott
(2007), we find a larger fraction of exporters and a higher share of firm exports in total shipments in Table 1.
The main reason for this difference is that Table 1 measures firm exporting using the customs records from
LFTTD, whereas Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007) measures firm exporting using the export
question in the Census of Manufactures.23 Following the 2001 recession and the granting of Permanent
Normal Trading Relations (PNTR) to China, there was also a sharp decline in overall employment and high
rates of exit in U.S. manufacturing (as examined in Pierce and Schott (2012)). To the extent that exporting
and non-exporting firms were differentially affected by this decline, this could also affect the evolution of
the fraction of exporters over time.
      Following the early evidence on firm export participation for the United States in Bernard and Jensen
(1995, 1999), similar results have been reported for many countries, including Brazil (Labanca and Muendler
(2014)), France (Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2004)), Germany (Bernard and Wagner (1997)), Sub-Saharan
Africa (Van Biesebroeck (2005)), the United Kingdom (Girma, Greenaway, and Kneller (2004)). As sum-
marized in Organization (2008), the share of manufacturing firms that export is 20.9 percent for Chile;
18.2 percent for Columbia; 17.4 percent for France; 20 percent for Japan; and 39.2 percent for Norway.
Therefore the finding that a relatively small share of firms export is robust across this diverse range of
countries.

4.2     Exporter Characteristics

The self-selection of firms into exporting in our theoretical model above implies systematic differences in
performance between exporters and non-exporters. In Table 2, we present evidence on these performance
differences for U.S. manufacturing industries using data from the 2007 LFFTD. We regress the log of each
measure of firm performance on a dummy variable for whether a firm exports. In the rows of the table,
we report the results for different measures of firm performance. Column (1) includes no other controls;
Column (2) controls for industry fixed effects; and Column (3) incorporates industry fixed effects and
firm size as measured by log firm employment. Therefore each cell of the table corresponds to a separate
regression specification.
      As shown in Column (1), we find that exporting firms have 128 percent more employment, 172 percent
higher shipments, 33 percent higher value-added per worker, and 3 percent higher total factor productivity
(TFP).24 All of these differences are statistically significant at conventional critical values. When we include
  23 Using  this alternative definition of firm exporting from the Census of Manufactures, we find a relatively similar pattern of
results for 2007 as for 2002 in Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2007). Therefore the customs records from LFTTD imply that
exporting is more prevalent than would be concluded based on the export question in the Census of Manufactures.
   24 We measure Total Factor Productivity (TFP) using the Törnqvist superlative index number of Caves, Christensen, and Diewert




                                                               23

industry fixed effects in Column (2) to focus on within-industry differences between exporters and non-
exporters, these performance differences become slightly smaller, but remain statistically significant at
the 1 percent level. We continue to find that exporters are larger than non-exporters, by 111 percent for
employment and 135 percent for shipments. Exporters also remain more productive than non-exporters,
by 19 percent for value-added per worker and 4 percent for TFP. Column (3) shows that these performance
differences are not driven simply by firm size. After including log firm employment as an additional control,
we continue to find statistically significant differences between exporters and non-exporters within the
same industry for all the other performance measures.

             Notes: Notes: Data are for 2007 and are from the U.S. Census of Manufactures. All results
             are from bivariate OLS regressions of firm characteristic in first column on a dummy
             variable indicating firm's export status. Firm exports measured using customs information
             from LFTTD. Columns two and three include industry fixed effects and industry fixed
             effects plus log firm employment, respectively, as additional controls. Total factor
             productivity (TFP) is computed as in Caves et al (1982). Capital and skill per worker are
             capital stock and non-production workers per total employment, respectively. All results
             are significant at the 1 percent level except the Log Skill per Worker results in column 2
             which are not significant at the 10 percent level.

                                                Table 2: Exporter Premia


    Comparing the results for 2007 in Table 2 with those for 2002 in Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott
(2007), we find stable performance differences between exporters and non-exporters, which become some-
what larger over time. Following the early evidence for the United States in Bernard and Jensen (1995,
1999), similar performance differences between exporters and non-exporters have been found for a range
of developed and developing countries, including France (Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2004)), Germany
(Bernard and Wagner (1997)), Slovenia (De Loecker (2007)) and Sub-Saharan African countries (Van Biese-
broeck (2005)), among many others. Even within a given country, similar performance differences are
(1982). We use log differences to approximate the percentage differences between exporters and non-exporters, which understates
the magnitude of the percentage differences. For example, from Column (1) of Table 2, exporters are 260 percent larger than
nonexporters in terms of employment (since 100*(exp(1.28)-1)=260).


                                                              24

observed between plants that ship long versus short distances, as shown for the United States by Holmes
and Stevens (2012).
    One notable feature of the results in Table 2 is that the differences in firm productivity (both value added
and TFP) are smaller than those in employment and shipments. This is consistent with our theoretical
framework above, in which productivity differences between firms are amplified by elastic demand (an
elasticity of substitution greater than one) and firm decisions to participate in the international economy
along multiple margins. In the model, causality runs from high productivity to exporting, through firms’
endogenous decisions to self select into the export market. However, in principle, causality also could run
from exporting to high productivity (e.g. through “learning by exporting”). As productivity differences
between future exporters and other non-exporters are typically found to predate entry into exporting, most
existing research interprets these productivity differences as largely the result of selection into exporting
(see Bernard and Jensen (1999) for U.S. evidence and Clerides and Tybout (1998) for evidence from Mexico,
Colombia, and Morocco). More recently, a number of empirical studies have provided evidence that firm
entry into exporting can stimulate the adoption of new productivity-enhancing technologies, including in
particular Bustos (2011) and Lileeva and Trefler (2010).
    One limitation of the model is that it focuses on differences in productivity and size between exporters
and non-exporters. The results in Table 2, however, suggest that exporters also differ along a range of
other characteristics, including wages, capital per worker and skill per worker. The literature on heteroge-
neous firms in international trade has explored a number of mechanisms that can account for these other
dimensions of performance differences. Burstein and Vogel (2015) and Harrigan and Reshef (2015) con-
sider technology-skill complementarities, in which higher firm productivity raises the marginal product
of skilled workers relative to that of unskilled workers, which in turn induces more productive firms to
choose more skill-intensive production techniques. Helpman, Itskhoki, and Redding (2010) and Helpman,
Itskhoki, Muendler, and Redding (2016) develop a model of search and screening frictions, in which more
productive firms screen their workers to a higher ability threshold, and hence employ workers of higher
average ability and pay higher wages. This environment implies both an employer-size wage premium
and higher wages for exporters than for non-exporters. Opening the closed economy to trade increases
the dispersion of revenue across firms, through the selection of more productive firms into export markets,
which in turn increases the dispersion of wages across firms. This thereby provides a new mechanism for
trade to affect wage inequality through export market selection.25
    An empirical literature using linked employer-employee datasets has sought to further decompose the
observed wage differences between exporters and non-exporters into the contributions of unobserved dif-
ferences in workforce composition and wage premia for workers with identical characteristics. Following
Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) and Abowd, Creecy, and Kramarz (2002), this literature typically as-
sumes that the production function is log additively separable in worker ability and that the switching of

workers between firms is random conditional on firm fixed effects, worker fixed effects and time-varying
worker observables. In general, this literature finds a role for both unobserved differences in workforce
composition and wage premia, with their relative contributions varying across studies, as in Baumgarden
(2013), Davidson, Heyman, Matusz, Sjöholm, and Zhu (2014), Frías, Kaplan, and Verhoogen (2015), Krishna,
Poole, and Senses (2014), Munch and Skaksen (2008) and Schank, Schnabel, and Wagner (2007).

4.3     Firm Importing

Our theoretical framework above emphasizes that firms self-select into importing as well as into export-
ing. In Table 3, we compare firm importing and exporting using the 2007 LFTTD. Column (1) reproduces
the share of each three-digit North American Industrial Classification (NAIC) industry in the number of
manufacturing firms from Table 1; Column (2) reproduces the share of firms within each industry that
export from Table 1; Column (3) reports the share of firms within each industry that import; and Column
(4) summarizes the share of firms within each industry that both export and import.

1. For the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole, around 20 percent of firms import. However, there is
substantial variation across industries, with the share of importers ranging from a low of 5 percent in
Printing and Related Support (323) to a high of 50 percent in Computer and Electronic Product (334). Our
theoretical model from Section 2 predicts a positive correlation between firm importing and exporting
through two mechanisms. The first of these mechanisms is selection: more productive firms will find
it profitable to incur the fixed costs for both importing and exporting. A second channel is through the
interdependence and complementarities between the firm margins of international participation. On the
one hand, when a firm incurs the fixed cost to export, the resulting increase in firm sales increases the
profitability of incurring the fixed cost to import. On the other hand, when a firm incurs the fixed costs
for importing, the resulting improvement in supplier access and reduction in marginal costs increases the
profitability of incurring the fixed cost for exporting. Consistent with these predictions, we find a strong
positive correlation across industries between the shares of firms that export and import in Columns (2) and
(3) of Table 3. As a result, many of the firms that engage in one of these forms of international participation
also engage in the other, as is evident from a comparison of Columns (2)-(4) of Table 3.
      Although the literature on firm importing is less extensive than that on firm exporting, similar results
again have been found for a number of other countries, including Belgium (Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings
(2014)), Chile (Kasahara and Lapham (2008)), France (Blaum, Lelarge, and Peters (2013, 2014)), Hungary
(Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2015)) and Indonesia (Amiti and Davis (2011)) among others. While Table 3 re-
ports results for firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector, many firms in other sectors also import or export.
A small body of research has sought to analyze the trade behavior of such intermediaries, wholesalers
and retailers, including Ahn, Khandelwal, and Wei (2011), Akerman (2010), Antràs and Costinot (2011),
Bernard, Grazzi, and Tomasi (2014), Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2010b) and Blum, Claro, and
Horstmann (2000). Some firms can also transition from manufacturing to non-manufacturing, as they off-
shore the entire of their production process, as examined in Bernard and Fort (2015) and Bernard, Smeets,
and Warzynski (2016). More generally, Boehm and Pandalai-Nayar (2015) examine the role of offshoring
by U.S. and foreign-owned multinationals in understanding the evolution of U.S. manufacturing employ-
ment. Although imports of goods have received much more attention than imports of services, because
of the scarcity of data on trade in services, notable exceptions are Liu and Trefler (2008) and Breinlich
and Criscuolo (2011). Finally, more recent research on networks has examined patterns of exporting and
importing between individual buyers and sellers, including Bernard, Moxnes, and Saito (2014), Bernard,
Moxnes, and Ulltveit-Moe (2015), Chaney (2014, 2015), Eaton, Kortum, Kramarz, and Sampognaro (2014),
Eaton, Jinkins, Tybout, and Xu (2016) and Lim (2016).

4.4     Importer Characteristics

The self-selection of firms into importing in our theoretical model above also implies systematic differ-
ences in performance between importers and non-exporters. In Table 4, we provide evidence on these


                                                      27

performance differences for U.S. manufacturing industries, using an analogous specification to that for
firm exporting in Table 2. All specifications in Table 4 control for industry fixed effects and all specifica-
tions except for employment control for firm size as measured by log employment.

           Notes: Data are for 2007 and are for firms thatappear in both the U.S. Census of Manufacturers

           the dummy variable noted at the top of each column as well as industry fixed effects. All
           specifications except for employment also include firm employment as an additional control.
           Firm exports and imports are measured using customs information from LFTTD. Total factor
           productivity (TFP) is computed as in Caves et al (1982). Capital and skill per worker are capital
           stock and non-production workers per total employment, respectively. All results are significant
           at the 1 percent level.

                                        Table 4: Exporter and Importer Premia


    Consistent with the selection forces emphasized in our model, we find a similar pattern of results for
importing as for exporting. After controlling for firm size, we find import premia within industries of
around 120 percent for employment, 32 percent for shipments, 25 percent for value-added per worker, 3
percent for TFP, 9 percent for wages, 28 percent for capital intensity and 16 percent for skill intensity.26
Consistent with both the selection and magnification effects emphasized by our model, we find the largest
performance differences for firms that simultaneously export and import. In the model, participation in
the international economy along multiple margins amplifies the effect of true differences in firm primitives
on endogenous measures of firm performance.27
    To examine the implications of firm selection into importing for firm and aggregate productivity,
Blaum, Lelarge, and Peters (2014) develop a framework in which firm-level data on value-added and do-
mestic expenditure shares provide sufficient statistics for the impact of trade in intermediate inputs on
consumer prices. Within this framework, a reduction in a firm’s domestic expenditure share implies a
reduction in its unit costs. Using the observed joint distribution of firm value-added and domestic expen-
diture shares in the data, this framework implies substantial heterogeneity across firms in the effects of
  26 Again we use the log approximation, which can can substantially understate the size of these performance differences.

exponents of the employment coefficient in Column (2) of Table 4, importing firms have 232 percent more employment (since
100*(exp(1.20)-1)=232).
  27 While we focus on firm exporting and importing, similar performance differences are observed between multinationals and

other firms. See for example Doms and Jensen (1998), Helpman, Melitz, and Yeaple (2004) and Yeaple (2009).

firms.

4.5      Extensive Margins of Firm Exporting and Importing

One of the central features of our theoretical framework above is that firms decide to participate in the
international economy along multiple extensive margins: the number of products to export to each market,
the number of export markets, the number of intermediate inputs to import from each source country, and
the number of countries from which to source intermediate inputs. We now use U.S. export and import
transactions data to provide evidence on these multiple extensive margins.
      In Table 5, we report joint distributions for exporting firms across the number of products exported
(rows) and the number of markets served (columns). The top panel reports the percentage of exporting
firms; the middle panel reports the percentage of export value; and the bottom panel reports the percentage
of exporter employment. The cells in each panel sum to 100. Comparing results across the three panels,
we find that around 35 percent exporters ship one product to one market (top panel, top left cell), but they
account for only 11 percent of employment (bottom panel, top left cell) and a mere 1 percent of export
value (middle panel, top left cell). In contrast, the 5 percent of exporters that ship eleven or more products
to eleven or more markets (top panel, bottom right cell) account for around 46 percent of employment
(bottom panel, bottom right cell) and nearly 80 percent of export value (middle panel, bottom right cell).
Across all three panels, the diagonal terms in each panel tend to be large relative to the off-diagonal terms,
so that firms that export to many markets also on average export many products. This pattern of results is
consistent with the positive correlation between the different margins of firm international participation
in our theoretical framework above. More successful firms export more of each product to each market,
as well as exporting more products to each market and exporting to more markets, thereby ensuring that
relatively few firms account for most of aggregate export value.28
  28 Anotherfeature of international trade besides its concentration across firms is its “sparsity”: the prevalence of zeros with
many firms exporting few products to few destinations, as examined in Armenter and Koren (2014).

         (top panel), their export value (middle panel) and their employment (bottom panel), according to the number of
         products firms export (rows) and their number of export destinations (columns). Products are defined as ten-digit
         Harmonized System categories.


                                  Table 5: Export Distribution by Product and Country


    In Table 6, we report analogous joint distributions of importing firms across the number of products
imported (rows) and the number of foreign countries from which products are imported (columns). The
cells in each panel again sum to 100. Looking across the three panels, we find a similar pattern of results for
imports as for exports. Around 30 percent of importers source one product from one foreign country (top
panel, top left cell), but they account for around 11 percent of employment (bottom panel, top left cell) and
less than 1 percent of import value (middle panel, top left cell). By comparison, the 3 percent of importers
that source eleven or more products from eleven or more countries (top panel, bottom right cell) account
for around 46 percent of employment (bottom panel, bottom right cell) and approximately 76 percent
of import value (middle panel, bottom right cell). We again find that the diagonal terms in each panel

                                                                   30

tend to be large relative to the off-diagonal terms, implying that firms that import from many countries
also on average import many products. These results again confirm the positive correlation between the
different margins of international participation in our model. More successful firms import more of each
product from each country, as well as importing more products from each country and importing from
more countries, thereby again enabling a relatively small number of firms to be responsible for most of
aggregate import value.
    More broadly, these findings provide additional support for a growing body of research that emphasizes
the importance of the firm extensive margin of trade participation. Comparing the Krugman (1980) model
to the Melitz (2003) model with an untruncated Pareto productivity distribution, Chaney (2008) shows that
the presence of the extensive margin in the heterogeneous firm model reverses the relationship between
the elasticity of substitution and the sensitivity of trade flows to trade costs.29 Using firm export data
from France, Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2004) decompose the variation in aggregate exports across
destination markets, and show that the extensive margin of the number of exporting firms accounts for over
60 percent of this variation.30 Using the same French data, Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2011) structurally
estimate an extension of the Melitz (2003) heterogeneous firm model and show that the extensive margin of
firm export participation plays a central role in shaping the effects of a counterfactual 10 percent reduction
in bilateral trade barriers for all French firms.31 Most of the overall increase in French exports of around
$16 million is accounted for by a rise in the sales of the top decile of firms of around $23 million. In
contrast, every other decile of firms experiences a decline in sales, with around half the firms in the bottom
decile exiting. Using a gravity equation specification, Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008) show that
incorporating the extensive margin of firm selection into export markets is consequential for estimates of
the impact of standard trade frictions (such as distance and whether countries share a common border) on
trade flows.32
  29 An   untruncated Pareto distribution of productivity (ϕ) is characterized by a probability density function of g ( ϕ) =
   k ϕ−(k +1) with a corresponding cumulative distribution function of G ( ϕ ) = 1 − ( ϕ                k
kϕmin                                                                                           min /ϕ ) , where ϕmin > 0 is the
minimum value for productivity and k > 1.
   30 Following trade liberalization reforms, Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) find that much of the growth in overall trade occurs in goods

that were not previously exported or were only previously exported in small amounts.
   31 Other quantitative analyses of models of heterogeneous firms and trade include the study of trade integration in Corcos,

Del Gatto, Mion, and Ottaviano (2012), the analysis of the impact of China’s productivity growth on world welfare in Hsieh and
Ossa (2011), the investigation of patterns of trade in Bangladesh’s apparel sector in Cherkashin, Demidova, Kee, and Krishna
(2010), and the exploration of foreign direct investment (FDI) activity in Irarrazabal, Opromolla, and Moxnes (2013).
   32 The importance of the extensive margins of firm trade participation for aggregate trade flows does not necessarily imply that

they are relevant for measuring the aggregate welfare gains from trade. For the circumstances under which the aggregate gains
from trade can be summarized by a constant trade elasticity and an aggregate domestic trade share in the Melitz (2003) model,
see Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) and Melitz and Redding (2015).

    Other research has established the importance of the product extensive margin within firms. Bernard,
Redding, and Schott (2011) develops a general equilibrium model of multiple-product, multiple-destination
firms, which features heterogeneity and selection across products within firms as well as across firms.33
Firms choose whether to export to each market and the range of products to export to each market. Under
the assumption of untruncated Pareto distributions for firm productivity and product attributes, the model
implies log linear relationships for aggregate trade, the intensive margin of average exports per firm-
product conditional on positive trade, and the extensive margin of the number of firm-product observations
  33 Other recent research on multi-product firms in international trade includes Arkolakis, Muendler, and Ganapati (2014), Eckel

and Neary (2010), Feenstra and Ma (2008), Mayer, Melitz, and Ottaviano (2013) and Nocke and Yeaple (2014).

with positive trade. Estimating these gravity equation relationships using U.S. trade transactions data, the
negative effect of distance on aggregate bilateral trade is largely explained by the extensive margin of the
number of firm-product observations with positive trade. Although distance reduces the intensive margin
of exports of a given product by a given firm, average firm-product exports conditional on positive trade
are largely uncorrelated with distance, because of endogenous changes in export composition.34
      More recent research has begun to provide evidence on the extensive margins of firm importing. As
discussed above, Antràs, Fort, and Tintelnot (2014) develops a quantitative multi-country sourcing model
in which heterogeneous firms self-select into importing based on their productivity and country-specific
variables (wages, trade costs, and technology). For parameter values for which firm importing decisions
are complementary across source countries, firm import participation exhibits a strict hierarchy, according
to which the number of countries from which a firm sources is (weakly) increasing in its productivity. The
presence of endogenous import sourcing decisions plays a central important role in shaping the effects of a
counterfactual shock of increased import competition from China. While this common import competition
shock decreases overall domestic sourcing and employment, some firms can be induced to select into
sourcing from China as a result of the shock. For parameter values for which importing decisions are
complementary across source countries, these firms on average increase their input purchases not only
from China, but also from the U.S. and other countries.

4.6       Concentration

Another central implication of our model is that the correlation among the margins of international partici-
pation magnifies differences in firm performance, thereby helping to explain the observed skewed distribu-
tion of firm size. In this section, we present further evidence on the degree to which trade is concentrated
across firms. Table 7 shows that trade of all types is extremely concentrated in the largest firms. The
largest decile of firms accounts for over 95 percent of total trade, exports and imports, and over 99 percent
of related-party trade in 2007. Even among the largest firms, the top 1 percent stand out. They control
more than 80 percent of total US trade and more than 92 percent of related party trade. These “largest of
the large” firms are 15 times more important in exports and imports than are firms in the second-largest
percentile.
      Following the early U.S. evidence in Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009), this finding that trade is dis-
proportionately concentrated in the largest firms has been confirmed across a range of different countries.
For example, using data for manufacturing exports, Mayer and Ottaviano (2007) reports that the share of
exports accounted for by the top 1 percent of firms is 48 percent for Belgium; 44 percent for France; 59 per-
cent for Germany; 77 percent for Hungary; 32 percent for Italy; 53 percent for Norway; and 42 percent for
  34 As shown in Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2009), the extensive margins of the number of exported products and
export markets account for much of the cross-section variation in aggregate U.S. exports and imports. Over short time horizons,
the intensive margin of average trade conditional on trade being positive is relatively more important, and the extensive and
intensive margins behave differently for arms-length versus related-party trade in response to macroeconomic shocks such as
the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

the United Kingdom. Therefore the extreme concentration of trade across firms is also a robust empirical
finding across this diverse range of countries.

4.7     Co-movement in the Margins of International Participation

We now turn to examine in more detail our model’s central prediction of co-movement in the margins
of firm participation in international markets. In Table 8, we calculate the correlations of log value (total
trade, imports, exports and related-party trade) and log counts (import and export counts of country-
products, products, and countries) for firms with positive values in the category. In every case we find
positive and significant correlations across the different dimensions of international activity of the firm.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, total firm trade is strongly positively correlated with firm exports and imports as
well as related-party trade. In addition, however, we see that export value and counts of export products
and countries are positively related to similar measures on the import side. Therefore, as predicted by our
model, firms that source from more countries, or import more products, also export more products to more
countries and the total value of their exports is higher.
      In Figure 1, we begin by examining the relationship between a firm’s decision to import and its decision

     positive values of both variables. All correlations are for the year 2007. Trade refers to the sum of exports and imports; RP Trade reports to
     related-party trade (sum of related-party exports and related-party imports). Products correspond to Harmonized System (HS) 10-digit products.

of all trading firms within the bin that both export and import. As shown in the main panel of the figure,
the extent of two-way trade increases non-linearly across the distribution of total firm trade, whether we
look across decile bins of the distribution as a whole or across percentile bins of the top decile of the
distribution. Therefore the most successful trading firms are disproportionately likely to both export and
import, consistent with the presence of fixed costs of both exporting and importing in the theoretical
framework above.
    Our framework also predicts that the various margins of international participation will interact with
each other. Increases in firm productivity result in more than proportional increases in international trade,
because of the reinforcing connections between exporting and importing. In Figures 2-6 and Table 9, we
examine how the different margins of firm international participation vary across deciles and percentiles
of the value of total firm trade (exports plus imports). The horizontal axis of the graph in the lower left of
each figure represents the ten deciles of firms sorted by their total trade and is held constant across each of
the figures. The horizontal axis of the graph in the upper right hand corner of each figure covers firms in
the 90th to 100th percentiles of the firm total trade distribution and is held constant across the figures. The
vertical axes in the five figures use a log scale. In the main panel of each figure, we report means across
decile bins of total firm trade. In the call-out panel of each figure, we show means across percentile bins
of the top decile of total firm trade.

    As shown in the main panel of Figure 2, the logs of the average values of firm exports and imports
increase monotonically across the first nine deciles of the firm total trade distribution. Total trade for the
average firm increases roughly 225 percent from one decile to the next.35 The picture changes drastically
for the top decile. Average total trade for the largest ten percent of firms is 42 times greater than that of
the previous decile. The biggest traders are far larger than the rest of the trading firms and this pattern
holds for both their imports as well as their exports. Comparing the main and call-out panels of Figure 2,
we find that the distribution of trade across firms has a fractal property, where we find the same pattern
across percentiles of the top decile as across the deciles of the distribution as a whole. Average total trade,
exports and imports increased relatively steadily until the very top percentile when it jumps again. The
top one percent of trades are 15 times larger than the second largest percentile of firms.
    In Figure 3, we calculate the average value of related-party trade (exports plus imports), exports and
imports.36 As is apparent from the main panel, average related-party trade is sharply increasing across the
deciles.37 Again we find a positive correlation between the margins of international participation: firms
that trade more not only import and export more overall, but also import and export more with related
parties. We find that related-party exports and imports increase more rapidly across deciles of the total
trade distribution than overall exports and imports, so that related-party trade accounts for a bigger share
of overall trade for the larger trading firms. Comparing the main and call-out panels of the figure, we again
observe that the results exhibit a fractal property, with the same pattern across percentiles of the top decile
as across the deciles of the distribution as a whole. The average firm in the top percentile of trading firms
conducts 29 times as much related-party trade as the average firm in the next percentile.38
  35 The   growth of exports is slightly lower, 210 percent, while the growth of imports is slightly higher, 244 percent. See Table 9.
  36 To conform with census disclosure requirements we only report results for related-party exports and imports from the fourth

decile upwards.
   37 For evidence on firm productivity as a determinant of related-party trade, see Nunn and Trefler (2008, 2013) and Bernard,

Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2010a).
   38 The sharp increase in the share of related-party trade with the size of firm total trade explains why related-party trade

accounts for around half of aggregate U.S. imports (see Antràs (2003) and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009)), even though intra-
firm shipments are relatively unimportant for the average plant or firm (see Atalay, Hortaçsu, and Syverson (2014) and Ramondo,
Rappaport, and Ruhl (2015)). The key to reconciling these features of the data is that related-party trade is disproportionately
important for the very largest firms that account for a disproportionate share of aggregate trade value.

            Note: Data are from the 2007 LFTTD. Figure displays the average number of related-party export
            products, destinations and product-destinations, as well as the average number of related-party im-
            port products, sources and product-sources, for firms in each quantile of the total trade distribution.
            Products are defined as HS10 categories. Total trade is related-party and arms-length trade (exports
            plus imports). Horizontal axis of the bottom-left figure is the decile of total trade. Horizontal axis
            of the upper-right figure is the percentile of total trade. Vertical axes of both figures use log scales.



   While the first two figures focus on trade values, the next several figures examine the extensive mar-
gins of firm participation in international markets. In Figure 4, we show the number of product-country
observations with positive exports or imports across percentiles of the value of total firm trade. As evident
from the main panel, the product-country extensive margin increases monotonically across deciles of the
total firm trade distribution, with the level of activity in terms of country-products jumping in the highest
decile. Consistent with the predictions of the model, more successful firms trade more than less successful
firms, not only because they export or import more of a given number of products with a given number of
countries, but also because they export and import with more product-country pairs. Again, we find the
same properties across the percentiles of the top decile (in the call-out panel) as across the deciles of the
distribution as a whole (in the main panel).
   In Figures 4 and 5, we break out the product-country extensive margin in the contributions of the
product and country extensive margins separately. As shown in the main panel, the increase in the number
of product-country observations with positive trade across the deciles of the total firm trade distribution
is achieved partly through an increase in the number of products with positive trade and partly through
an increase in the number of countries with positive trade. While the extensive margins for export and
import products rise at approximately the same rate across the deciles of total firm trade, the extensive


                                                                                          41

margin for export destinations rises more rapidly than that for import source countries, suggesting that
fixed sourcing costs are large relative to fixed exporting costs. For all these extensive margins, the level of
activity jumps for the top decile, and the distributions are fractal, in the sense that we observe a similar
pattern across percentiles of the top decile as across the deciles of the distribution as a whole.
    Figure 6 shows the distribution of the extensive margins for related-party trade. The pattern is a
familiar one with a roughly log-linear increase across the deciles until the largest decile where there is a
substantial jump in activity. Again, we see the pattern repeated within the top decile, as the largest trading
firms have many more related-party connections for both imports and exports. This extensive margin of
related-party activity suggests a useful extension of our framework to incorporate the decision whether
to organize overseas production within the boundaries of the firm (foreign direct investment (FDI)) or
through arms-length transactions (outsourcing). Work on firm-level FDI has consistently found that more
productive firms are more likely to be multinationals, i.e. have at least one foreign affiliate, and that the
numbers of host countries and affiliates are increasing in measures of firm performance.39
    Figure 7 shows that the largest trading firms account for larger shares of exports for individual product
markets. The average export market share of a firm’s top product in each market rises systematically across
deciles and percentiles of total trade. The largest firms in terms of total trade have average shares of US
exports for their top product within each market of 25 percent, while firms in the fifth decile average under
7 percent of US exports of their top product within each market. In our model, such variation in market
shares gives rise to strategic market power, and generates variation in markups across firms.

            Note: Data are from the 2007 LFTTD. Figure displays the average across markets of the share of
            a firm’s top product in US exports of that product to that market. We allow the definition of top
            product to vary across markets. We display this average for firms in each quantile of the total trade
            distribution. Total trade is related-party and arms-length trade (exports plus imports). Horizontal
            axis of the bottom-left figure is the decile of total trade. Horizontal axis of the upper-right figure is
            the percentile of total trade. Vertical axes of both figures are fractions.



   Taken together, the results of this section provide further evidence in support of the predictions of
our theoretical model. All the margins of firm international participation strongly co-move together, with
greater participation along one margin correlated with more active engagement along another. In the
model, these correlations are driven by two mechanisms. On the one hand, higher firm productivity propels
greater international participation along all margins simultaneously, because of the non-random selection
of firms into these different activities. On other hand, the decisions to participate in international markets
along each margin are complementary with one another. As more productive firms incur the fixed export-
ing costs of serving additional markets, this increases their production scale, and raises the profitability
of incurring the fixed importing costs for additional countries. Incurring these additional fixed importing
costs in turn reduces production costs, which raises the profitability of incurring the fixed exporting costs
for additional markets. Through these forces of selection and complementarity, exogenous differences
across firms are magnified, such that a relatively small number of firms account for a disproportionately
large share of aggregate trade.

5    Conclusions

Over the last two decades, a growing body of theoretical and empirical research has demonstrated the
role of heterogeneous firm decisions in mediating the economy’s response to international trade. The
now-standard model of heterogeneous firms and trade envisions a continuum of measure zero firms that
compete under conditions of monopolistic competition and self-select into export markets. In this paper,
we review this research and argue that this standard paradigm does not go far enough in recognizing the
role of “global firms,” defined as firms that participate in the international economy along multiple margins
and account for substantial shares of aggregate trade.
    We outline a theoretical framework that recognizes the role played by such global firms. We allow large
firms to internalize the effects of their choices on market aggregates, which results in variable markups,
pricing to market and incomplete pass-through. We include a much richer range of margins along which
firms can participate in international markets than the standard paradigm. Each firm can choose the set
of production locations in which to operate plants; the set of export markets for each plant; the set of
products to export from each plant to each market; the exports of each product from each plant to each
market; the set of countries from which to source intermediate inputs for each plant; and imports of each
intermediate input from each source country by each plant.
    We use U.S. firm and trade transactions data to provide empirical evidence on the predictions of this
framework. Consistent with the selection forces in our model, we show that only a subset of firms partic-
ipate in international markets (through either exporting or importing) and that these trading firms have
superior performance characteristics: they are larger and more productive than purely domestic firms.
We find strong support for our model’s prediction of a correlation between the different margins of firm
participation in the global economy. A substantial fraction of firms that export or import do both. More
successful firms export more of each product to each market, export more products to each market, ex-
port to more markets, import more of each product from each source country, importing more products
from each source country, and import from more source countries. These empirical findings also pro-
vide support for the magnification effects emphasized in our model. Small differences in exogenous firm
characteristics have amplified effects on endogenous firm performance (such as sales), because they are
magnified by these endogenous market participation decisions, thereby helping to explain how a relatively
small number of firms dominate aggregate international trade.
    While much already has been achieved within the literature on heterogeneous firms and trade, there
remains much to be done. Recognizing the importance of global firms opens up a number of avenues for
further research, including their implications for the transmission of international shocks, the elasticity
of trade with respect to trade costs, and the aggregate welfare gains from trade. Although we consider
many margins of firm participation in the international economy, we abstract from the decision whether
to organize global production chains within or beyond the boundaries of the firm, which itself has been

the subject of much recent research. Therefore another interesting area for further inquiry is exploring
the implications of this internalization decision for firm performance and country comparative advantage
in a world of such global firms.

Now we combine (40)-(42). The firm expenditure share increases in productivity in (40), even though the
firm markup increases in productivity in (41). Therefore, from (42), the firm markup must rise less than
