                                         ABSTRACT

During a pandemic, an individual's choices can determine outcomes not only for the individual but
also for the entire community. Beliefs, constraints and preferences may shape behavior. This
paper documents demographic differences in behaviors, beliefs, constraints and risk preferences
across gender, income and political affiliation lines during the new coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pandemic. Our main analyses are based on data from an original nationally
representative survey covering 5,500 adult respondents in the U.S. We find substantial gaps in
behaviors and beliefs across gender, income and partisanship lines; in constraints across income
levels; and in risk tolerance among men and women. Based on location data from a large sample
of smartphones, we also document significant differences in mobility across demographics, which
are consistent with our findings based on the survey data.

1    Introduction

Individual behavioral responses during the outbreak of a highly contagious disease, such as the

COVID-19 pandemic, contribute significantly to public health outcomes. Economic theory suggests

that individual choices are shaped by beliefs, constraints, and preferences. Therefore, it is important

to understand differences in these factors to coordinate an effective response.

    We document substantial differences in behaviors, beliefs, constraints, and risk tolerance regard-

ing the COVID-19 pandemic across gender, income, and political affiliation lines. Our analyses rely

primarily on an original and nationally representative survey conducted weekly between April 1

and April 29, 2020 covering 5,500 individuals. We also use geo-location data from a large sample

of smartphones provided by SafeGraph to examine differences in mobility responses.

    We first document systematic differences along gender, income, and political affiliation lines

in the extent to which Americans curtail their mobility outside the home. Using the geo-location

data, we show that as the pandemic progresses, U.S. counties with higher shares of women and

counties with lower poverty rates reduce both non-work and work trips more than counties in the

same state that are otherwise similar in their local infection risks as well as their demographics

and socio-economic metrics. Counties with higher shares of Democrats respond more in reducing

non-work trips but less in limiting work trips.

    Using survey data, we study a wide variety of social distancing choices that may contribute to

these mobility differences, as well as other precautionary behaviors. Moreover, the survey allows

us to examine heterogeneity not only in actions, but also in preferences, constraints, and beliefs.

We find significant heterogeneity in behaviors and the factors that may shape them among people

who are otherwise similar and live in communities that face similar COVID-19 risks.

    Compared to their respective counterparts, Democrats and women are more likely to limit

socializing with members outside of their household and take other health precautions (e.g., wiping

down groceries, washing hands, and wearing masks), whereas low-income households are less likely

to do so. Low-income households are also less likely to work from home and to avoid large gatherings

and public transportation.

    We also find heterogeneity in beliefs across these demographic lines. Women and Democrats

are more pessimistic about their own health outcomes and/or chances of being infected, expect


                                                  2
more deaths in the U.S., and believe more strongly in the effectiveness of state restrictions. They

are also more worried about the health and economic well-being of themselves and those around

them. In contrast, while low-income respondents worry more about their own economic well-being

than high-income respondents do, they hold more optimistic beliefs about deaths in the U.S. and

believe less in the effectiveness of state restrictions.

   Finally, we find that female respondents and Democrats are less willing than their respective

counterparts to tolerate risk, and that respondents in low-income households are more likely to be

constrained in their ability to self-isolate and to work from home. After presenting these results,

we discuss the relationship between our survey results and the patterns we document in geographic

mobility differences. We also discuss the association between differences in individuals’ behavioral

responses and differences in their beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic.

   Our paper provides insights about several demographic differences regarding a wide span of

behaviors and beliefs, while also examining differences in constraints and risk tolerance. In ad-

dition to documenting partisan differences, we study gaps along gender and income lines, which

prove to be significant. The behaviors we study include work and non-work mobility, as well as

social distancing choices and other precautionary behaviors, providing a comprehensive picture of

demographic differences in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because demographic gaps in

beliefs may not — and indeed do not, according to our results — consistently go in the same direc-

tion, we examine several types of beliefs that may influence individuals’ decisions: beliefs regarding

systemic risk, individual risks of infection and health outcome conditional on infection, and effec-

tiveness of personal and policy efforts. Furthermore, we explore differences in risk tolerance and

constraints, two factors that may also shape behaviors. We document income gaps in constraints

and gender gaps in risk tolerance. While more research is needed to separately quantify the effects

of beliefs, constraints and preferences on decision-making in this pandemic, our results suggest

important differences across demographic dimensions in the extent to which each of these factors

shapes individual behaviors.

   Across gender lines, our results indicate significant differences in behaviors, beliefs and risk

tolerance. A priori, it is unclear how women and men may differ in their work-related mobility

responses and their willingness to take discretionary precautions. For example, women may be more

likely to have jobs that cannot be done at home, but those who can afford it may also be more

                                                    3
likely to stop working to take over childcare and homeschooling (e.g., Adams-Prassl et al. 2020).

Similarly, while women tend to have more friends and derive more support from them (e.g., Walen

and Lachman 2000), they may also be more willing to limit socialization and take other precautions

because in certain contexts they tend to be more risk averse and/or more likely to make sacrifices

for the greater good (e.g., Andreoni and Vesterlund 2001, Croson and Gneezy 2009, Shurchkov and

Eckel 2018). In net, we find that women are more likely than men to limit work trips, less likely

to socialize with friends and extended family and more likely to engage in precautionary health

behaviors. The gender differences in beliefs and risk tolerance we document may contribute to these

findings. Evidence suggests that women’s risk aversion may lead them to make more conservative

choices (e.g., Jianakoplos and Bernasek 1998, Barber and Odean 2001). To the extent that the risk

preference difference contributes to gender differences in actions, our results suggest that women’s

lower risk tolerance may also be socially beneficial, as personal preventive actions are likely to have

positive health spillovers on others.

   Across the political divide, we see substantial differences in behaviors and beliefs. Several

concurrent papers document partisan differences in expectations of U.S. deaths and beliefs regarding

the effectiveness of social distancing (Allcott et al. 2020, Kushner Gadarian et al. 2020), as well as

differences in limiting visits to locations of interest outside of home (e.g., restaurants, retail) before

most states introduced mobility restrictions (Allcott et al. 2020, Andersen 2020, Painter and Qiu

2020). By documenting the differences in beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic, we add to the

literature on partisan perception differences regarding objective outcomes (e.g., Garrett and Lange

1989, Gaines et al. 2007). Evidence on how perception differences along partisan lines translate into

behavioral differences is mixed (e.g., Gerber and Huber 2009, McGrath et al. 2017). Testing whether

differences in beliefs drive differences in actions is beyond the scope of this paper. Nonetheless,

it is interesting that controlling for belief differences almost completely attenuates the behavior

differences we document across the political affiliation divide, and controlling for differences in

news consumption completely attenuates the gaps in beliefs. These results suggest that consistent

and accurate information could play an important role in combating COVID-19.

   Our results along income lines also point to important disparities that policy makers should

consider. Low-income individuals are over-represented in jobs that cannot be done from home;

and consequently, they are more at risk of exposure and job loss (e.g., Adams-Prassl et al. 2020).

                                                    4
At the same time, low-income households are more likely to experience financial strain and have

lower access to credit, health care and health insurance (e.g., Berchick et al. 2019). This paper

documents that low-income individuals are less likely to reduce mobility and are more constrained in

their ability to work from home and in self-isolate. These findings imply an additional disadvantage

that they face during the pandemic. Public policies may need to pay special attention to easing

the constraints on those most severely affected by the pandemic.



2        Observed Mobility Differences: SafeGraph Data Results

In this section, we present empirical patterns from the SafeGraph data as a starting point for

our investigation. SafeGraph is a data company that aggregates anonymized location data from

numerous applications to provide insights about physical places (www.safegraph.com). Using geo-

location data obtained from the activity of more than 35 million smartphones, SafeGraph provides

an aggregated dataset (Social Distancing Metrics) to researchers interested in exploring COVID-

19-related topics. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes a census block group if it has fewer than

five devices observed in a month. For each census block on a given day, Social Distancing Metrics

data report the number of devices exhibiting full-time work behavior (spending more than 6 hours

between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. in one location outside home), part-time work behavior (spending more

than 3 but less than 6 hours between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. in one location outside home), and the

number of devices that stay home all day.1

        We aggregate these data from their original census block group level to the county level and

augment them with county election results from the 2016 presidential election (from MIT Election

Data and Science Lab (2018)) as well as county COVID-19 case and death numbers, county demo-

graphics data on population density, age, education, race, poverty and employment, and rural-urban

descriptors (from Killeen et al. (2020)). Appendix A contains further details on data construction.

        We examine how the shares of devices that left home (for any reason), the shares of devices

that left home for full-time work, for part-time work and for non-work reasons vary with county

demographics between February 1 and April 24 of 2020. Our main specification is as follows:


                                 sct = Dc βw(t) + Zct γw(t) + ζc + ηs(c),t + εct ,                               (1)


where sct is the share of devices in county c on day t exhibiting a particular behavior and Dc is

a vector of county descriptors of interest: percent female, percent voting for Clinton in the 2016

election (termed “Democrats” in the discussion of results), and percent living under the poverty

line. The coefficients of interest, βw(t) , are allowed to vary by week w(t). The control variables Zct

are also allowed to vary weekly in their influence. They include demographic and socioeconomic

controls, and variables to capture differences in COVID-19 risks across counties.2 We include

county fixed-effects (ζc ) to control for cross-sectional differences and state-date fixed effects (ηs(c),t )

to control for state-wide changes in social-distancing policies. Because each observation is a share

in a county, we weight observations by the total number of devices in each county. We also cluster

errors at the county level.

       The dependent variables are computed using the total number of devices in the sample as the

denominator and the number of devices exhibiting certain behaviors as the numerators. SafeGraph

reports a sampling bias in favor of detecting devices that are moving (SafeGraph 2020). We adjust

the share of devices ever leaving home by designating all devices that were inactive on a specific

day and in the sample in that month as “at-home.”3

       Each column of Figure 1 corresponds to a share of devices exhibiting a certain behavior. Each

row corresponds to a demographic variable. The coefficients are estimated relative to the first week

in our sample. The pattern over time is consistent across columns: while differences are nonexistent

or small during February, in cases where differences emerge, plots start to fan out from the zero-line

in early March and stabilize in April. Recall that the first confirmed case in the U.S. was reported

on January 21. States that eventually put restrictions in place did so primarily in the last week of

March or first week of April (see Figure 2 for a timeline of various state interventions).
   2
     These control variables are population shares of whites, blacks, and Asians, percent of adults with a bachelor’s
degree, percent of adults without a high-school degree, unemployment rate, and the employed share of the county
population, as well as logarithm of one plus the number of COVID-19 cases, logarithm of one plus the number of
COVID-19 deaths, logarithm of population density, population share over the age of 65, degree of urbanization, and
a binary variable indicating whether the county is in a metropolitan area.
   3
     Supplemental Appendix SA details this sampling bias and shows the robustness of our results to omitting this
adjustment, to using several different adjustment approaches, and to including varying sets of control variables.



                                                         6
       As the pandemic progresses, the estimates indicate that compared to Republicans, Democrats

respond more in reducing non-work trips, but less in limiting work-related trips. U.S. counties with

high poverty rates become less likely to reduce work and non-work trips than counties with higher

earnings. In contrast, counties with a higher share of women respond more strongly in limiting

non-work and work trips than counties with lower shares of women. The demographic differences in

work travel could be related to differences in the representation of females, low-income workers, and

Democrats in essential jobs and in workplaces allowed or required to stay open.4 Non-work trips

may include both necessities (e.g., grocery shopping) and discretionary trips (e.g., visiting friends

and extended family). Next, we use our survey data to study different types of social distancing

choices that may contribute to these mobility differences. In Section 4, we discuss these mobility

results in light of what we learn from the survey.



3 Actions, Beliefs, Constraints and Risk Tolerance: Survey Results

This section examines how different types of social distancing choices and other preventive choices,

as well as potential drivers of actions (i.e., beliefs, constraints, and risk tolerance) vary across

partisan, gender, and income lines. To this end, we conducted a survey in five weekly waves during

April 2020. Our sample comprises 5,500 respondents and is nationally representative in geography,

age, gender and ethnicity (see Appendix B for survey details).

       To examine heterogeneity in actions, beliefs, constraints and risk tolerance, we use the following

regression equation:

                                        Yiτ = Di α + Xiτ λ + ξs(i)τ + εiτ                                        (2)

where Yiτ is an outcome variable of interest, i.e., an action, belief, constraint, or preference of

respondent i at time τ . We explain these dependent variables as we discuss our results. The vector

Di represents the demographic variables of interest: respondent i’s political affiliation (Democrat,

Republican, or Independent), gender (female or male), and annual household income (less than

$30,000, between $30,000 and $74,999, or above $75,000). The control variables Xiτ include the
   4
    For example, Sperling (2020) and Ingraham (2020) note that many essential workers tend to have lower incomes.
Delaporte and Peña (2020) show that higher-income individuals are more likely to be able to work from home due
to the nature of their jobs. Similarly, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) note that lower-income individuals are more likely
to work in occupations in which only a small share of tasks can be done from home. Studying mobility in New York
City, Coven and Gupta (2020) show that low-income residents are less likely to stay at home.

population density of the respondent’s zip code, the number of positive COVID-19 cases and deaths

in the respondent’s county at the time of the survey, and demographic variables such as age, race,

educational level, and current employment status. Finally, we include state-time fixed effects, ξs(i)τ ,

where subscripts refer to state s(i) at time τ , to capture systematic differences across states at the

time of each survey wave.


3.1      Heterogeneous Actions

In the survey, we ask “Which of the following changes have you personally made to protect yourself

from the coronavirus infection?” for a set of actions: (1) self-isolate at home and avoid all public

places; (2) avoid public transportation and large gatherings; (3) work from home; (4) do not meet

friends or extended family; (5) wash hands more often; (6) wipe down groceries after bringing them

home; (7) wear a mask when out and about; and (8) wear gloves when going shopping.5 These

questions fall into two broad groups: social distancing decisions that may contribute to the mobility

differences documented in Section 2 (items (1) – (4); results presented in the left panel of Figure 3),

and other health precautions individuals may take that are difficult to glean from any observational

data (items (5) – (8); results presented in the right panel of Figure 3).

       Overall, our results suggest that women and Democrats are taking more precautions than their

counterparts and that low-income individuals are less likely to do so than higher-income ones. The

results in the left panel of Figure 3 document that low-income respondents are less likely to work

from home or avoid large gatherings, and that Democrats and women are more likely to avoid large

gatherings than Republicans and men. The decision to stop seeing friends and extended family

may be the most discretionary of all actions contributing to mobility. Democrats and women are

more likely to limit socialization than Republicans and men, while low-income respondents are

less likely to do so than high-income respondents. The gender difference in the propensity to stop

socializing with friends and extended family is the largest across all actions studied. The right

panel of Figure 3 shows that low-income individuals are less likely to take other health precautions

than higher-income respondents, whereas Democrats and women are more likely to do so than
   5
     The survey also asked whether respondents canceled travel plans and an open-ended question about any additional
precautions they took. A very low proportion of respondents took other precautions. Travel cancellation is heavily
influenced by having travel plans to begin with. Nonetheless, using the same regression (2), we find that low-income
individuals are less likely to cancel travel plans. There are no gender or partisan differences in cancelling travel plans.



                                                            8
their counterparts. As Supplementary Appendix SB reports, these results are robust to controlling

for respondents’ personal experience (i.e., whether the virus has affected a respondent’s health or

the health of a family member or a close friend) and pre-existing health conditions (diabetes, high

blood pressure, chronic pulmonary disease, etc.). Next, we examine heterogeneity in factors that

may contribute to differences in these decisions.


3.2      Heterogeneous Beliefs and Worries

The survey asked respondents how worried they feel for their own health, and the health of their

partner, kids, extended family, members of their community, and the whole U.S. It also asked

how worried they feel for the economic well-being of the same groups of people. The survey also

elicited three types of beliefs: (1) Individuals’ predictions on their own health risks: (1.1) chance of

becoming infected in the next three months assuming that the social distancing policies and their

personal protection efforts stay the same; (1.2) chance of having no or mild symptoms should they

get infected. (2) Their predictions on systemic health risks: the number of U.S. deaths by July 1,

2020 assuming the state policies remain the same. (3) Their beliefs regarding the effectiveness of

state policies and preventive actions: (3.1) how their infection chance would change if their state

had not introduced social distancing measures, assuming their personal efforts stay the same; (3.2)

how their infection chance would change if they had not taken preventive actions, assuming that

the state policies stay the same; and (3.3) their prediction on the number of U.S. deaths by July

1, 2020 if there were no social distancing measures.

       Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 3 present heterogeneity in predictions regarding own or systemic

health risks and the effectiveness of state policies and personal precautions, respectively. Democrats

(and to a lesser extent, Independents) are generally more pessimistic about health outcomes and

believe more in the effectiveness of policies and preventive actions than Republicans.6 Women are

more pessimistic than men about their health outcomes should they get infected and are stronger

believers than men in the effectiveness of state policies and of their own preventive actions. Low-

income respondents are more optimistic about the number of deaths they expect in the U.S. and

do not believe in the effectiveness of personal measures or state policies as much as higher-income
   6
    Beliefs regarding effectiveness of own actions could be driven partially by differences in the propensity to take
precautions.



                                                         9
households do.

      In addition to gaps in beliefs, we also see that women and Democrats worry more than their

counterparts about health and economic well-being (Figure 4, panels (c) and (d)), ranging from their

own health or economic well-being to their partner’s, local community’s, and the whole nation’s.

The difference between women and men is the largest for worries about their children’s health.

How much respondents worry about their own health or the health of others does not seem to vary

based on household income, but low-income respondents worry more about their own economic

well-being than high-income ones do.

      These results are robust to controlling for respondents’ personal experience and pre-existing

health conditions (see Supplemental Appendix SB). Moreover, these belief differences line up with

the differences in actions we have documented. We discuss this association in Section 4, where we

also explore heterogeneity in news consumption.


3.3     Heterogeneous Constraints

To understand the constraints in people’s ability to take preventive actions and how such constraints

vary demographically, we asked people who said they had not taken an action to indicate the

reason that best describes why. The response options fall into “constrained” and “unconstrained”

categories. For example, if a respondent does not work from home, we consider the reason to be in

the “constrained” category if her answer indicates that her work cannot be done from home or her

employer did not give her the option. However, if her answer is “I could perhaps work from home,

but it’s better not to / I don’t like to,” we consider her choice to be unconstrained.

      Overall, our results suggest that constraints play some role in people’s ability to take certain

preventive actions. We find that a non-negligible proportion of people indicate constraints as the

main reason for not taking certain actions. For example, 19.3% of respondents who continued to

work outside cited constraints as the main reason for not working from home. Similarly, 12.4%

of respondents who did not avoid all public places or self-isolate at home indicated that they did

not do so because of constraints.7 We also find heterogeneity in constraints across demographics.

Figure 5 shows that the extent to which constraints are reported as the main reason for not isolating
  7
   In computing these shares and constructing the sample for the estimation in this section, we drop respondents
whose answers indicate that the action is not applicable in their case.



                                                      10
and not working from home is much higher for low-income respondents. All other estimates are

statistically insignificant, indicating that for those who do not take these preventive actions, there

is no systematic partisan or gender differences in their abilities to do so.


3.4   Heterogeneous Risk Preference

To explore systematic differences in risk tolerance, we add to our April 22 and 29 surveys the

question “Thinking about yourself, in general, how willing or unwilling are you to take risks?”

(ratings ranged from 0 “completely unwilling to take risks” to 10 “very willing to take risks”). This

subjective self-assessment has been shown to be correlated with risk-taking behaviors in field and

laboratory experiments and is used to measure risk preferences across the world (e.g., Vieider et al.

2015, Falk et al. 2018).

    We find women to be less willing than men to take risks even after controlling for socio-economic

and demographic differences such as employment status and educational level. The average score in

the sample is 5.45 with a standard deviation of 2.65. Examining heterogeneity across demographics,

we find a substantial gender gap: women are much less risk tolerant than men (α = 0.88, s.e.= 0.12).

Republicans are, on average, more willing take risks, but the partisan gaps are smaller than the

gender gap: the estimated differences are 0.47 points (s.e.= 0.14) for Democrats vs. Republicans

and 0.45 points (s.e.= 0.15) for Independents vs. Republicans.



4     Discussion

In this section, we discuss the relationships among the various results we have documented thus

far. We first highlight the relationship between mobility patterns documented in Section 2 and our

survey results presented in Section 3. Recall that our analysis of the SafeGraph data suggests that

people who live in counties with higher shares of Democrats and women and lower shares of poverty

respond more strongly to the pandemic in limiting their non-work trips than their counterparts.

These non-work trips may include discretionary outings and necessary trips like grocery shopping.

Our survey confirms that Democrats, women and higher-income people are less likely to meet

friends and extended family, suggesting that differences in non-work trip patterns are not driven

solely by differences in necessities.

      At the same time, the survey also highlights that differences in necessities do seem to matter.

When asked the main reasons they did not work from home or avoid public places and self-isolate,

lower-income individuals are more likely to cite constraints than higher-income ones. This result

suggests that the larger reduction in work trips in counties with lower poverty shares is likely to be

driven by differences in necessities and in demographics of essential workers, not just by personal

choice.

      In addition to explaining mobility differences, the survey contributes to our understanding of

other precautions individuals may take. Overall, we see that the propensity to limit discretionary

mobility and the likelihood of taking other health precautions go together.

      Furthermore, looking across the demographic differences in actions and beliefs, we see that

groups that engage more in preventive actions are also more worried about the health and economic

impact of the pandemic, are less optimistic about their infection risks and health outcomes, and

are stronger believers in the effectiveness of state policies and personal preventive actions. In sum,

heterogeneity in actions and heterogeneity in beliefs seem to be consistent with each other. To

what extent does controlling for heterogeneity in beliefs attenuate heterogeneity in actions?

      To answer this question, we repeat our action regressions, now including elicited beliefs as

control variables (see Appendix C for more details and results). Once we account for heterogeneity

in beliefs, the behavioral differences between Democrats and Republicans in their propensity to

physically distance themselves from others or to take other preventive actions are largely attenuated

(except for the differences in wearing masks). Though this exercise is not meant to identify a causal

impact of beliefs on actions,8 this result points to a strong association between differences in beliefs

and differences in actions across partisan lines.

      After we control for belief differences, women remain more likely to stop seeing friends and

extended family, wear masks, and wash hands more often. Similarly, the findings that low-income

respondents are less likely to work from home or stop seeing friends and extended family remain

significant. These results suggest that additional factors are important in understanding these

behavioral differences across gender and income. This paper highlights constraints and risk prefer-

ences as two examples of such factors.

   Beliefs may be endogenous in such regressions, for instance, due to motivated reasoning or due to a common
unobservable shock to actions and beliefs.

        Recall that we find large differences in beliefs across individuals facing the same public health

crisis. Such belief heterogeneity could be related to systematic differences in information sources.

To examine this possibility, we asked survey respondents about the news sources they usually rely

on and how much attention they pay to other information sources such as friends, their governor,

the President and his administration, etc. Using these data, we repeat our belief regressions after

adding controls for news sources that respondents find reliable and other information sources that

respondents pay attention to (see Appendix D for more details on these control variables and es-

timation results). We find that variations in news and other information sources almost entirely

attenuate belief differences across political affiliation. The attenuation is less pronounced for dif-

ferences across gender or household income. While this result does not necessarily imply a causal

effect of news consumption on beliefs, the asymmetry in the attenuation effect of these controls

suggests a partisan difference in the type of information people consume – a fact that has been

independently documented in other contexts.9 Because partisan differences in news consumption

can lead to differences in behaviors, our results suggest the importance of disseminating consistent

public messages about the COVID-19 pandemic for an effective public health response.



5        Conclusion

By documenting heterogeneity across demographics in people’s actions, beliefs, constraints and

risk preferences in the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper takes a step toward understanding how

the pandemic affects people in different demographic groups and aims to inform targeted policy

discussions as the economy opens up. For example, to the extent that beliefs shape actions, an

effort to reach people of all ideologies with a consistent message may help to unify the public

response to the pandemic. We also find that a significant proportion of respondents cite constraints

as the main reason for not working from home or self-isolating; moreover, this share is larger

for lower-income households. Furthermore, we find that women are, on average, significantly less

tolerant of risk. They also worry more about their own health and the health of those around them

(in particular, their kids’ health) and take more preventive actions. These differences should be

considered in policy discussions, especially since early efforts to reopen the economy are likely to
    9

A        SafeGraph Data Details

We aggregate the data from the Census Block Group to the county level and merge the county-

level demographic, voting, and COVID-19 cases and deaths datasets with the social distancing

data. We exclude Alaska and territories of the U.S. Following SafeGraph notifications, we drop

one date (2/25/2020) known to cause a disproportional number of people to appear to be at home

even if they were not.

       The SafeGraph data are nationally representative in the three demographic aspects we study.

Table A.1 shows that the national shares and sample shares are very close.

B        Survey Details

We repeated our survey across five weekly waves spanning April, 2020: April 1 (N=482), April 8

(N=1,974), April 15 (N=1,027), April 22 (N=988), and April 29 (N=1,029). All surveys included

questions on expectations and worries about how the pandemic may affect the health and economic

well-being of themselves and others, policy attitudes, and news consumption patterns. Questions

on self protective actions were introduced on April 8. Questions about constraints were introduced

on April 15; the risk preference assessment was introduced on April 22. The survey is replicated in

Supplemental Appendix SC.

       We fielded the survey on Lucid (https://luc.id/theorem/) and aimed for a nationally represen-

tative population of adults (age 18 or over) living in the U.S.10 Our data are indeed representative

of the U.S. adult population in terms of age, ethnicity, gender, political affiliation, income and
  10
    An independent academic study, Coppock and McClellan (2019), examined the validity of Lucid in terms of
respondent characteristics and treatment effect estimates and concluded that “subjects recruited from the Lucid
platform constitute a sample that is suitable for evaluating many social scientific theories, and can serve as a drop-in
replacement for many scholars currently conducting research on Mechanical Turk or other similar platforms.”

Review Board (IRB) reviewed the surveys and determined that they are exempt from ongoing re-

view (HUM00148129, HUM00180582). We map zip codes to counties and merge with the external

datasets to get local population density, COVID-19 infection, and death counts. The IRB has also

approved this merge (HUM00180640).



C      Heterogeneity in Actions, Adding Beliefs as Control Variables

Figure C.1 informs the discussion in Section 4. It plots the estimates without and with beliefs

controls (both sets of estimations also include baseline controls and controls for health risk factors

and personal experience with COVID-19). Belief controls include respondents’ outcome predictions,

effectiveness beliefs, and health worries.

Notes: For each of the actions indicated in the legend, this figure plots two sets of the estimated coefficients α in

Figure D.1 also informs the discussion in Section 4. It plots the estimates without and with news

consumption controls (both sets of estimations also include baseline controls and controls for health

risk factors and personal experience with COVID-19). News consumption controls include dummy

variables for news sources that respondents follow (ABC News, CNN, Fox News Channel, Local

news, MSNBC, NPR, HuffPost, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington

Post, other, or none) and metrics that capture how much attention they pay to other information

sources (friends, family members, pastor and/or spiritual community, the President and his ad-

ministration, the respondent’s governor, scientists/researchers, Centers for Disease Control, people

they follow on Twitter, and people they follow on Facebook) rated on a 1–5 scale (5-point rating:

not at all–very much so).

SA      Robustness: SafeGraph Data Analyses

We conduct two sets of robustness analyses to show how our results in Section 2 vary with different

adjustment methods and control variables.


SA.1    Robustness of Mobility Results w.r.t. Different Controls

First, we investigate how our controls modify the results. In Figure SA.1, we plot results from

three different specifications: (1) a specification with only state-date and county fixed effects as

controls; (2) a specification adding socio-economic and demographic controls, i.e., Zc = Z1c , which

includes the population shares of whites, blacks and Asians, percent of adults with a bachelor’s

degree, percent of adults without a high-school degree, unemployment rate, and the employed share

of county population; and (3) our baseline specification with the full set of controls, i.e., Zct =

(Z1c , Z2ct ), where Z2ct captures the time-varying differences in COVID-19 risks across counties:

logarithm of one plus the number of COVID-19 cases in county c at time t, logarithm of one plus

the number of COVID-19 deaths, logarithm of population density, population share over the age of

65, degree of urbanization, and a binary variable indicating whether the county is in a metropolitan

area.

   Figure SA.1 shows that mobility response gaps in leaving home would be larger if we did not

include the full set of controls Zct in our analyses. The gaps are attenuated by the inclusion of

demographic controls, and further attenuated by the inclusion of local COVID-19 risks. These

results suggest that part of the differences reported by the popular press across these demographic

dimensions may be due to other co-varying factors.


SA.2    Robustness of Mobility Results w.r.t. Different Adjustment Methods

In the SafeGraph data, the number of completely-at-home devices could be under-reported due to

a sampling bias. SafeGraph (2020) reports: “GPS data from smartphones is often subject to a

sampling bias in favor of devices that are changing locations (i.e., moving). Collecting GPS data

is battery intensive, and software applications sometimes implement GPS data collection methods

that depend on movement of the device, rather than a fixed time interval. This represents a

sampling bias in favor of detecting devices that are moving.”

Figure SA.1: Shares of Devices Engaging in Different Types of Activity, with Different Sets of
Controls, SafeGraph Data




Notes: This figure plots three sets of βw(t) estimates and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals obtained by
estimating equation (1) with only state-date and county fixed effects (estimates indicated by green dots), with
controls Z1c added (red triangles) and the full specification with all controls Z1c , Z2c (blue squares). Each row plots
the estimated coefficient for a specific demographic variable (% Democrat, % population below poverty line, and %
female). The y-axis markers indicate the beginning date of the week for which the coefficients are reported.

                                               Supplemental Appendix


   In the main text, we report results after adjusting the share of devices at home by designating

all inactive devices as completely-at-home. We can do so because SafeGraph reports all devices

in its sample during a month, regardless of whether it saw any activity for them on a specific

day within the month (candidate device count). This adjustment provides an upper bound of the

number of completely-at-home devices. SafeGraph also reports the number of devices that “pinged”

during a given day (active device count). In this section, we report results using different metrics

and adjustment methods based on candidate device count or active device count. We explore the

robustness of our results to the following four alternatives:

  1. Not adjusting the share of devices at home. This approach assumes there is no

     under-reporting of completely-at-home devices. Therefore, the unadjusted share sat-home =

     100×(completely-at-home devices/candidate devices) is a lower bound. This robustness check

     impacts only the results on the share of people who “Leave Home”; it does not impact the

     other shares because the denominator for all shares remains the same as in the baseline.

  2. Calculating the number of “expected” active devices based on the maximum ratio

     of active devices to candidate devices in the first week. In this approach, we calculate

     the maximum ratio active devices to candidate devices in a day during the first week, assume

     it to be the ratio of the latent true number of active devices to candidate devices and assume

     this ratio to be stable over time. We then calculate the “expected active device count” as

     the candidate device count multiplied by the initial ratio on each day. We use this expected

     number of active devices in each county as the base and adjust the at-home device count

     accordingly. We define the dependent variables as: spart-time = 100 × ( part-time work devices
                                                                              expected device count ),

     sfull-time = 100 × ( full-time work devices
                          expected device count ), sleave-home = 100 − sat-home , where sat-home = 100 ×

     ( completely-at-home devices+max{0,expected   device count - active devices}
                                expected device count                             ), and snot-work = 100−sat-home −

     spart-time − sfull-time .

  3. Using active devices as the base for computing shares, and not adjusting for

     under-reporting. This approach provides an alternative lower bound for the share of at-

     home devices. The dependent variables are defined as: spart-time = 100 × ( part-time work devices
                                                                                    active devices     ),

     sfull-time = 100 × ( full-time work devices
                               active devices    ), sleave-home = 100 − sat-home where sat-home = 100 ×
         completely-at-home devices
     (         active device        ),   and snot-work = 100 − sat-home − spart-time − sfull-time .

                                          Supplemental Appendix


  4. Using the maximum active devices in the first week for each county as the base

     and adjusting the at-home devices accordingly. In this approach, we calculate the

     largest number of active devices in a day during the first week for each county (“initial

     active device”), assume it to be the latent true number of active devices and assume this

     latent number to be stable over time. This approach provides an alternative upper bound

     for the share of at-home devices. We define the dependent variables as: spart-time = 100 ×

     ( part-time  work devices                      full-time work devices
        initial active devices ), sfull-time = 100×( initial active devices ), sleave-home = 100−sat-home , where
                                                                 active devices - active devices }
     sat-home = 100×( completely-at-home devices+max{0,initial
                                               initial active devices                              ), and snot-work =

     100 − sat-home − spart-time − sfull-time .

   In Figure SA.2, we report estimates from these robustness specifications. The first column,

where the dependent variable is ‘Leave Home,’ depicts results from all four specifications. Other

columns report results from the latter three specifications, since the first alternative does not

impact the construction of these three dependent variables. Although the results change with the

assumptions, the general message of our findings stays the same.

SB      Robustness: Survey Data Analyses

In this section, we present robustness checks of our survey results. Just as gender, party affiliation,

and income may co-vary with other demographics, they may also co-vary with health risks and

personal experience with COVID-19, which in turn may impact individuals’ actions and beliefs.

Therefore, we collected data on these factors and checked the robustness of our results by includ-

ing them as controls. Figures SB.1 and SB.2, on action heterogeneity and belief heterogeneity,

respectively, report results from a specification including controls for personal health risks and per-

sonal experience with the disease. Personal experience variables include whether the respondent

had the disease, whether she/he had a family member or a close friend who got ill with COVID-

19, and whether she/he has a family member or a close friend who was hospitalized or died due

to COVID-19. The question on personal health risks is based on the risk factors listed by the

Centers for Disease Control on April 1st , including moderate to severe asthma; COPD or other

chronic lung disease; serious heart conditions; diabetes; conditions that can cause a person to be

immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation,

immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other

immune-weakening medications; severe obesity (BMI of 40 or higher); chronic kidney disease and

currently undergoing dialysis; and liver disease. Because Wave 1 surveys did not ask the personal

health risk question, we also replicate our main results excluding Wave 1 respondents as a baseline

for comparison in the figure (coefficients indicated with hollow markers). Including health risks

and personal experience controls does not substantially change our results.

Beliefs About Infection Risk

       As of April 20, 2020, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is reporting 776,093

confirmed coronavirus cases and 41,758 deaths in the U.S. Many cases go undetected.11 Of course,
  11
    The date and these two numbers were updated to the applicable information of two days prior to the survey
time.

                                     Supplemental Appendix


infection rates depend on the community and the protection measures each person can take. As-

suming that the social distancing policies and your personal efforts stay the same, what are the

chances that you will get infected with the coronavirus in the next three months? [Choose one:

0% chance; 1-10% chance; 11-20% chance; 21-30% chance; 31-40% chance; 41-50% chance; 51-60%

chance; 61-70% chance; 71-80% chance; 81-90% chance; 91-100% chance.]

Beliefs About the Effectiveness of State Restrictions and Own Precautions in Reducing

Infection Risk

   The next two questions embedded responses from previous questions. If respondent indicated

that their state has not introduced any social distancing measures, or that they have not taken any

precautions, the relevant question was not displayed to the respondent.

   • Earlier, the survey asked about the changes you personally made to protect yourself from the

     coronavirus infection. You indicated that you [all precautions the the respondent indicated

     as having taken]. Assuming that the state policies stay the same, what do you think your

     chances of becoming infected with coronavirus in the next three months would be if you did

     not make these changes? [Choose one: Same chance; 5% higher chance; 10% higher chance;

     15% higher chance; 20% higher chance; 25% higher chance; 30% higher chance; 40% higher

     chance; 50% higher chance; My chance of being infected would increase by more than 50%.]

   • Imagine that you could still take the same measures you personally took to lower your chances

     of being infected with coronavirus, but your state had not introduced any social distancing

     measures. Assuming your personal efforts stay the same, what do you think your chances of

     becoming infected with coronavirus in the next three months would be if your state did not

     have social distancing measures? [Choose one: Same chance; 5% higher chance; 10% higher

     chance; 15% higher chance; 20% higher chance; 25% higher chance; 30% higher chance; 40%

     higher chance; 50% higher chance; My chance of being infected would increase by more than

     50%.]

Beliefs About Health Outcomes Conditional on Being Infected

   • According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) report, about 7% of

     people diagnosed with the coronavirus are hospitalized, but do not need intensive care. About

                                                35
                                      Supplemental Appendix


    1.5% of people are hospitalized and need intensive care. It is also suspected that a large

    percentage of people are symptom free and/or have mild versions of the disease.

    Most importantly, the chances are person-specific. The progression of the disease can be very

    different based on your age, health, pre-existing condition, living conditions, how much of the

    virus you are exposed to, etc. Although it’s hard to know without data, you probably have

    a better understanding of your situation than anyone else. Therefore, we ask you to predict

    how the coronavirus is likely to affect you, should you get infected:

    Please make sure numbers add up to 100. Allocate points according to how big you think your

    chances are for each possibility. [Chances that I will be symptom free are: (fill in, numerical);

    Chances that I will have a mild version of the disease are: (fill in, numerical); Chances that I

    will have a moderate version (without hospitalization) are: (fill in, numerical); Chances that

    I will have a severe version that requires hospitalization (but no further interventions) are:

    (fill in, numerical); Chances that I will have a severe version that requires intensive care at

    the hospital are: (fill in, numerical).]


Factual Questions About Factors That Influence Health Outcomes

  • Quality of care. Communities differ in how well equipped their hospitals are and how much

    capacity their hospitals have when it comes to coronavirus infections. If you were to be

    hospitalized due to coronavirus, what’s your expectation of the quality of care you would

    receive? [Choose one: Top-notch care, no issues; Good care, as usual; Good care, but hospital

    would have bed/equipment shortages; OK care, as usual; OK care, but hospital would have

    bed/equipment shortages; Not so good care, as usual; Not so good care, and hospital would

    have bed/equipment shortages.]

  • Pre-existing health conditions. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) re-

    leased the list of underlying medical conditions that put people of all ages at higher risk for

    severe illness resulting from the coronavirus infection. We list them below.

    Which of these apply to you? Please click all that apply. [Choose all that apply: Moderate

    to severe asthma; COPD or other chronic lung disease; Serious heart conditions; Diabetes;

    Conditions that can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment,

                                                36

      smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV

      or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications.; Se-

      vere obesity (BMI of 40 or higher); Chronic kidney disease and currently undergoing dialysis;

      Liver disease; I do not want to answer; None of them apply to me.]

Beliefs About Systemic Health Risk (Total Number of Deaths in the U.S.)


   • As of April 20, 2020, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is reporting 41,758

      deaths in the US.12 Assuming the state policies remain the same, how many people do you

      think will die from a coronavirus infection in the U.S. by July 1, 2020? [Choose one: less than

      25,000; 25,000–50,000; 50,000–75,000; 75,000–100,000; 100,000–125,000; 125,000–150,000;

      275,000–300,000; 300,000–350,000; more than 350,000.]


Beliefs About Economic Outcomes


   • The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew about 2.3% in 2019. Assuming the state policies

      remain the same, how much GDP growth do you expect in 2020? [Choose one: more than 10%

      growth; 5%–10% growth; 2.5%–5% growth; 0–2.5% growth; 0% to -2.5% growth (negative

      growth means contraction); -2.5% to -5% growth (negative growth means contraction); -5%

      to -10% growth (negative growth means contraction); -10% to -20% growth (negative growth

      means contraction); -20% to -30% growth (negative growth means contraction); worse than

      -30% growth (negative growth means contraction).]

   • In the last quarter of 2019, unemployment rate in the U.S. was 3.6%. Assuming the state

      policies remain the same, how much unemployment do you expect in the U.S. by July 1,

      2020? [Choose one: less than 3%; 3-5%; 5-10%; 10-15%; 15-20%; 20-25%; 25-30%; more than

      30%.]

   At this time, the majority of states are implementing some measure of social distancing. Assum-

ing there are no changes to these policies, you expect that by July 1st [reminder of their previous

death prediction] people in the U.S. will die due to coronavirus infections. You also expect [reminder

of their previous unemployment prediction] rate of unemployment by July 1st, and [reminder of

their previous GPD growth prediction] in GDP in 2020. How would these predictions change if

none of the states implemented any social distancing measures?

   • Please select the number of U.S. deaths you would expect by July 1st if there were no social

     distancing measures. [Choose one: less than 25,000; 25,000–50,000; 50,000–75,000; 75,000–

Constraints as Main Drivers of Choices

   Everyone has different preferences, risks, constraints in their lives. Earlier in the survey, we

asked you what self-protective measures you took, if any. On this page, we ask why you did not

choose some of the self-protective actions. These questions are not meant as a judgement. They

aim to understand what actually drives people’s decisions. Please answer them honestly. We want

to know more about people’s preferences and circumstances. The questions below were asked if the

applicable precaution was not taken by the respondent.
