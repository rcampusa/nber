                                          ABSTRACT

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many localities instituted non-essential business closure
orders, keeping individuals categorized as essential workers at the frontlines while sending their
non-essential counterparts home. We examine the extent to which being designated as an
essential or non-essential worker impacts one's risk of being Covid-positive following the non-
essential business closure order in Pennsylvania. We also assess the intrahousehold transmission
risk experienced by their cohabiting family members and roommates. Using a difference-in-
differences framework, we estimate that workers designated as essential have a 55% higher
likelihood of being positive for Covid-19 than those classified as non-essential; in other words,
non-essential workers experience a protective effect. While members of the health care and social
assistance subsector contribute significantly to this overall effect, it is not completely driven by
them. We also find evidence of intrahousehold transmission that differs in intensity by essential
status. Dependents cohabiting with an essential worker have a 17% higher likelihood of being
Covid-positive compared to those cohabiting with a non-essential worker. Roommates cohabiting
with an essential worker experience a 38% increase in likelihood of being Covid-positive.
Analysis of households with a Covid-positive member suggests that intrahousehold transmission
is an important mechanism

1. Introduction

Reopening the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic involves striking a delicate balance under massive

uncertainty. Policymakers face tremendous pressure to balance concerns about harm from the Covid-19

pandemic with concerns about the negative impact of the lockdown on the welfare and livelihoods of

people. With over 52 million Americans filing claims for unemployment insurance from March 14 to

August 8, 2020 (United States Department of Labor 2020), and over 15 million additional Americans

filing for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (assistance available to informal sector workers such as

those who are self-employed, seeking part-time employment, or who otherwise would not qualify for

regular unemployment compensation) as of August 22, 2020 (United States Department of Labor 2020),

the Covid-19 pandemic the has led to an unprecedented level of unemployment in the United States

rivaling only the Great Depression.

        Globally, 93% of the world's workers reside in countries with some sort of business closure

measure in place since the start of 2020 (International Labour Organization 2020), with many jobs

shifting into the home. Jobs that have not shifted into the home environment during the pandemic are, for

the most part, jobs designated as "essential." Workers of these essential jobs have helped society maintain

a semblance of normalcy. The most obvious in this group are health care workers, but employees working

in grocery stores, delivery services, factories and farms, restaurants, transportation, and other industries

are also considered essential workers. Individually, these workers face the same tradeoff confronted by

society at large: on the one hand, essential workers take on greater risk of Covid-19 infection to

themselves and their families, but on the other hand, they maintain financial viability. Conversely, non-

essential workers and their families may be less at risk of Covid-19 infection, but these workers may be

more likely to become unemployed or underemployed.

        At the societal level, closure of non-essential businesses has been shown to be effective in

reducing Covid-19 mortality (Ciminelli and Garcia-Mandico 2020), but a lockdown of all non-essential

workers is unlikely to be cost-effective for an extended period (Fischer 2020). Prior work has already

shown that closure of non-essential businesses jeopardized almost a quarter of jobs in the U.S. and


                                                      3
reduced total wage income (del Rio-Chanona et al. 2020), had a perverse effect on wage inequality

(Schiavone 2020), and increased unemployment mostly among minorities (Fairlie, Couch, and Xu 2020).

Furthermore, designating businesses as essential or non-essential shifted consumer activity to favor those

categorized as essential. For example, during stay-at-home orders, consumption patterns shifted from

restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food vendors, while maintaining a small impact on

aggregate levels of activity (Goolsbee and Syverson 2020). Similarly, essential retail ­ the "frontline" job

most in demand during the pandemic ­ took a much smaller hit in job vacancies, while leisure and

hospitality services and non-essential retail saw the biggest collapses (Forsythe et al. 2020).

        Importantly, however, essential workers may be at higher risk of exposure to Covid-19 infection

(Mutambudzi et al. 2020) and also be at greater risk of infecting others. Individuals most susceptible to

infection by essential workers are likely to be those living under the same roof ­ such as cohabiting

family members. Several epidemiologic studies from China have confirmed that intrahousehold

transmission is a major route by which children become infected with the virus (Cai et al. 2020, Liu et al.

2020, Tan et al. 2020). One early study found that more than half of all patients with Covid-19 had at

least one family member with the disease, and 75 to 80% of all clustered infections were within families

(Chen et al. 2020). Additional work found that household transmission accounted for 30% to 55% of

Covid-19 positive cases after social distancing was implemented (Curmei et al. 2020). These findings

suggest that intrahousehold transmission may be an effective target for policy interventions.

        In this paper, we examine the extent to which designation as an essential worker versus a non-

essential worker impacts one's risk of being positive for Covid-19 following the statewide non-essential

business closure order in Pennsylvania. We also assess the intrahousehold transmission risk experienced

by cohabiting family members and roommates of essential workers versus non-essential workers. This is

a unique analytic problem, as it requires us to link Covid-19 status, employment sector, and physical

address to establish cohabitation status, all at the individual level. Notably, it requires data from not only

individuals testing positive for Covid-19 but also those not tested or testing negative. Data from health

systems and government agencies lack the level of granularity and visibility into those individuals who


                                                       4
have not tested positive, thus making it impossible to assess the impact of non-essential business closures

on rates of Covid-19 infection among those working in essential versus non-essential businesses and

those who live in proximity to them. Using data collected by Independence Blue Cross (Independence; a

large commercial health insurer based in southeast Pennsylvania), we are able to construct a uniquely

detailed dataset that merges individual-level Covid-19 status using medical insurance claims, enrollment

and demographic information, and employer industry using North American Industry Classification

(NAICS) codes, which were used to identify a individuals as essential or non-essential workers. This

dataset is also unique in its breadth. Independence provides medical insurance to more than 50% of

commercially insured individuals in the Greater Philadelphia area. The analyses presented here represent

a substantial portion of essential and non-essential workers in the fifth largest metropolitan area in the

United States.

        We use a difference-in-differences framework to estimate that essential workers, relative to their

non-essential counterparts, have a 55% higher likelihood of being positive for Covid-19. Said differently,

non-essential workers experience a substantially lower risk of being positive for Covid-19 compared to

their essential counterparts. While members of the health care and social assistance subsector contribute

significantly to this overall effect, it is not completely driven by them. We also find evidence of

intrahousehold transmission that differs in intensity by essential status.



2. Background

On March 19, 2020, less than two weeks after declaring a state of emergency for the Commonwealth of

Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf and Secretary of Health Rachel Levine issued a statewide order for all

non-life-sustaining businesses in Pennsylvania to close their physical locations (Governor Tom Wolf

2020a). These orders were enforced by law; consequences of failed compliance with the order included

citations, fines, or license suspensions. Accompanying the order, Governor Wolf included a list of life-

sustaining businesses that were permitted to continue physical operations, identified using NAICS codes.

In this paper, we refer to those employed by businesses that were permitted to continue operations (such


                                                      5
as hospitals, transportation systems, and food manufacturing) as essential workers; those employed by

businesses that were forced to temporarily close (including mining activities, construction, and general

merchandise stores) are considered non-essential workers.

        The criteria for classifying businesses and their employees into essential and non-essential

categories were somewhat arbitrary. Although the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and

Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published guidance for identifying essential industries

(Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 2020), ultimately the final decision was made by state-

level governance. Classification of some businesses was uniform across states, but others were less clear;

early in the pandemic, Pennsylvania was the only state to shutter liquor stores, Delaware permitted florists

to continue with deliveries, and Arizona allowed golf courses to remain open (Andrew 2020). Such

differences highlight the substantial influence of policymakers in determining the livelihood of employees

in industries that lack clear classification.

        Despite existing variation in these classifications, essential workers broadly work in positions of

higher risk and lower pay. Many of these industries ­ including grocery stores, warehousing, public

transit, and health care ­ require employees to work long hours in high-density settings with prolonged

close contact with other individuals; such conditions may put these workers at increased risk for exposure

to Covid-19 (CDC 2020). Prior reports have also indicated that, compared to their non-essential

counterparts, essential workers are more likely to be Black, have a household income of less than

$40,000, and are less likely to hold a college degree (Kearney and Munana 2020). In addition, essential

workers are more likely to report having more difficulty affording necessities like utilities and food and

having more difficulty paying credit card bills (Kearney and Munana 2020). Furthermore, many essential

workers in frontline industries are over age 50, live in a household with one or more adults over age 65,

and have family care obligations (Rho, Brown, and Fremstad 2020). Some essential industries ­ such as

building cleaning services ­ also have a high incidence of uninsured workers (Rho, Brown, and Fremstad

2020). Thus, essential workers may simultaneously be at greater risk for Covid-19 infection and be less-

equipped to support themselves and their families in the event of illness. On the other hand, non-essential


                                                     6
workers may face a high risk of having reduced work hours or of becoming unemployed (Lund et al.

2020, Sanchez et al. 2020).



3. Data

We use medical claims data, which shed light on the clinical status of an individual member vis-à-vis

Covid-19 through a diagnosis code. Beyond information directly related to Covid-19, the medical claims

also allow us to capture relevant clinical characteristics, such as whether the member has been diagnosed

with a chronic condition in the past 12 months or whether the member has had an acute inpatient

hospitalization in the past 12 months. We focus on Covid-19 positivity rather than the downstream risk of

hospitalization or death for two reasons. First, the classification of businesses and their workers as

essential versus non-essential was not based on individuals' differential risk of a positive diagnosis for

Covid-19 translating into hospitalization and/or death; in other words, the non-essential business closure

policy was orthogonal to one's risk of hospitalization or death. Second, the downstream risk of

hospitalization or death is confounded by various factors including health care utilization (e.g., hospital

capacity) and treatment protocols (e.g., Covid-19 standard of care, which has rapidly evolved since the

beginning of the pandemic). These factors are less problematic in our study, which focuses on the

differential risk of Covid-19 transmission as a result of the non-essential business closure policy.

          We also draw on member files, which provide information regarding a member's demographic

characteristics. At the member level, we can observe the member's age, gender, and ZIP code of

residence. By merging member ZIP codes with data from the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy and

the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year aggregate ZIP Code tabulation area-level files, we

can also observe ZIP Code-level characteristics including the rurality of each member's residence, its

racial and ethnic composition, and the percent of members ages 18 to 64 living below the Federal Poverty

Line (FPL). The member files also allow us to identify members as either primary policyholders or as

dependents of a primary policyholder (including spouses) and create a flag for members (either primary

policyholders or dependents) that share the same address (i.e., are cohabitants).


                                                      7
        Our data also shed light on a member's employment status and affiliation by maintaining NAICS

codes for employer-based customers. NAICS codes were developed by the Office of Management and

Budget (OMB) and adopted in 1997 (United States Census Bureau 2020a). Under NAICS, business

establishments are classified according to Sector (2-digit code), Subsector (3-digit code), Industry Group

(4-digit code), NAICS Industry (5-digit code), and National Industry (6-digit code) (United States Census

Bureau 2020b). Using each employer's 4-digit Industry Group code, we classify individual members who

are primary policyholders as essential workers or non-essential workers.

        For our analyses, we restrict our sample to primary policyholders and their cohabiting dependents

who reside in Pennsylvania and have been continuously enrolled and employed for at least four months

from January through April of 2020. We also restrict to members who are commercially insured; in other

words, we exclude members who are insured through Medicare or the Affordable Care Act. All analyses

are conducted for weeks 7 to 23 of 2020 (February 12, 2020 to June 9, 2020, inclusive), with the end date

coinciding with the expiration of the stay-at-home order declared by Governor Wolf (Governor Tom Wolf

2020b). Our final sample comprises 415,958 primary policyholders and 387,412 cohabiting dependents.



4. Descriptive Statistics

4.1. Trends

Figure 1a shows the cumulative proportion of members in our sample with a positive diagnosis for Covid-

19 over weeks 7 to 23 of 2020. From week 7 to week 9, nearly no members were positive for Covid-19.

Beginning in week 10, the proportion of Covid-positive members started to increase at a steady rate.

When we stratify members into essential workers versus non-essential workers, we see that this rate of

increase, and the cumulative proportion of Covid-positive members, is greater for essential workers

compared to their non-essential counterparts.

                    ----------------------- Insert Figure 1 About Here -----------------------

        It is possible that the disparities in Covid-positive rates across the two groups arise from

differential testing rates between essential workers and non-essential workers. Specifically, populations


                                                        8
with greater exposure to the virus may have been tested more frequently; in Pennsylvania, early

guidelines limited testing to people demonstrating Covid-19 symptoms (Moselle and Benshoff 2020). By

July 10 (which falls after the end of our study period), testing guidelines were revised to include

asymptomatic individuals who suspected contact with an infected person (Pennsylvania Department of

Health 2020). As such, we examine the weekly proportion of positive diagnoses among essential workers

who were tested and non-essential workers who were tested (Figure 1b). We find that the positivity rates

among essential and non-essential workers who were tested were comparable up until week 14. In fact,

prior to week 13, non-essential workers briefly exhibited higher rates of positivity than their essential

counterparts. Starting in week 13 and through week 18, a greater proportion of essential workers being

tested were receiving positive results compared to non-essential workers being tested. Week 19 and later,

the weekly positivity rates across the two groups become similar again. Overall, the weekly positivity rate

among all tested members began to exhibit a gradual decrease beginning in week 18.

4.2. Summary statistics

In Table 1, we present summary statistics of all primary policyholders and their cohabitants who meet our

inclusion criteria. In Panel A, we see that essential workers comprise 37.2% of primary policyholders, and

these members are more likely to be Covid-positive (2.1% positivity) than their non-essential counterparts

(0.9% positive). Overall, primary policyholders who are essential workers tend to be younger, are more

likely to be female, have slightly more rural representation, are less likely to have a chronic condition, and

are less likely to be cohabiting with another Independence member. Comparing ZIP Code-level

characteristics shows that essential workers are more likely to live in areas with a greater proportion of

Black/African American or Hispanic residents and are more likely to live in an area with a greater

proportion of residents living below the FPL.

                     ----------------------- Insert Table 1 About Here -----------------------

        When we turn to cohabiting dependents of primary policyholders (Panel B), we find that 33.7%

live with essential workers, whereas 66.3% live with non-essential workers. Mirroring what we saw with




                                                        9
the primary policyholders, dependents who live with essential workers are more likely to be Covid-

positive (0.59%) compared to those who live with non-essential workers (0.48%).

        Panel C shows summary statistics for members who are cohabiting with another primary

policyholder but are neither their dependents nor essential workers themselves; we refer to this group of

members as non-essential non-dependents. We see that the overwhelming majority (94.5%) of these

members are living with other non-essential workers and only 5.5% are living with essential workers.

Those cohabiting with essential workers, compared to those cohabiting with non-essential workers, have a

higher likelihood of being Covid-positive (1.47% versus 0.89%).



5. Effect of being an essential worker

To quantify the average effect of the non-essential business closure order in Pennsylvania on the

likelihood of being Covid-positive among essential workers versus non-essential workers, we estimate a

difference-in-differences model on our sample of primary policyholders. We restrict our sample to

primary policyholders because we can only identify the employer industry of primary policyholders, and

thus classify them as essential versus non-essential workers. To account for the approximately two-week

incubation period of Covid-19 (Lauer et al. 2020), we define week 14 of 2020 (starting April 1, 2020) as

the beginning of the post-implementation period, which is two weeks after the business closure order was

enacted. 1 Our difference-in-differences model is a fixed-effects regression as follows:

                 = 0 + 1 (   ) + 2  + 3   + 4  +

                         5  + 6  +                                                                (1)

 is a binary indicator for member  in industry subsector  in week  and indicates whether the member

is positive for Covid-19.  is an indicator variable that equals 1 if subsector  in which the

member is employed is deemed essential by the governor's business closure order, and 0 otherwise. 




1
 As a robustness check in section 8, we also estimate a model in which we define week 12 of 2020 as the start of the
post-implementation period.


                                                        10
equals 1 for weeks 14 through 23, and 0 otherwise.   is a vector of member characteristics, including

age, gender, cohabitation status, clinical characteristics, rurality, and socioeconomic characteristics based

on the member's ZIP Code.  ,  , and  are week, county, and industry fixed

effects, respectively. We control for industry fixed effects specifically at the subsector level (3-digit

NAICS code) to allow for within-industry variation of essential versus non-essential workers (since the

latter is defined at the 4-digit industry group level). The main effect for  is omitted because it is

perfectly collinear with the week fixed effects.  1 is the difference-in-differences estimator that captures

the effect of the business closure order on the likelihood of being Covid-positive for essential workers.

        Table 2 presents results from the difference-in-differences estimation. We find that being an

essential worker is associated with a 0.75 percentage point increase in one's likelihood of being Covid-

positive (column (1)). Given an average positivity rate of 1.36%, this corresponds to a 55% increase in

likelihood of being Covid-positive for essential workers compared to non-essential workers.

                     ----------------------- Insert Table 2 About Here -----------------------

        To account for the possibility that some primary policyholders may no longer be active members

of the workforce (i.e., retired) but continue to receive health insurance benefits through their previous

employers, we repeat this estimation and restrict the sample to primary policyholders who are less than 65

years of age. This is particularly important to examine since older age is a documented risk factor for

Covid-19 (Jordan, Adab, and Cheng 2020), and thus could bias our findings away from the null. In Table

2 column (2), we see that our results are robust to this additional restriction. In this group, we find that

being an essential worker is associated with a 53% increase in likelihood of being Covid-positive (0.73

percentage point increase over an average positivity rate of 1.37%).

        Next, we examine whether and the extent to which this effect is being driven by those who are

employed in the health care industry, as these members may disproportionately be exposed to others who

are positive for Covid-19. For this, we conduct two additional analyses. First, we repeat our estimation of

Equation (1) for a sample that excludes members who are employed in the health care and social




                                                        11
assistance subsector. Second, we use a sample that is comprised only of these members who are employed

in the health care and social assistance subsector. We include the social assistance subsector along with

the health care subsector because this is the highest level of granularity we can attain using the 3-digit

NAICS code. Examples of employers in this subsector include hospital systems, nursing homes, social

assistance, and daycare centers. In this subsector, 98% of primary policyholders are designated as

essential workers and 2% of primary policyholders are designated as non-essential workers, according to

the Pennsylvania governor's business closure order.

        The results of these analyses are shown in columns (3) and (4) of Table 2. When we exclude

members who are employed in the health care and social assistance subsector, we find that being an

essential worker is associated with a 21% increase in one's likelihood of being Covid-positive (0.21

percentage point increase over an average positivity rate of 0.10%), relative to being a non-essential

worker. While smaller in magnitude than the estimated effect for the full sample, this result is still

statistically significant at the 0.1% level. In comparison, being an essential worker who is employed in the

health care and social assistance subsector is associated with a 41% increase in one's likelihood of being

Covid-positive (1.24 percentage point increase over an average positivity rate of 3.02%), relative to being

a non-essential worker employed in the same subsector. The magnitude of the percentage point increase

(1.24 percentage points) is meaningfully larger than that of the estimated effect for the full sample (0.75

percentage points). These findings suggest that while those employed in the health care and social

assistance subsector contribute significantly to the overall effect, the effect is not completely driven by

these members.



6. Effect of cohabiting with an essential worker

The current clinical literature suggests that Covid-19 primarily spreads through close person-to-person

contact (Chu et al. 2020). Thus, we examine whether one's risk of being Covid-positive after the business

closure order varies depending on whether the individual cohabits with an essential worker as opposed to




                                                      12
a non-essential worker. We separately examine the effects of cohabitation for (a) dependents of primary

policyholders and for (b) non-essential non-dependents cohabiting with another primary policyholder.

6.1. Effect on dependents cohabiting with an essential worker

First, we examine whether and the extent to which dependents of essential workers are at greater risk of

being Covid-positive relative to dependents of non-essential workers. In other words, are family members

of essential workers at greater risk of being positive for Covid-19? We repeat our estimation of Equation

(1) with an analysis sample that comprises all cohabiting dependents of primary policyholders. Column

(1) of Table 3 shows that dependents who are cohabiting with an essential worker are 0.09 percentage

points more likely to be Covid-positive than dependents who are cohabiting with a non-essential worker.

Given an average positivity rate of 0.51% among all dependents, this corresponds to a 17% increase in

likelihood of being Covid-positive for dependents of essential workers compared to dependents of non-

essential workers.

                     ----------------------- Insert Table 3 About Here -----------------------

        In columns (2) and (3), we further investigate whether this risk is different for dependents who

are 18 years of age or older (i.e., spouses or adult children) versus dependents who are under 18 (i.e.,

children who are minors). We find that the magnitude of the percentage-point change is larger for adult

dependents (0.13 percentage point increase) compared to minor dependents (0.03 percentage point

increase), but that the corresponding percent increases in their likelihood of being Covid-positive are

quite similar (17% for adult dependents versus 18% for minor dependents). This points to a substantial

difference in underlying positivity rates among the two groups (0.8% among adult dependents versus

0.1% among minor dependents).

6.2. Effect on non-essential non-dependents cohabiting with an essential worker

Next, we examine whether and the extent to which non-dependent cohabitants who are non-essential

workers are more likely to be Covid-positive when they live with an essential worker as opposed to a non-

essential worker. For the most part, we can think of these individuals as roommates who are not family

members (although it is possible that two family members may both be primary policyholders on separate


                                                        13
insurance policies with Independence). For the sample of all non-essential primary policyholders who are

cohabiting with another Independence primary policyholder, we again estimate Equation (1) and show

these results in column (4) of Table 3.

        We find that non-essential non-dependents cohabiting with an essential worker experience a 0.35

percentage point increase in their likelihood of being Covid-positive relative to those cohabiting with a

non-essential worker. Given an average positivity rate of 0.93%, this corresponds to a 38% increase in

likelihood of being Covid-positive for individuals with a roommate who is an essential worker.

Interestingly, the magnitude of this increase in risk is greater for roommates (i.e., non-dependents) than

for family members (i.e., dependents).



7. Effect of cohabiting with a Covid-19 positive essential worker

To examine whether our analyses above actually represent the transmission of Covid-19 from one

individual to another who are living in the same household, we conduct additional analyses in which we

focus on a sample of households with at least one Covid-positive member. After identifying this set of

households, we remove from the analysis sample the Covid-positive index member, which we define as

the household member with the earliest diagnosis date. This leaves us with an analysis sample of

individuals cohabiting with a Covid-positive member who may either be an essential or a non-essential

worker. In 167 households (0.04% of the full sample), two members of the same household are diagnosed

with Covid-19 on the same date. Of these, 161 households have Covid-positive members with a

concordant essential status (i.e., both members are either essential workers or non-essential workers) and

6 households have Covid-positive members with discordant essential status (i.e., one member is an

essential worker and the other is a non-essential worker). For these 167 households, we randomly assign

one of the two Covid-positive members as the index member and remove that individual from the analysis

sample. We also drop the 6 discordant households from our analyses and find our results to be robust.

        Column (5) of Table 3 reports the results of estimating Equation (1) for this sample of individuals

cohabiting with a Covid-19 positive index member. We find that those cohabiting with a Covid-positive


                                                     14
essential worker have a likelihood of Covid-positivity themselves that is 0.45 percentage points higher

than those cohabiting with a Covid-positive non-essential worker (column (1)). Given a relatively high

positivity rate in this population (7.4%), this corresponds to a 6.1% increase in likelihood of being Covid-

positive for those living with a Covid-positive essential worker in comparison to those living with a

Covid-positive non-essential worker. This suggests that intrahousehold transmission of Covid-19 is high

regardless of whether the index member is an essential worker or not, and that the risk of transmission

seems slightly higher when the index member is an essential worker.



8. Robustness

We conducted several additional analyses to assess the robustness of our main findings. First, we find that

our difference-in-differences estimates are highly stable across the inclusion of fewer versus more control

variables and fixed effects. For our main model with the sample of primary policyholders, as we move

from a sparser model with only week fixed effects (Table 4 column (1)) to models in which we add

member- and ZIP Code-level controls (column (2)), and county fixed effects (column (3)), the effect

remains remarkably robust and consistent. This is also the case for all other models estimated above (see

tables in the Appendix).

                     ----------------------- Insert Table 4 About Here -----------------------

        The main effect is also robust to defining week 12 of 2020 as the start of the post-implementation

period as opposed to week 14. Week 12 marks the very beginning of the business closure order and does

not account for the time it takes for the virus to spread, incubate, and manifest via symptoms. Since the

criteria for receiving a diagnostic test for Covid-19 during the study period was relatively strict and

largely limited test availability to symptomatic individuals or those with close contact with a known

Covid-positive individual (Pennsylvania Department of Health 2020), using week 12 to define the

beginning of the post period may provide an underestimate of the true effect as it does not sufficiently

account for a "lead-in" period. We find that our main results remain highly robust, with a 0.65 percentage

point increase in likelihood of being Covid-positive associated with being an essential worker as opposed


                                                        15
to a non-essential worker (column (4)); this effect is only marginally smaller in magnitude than what we

estimated previously in section 5.



9. Discussion and Conclusions

Our findings suggest that essential workers and their cohabitants (whether dependents or other primary

policyholders sharing the same address) are at substantially higher risk of being positive for Covid-19

than are non-essential workers and their cohabitants. Conversely, non-essential workers and their

cohabitants experience a protective effect against the risk of Covid-19 infection as a result of the non-

essential business closure policy. In our sample, essential workers are 55% more likely to be Covid-

positive than non-essential workers. Family members (i.e., dependents) who live with essential workers

are 17% more likely to be Covid-positive compared to family members living with non-essential workers.

Also at increased risk for Covid-19 are roommates (non-dependents) who are not essential workers

themselves but are living with an essential worker; these individuals are 38% more likely to be Covid-

positive than are roommates of non-essential workers. However, conditional on the presence of a Covid-

positive household member, the increased risk of transmission to other members of the household when

the first Covid-positive member in the household is an essential worker (as opposed to a non-essential

worker) is marginal; there is a 6% increase in one's likelihood of becoming Covid- positive when living

with a Covid-positive essential worker as opposed to a Covid-positive non-essential worker.

        We acknowledge there are several limitations to our analyses. First, our analyses are based on

data from a single insurer and its commercially insured members. Given that Independence is the largest

health insurer in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area, our findings are likely to be representative of

commercially insured individuals in this region, but may not be completely generalizable to other

populations. Notably absent from our sample are uninsured individuals or those who were previously

commercially insured but recently lost their health insurance, since health insurance in this setting is tied

to employment. In this population, the distribution of essential workers and non-essential workers may be

different from what is observed in our sample of commercially insured individuals. If we were to assume


                                                      16
that those who are not commercially insured are in fact more likely to serve as essential workers (e.g.,

part-time workers at grocery stores, PRN (pro re nata) home health aides, delivery drivers), then our

estimates may be biased towards the null and offer a conservative estimate regarding the risk borne by

essential workers of becoming positive for Covid-19. Another limitation is that our data do not allow us

to fully account for differences among members in their socioeconomic status or other factors that may

impact both one's likelihood of being an essential worker and living in an environment with higher risks

of Covid transmission (e.g., living in a tighter space with more cohabitants).

        Finally, it is possible that the information regarding dependents' addresses may not be completely

accurate, as members may not always update dependents' addresses when there is a change. In some

cases, dependents who were previously living elsewhere may have recently started cohabiting with the

primary policyholder (e.g., college students who moved back in with their parents when universities

depopulated their campuses); our analyses would have failed to capture these dependents as cohabitants,

leaving them out of the analysis sample altogether in estimating the effect of cohabiting with an essential

worker. In other cases, dependents who were previously living with the primary policyholder may have

left (e.g., children who moved out of their parents' home but did not update their addresses with

Independence); our analyses would have counted these dependents as cohabitants. However, doing so

would have biased our results towards the null since it is less likely that the primary policyholder would

have served as a transmission vector for this dependent who is not located under the same roof.

Furthermore, even if these dependents were not cohabiting with the primary policyholder, their likelihood

of in-person interaction may be higher than not, which would serve as another potential vector of

transmission.

        The societal tradeoffs between health and economic viability seen during the Covid-19 pandemic

evoke economic estimates of the "value of a statistical life" (Viscusi 1993). Previously, most of this

literature has concentrated on valuing mortality risk by estimating compensating differentials for on-the-

job risk exposure in labor markets. Because increases in health risks can be detrimental, economists

believe that there must be some other aspect of the job that compensates for the added risk (Viscusi and


                                                     17
Aldy 2003) ­ for example, receiving higher pay or greater job satisfaction. In contrast, the designation of

some workers as essential and others as non-essential during the pandemic has increased the health risk

profile of some jobs while reducing it for others, all while other underlying aspects of these jobs (e.g.,

monetary compensation) remain minimally affected. Thus, in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, rather

than a risk-income tradeoff, the value of a statistical life approach takes more of a risk-risk tradeoff and

focuses our attention on the net effect of a policy or regulation on a population's risk exposure (Viscusi

1994). For example, by designating grocery stores as essential businesses, policymakers ensured access to

food (and thus, reduced the risk of food insecurity) while raising the risk of exposure to and spread of the

virus for those who work in that industry. Given these consequential tradeoffs, policymakers must assess

the benefits of increased health risks when deciding on the extent of economic activity. These policy

choices ultimately involve a balancing of increased health risk and other risks.

        As policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of reopening economies and allowing for the

resumption of regular in-person interactions, person-to-person transmission of Covid-19 remains a

primary concern. Our estimates illustrate the differential impact of Covid-19 on essential versus non-

essential workers, though we note that the magnitude of the differences in risk experienced by essential

versus non-essential workers will decrease as the overall positivity rate decreases over time. Even when

accounting for the influence of health care workers on Covid-positivity, we find that a worker's essential

status puts the individual ­ and their family members ­ at higher risk for Covid-19 infection. Thus, our

results show that the designation of a workplace as essential or non-essential by state-level governance is

one that may have serious health and safety implications for the workers affected. These findings should

be taken into consideration as bodies of government determine how best to lead society forward as the

Covid-19 pandemic persists.
