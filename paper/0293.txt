                                 Abstract


       It has been alleged that multinational firing fail to adapt their
methods of production to take advantage of the abundance and low price of
labor in less developed countries and therefore contribute to the unemploy-
ment problems of these countries. This paper asks two        questions:   do multi-
national firms adapt to labor cost differences by using more labor—intensive
methods of production in LDC's than in developed countries and do multinational
firms' affiliates in LDC's use more capital—intensive methods than locally--
owned firms?
       We concluded that both U.S.—based and Swedish—based firms do adapt to
differences in labor cost, using the most capital—intensive methods of
production at home and the least capital—intensive methods in low—wage
countries. Among host countries, the higher the labor cost, the higher the
capital intensity of production for manufacturing as a whole, within Individual
industries, and within individual companies.
       When we attempted to separate the capital—intensity differences into
choice of technology and method of operation within a technology we found
that firms appeared to choose capital—intensive technologiesin LDC's but
then responded to low wage levels there by substituting labor for capital
within the technology. Similarly, U.S. affiliates appeared to use technologies
similar to those of locally—owned firms but to operate in a more capital--
intensive manner mainly because they faced higher labor costs.              -

Introduction
       A major issue in the discussion of the effects of multinational firms'
operations on host country employment has been whether these firms use
"inappropriately" capital—intensive methods of production and are therefore
responsible in some degree for underutilization of the presumably abundant
labor, or unskilled labor, resources of less developed countries. T''e attempt
here to answer two questions about factor use by multinational firms. One
is   whether      they   respond to the   comparatively   low   labor costs in LDC's by
using more        labor—intensive methods of production there than        in    developed

countries.        The second    is whether the LDC affiliates of multinationals are
more capital—intensive than locally—owned firms.                 In contrast   to the   numerous

case   studies which have       examined both of    these   questions our work investigates
the   pattern      that emerges from an analysis of several manufacturing industries

across many countries. We make particular use of data on multinational firms

collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S.                  Department
of Commerce for 1966 and 1970 and similar data for Swedish—based multinational

firms collected by the Industriens Utredningsinstitut of Stockholm for

1970 and 1974.




     'This paper was prepared as one of several srecial studies that were part

Countries, directed by Anr,c Krueccr. The study was supported by a contract

     The   question   of the degree of adaptation to LDC factor costs has

received the greatest amount of attention. Unfortunately there are many

possible definitions of adaptation and a good deal of effort has been

spent, often unprofitably we       believe,   in attempting to distinguish one from

another.

     A question frequently raised is whether any observed differences

between production methods in developed countries and those in LDC's are

the result of factor substitution within a single technology (along a

single production function), as in Figure 1 or the result of the        use   of a

attempt to divide the observed differences betweenDC and LDC factor use

ratios (k1 and k3) into the unobserved differences between k1 and k2

(cx ante substitution in their terms) and between k2 and k3 (ex post sub-

stitution). "By ex ante factor substitution we refer to choices of plant

design and by cx post factor substitution, we refer to the way in which

the plant is run."2 Courtney and Leipziger assume two technologies In

each industry, one for developed country affiliates of each firm and one

for affiliates in LDC's, and fit production functions accordingly.

     In our study we have fitted production functions to data for individual

affiliates in an industry across all countries, treating the degree of

development as a continuum rather than as a dichotomy. The framework can be

described as viewing the parent firm as having a technology set consisting

of knowledge of a variety of ways of producing which differ in their

capital intensity. The question Is whether the parent firtn's choices from

this technology set for use in different countries reflect differences in

factor costs.

     Even this viewpoint is most appropriate for a single product rather

than for the heterogeneous Industries of any available collection of data.

Production functions fitted to aggregate data or to heterogenous firm

or establishment data may be regarded as fictions which provide insights into

factor substitution but which must be taken with some reservations as

explanations of aggregate production relationships. We therefore concentrate
                                     —5—

first on the observed differences In factor proportions (the difference

between k1 and k3 in Figure 3), and relate them to differences in factor

prices. We examine the relationships, taking as our units of observation

for a country, in turn, manufacturing as a whole, broad industries, and

individual firms. e ask, in this part of the paper, what adaptation

there is to host—country factor prices, how much of it takes place through

the selection of labor—intensive industries and how much through the selec-

tion of labor—intensive firms for production in low—wage countries, and

finally, how much takes place through the choice of factor proportions

within industries or firms.

      At the most aggregative level, broad Industries, adaptation by

 selection (Figure 4) means that labor—intensive industries establish production

 abroad,especially in low—wage countries, more frequently or, at a higher

level relative to home output, than do capital—Intensive industries. In other

words,   if   there is adaptation by selection, the share of labor—intensive

Industries    will be higher among affiliates, particularly among affiliates
in low—wage countries, than among home—country industries.

     Since virtually all industries defined by statistical classifications

are heterogeneous, in the sense that they include firms producing a wide range

of products, the more labor—intensive firms might choose to relocate their

production to foreign countries with low   labor   costs while more capital—

intensive firms did not (Figure 5).

That would be adaptation by selection of firms within an industry.

     In the cases of selection of investing industries and investing firms

there are, of course, influences on location other than labor cost. It has

been suggested, in fact, that the typical advantage of U.S. firms, which

enables them to compete effectively in foreign markets with host—country

and other foreign firms, Is technological skill. If high technology is

associated with high capital—intensity there will be a tendency for capital—

intensive firms and industries to locate abroad that will operate in the

opposite direction to the influence of labor costs.

     A further difficulty arises with    production     functions fitted to data

across   countries.   Tynically no nbvsical outi'ut data are available and out—
put is nuasured by value added. This practice biases tile result toward
obscuring economies of scale, if thc--' exist. Presumably, plants of uneco—
nomically small size, pernaps in maret too small to sustain plants of
optimal size, can survive only if they are afforded high protection or subsidies.

The    level   of protection must be        high   enough to provide standard levels of

wages for the workers and profits sufficient to attract and retain capital.

Each   worker enters t1e production function on the ri'ht—hand side and his wagc
on the left, in value added. Each unit of capital is also entered on both
sIdes of       the function    because the investment (on the right—hand side) will
not   be made unless the level of protection or subsidy is sufficient to provide

a standard return, which          enters    the   equation    on the left—hand side.

       Within    a   single   economy tie   presumption      is that all   producers must sell

at   the same price, since they are in coipetition with each other. Any
inefficiently small plant with too many workers per unit of output would
have the high wage bill included in its value added bUt, since                  It is selling

in competition with, and at          the   same price as,plants, the
                                                              efficient

inefficiency will be reflected in a low or even negative return on capital,
and a low or negative value added, wiich will truly reflect net output.
The same would happen in the case of a plant with too much capital per unit

of output. however, among different countries, prices need not be the same

if there are trade barriers and plants in one country do not compete freely

with those in another. The value added by               inefficient plants is inflated
in   segregated, protected markets. The results in studies across countries

are thus biased toward proportionality between inputs and outputs: that is,

constant returns to scale.            This analysis assumes, of course, that the

degree of protection Is that needed for survival by inefficient plants rather

than that achieved by ooliticallv towerful firms or industries seeking high profits.

Data

        The basic data for our analysis came fron two sources: surveys of the

foreign operations of U.S. firms by the Bureau of Fconornic Analysis (BEA),

formerly    the Office of Dusiness Fconomics (031:) of the U.S. Department of

Commerce    and    of operations of SwedisLi firm b- the Industriens Utrednincsinstitut

of    Stockholm.     The U.S. surveys took place in 1966 (a conDicte census) and 1970,

and the Swedish surveys, believed to have virtually complete coverage, in 1970

and 1974. The U.S. data are described in U.S. Departnent of Commerce [1972]

and [1975), and the       l97() Swcdsh   data in   Swedenbor [1973]. The Swedish       study

for 1974 has not yet been published but the          data are similar to those of 1970.
       Although     the U.S. and Swedish survey questionnaires are quite similar,

there are differences which are reflected in          the way they   are used below.

The    U.S. data give more detailed balance sheet Infornation,         includirc net

and   gross book values for nropertv, rlant, and eruirment. The Swedish data
                                       — 12     —




 provide more product and industry information for both parents and overseas
 subsidiaries and also a rough measure of the current gross value of property,
plant, and equipment based on fire iiiurance values. Although the fire
 insurance valuation presumably thes not include revaluations of land, we are
inclined to the view that it is better thin booi. value as an estimate of the
amount of capital in market values. The U.S. data, or the other band,
characterize    each parent and each affiliate only 1w its single          most important
industry    affiliation and provide only        book values of assets.

       The basic facts about capital intensity for all manufacturing in parent
countries,    parent companies, and foreign affiliates arc set out in Table 1.

In every available comparison, ca'ita1. intensit.' in parent country domestic

manufacturing as a whole and      in parent companies'        domestic operations ias higher

than in    foreign   affiliates, even those in      developed   countries. And capital

intensities of affiliate operations in           developed   countries were consistently

higher    than those   of operations in less developed countries. The comparisons

clearly    indicate that some form of adaptation to differences in labor costs
does take place and that the adaptation, or tie sum of all the different types
of   adaptation, was large. Capital intensities of            affi1ates in less developed
countries    were typically 4fl per cent or more below those of parents or home

countries.

      As we   mentioned   earlier, there   are   many possible reasons for such

differences. One possibility is that we are observing only industry selection:

the more labor—intensive industries choose to go abroad to benefit from lower

labor costs, particularly in less developed countries, but that they produce

abroad exactly as at borne. One wa         to   test for this possibility is to make

comparisons of capital intensity within industries, as in            Tables   2 and 3.

If   all the differences in Table 1 were accounted for by industry selection

there would be no differences within industries. If industry selection

were unimportant, the differences in Tables 2 and 3 would be as large as

tliosein Table 1.

       It is clear that,   even   within broad industry groups, home production

is most capital—intensive, production in developed—country affiliates next,

and production in LDC affiliates least capital—intensive. In Table 2,

for the United States, 22 out of 24 comparisons show parent production more

capital—intensive than that in develored—country affiliates, 16 out of 16

show developed—country affiliates more capital—intensive than those in

LDC's, and 16 out of 16 show parent production more capital—intensive than

affiliate production in LDC's. Adaptation, in other words, is visible

within industries, at least within industry groups as broad as these. That

impression is strengthened by the averages. The average of the industry

relatives of affiliate to parent capital intensity show at least as much

relation to the type of host country as do the aggregates, and possibly more

in the case of LDC's.

      The adaptation in capital intensity shown     by manufacturing intlustry as
a whole in Table 1, put in index form in the All Manufacturing lines of Table 2,

can be divided into two parts. One is the adaptation within industries and

the other is adaptation by    selection   of industries discussed earlier. Adaptation

within industries is shown in the indIvidual it'dustrv lines of Table 2 and

summarized in the Average of Industry Relatives lines. It is calculated by

putting each industry line into relative form (parent capital intensity = 100)

and averaging across industries with narent employment as weights. If

within—industry adaptation were the only type that took place, the All Manufacturing

entries      and the Average of Industry Relative entries would be identical.

If there were, in addition, some selection by choice of industries, in the

sense that labor—intensive industries had a larger share of overseas

activity than of home—country activity, It would tend to make the         All
Ianufacturing      relatives lower than the   Averages of Industry Relatives.

Such    selection does appear to have taken place in     the   case of affiliates
in    developed   countries. Labor—Intensive industries are more     important

than    in the home countries. however, the opposite seems to be true for
less developed countries. The industry selection seems to lean toward
capital—intensive     industries there and offsets, to a small degree, the

effect of adaptation within industries. Thus not only does selection of

industries play a small role in the total extent of adaptation for

manufacturing as a whole, but it even r1ays an apparently perverse role

in LDC's. The major adaptation takes place within these broad industries.

       The   Swedish data on fire—insurance values in Table 3 point to roughly
the same conclusions. By far the      largest part of the difference in capital

intensity     between Sweden and foreign affiliates in developed     countries and

between   affiliates in developed   countries and those in LDCts     is accounted
for   by differences within broad industries. ComparinR the aggregate ratios

with the averages of industry ratios for fire insurance values we find

for LDC's that the aggregate is a bit lower, indicating some selection of

labor—intensive industries for production in LDC's. Fowever, the effects

of that selection were again, as in the United States, minor compared with

            We   conclude, then, from these aggregate data that the large differences
 in    capital      intensity, especially between LUC's and the DC affiliates of

 U.S. and Swedish companies and between          DC affiliate   and parent or home—country

 capital intensity are not primarily expressions of industry mix, at least

among tile industries we consider, but reflect mainly differences within

indus tries.



Ieasures of Labor Cost and Capital Intensity

         The theoretical determinant of capital intensity decisions, if scale

of production is         not a factor, is   tile relative cost of   labor and capital.
In     examining factor choices within the       firm   we have assumed that capital

costs are identical for the firm in any location, and that ratios of labor

cost to capital cost are therefore proportional to labor cost alone. The

cost of capital may be considered to consist of to elements, one the

opportunity cost to the firm of tying up assets in a particular form, and

tile   other the cost of a physical capital good. Capital costs in the first
sense       may be   taken   to be the same for a given firm all over the world,
although         that will not be the case if a firm is inhibited in transferring

profits from a given country or If investments in different countries

bear different risks. With resnect to nhvsical caiital, however, the

assumption of equality in all countries is           clearly not r;i! c1 for   construction,

which       is strongly affected by labor cost, although it      is rt such a bad

assumption         for equipment, which tends to have a world wide market.4 Since


        4
            Cf. Kravis, ileston, and Summers [197flaJ, p. 121.



construction cost and labor cost are rositivelv correlated we exaggerate

the differences between countries fri relative factor prices and under-

estimate elasticities of substitution.
                                    —21—


        The labor cost we would like to measure is that for pure unskilled
labor or for labor of a given quality. Lacking any such cost measure we
have    used several approximations or proxies, Including real CDP per capita,

average   wage paid by all manufacturIric' affiliates in a country, average wage,

and the latter two deflated by an inde: of the    average quality of labor.
        Real CUP per capita is of course not a measure of labor cost. It was
used as a proxy under the assumption that the higher the real GDP per capita,

the   higher the standard of living and the higher the cost of unskilled labor.
The estimates are from Kravis,   Peston, and Summers [1978b]. Average wages

come closer to cost measures but obviously reflect differences in quality

as   well as differences in price. To remove the effect of quality dif-
ferences we have devised a rough index of labor quality from various
measures calculated by others including L)enisori [1967], Harbison and
Myers [1964], and Krueger [1965], which covers about fifty countries.
In using the quality index to deflate money wages for a specific industry,
for example, we In effect assume that each company within a country
hires    workers of average quality and that any deviation of a company's

wage or an industry's wage from the average wage represents a higher cost

rather than higher quality. Where    we use average country wages without
distinguishing   companies or industries, however, we are making a very differ-
ent assumption, namely, that all companies and industries in a country face
the same..labor cost and that any variation represents differences in quality.
        Measures of capital intensity raise at least as many problems. We
have experimented with assets per worker, book and market values of property,

plant, and equipment per worker, value added, and nonwage value added per

                  per worker have the advantage of being coiprehensive. If
                                      — 22   —




one thinks of inventories, bank accounts, and loans as being production

inputs, that comprehensiveness seems desirable. However, for a singlecompany,

there is no assurance that the financial assets of a subsidiary are held

entirely to assist production in that country. It is quite conceivable that

a parent company might arrange to have the subsidiary hold assets for the use

of the parent or of other affiliates, and        it would then be improper to
treat the nor.production assets as necessarily belonging to the host—country's

production function. Similarly, the parent might hold financial assets for

the use of all its affiliates, In which case we might be understating the

amount of capital involved in a given affiliate's production.

     We have, for these reasons, leaned torard fixed assets, or property,

plant, and equiptaent per worker. flost of the data are for net property,

plant,    and equinmcnt, with all   the associated problems of depreciation

rates, valuation of assets purchased in the nast, etc. However, for
Swedish affiliates and their parents and for Swedish domestic firms in
each industry we also have data on the valuation       for fire insurance of

gross property, plant, arid equipment.

     It would be desirable to have a measure of the flo, of capital

services instead of the stock of capital, since that would be the appro-

priate measure of the contribution of capital to production. We do not

have adequate measures, however, and proxies which have been suggested,

such as value added or nonwagc value added per worker5 do not seem satis—




         See, for example, Lary [19G8].
                                       — 23 —


factory,     especially for comparisons within firms. The problem centers on

the ability of the firm to manipulate the location of profits, presumably

to minimize taxes or to evade other host-country or home—country regulations.

The result is that there are large numbers of affiliates with negative or

zero value added and others in which value added has been inflated for

similar reasons. To the extent they are used, value added per worker is

taken to represent total returns to capital per worker, including returns to

human capital, following Lary, and nonwage value added is taken to represent

returns to nonhuman capital.

        We   should   have liked to investigate differences in skill mix and

prices of skilled labor but the data are poor for this purpose. The U.S.

survey forms included questions on the breakdown of the labor force and

payments by type but the answers were considered unsatisfactory by BEA

and were not used. We could not treat differences among countries in average

wages as representing skill differences, as one might within a country.

The average wage       of each country, deflated   by     average   labor   quality , is
our   measure of the cost of standard labor, although it can incorporate
skill differences as well. To the       extent     that    it does,   the   relationship

between labor    cost and capital intensity is blurred. A possibility that

may   be worth exploring would be to measure labor cost by average wage
for the country as a whole dated by         the    average labor quality index and
measure skill intensity for a given affiliate or group of affiliates by the
ratio of average wage paid to the average national ¶lage.
     The Swedish affiliate data did include a usable distinction between
production workers and others. We have made some use of the proportion of

Labor Costs and Factor Proportions in
Individual      Countries and Industries
        We begin our analysis of the       impact   of labor costs on capital intensity
with a    series of regressions across countries, using data on the character—

isfics    of U.S. and Swedish multinationals'        affiliates In different countr1.

        In   the first   set of   regressions, summarized in Table 4, the data
for   all U.S.—owned     manufacturing   affiliates In each country     show that
capital intensity responds significantly to country differences in wage
costs. Equations 5 and 6, which make use of our best measures of wage
costs, the average affiliate wage divided by           our   measure of average labor
quality in     each country, suggest an elasticity of substitution of between

.7 (for fixed capital) and .8 (for all capital). A comparison of equations

1 and 2 with equations 3 and 4 indicates that adding more countries to the

38 covered by our labor quality index would tend to raise the coefficients,

their    significance, and the r2, but would not change the main findings.
        Real CD? per capita, which we expected to be a good proxy for labor
cost,    performed poorly, explaining very little of the variation in capital

intensity. To check whether          the greater explanatory power of the wage rates
might   be spurious, stemming from a common price level effect on both labor

cost and     the capital intensity measure, we ran       equations 7 and 8 with price

level as the explanatory variable. Price level had no             apparent   explanatory

power and the coefficients were not statistically simificant. However, the

fact that the coefficients were positive and fairly large does raise the

possibility that the       elasticity of substitution we calculate may be somewhat
exaggerated by spurious price effects.

       The Swedish data of Table 5 again show strong effects of labor cost

on capital intensity. The coefficients for average wage and quality—adjusted

average wage range from .75 to .87, somewhat above those in the U.S. equations.

What is different about the Swedish results is that both price level and

real GDP are related to capital intensity. The high price level coefficient

hints at some exaggeration of the calculated substitution elasticities but

the considerable explanatory power of real GDP, the labor cost proxy most

clearly cleansed of price effects, shows that labor cost is an influential

factor.


       If we accept the results of Tables 4 and 5 as indicating significant

response to labor cost, we still would wish to know whether the response

involved only the choice of industries for investment (labor—intensive

industries in low—wage countries) or choices among companies or production

methods within industries. We can get some notion of the answer to this

question from Tables 6 and 7 which show the same relationships within broad

industry groups for both U.S. and Swedish affiliates.

      The U.S. equations for aggregate manufacturing (Table 4) and for pooled

individual industries (Table 6) are quite similar, except that the latter

imply lower elasticities of substitution, .50—.55 instead of .6—. 7. In other

words, the substitution between labor and capital in the manufacturing aggre-

gate owes a little to the choice of industries hut mostly takes place within

the   broad industry groupings found in the table. There is some tendency
for labor intensive industries to be more heavily represented in lower
income countries but it accounts for only a small part of the apparent

substitution of labor for capital there. We can judge from equation 2

that the elasticity of substitution estimated in equation 3, limited to

128 observations because of the lack of complete coverage in the labor

quality   variable, is not higher than that of equation 1 because of differences
in   country coverage. The coefficient for a,erage wage among the countries

included in the quality data is almost identical to that calculated from data

for all countries.

         The equations for individual U.S. industries almost all show signifi-

cant labor cost coefficients, implying substitution of labor for capital in

low—labor—cost countries. The exception was transport equipment, for which

the number of observations was very small. The largest coefficient, sug-

gesting an   elasticity of substitution above "1" was for the chemicals indus-
try.
         A similar analysis of Swedish affiliates is made in Table 7. Since

we had no wage data by country for these affiliates the elasticities were

estimatedusing average wages paid in each country by U.S. affiliates: the
same wage variable as in Tables 4 ard 5. Both 1970 and 1974 equations indi-
cated strong response to labor costs, as measured by average wages or by

quality—deflated average wages. However, both real GDP and price level

were also related to capital intensity and, in fact, explained it better

than the presumably appropriate wage variable did.

       Although there were not enough observations to calculate an equation

for each industry among Swedish affiliates, there did seem to be some indus-

try differences large enough to affect the elasticity measure. When we

distinguished two industries, which seemed to be outliers, Paper Products &

Printing and !eta1 Products, from the others, we found them to have somewhat

higher elasticities and the explanatory power of the equation increased greatly.

In   any case, the Swedish affiliates appeared to respond to labor costs as the
U.S.   affiliates did, and perhaps to a greater degree, with elasticities of

substitution mainly over .7.

      bThe coefficient reproduced below is the sum of the labor cost
coefficient in the preceding column and the coefficient of the product
of labor cost and the dummy variable for the paper products and metal products
industries. Thus, if we write the fitted equation as

where        is the capital/labor ratio, in D is the dummy variable for the two
industries,      and LC is the labor cost measure, the coefficient shown here is
c +   d.     The t—ratio, however, is for the coefficient d.

Labor Costs and Factor Proportions Within Firms

        The degree of adaptation we have found to exist within industries might

still be a matter of selection, either among sub—industries or among compa-

nies within each industry, with each company producing in the same way at

home and abroad and in each foreign location. We cannot work with much finer

industry classifications than those of Table 6 for lack of data or of suffi-

cient numbers of observations but we can, for both the United States and

Sweden, use information for individual companies and their affiliates to look

for adaptation within companies. The within—company adaptation might be

within a given technology (Figure 1 in the Introduction), between technologies

(Figure 2), some combination of these (Figure 3), or some selection of

processes for LDC production (Figure 6). In addition, the capital/labor

ratio may reflect the effects of scale economies or diseconomies within the

firm (Figure 7).

       A sampling of U.S. results for all industries pooled in 1966 and 1970

is given in Table 8. Since we are using individual affiliates as the units

of observation    here we can   include not only labor cost in the host country

but   also   scale of operations for the affiliate itself as explanatory variables.

       The data for 1966 have sonic advantages and some drawbacks compared with

those from the 1970 survey. The main advantage is that they are from a com-

plete census of foreign direct investment, and the number of observations is

therefore much greater. Secondly, the 1966 questionnaire was much more

detailed than the later one, a fact that permits us to measure more and

different variables. On the other hand, the 1966 census does not include as

much parent data as in 1970, or less were tabulated than in 1970. Therefore,

the capital intensity variables for 1966 could not be calculated relative to

those of parents because we lack parent data. The result is that some selec-

tion of parents may be mixed in with the adaptation by individual companies.

and labor cost as the independent variable.

       The labor cost coefficients in equations 2 and 3 are close to, but

a little smaller than, those of Table 6 where we used country aggregates

of affiliates. Most of the response to labor cost within industries takes

place within individual companies but there is also a tendency for firms

with low capital intensity to operate in low wage countries, reinforcing

the effects of intra—firm adaptation. Thus, we have evidence of adaptation

by the definitions of Figure 5 and of Figure 1 or Figure 6 of the

Introduction.

      The scale variable proves to be highly significant and in the expected

direction for capital intensity as measured by physical plant and equipment.

That is, larger scale is associated with more capital—intensive methods of

production. But this was not true where capital intensity was measured by

total assets per worker. By that measure, larger size was associated with

lower capital intensity, although the effect was not strong when the quality—

adjusted wage was used as the labor cost measure.

      The labor cost measure used here is different for each affiliate. It

is the affiliate's average wage per worker deflated by the average labor

quality of the country in which the affiliate is located. Use of the

individual firm average wage as a labor cost measure implies that, within

a country, higher wages represent higher cost for standard labor rather than

higher labor quality. If this is not the case (if internal labor markets

are competitive, for example) labor cost might be better measured by average

manufacturing affiliate wage for the country as a whole. Equations 3, 7,

and 11 of Table 8 use this labor cost measure but the results are not

consistently higher or lower labor cost coefficients than those of equations

2, 6, and 10.

        The pooling of all industries implies that labor cost and scale

effects are identical among all of them, an assumption that we have no great

confidence in. Separate equations for the various manufacturing groups in

1970 are given in Tables 9 and 10, the former using property, plant, and

equipment as the capital measure, to give physical capital intensity, and

the latter using assets per worker, or total capital intensity.

       Physical capital intensity is clearly responsive to labor cost differ-

ences. The variable is significant in 11 out of 14 equations, not counting

groups such as chemicals for which we also have subgroup equations, and the

average elasticity of substitution is about .60, very close to the estimate

from the country aggregates in Table 6.


       Scale, which appeared important in the pooled data, rarely appears signi-

ficant in the individual industry equations, although it is positive, as ex-

pected, where it is significant. The implication is that we were observing

an inter—industry effect in the pooled data rather than a true effect of

scale on capital intensity within industries. That possibility is suggested

also   by the fact that two of the three significant scale effects in Table 9
are for combinations of industries: other chemicals, and other non—electrical
machinery.
       Somewhat surprisingly, in view of our doubts expressed earlier about

assets as a capital measure for individual affiliates, we are better able to

explain variation in total capital per wor:er than in physical capital per

worker. The levels of the      in Table 10 are substantially above those in

Table 9 and the average estimated elasticity of substitution among the signi-

ficant coefficients is also somewhat higher, at almost .70. The scale variable,

  however, is negative where it is significant. Taken in conjunction with

  the positive scale coefficients in equations in which physical assets alone

  were the dependent variable, the negative coefficients seem to imply that

  larger affiliates economize on non—physical assets per worker.

        Some equations based on the 1966 data appear in Tables 11 and 12.

  They differ from the 1970 equations in several respects. As mentioned

  earlier, affiliate capital intensity is not calculated relative to that of

  the parent, and we have omitted the equations for net property, plant and

  equipment per worker because they are similar to those for gross P.P.&E.

 but show slightly lower elasticities and R2s.

       The impression of strong response of physical capital intensity to

  labor costs from the 1966 data is quite similar to that from the 1970

 survey. However, there are many more significant scale coefficients, all

 positive. The main reason seems to be the use of gross rather than net

 physical assets, since the equations for net property, plant, and equipment

 per worker in 1966 do not show such strong scale effects. The 1970 equations

 in Table 8 also showed larger scale effects when gross, rather than net,

 property, plant, and equipment was used in the capital intensity measure.

       As in the 1970 data, the equations using assets per worker (Table 12)

• give the highest estimates sf the elasticity of substitution and the highest

 levels of a2,   the former averaging about .70. Also, there is again a strong,

 although not universal, negative scale effect. The larger the affiliate the

 lower the total assets per worker even though some of the same industries'

 equations showed that the larger the affiliate, the higher the gross property,

 plant, and equipment per worker.

         The negative scale coefficients in the equations using assets per

worker as the measure of capital intensity are a surprise. There is

virtually no relationship between size of affiliate and assets per worker in

simple regressions within industries and the few significant coefficients

are split between positive and negative ones. However, there is a strong

relationship between affiliate size and gross property, plant, and equipment

per worker, and all the statistically significant coefficients are positive.

These results suggest that indivisibilities in machinery and equipment are

responsible for the relationship and that the effect of these is offset

in other types of assets.

         The data for Swedish firms and their foreign affiliates differ from the

U.S. data in several respects. One     of   the chiefadvantages of the Swedish

data is that they give production, by industry, for each parent and

affiliate. We can thus distinguish industry—mix choices even within the

firm from    choices of factor proportions within an industry in a way that is

impossible with the U.S. data in which each parent and affiliate is charac-

terized by only one industry. We do this by calculating, for each parent and

affiliate, capital intensities at Swedish industry coefficients. Any differ

ence between the capital intensities of parents arid affiliates at Swedish

industry coefficients then represents a choice of industry mix, while the

difference between the actual capital intensity of an affiliate and its

calculated capital intensity at Swedish industry coefficients represents a

choice   of production methods within industry. Thus we can calculate the
affiliate's inputs at Swedish coefficients as

 where AK and AL       are affiliate capital and labor inputs at Swedish industry

 coefficients, Aq is the affiliate's production in industry 1, K is capital

 input and LW is labor input in the domestic Swedish industry i, and        is

 output in Swedish industry i. We can similarly calculate parent capital and

 labor inputs at Swedish industry ratios, PKSW and PLSW, and we can compare all

 of these with actual affiliate and parent inputs, AK, AL, PK, and PL.

      Another advantage of these data is that both numbers and payroll are

 given separately for wage and salaried workers, enabling us to calculate aver-

age earnings for each. The wage per wage worker, while not standardized for

quality, may be a little less subject to wide differences in mix than the

average wage in the U.S. figures, which lump wage and salaried workers together.

     This possibility of breaking down the Swedish parents and affiliates by

industry is particularly important for our purposes because the number of

Swedish affiliates in any one industry is small, and we were therefore unable

to run separate equations for individual industries. All the equations re-

ported on below are, therefore, pooled over all industries.

     Affiliate industry mix was not explained well in any equations and in

fact, two measures of wage cost gave effects with opposite signs. When we

measured wages by money GPP per capita deflated by average quality we found

that higher wage levels were associated with less capital—intensive industries,
                                               — 48 —



but   when we measured wages by average affiliate wage deflated by average

country labor quality, as in the equations for U.S. affiliates, we found,

as expected, that high wages were associated with more capital—intensive

industries. However, in neither case did we explain more than a very small

fraction of the industry mix variation.

        When we tried to explain the adaptation of capital intensities within

industries,      the variable that seemed most effective was the ratio of real
GDP per capita to the average labor quality, a kind of labor productivity

ratio   with the labor input adjusted for quality. The variable may be a
proxy   for capital input per unit of standard labor input, in which case we

would be using something like the same variable on both sides of the equation

and the results would be meaningless. The equations were:

     The results using real GDP per capita as a proxy for wage costs, on

We must describe these  results as quite inconclusive as to the existence
of factor substitution within Swedish firms.
        Since most of the equations for Swedish data were run only in arithmetic
form, they do not yield elasticities of substitution directly and, to judge
from our experience with          the U.S. affiliate data, the degree of association
between      labor cost and capital intensity is probably understated. However,

the direction of the relationships found Is of some interest for confirming,

contradicting or supplementing, the              results   of the U.S. analysis. We can

summarize the results from equatious on Swedish affiliate data briefly as

follows:

        1. Affiliates in      industries    of   low capital       intensity,   relative   to parents

             tended to be in higher income countries —— Non—adaptation.

        2. Parents in industries with high capital intensity tended to have
             affiliates in high—income countries —— Adaptation.
        3. Affiliates in industries of high skill intensity relative to parents
             tended to be in high—skill countries —— Adaptation.
     4. Affiliates, individually and in the agqregate, produce with hicher
             capital intensity relative to parents or Swedish industry in high—
             income and high—wage countries         ——   Adartation.
                                              — 50 —




      5.    Affiliates use higher skill ratios relative to parents orSwedish

             industry in countries whose salaried work is relatively cheap ——

            Adaptation.

      In all these calculations we have looked at relations among affiliates.

We can also use the affiliate data to compare affiliates in general with

their parents and with Swedish industry, taking advantage of the information

on industry composition instead of relying on the single—industry designations

as in the earlier comparisons of aggregates. For example, the average ratios

of affiliate/parent industry capital Intensities and skill intensities at

Swedish industry coefficients were:

              -   _sW       Sw
                        /N.      =    1.06

             aL         i     PL


where aLS" is the number              of salaried workers an affiliate would have if It

 used the   Swedish industry ratio of salaried workers to output. The
 affiliate industry mix was more ca'ital intensive than Swedish output            in
 general    and very slightly more skill—Intensive. Thus there is no evidence

 here of adaptation to lower labor costs outside Sweden in the form of

 selection of industries.

      However, the actual capital intensities of the affiliates were sub-

 stantially below the Swedish and parent levels for the same industries.

That Is, when we compare the actual average capital intensity in Swedish

affiliates             with what it would have been if they had, in each Industry,
                                                                       a

actual    capital intensity was 19 per cent lower. The actual parent capital

intensities, on the other hand, were slightly above those of the corresponding

Swedish industries. The affiliate capital intensities therefore represented

even a little more than the 19 per cent adaptation relative to the parent

capital intensities.

      On the whole, then, the Swedish data suggest considerable adaptation

within industries between the very high labor costs in Sweden and the lower

labor costs in host countries, and between developed and less—developed

host countries. The evidence on adaptation within firms was mixed, but it

did predominantly point to some degree of adaptation to differences In

labor cost.


Adaptation as Factor Substitution
and Technology Choice

      The tests of individual firm adaptation up to this point have attempted

to determine whether there was any effect of differences In labor costs on

factor proportions. Here we look at adaptation as the product of two

decisions the parent company makes about affiliate production methods. One
                                     — 52 —




is   the choice of technology, which might be the choice of machinery or

plant design, or even of product mix, and is represented by a family of

isoquants belonging to a production function. The other is the way In

which the affiliate operates within the chosen technology, which might

include decisions regarding multi—shift operation or ancillary services,

and is represented by the choice of a location on the isoquant defining

the technology.

       This conceptualization is broad enough to include all the variables

that influence the choice of factor proportions. Factor prices will

determine the factor substitution effect, i.e., the choice of location on

the isoquant. The choice of technology can be thought of as an ex—ante

decision determined not only by technological considerations but by eco-

nomic variables as well. Some of these variables are the product—mix,

the availability of skilled labor force and the scale Of production.6




       6
           See Roldan [19781, pp. 40—58.


Across countries these variables are assumed to be correlated with the

level of development of the country. The factor intensity technology

parameter of a production function is specified as a function of the per

capita income of the country in which the affiliate is located. The

elasticity of substitution parameter and the factor price ratio determine

the magnitude of the factor substitution effect.

where u is the error term. The parameters c         in (1/a) and d —B

are estimated by ordinary least—squares.

        The   resulting expression for the predicted capital/labor ratio k
in   terms of the estimated parameters is [EXP (—c) being .e


                     = EXP (—c)    ,.1,—d •                                  (10)


        As the factor intensity parameter varies from country to country

according to Y, we can calculate a predicted average capital labor ratio

for affiliates operating in DC's and LDC's by substituting in expression

Q0) the proper averages for the income and factor price variables.           and

     are calculated as the average per capita income for the DC's and LDC's

respectively; (w/r)D and (w/r)L are calculated as the average factor

price ratio for affiliates operating in DC's and LDC's respectively.

        The relative capital intensity that measures the adaptations

between DC's and LDC's affiliates is given by the expression



                   kD   -d (D           Tx S                                 (11)

that   we will call T from here on, gives a measure of the extent and

direction of the technology selection effect. T < 1 implies that affiliates

operating in DC's will tend to use a technology that is, at every factor

price ratio, less capital intensive than the one used in LDC's; and vice

versa if T >    1.
        Since        and     are such that D >      the selection of technology

effect T will be larger or smaller than 1 depending on the sign of the

regression coefficient d. In other words T           I if d   0. Thus, the

empirical estimation of the coefficient d in equation (9) will be of

extreme   importance. In particular, the       possibility of biases in the

estimation     procedure    should be kept in mind, although our own analysis

does not suggest any source of potential bias.

        The substitution effect——denominated S——is measured by the

expression

from zero in the regression of equation (9). it would indicate thRt

affiliates in DC's and LDC's operate with the same technology (on the

same isoquant) and that differences in capital labor ratios between

them can be explained by differences in factor price ratios. The

expression kD/kL will be given simply by

      The results for the predicted relative capital—labor ratios and

their component technology selection (T) and factor substitution (S)

effects are presented in Tables 13 through 16.

      The main result is the opposite direction in which the technology

selection and the factor substitution effects work in all industries.

T is always less than one, meaning that the technology used by the LDC

affiliates is more capital intensive than the one used by developed

country affiliates. The situation can be represented graphically in

Figure 10, a version of Figure 3 where the isoquant representing the

LDC's affiliates technology is to the right of the one for DC

affiliates. The selection of technology effect could be represented by

the distance ab. However, the factor substitution effect from the rela-

tively lower labor costs in LDC's will operate in the direction of using

relatively more labor than capital. This effect can be represented by

the shift from b to c in the isoquant for LDC      affiliates, and it can

be strong enough to make the capital labor ratios in use in some indus-

tries significantly higher for DC's than for LDC's affiliates.

      Figure 10 has to be interpreted carefully since it is only a two—

dimensional representation of our empirical results. Failure to understand

that would lead one to conclude that country L would be better off——given

its factor price relationship (w/r)__oPeratin somewhere on the isoquant

of the DC's, instead of in the isoquant for LDC's as the graph shows.

That situation cannot materialize becau8e both the isoquants and factor

price relationships of DC's and LDC's are assoiated with different values

of variables affecting the choice of technology.

 Representation of Empirical Results of Affiliates'
Facttr Substitution and Technology Selection Effects
                                    — 62 —




         The Chemical industry and its subsections, Drugs and Industrial

Chemicals, are among the ones with higher capital labor ratios for DC.

affiliates. Since there is no selection of technology effect in these

cases, the factor substitution effect alone explains the differences

found.

         The result that multinational finns use comparatively capital—

intensive technology in less developed countries is a surprise. If the

apparent choice of capital—intensive technology is genuine, it may be

that the multinational finns are selecting technologies that reduce the

need for skilled labor, scarce and expensive in LDC's, but can use large

amounts of unskilled labor where it is cheap. This choice of capital—

intensive technology may   apply   to the production process itself, but the

affiliate may find it profitable to use unskilled labor extensively in

ancillary activities. There has also been a good deal of evidence that

exchange—control regimes in some LDC's have encouraged overinvestment in

capital9 although it is not clear that such overinvestment would show up




     9
      See Bhagwati [1978), Chapter 5.


as choice of technology rather than factor use within a technology.

      We should point out that the estimates of production functions here

are made from data that are far from ideal, and the results may at least

reflect the compromises made necessary by data inadequacies rather than

the realities of technological choice. One problem is that our measures

of technology and factor use are identical——both being capital 8tock per

worker. That fact alone causes difficulties in making the distinction
                                          — 63   —




 we are aiming at. Furthermore, the industries we deal with are very

 broad and it is likely that the nature of the activity differs substan—

 tially from country to country. The return to capital is calculated as

 the ratio of nonwage value added to the stock of capital and therefore

 suffers from all the defects of the value added including that mentioned

 in Appendix A and also the many vagaries of corporate accounting methods

 aimed   at minimizing the tax burden. The estimates of labor cost, presumably
 far more reliable than the figures on returns to capital, are subject to
 the   problem of our inability to distinguish among types of labor and

 therefore   to distinguish those differences in payroll per worker that
 represent differences in quality from those that represent differences

 in the price of labor of some standard quality.


 Choice of Factor Intensities by
 Multinationals and Host—Country Firms


         Even if there is considerable adaptation among affiliates to

 differences in labor cost, U.S.—owned or other foreign—owned affiliates might

 fall short of the labor intensity of local firms. The affiliates might

enjoy lower costs of capital than native firms through their parents' access

to capital markets, particularly developed country capital markets. They

might face a need to pay higher wages than native firms because of host—

country government or union rules. Even if factor prices were identical

to those paid by native firms, the foreign affiliate may select a more

capital—intensive technology than a native firm because the foreign parent

may be familiar with such technology from its home environiient and find the

costs of adapting the technology uneconomically high. In this section we

attempt to measure the differences in capital intensities between U.S.

affiliates and host—country firms.

       Since our source of U.S. data for the previous section did not cover

host—country firms other than affiliates, other sources had to be used.

These did not provide data on individual firms, but only on aggregates by

 industry within each country, and the affiliate data were therefore aggre-

gated to the same level for comparison. Country data were derived from

 the Growth of World Industry reports of the United Nations and from other
            10
 sources.        The fact that each country's report has its peculiarities



        10
             See Roldan [19781, ippendix I, Sections 2 and 3.



with respect to definitions, coverage, etc. may introduce some biases in

our analysis.

      We make our comparisons between affiliates and host—country firms.

The alternative would have been to compare affiliates with the domestic

sector of the industry, defined as host country data minus affiliate data.

We felt, however, that the first alternative would avoid the mixing of

information obtained from different sources. Most of the variables used

in the analysis are ratios of original categories of information (for

example, the wage rate is calculated in our study as a ratio of payroll to

employment, both of which are obtained from the same original country source)

and a number of measurement errors are more likely to cancel out if the

information comes from a common source. Thus, the conclusions of this

section viii deal basically with differences in factor intensities between

affiliates and host—country firms instead of domestic firms, although

inferences with respect to the last ones can be easily made.

          Information   on capital stock by host—country and industry is not

 available, precluding a direct comparison of capital—labor ratios between

 host—country firms     and U.S. affiliates. The method followed here involves
 obtaining estimates for these capital—labor ratios by means     of   a produc-

 tion function approach. The available data allow the calculation of the

 price response (elasticity of substitution) and the factor intensity

parameter of the technology. These two parameters, given the knowledge

of    the factor prices paid by affiliates and host—country firms, will be
enough to calculate      estimates of the factor intensities. This indirect

method,    however, does not solve all the problems. In particular, the
exclusion    of the rental cost of capital from the regressions, because of

the lack of host—country data, introduces some estimate biases that need

to    be considered to assess the nature of the results obtained.
          The regression model used in the following analysis is limited to
 the CES production      function to allow for the possibility that elasticities

 of   substitution could be different beteen affiliates and host—country
 firms.
           Let us assume a CES production function,


               V = A    (sK + (l-s) LP)V/P                                 (13)



where V is value added, K denotes capital stock and L employment. The

parameters A, s, , and v correspond to the efficiency, factor

intensity, substitution and scale parameters, respectively. Let w and

r be the wage rate and the rental cost per unit of capital respec-

tively.

            Applying   cost minimization conditions to expression (13) we

 obtain,

           In the process, the scale parameter has dropped outs meaning

 that condition (14)is independent of the degree of returns to scale.

 From (14) it is clear how s is the capital intensity parameter: given

a factor price ratio and the value for the elasticity of substitution

     (denominated as c       hereafter), the   larger s is, the larger K/L will be.

The factor intensity of the technology described by the CES production

function is given by the expression


                                                                             (l5

 showing that it also depends on the particular value of the elasticity

 of substitution.

           The technological parameters in (14) can be empirically

estimated from the formulation

expression (14).

           The rental cost of capital r        should have entered equation (16)
as the   denominator in     the term for labor cost, but it has been

omitted because we lack data for host countries.            This Onhissior will

substitution if the true value of a is less than one and the coeffi-

cient in the regression of in r on in w is neoative.11     -

        The relative difference in the capital labor ratios between

affiliates and host country firms, assuming that the rental cost of

capital is similar for both of them, will be given by the expression:

        Imposing profit maximizing conditions on a CES production function
and assuming constant returns to scale we obtain an alternative equation

 to estimate the elasticity of substitution:

                   V —
              in       constant ÷   am   w                                     (20)


The variable for product price that should have entered as a divisor

in the term for labor costs has been omitted because we lack information.

The bias introduced by this omission will be positive if prices and wages

are positively correlated across countries.

        The empirical analysis has been conducted for the industries and years

for which a relatively large number of matching observations could be

obtained from country sources and the U.S. Department of Commerce surveys

of direct investment abroad (see Table 17).

        The results for the estimation of the elasticities of substitution

for affiliates and host—country firms are presented in Table 17, along

with results of the Chow test to determine whether the functions differ

between country and affiliate data. In eight out of the ten equations the

point  estimates for the elasticity of substitution are higher for the
affiliate data than for country data. This result could be taken as
supporting the thesis that multinational firms have more flexibility in
the choice of techniques of production than their domestic counterparts.

However,    the Chow test in Table 17 shows that only for Food Products 1966
is it   possible    to reject the hypothesis that the affiliate   and the

country    regression have similar parameters. This should be interpreted
cautiously   because it   refers to the joint action of all the parameters
involved in   the   regression, and it is possible that each parameter could
be   different for the two   regressions,    but their combined effects are not

8tatisticaily different.

         Table 18 presents for some industries estimates of the elasticity

 of substitution obtained with specification (16). These estimates

 differ as expected from the ones obtained with equation (20) because of

 the different biases they are subject to.

         Tables 17 and 18 suggest that, a) estimates for equation (16) are

lower than those for equation (20) for the same industries and, b) that

elasticities of substitution estimated from affiliate data are higher

than those from country data.

         The   direction of the biases will be determined by the correlation
between in w and in r for equation (16) and in w and in p for equation (20).
Rental    cost of capital figures are not available for country data, nor

product   prices for either data set, but for affiliates we found that the
rental   cost of capital was not statistically different between developed
and less developed countries, while wages differed between       them.
        The assumption that rental cost of capital is constant for affiliates,

with wages varying across countries, implies that product prices must vary

as wages do. In other words we can assume that prices and wages are

positively correlated for the affiliate, while wages and rental cost are

not correlated at all. Thus the affiliate elasticity estimates given by

equation (16) would     be   unbiased while the ones given by equation (20)

would   be biased upwards.
        As for the country firms, the very limited information given by

Minhas [1963) on rates of returns for various industries in U.S., Canada,

U.K., Japan and India suggests that in Japan and India, rates of return

were larger or at least equal to those in the U.S., Canada and U.K., with

the exception of the Non—Electrical Machinery Industry. This Is obviously

not   hard evidence, but in absence of other alternatives, we can interpret

it as suggesting that lower wages across countries are accompanied by

higher rates of return. In other words, the correlation between r and w

is negative, implying a downward bias in the equation (16) elasticity

estimate for the country data. How prices are correlated with wages in

a cross—country sample is not clear from the above since higher costs of

capital are offset by lower wages. An hypothesis is that at the country

level, prices are correlated with wages. A country with higher wages

presumably has a higher standard of living and an output composition

for a given industry with a larger share of more sophisticated and

expensive goods. This hypothesis implies that the elasticity of substi-

tution estimates from equation (20) for country data will be upwardly

biased, as the estimates for the affiliate data are. Although we lack

information on the extent of these biases the fact that they work in the

same direction for equation (20) reinforces the presumption that the

elasticities of substitution for host—country firms and affiliates do

not differ.

       Differences in capital—labor ratios. There are at least

two   alternative   ways to proceed to the calculation of capital—labor

ratios starting from specification (16). The first is to run separate

regressions for affiliate and country data. A Chow test would indicate

whether the regressions are significantly different or not. If the

regressions are shown to be statistically different, we can proceed to

introduce the point estimates of the parameters for affiliates and country

data in expression (17) to calculate k/k and the technology (T) and

substitution (S) effects. If the parameters for the affiliates and host—
                                      — 75   —




country    firms are similar, the ratio k/k will correspond to the substi-

tution effect S given in expression (19), with          —      The common

value for a can be taken from the estimate of the pooled affiliate and

host—country regression.

         The results for these calculations are given in Tables 18 and 19.

The poor fit of equation (16) shows in that estimates were obtained only

for five industries. The Chow test in Table 18 shows that for two cases

the functions are statistically different. For these two industries,

Table 19 shows the choice of technology effect T smaller than 1, meaning

that affiliates use a more labor—intensive technology than host—country

firms.    However, the factor substitution effect S is larger than 1 for two
reasons. First, the value of the point estimates for the elasticity

of substitution appears to be higher for affiliates than for host—country

firms    (0.41   versus 0.37 for Food Products and 067 versus 0.37 for Other

Chemicals). Second, affiliates face higher wages on average: $3,260 for

affiliates       versus $2,031 for host—country firms in the Food industry,
and $4,723 versus $3,330 in the Other Chemicals industry (Table 20).
As Table 19 shows, this brings ka/kc close to 1 for the Food Products
industry.    Thus the equation predicts that on the average, affiliates will

use   techniques    characterized by the same capital labor ratio as host—

country firms. In three other industries shown in Table 19, for which

the Chow test shows the functions do not differ significantly between

affiliates and host countries, the substitution effect S, and hence

is larger than 1, reflecting the fact that affiliates pay higher wages on

average than host—country firms.

            The second alternative way of calculating the ka/kc ratios

 is to assume from the start that the elasticities of substitution of

 affiliates and host country firms are similar. This similarity has

 been suggested above, in the section analyzing this parameter. This

 assumption is equivalent to assuming that the only difference between

 the affiliate and host country production function can arise from

 the factor intensity parameter. We can proceed to test the difference

 between the two production functions by introducing a dummy variable

 in the pooled regression of affiliates and host countries. The cast

minimizing expression for the capital labor ratio (14), becomes:


                =            . EXP]     [W]                                      (4)

 and the regression equation (.16),



            1n-aln1--+                  D±lnw                                    (16)

where   D   is a durny variable taking the value 1 for affiliate

observations anu 0 for country observations. The coefficient for the

dumy variable , equals o. times .                 The expression for k/k0 will

become,


            k
                = EXP   ()    (
                              w




where the choice of technology effect I = EXP             () and the factor
                                                                                 (17')

                                  (wa/wc)°.
for the existence of the technology choice effect; if               is statisti-

cally   not different    from zero, T will equal 1.
                                          —79—



         The regression results are presented in Table 21. The coefficient

for the dummy variable is statistically not significant in four cases,

implying that T equals 1. Three of these cases were analyzed with the

first estimation method, reaching the same conclusion (See Table 19).

The    fourth industry shows the dummy coefficient to be statistically not
different from zero. Table 21 also shows the elasticity estimates as
being not statistically significant in two cases. These results can be

explained   by the downward bias that afflicts the estiinate8 obtained from

equation    (20).     The fact that the estimates for a are found to be not

statistically       different   from zero raises problems of interpretation for

,     the coefficient of the dummy variable——since it is defined as the

product    of a times a——for the three industries mentioned.        For this

reason   we have opted not to present estimates for ka/kc for these indus-
tries.
         Table 22 presents the results for the technology (T) and substitu-
tion    (S) effects and the product of the two, the ka/kc estimates, for

the remaining industries. The choice of technology effect is smaller or

at the most equal to 1, indicating that multinational firm affiliates tend to

utilize tecnnologies of capital intensity lesser than or equal to that of

host—country firms. This conclusion is also supported by Table 19, where

the estimates for T are very similar, and by the Leipziger [              ]

study.     The substitution effect S works in the predicted direction,

making affiliates relatively more capital intensive than host—country

firm, given the conon           value   for a and the higher wages paid by the

affiliates.

        With   respect to the elasticities of substitution, the main result

appears to be the absence of statistically significant differences in the

estimates. Although the magnitude of the biases to which those estimates

could be subject might affect this conclusion, we have pointed out that at

least in one of the estimation equations (equation (20)) the direction of

the biases that could be present are similar for both data set. This fact

would tend to further support the notion of similarity of the elasticities

of substitution between affiliates and host—country firms.

          When predicted differences in factor intensities are viewed as the

 product of a choice of technology effect and a factor substitution effect,

 multinational firm affiliates are shown to utilize technologies of lesser

 or equal capital intensity than host—country firms. However, the substitu-

 tion effect is always larger than 1, making affiliates relatively more

 capital intensive than host—country firms, given the common (or larger

 for the affiliates) value for the elasticity of substitution, and more

 importantly, the higher wages paid by affiliates. Thus the higher estimated

 capital intensities of affiliates are attributed entirely to higher wages

 and, in a few cases, higher elasticities of substitution, but not at all

 to their choice of technology.


 Results of Other Studies

          The study most similar to ours was that of Courtney and Leipziger

 (1975] who used the same data on U.S. affiliates abroad. As already noted,

 their study concentrated on the issue of separating observed differences

 in capital intensity between affiliates in developed countries and those

 in   LDC's
              (k1 and k3
                           in Figure   3)   into   the unobserved differences in the

 choice   of technology (k1 and k2), or "ex ante substitution" in their terms,
                                      — 83 —



 and the unobserved substitution within the chosen technology (k2 and k3),

 or "ex post substitution." Courtney and Leipziger assumed two technolo-

 gies in each industry, one for developed country affiliates and one for

 affiliates in LDC's, instead of the many that we allowed for.
      -

          Their   results contained some of the same puzzling findings as those

 of our production functions. They found significant differences in technology

between affiliates in developed countries and those in LDC'S in 6 out of 11

industries and in three of these it was the affiliates in LDC's that were

using the more capital—intensive technology: that is, they were using, by

the authors' interpretation, more capital-intensive plant designs. However,

the response to lower labor costs in LDC's was so large that even industries

using more capital—intensive technologies in LDC's ended up with comparatively

labor—intensive production there. Since the most capital—intensive technolo-

gies in LDC's, relative to developed countries, were associated with the


highest elasticities of substitution, there Is a question, as in our own

results, as to whether the authors were really successful in separating the

choice of technology or plant design from the response to factor prices.

      Other studies of factor use in multinational firms' operations in LDC.'s

have been mainly case studies of particular industries or groups of plants.

On the whole, the results have been inconclusive, with some reporting exten-

sive adaptation and others virtually none. Since adaptation is not always

clearly defined, or the definitions differ among studies, and since most

studies refer to narrow segments of industry, It is not certain whether

they contradict each other or simply observe actual differences in behavior

among industries or countries.

         A study by Morley and Smith [1974] examined the choice of technology

by multinational firms    in   Brazil, largely on the basis of interviews and

the authors' views rather than any substantial statistical evidence on the

operation of plants. Their main conclusion was that there were very large

differences in technology between the U.S. firms at home and their af fill—

ates in Brazil. However, they explained the difference as an adaptation

to differences in the scale of production rather than in relative factor

prices. They argued that the production function is not homothetic and

that at any factor prices small—scale production would be relatively labor

intensive and large—scale production capital intensive.

         It is worth mentioning that a major role for scale in determining

factor proportions does not preclude a role for factor costs in adaptation

even if there is no response to factor prices at a given level of produc-

tion. It may be only the cheapness of labor in LDC's that permits the

existence of small, labor—intensive plants which could not survive in the

high labor—cost environment of the developed countries. The amount of

protection required to sustain small—scale, labor—intensive production

may be much less in an LDC, with low wages, than in a developed country

with its high wage levels. The adaptation by multinational firms may thus

be attributable to both the smallness of LDC markets and the low labor

costs.

         Examples of adaptation in the sense of both selection of stages of

production and selection of production techniques were found in a study

by Finan (1975] of U.S. direct investment and technology transfer in the

semi—conductor industry. American firms tended to place the labor—intensive

assembly stage of production in low—wage foreign countries, while confining

the more capital—intensive and technology—intensive wafer fabrication stage
                                       — 85   —




to   the United States and to affiliates in developed countries. However,

within the assembly      stage,   production was more capital—intensive in the

United States than abroad. A substantial number of automated assembly

lines were in operation in the United States, but none in foreign opera-

tions.

         Cohen [1975], in a study of foreign— and locally—owned plants in

Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore, not identified by industry, found the

foreign firms more mechanized than local firms in Taiwan but not consistently SO

in the other two countries. No generalization seems possible from the data

he presents. Outside of his sample of firms supplying statistical data on

mechanization, he reported his impression that General Electric and Philips

were more capital—intensive than local firms in radio manufacturing, although

Philips did adapt somewhat to local conditions. National Semiconductor and

Texas Instruments were producing integrated circuits using very automated

techniques in these countries, a fact that he interprets as lack of adapta-

tion although he presents no comparison with home country methods of production.

The finding from his questionnaires that there was little or no difference

between foreign and locally—owned firms in several industries presumably implies

adaptation by the foreign—owned firms relative tc their       home—country production.
         In   a study comparing 14 U.S.—owned operations with locally—owned

counterparts spread over nine industries in the Philippines and Mexico

Mason [1971] found that U.S. firms used more total capital assets and more

buildings but nor more equipment per employee than local firms. By measures

of the flow of capital and labor services the difference was not significant,

although it was in the expected direction.
                                    — 86 —




       Wells (1975), comparing foreign—owned with domestically—owned
plants in Indonesia, reported that the former almost all used what he

classified as "capitalintenaive" technology, and the latter almost all

"intermediate"   or "labor—intensive" technology. No ratios of capital to
labor input were used, but     he defined the characteristics of each level

of   technology for each of his six industries: cigarettes, flashlight
batteries, soft drinks,     tires, woven bags, and plastic sandals. He

attributed   the differences to presumably lower capital costs and much
higher   wages for the foreign companies. The wage differences, for

"comparable jobs...in each industry," were particularly striking between

foreign   and domestic firm costs of unskilled labor, with the foreign
firms paying wages about 2 1/2 times those of private domestic firms.

Conclusions
         The purpose of our investigation was   to learn whether multinational

firms responded to differences among countries in labor cost by using more

labor—intensive methods of production in low—wage countries. We found that

for both Swedish and U.S. multinational firms, parent company or home country

capital intensities of production, as measured by total assets per worker or

by fixed assets alone, were higher than those of affiliates in developed

countries and    that these in turn were higher than those of affiliates in
 less developed countries. These differences were not the result of industry
 selection; in fact in some cases It was capital—intensive industries which
tended    to invest   abroad, particularly in less developed countries.
         Among countries in which affiliates were located, higher labor costs

were associated with higher capital intensities of affiliates in the aggre-

 gate for all manufacturing and within manufacturing industries. Some of
                                      — 87 —



 the relation for manufacturing as a group represented a tendency for af fill—

 ates in labor—intensive industries to settle in low—wage countries but the

 main element was the relation of capital intensity to wage levels within

 industries.

       Within individual companies there is again a strong effect of labor

 cost on capital intensity. Some of the intra—industry effect noted above

was the result of selection among companies, more labor—intensive companies

 being more attracted to low—wage countries. However, the main intra—industry

effect was the result of adaptation within companies. We also found, in

the data for individual companies, a strong effect of scale of operations

on capital intensity when that was defined as property, plant and equipment

per worker. Scale had very little effect, and sometimes a negative one,

on capital intensity measured by total assets per worker.

      We attempted with the use of fitted production functions to separate

capital intensity differences among affiliates into differences in the choice

of technology and those in the method of operation within each technology.

We found that multinational firms appeared to choose more capital—intensive

technologies in low income countries but then to operate them in a more labor—

Intensive manner than in higher—income countries to such a degree as to more

than offset the capital intensity of the technology itself. This choice seems

paradoxical and we are far from certain as to our ability to distinguish

between technology choices and   methods of operation within any technology.
This is especially true because we are operating with data not collected

with a view to making such distinctions.

      Our attempt to use production function8 to study differences between

U.S. affiliates and native firms   in   host countries produced similarly

surprising results. U.S. affiliates were found to use technologies of the

same capital intenaity as native firms or even lower capital Intensity.

They nevertheless operated in a more capital—intensive way, partly because

their elasticities of substitution were higher than those of native firms

but mainly because they faced higher labor costs.

                                   APPENDIX A

           Effect of Protection on Measured Economies
   of Scale When Value Added is Used as the Production Measure



        The observed value added V equals the true value added \/

(value of services of production factors measured at zero effective

protection level) plus a surplus derived from protection. We chose

to describe it here as TV, where I is the rate of effective

protection, i.e.,

        V = V(l÷T)                                                    21)


The presumed regression model for the Cobb-Douglas production

function is


        in V =   C    +      ln K +       in L     u                (22)



The observed dependent variable will be


        in V   = in   V +    in   (1+1)                             (23)


Replacing (23)in (22) would give the regression equation that would

be correct to estimate


        in V — in (i+T) =         C   +     in K +     in L ÷ u    (24)



However, due to lack of information on T we estimate in fact the

following expression


        in V = C +          in K ÷        in L +   V               (25)


the error term will now be


       v = u +   in       (1+T)                                   (26)
                                                — 90 —



Since the level of protection can be assumed to influence the

employment of capital or labor, the error term will be correlated with

the independent variables giving rise to a simultaneous equation type

of bias.

           The expression for the bias can be obtained as follows. In

order to simplify the notation let us write expression (23) in devia-

tion form (so we can ignore the constant term) as

           Y =Z-r x+v                                                                          (27)


where y =    in   VA, Z =   ln    K and x =          In   L and v is given by expression

'(26). In general terms, for the equation Y =                         X   +    u, the asymptotic
bias will be given by the expression


           plim (—) plim (- X'XY                          plim ('-     X'u)

where      is the ordinary least squares estimator of .                            Applying   the

formula for equation (27) we get


                            b'' -b              'b

           plim (a-a)                                                                         (28)

the returns to scale are measured by h =                     ct÷      arid the asymptotic bias

for it will be given by plim ((a+) -                      (ci+)),      i.e.,

where the terms b. denote the coefficient in the regression of the

variable j on variable 1              (equation     i = a +   bj),   and    denotes     the

correlation coefficient between x and z.

               The denominator in (30)        is    positive, then the sign of the

bias will be given by the sign of the numerator.                      We know that

(1_b) > 0 and (l_b) > 0.                    In order to advance further conclusions

we need to make specific assumptions about b and b, i.e., on the

correlation between the effective protection and the employment of

capital and labor.

               The case for b        < 0   and b     < 0   can be made for a particular

industry having a cross-section of countries. If there are large

economies of scale the industry could not exist in small countries

without high protection. The smaller the country, the higher the

level of protection needed. Then capital and labor input will be

negatively related to the level of protection, i.e.,                        <   0 and

b        <0.
