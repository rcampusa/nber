       We explore signaling behavior in settings with a discriminating signal and several costly

nondiscriminating (“money burning”) activities. In settings where informed parties have many

options for burning money, existing theory provides no basis for selecting one nondiscriminating

activity over another. When senders have private information about the costs of these activities, each

sender’s indifference is resolved, the taxation of a nondiscriminating signal is Pareto improving, and

the use of the taxed activity becomes more widespread as the tax rate rises. We apply this analysis

to the theory of dividend signaling, The central testable implication of the model is verified

empirically.

                                          I. Introduction

       Models involving the signaling of private information through costly activities have been

used to explain a wide range of wonomic phenomena. Signaling in the style of Spence [1974]

requires the existence of a “discriminating” activity which is more costly for low quality types

than for high quality types. When the marginal cost of this activity is always higher for low

quality types than for high quality types, the Spence-Mirrl=s    “single crossing property” is said

to hold.   If the single crossing property fails, it may still be possible to support a signaling

equilibrium through the use of a discriminating activity (as long as total costs are higher for the

low quality type); however, this may involve a level of activity at which marginal costs are

higher for high quality types than for low quality types. In that case, it is in the interest of high

quality types to differentiate themselves by using the discriminatory activity (at a lower level)

in combination with an activity that is “nondiscriminating, “ in the sense that its marginal cost

is the same irrespective of quality. This observation gives rise to theones in which wonomic

agents have incentives to engage in observable, nondiscriminating resource dissipation, or

“money burning.”

       As we discuss below, previous signaling models have usually posited at most one

meehanism for burning money. In most settings, however, there are many ways to dissipate

resources observably, and existing theory provides no basis for selwting one nondiscriminatory

signal over another. This is sometimes viewed as an inherent shortcoming of dl signaling-cum-

money -burning explanations of monomic behavior.

       For concreteness, consider the analysis of Milgrom and Roberts [1986], who present a

model in which a firm wishes to signal that its products are of high quality. Managers of firms



                                                 1
use two choice variables to convey information to the public: the introductory price of the good,

and the amount spent on advertising.       The costs of advertising are assumed to be independent

of type. In contrast, the costs and benefits of varying introductory price do depend on the firm’s

unobsewed characteristics.      Thus, varying introductory price is a discriminatory activit y, while

advertising is a nondiscriminatory activity. Since the single crossing property does not hold for

variations in introductory price, burning money through advertising may emerge as part of an

efficient equilibrium signal.

        In a related model, Bagwell and Bemheim [1996] consider conspicuous consumption as

a means of signaling personal wealth.            Varying expenditures on a conspicuous good

discriminates between individuals on the basis of wdth over some ranges. In contrast, reducing

consumption of the conspicuous good for any fixed level of expenditure (which is accomplished

by overpaying for the conspicuous good) is a nondiscriminatory activity.           When the single

crossing property fails to hold globally for total expenditures, Veblen effects (defined as a

preference to pay more for a functionally equivalent branded good) may therefore arise as part

of an efficient signal.

        In models such as these, the choice of the means to bum money is inherently arbitrary. 1

Advertising and conspicuous consumption are chosen as means to bum money primarily on the

basis of their visibility.   Yet other methods of burning money are plainly available.           For

example, in the context of Milgrom and Roberts’ analysis, corporate donations to charity could

in principle fill the same role. Generally, the question of why one method of money burning

is chosen above all others has been left open.         This paper presents a model, based on a

suggestion in Bemheim [1991], that explores this choice on a more formal basis.



                                                  2
           The motivation and intuition for the current analysis can be understood as follows. It is

important in all money-burning models that nondiscriminating activities dissipate resources at

a known rate that is common for all types.         However, with many potential money-burning

activities, the true rate of resource dissipation for the sender is not naessarily        known to

receivers.     Consider, for example, signaling of product quality by corporations.     Advertising

may confer some benefit on the firm in terms of image or public relations. The true amount of

money burned is advertising expenses net of these benefits.        Moreover, managers may have

private information about the size of these benefits, even when advertising is nondiscriminatory

(in the sense that net benefits are unrelated to quality).       Likewise, managers may receive

“psychic income” from their corporations’ charitable contributions, with the magnitude of this

benefit varying in ways that are both unrelated to product quality, and known only to the

manager.       As private information about the true rate of resource dissipation becomes more

important, the problem of inference may also become more problematic.          For example, if one

observes a company making substantial charitable contributions, does one infer that the compan y

must produce a high quality product, or that the managers have relatively strong preferences for

charity?

       In this paper, we explore the optimal method of burning money in situations where

several nondiscriminating activities are available as potential signals (in addition to a single

discriminating activity). The incentive to bum money arises from our assumption that the single

discriminating activity fails to satisfy the single crossing property globally.   The true net cost

of each nondiscriminatory activity is agent-specific and known only to the sender, but is

unrelated to the sender’s quality. We demonstrate that, in this setting, each agent stnctl y prefers



                                                   3
a single money-burning activity to all others.        However, since the preferred form of money

burning differs from agent to agent, the theory generates an endogenous distribution of signaling

strategies.   In general, every potential money-burning activity will be chosen as a method of

signaling by some positive fraction of agents.

        This theory of optimal money burning has the following two strong, and rather surprising

implications: first, an increase in the observable component of the cost of a nondiscriminatory

activity (e. g. resulting from an increase in the tax rate on that activity) leads to more widespread

use of that activity as a money-burning signal; second, the taxation of a nondiscriminating signal

is Pareto improving.    Intuitively, an increase in an observable ta_xon an activity reduces the

significance of private information about the level of the activity required to dissipate the

equivalent of one dollar, thereby “purifying” the activity as a signal of quality.       It is worth

mentioning that once an agent begins to use an activity as a money-burning signal, further

increases in the tax rate reduce the level of the activity undertaken in quilibrium.       Thus, an

increase in taxation has an ambiguous effect on the aggregate volume of the activity.

        These general results are then applied to the case of a corporation signaling financial

strength to investors through the use of cash distributions to shareholders.     Since the tax code

treats cash dividends unfavorably relative to other methods of increasing net cash flows to

shareholders (particularly when the firm is also issuing new equity), the practice of paying

dividends is widely viewed as a puzzle.       Bemheim [1991] points out that, in the corporate

setting, limited liability naturally leads to a failure of the single crossing property, and that the

optimal signal may therefore combine net distributions with a nondiscriminatory money burning

activity, such as making net distributions in a tax-disfavored form. Naturally, firms may also



                                                  4
choose other methods of burning money, such as charity, unproductive advertising, and wanton

destruction of plant and equipment.      However, Bemheim argues that dividends offer a better

method of nondiscriminating dissipation for most firms because the investing public has better

information about the associated tax costs (which, after all, are incurred by the investors rather

than by the firm),

        The current analysis demonstrates that Bemheim’s theory has the following strong

implications: the taxation of dividends is Pareto improving, and an increase in the relative tax

burden on dividends should increase the number of firms that use dividends to signal profitability

(it may increase or decrease the total volume of dividends).            The second implication is

potentially testable. Although previous studies have found a negative relation betwun dividend

taxation and the aggregate level of dividends, this is consistent with our theory, and does not

rule out the possibility that the tax might nevertheless increase the number of firms choosing to

pay dividends.     We explore this latter possibility empirically, and find that there is indeed a

reasonably strong tendency for the fraction of corporations that pay dividends to move in the

same dirwtion as the dividend tax rate, even when other factors are accounted for.

        The paper proceeds as follows.       Section II outlines the general signaling model and

derives results.   Section 111applies the theory to the case of firms paying cash dividends to

signal high profitability.   It also contains empirical tests of the central hypothesis.   Section IV

concludes.


                                             II. Theory

A. The Model

       We consider a signaling model consisting of a “sender” and a “receiver.”            The sender


                                                  5
has private information concerning a vector of characteristics, ~.       One can think of ~ as the

sender’s “type.” We decompose type as follows: ~ = (Q,~), where Q will be interpreted as the

sender’s “quality,” while ~ will summarize other characteristics, detailed below.           We will

assume for simplicity that quality is either “high” (QJ or “low” (QJ.       The sender initiates the

process of interaction by choosing a “message,” m = (x,z), where x (a scalar) will be a

potentially   discriminating    activity,   and    z (a K-dimensional    vector)   will   consist    of

nondiscriminating activities.     Each component of the message m is constrained to be non-

negative,

        Having observed the sender’s message, the receiver selects a “response,” R.                 The

receiver’s response may depend upon inferences about the sender’s type. Thus, we write the

receiver’s response as R(P), where P represents the receiver’s probabilistic assessment that the

sender is of high quality, given the observed message m. Henceforth, we will use R~ to denote

R(l), and R~ to denote R(0). We assume that RH # R~, and we adopt the normalization that

R~ > R~.

       In the preceding paragraph, we have intentionally bmn vague about the process that

determines the response function R(P).            In some instances, we will impose the following

assumption:


Assumption R

       R(P) maximizes pu(R,QJ        + (1-P)u(R,Q), where u(R,Q) represents the rmeiver’s payoff

       associated with response R and quality Q,


Under assumption R, the receiver does not care directly about x or z. However, these variables



                                                     6
L
The single crossing property is equivalent to the assumption that *(R) = + co.

           We will use T to denote the probability that a sender’s quality is Q~. We will assume

that Q is distributed independently of T. Each marginal cost parameter y~ may take on any value

in the interval [~,&],      where ~ > 0 (so that each activity definitely has a positive cost), and

where ~ may be infinite.         The probability density function describing the distribution of the

vector ~ is denoted f(~l,... ,~~.         We will assume that the support of this distribution is


r    ❑    x~.l [Lk,B~], so that all possible types are potentially represented.    Finally, both u and f


are taken to be public knowledge.

           We study equilibria in which potential senders achieve full separation of types along the

dimension of quality, Q.2 As in most signaling contexts, our model can give rise to a variety

of separating equilibria. 3 We take the view that the requirements of perfect Bayesian equilibria

(s= Fudenberg and Tirole [199 1]) are minimal restrictions on the reasonableness of an outcome,

and we refine the equilibrium set accordingly.            Using standard arguments, one can easily show

that, in any perfect Bayesian separating equilibrium, low quality types choose m = 0.4 Non-

imitation by all low quality types then requires each high quality type to select (x, z) satisfying

                                                  K
    (2)                         V(x,R~,Q~)     - ~ y~z~ s V(0)RL>QL)
                                                    k=l


for all ~ ● r.       This is, of course, equivalent to

                                                 K
    (3)                       V(X,RH,QL)      - ~     Lkzk s V(O,R,,Q~)       .
                                                k=l

           We will further refine the set of separating equilibrium by assuming that each high

quality type differentiates itself from lower quality types in the most efficient manner possible.

                                                          8
Formally,     we focus on equilibria        in which type (Q~,~) chooses        (x, z) to maximize

U(X,Z,RH,Q~,~), subject to expression (3) and non-negativity constraints on x and Z.5 Using

standard arguments, one can easily verify that this is the only separating equilibrium which

survives the application of the “equilibria m dominance” refinement proposed by Cho and Kreps

[1987].


B. The Choice of a Nondiscriminating          Signal

          Our primary focus in this paper is on the sender’s choice of a nondiscriminating signal.

The following result provides a characterization of this choice:


Theorem 1

          me most eficient       signal for agents of type (QH,~) involves the use of the k-th

          nondiscriminating activi~ lf und only 1~Ak = Tk/~ s ~j/Lj E ~jfor j G { 1,2,... ,K}.


          Proof.    Suppose not. Then there are two activities, j and k, such that+ > h~, and such

that zj- >0    (where stars denote ~uilibrium values). Define the vector i as follows: 2i = Zi”


for each i # j,k; ij = O; and 2~ = z; + (Lj~~)zj”.        Notice that, since (x*,z”) satisfies (3) and


non-negativity, then (x ●,2) also satisfies (3) and non-negativity.    Moreover,



 (4)               u(x”,2,R~,   Q~, Y) = u(x*, z*, R~, Q~, y) + zj” Y
                                                                   [ ‘-   Y’[2)1      “
Under our supposition, the last term on the right hand side of (4) is strictly positive.       Thus,

(x”,z”) could not maximize U(X,Z,RH,Q~,~) subj~t to (3) and non-negativity.          1



                                                   9
        There are several important implications of this thwrem.     First, the model resolves the

problem ofindifference   across nondiscriminating methdsof        burning money. Except on a set

of measure zero, each agent strictly prefers one nondiscriminating activity to all others. Note

that the resolution of this indifference depends critically on the existence of private information

concerning rates of resource dissipation for nondiscriminating activities.       In the absence of

private information of this sort, the central indeterminacy would remain, even if rates of

dissipation differed both across activities and across senders,

        Second, different agents will use different nondiscriminating signals. Each type is most

attracted to those activities for which his or her relative costs (compared to the lowest cost

incurred by any type) are smallest. Thus, for example, managers with strong preferences for

charity will be more likely to burn money by making charitable contributions than by

advertising.

       Third, as long as there is some private information about the costs of all activities, every

nondiscriminating activity is used by some agents to bum money in equilibrium.             This is

because, for each activity j, some agents must have ~j very close to Lj. In fact, it is possible

to derive an explicit expression for the fraction of high quality senders choosing any particular

activity. Without loss of generality, we write this expression for activity 1:


                           ‘1 %     ‘K




                           L1   m   MK



where Mj = (Lj/L1) yl.      A nondiscriminating activity is used by a larger fraction of the

population when the distribution of marginal costs for that activity are concentrated near (in



                                                10
relative terms) the lowest marginal cost for that activity. This will tend to be the case when,

for example, there is relatively little private information about the cost of an activity.    In the

limiting case where the costs of an activity are uniform throughout the population, all agents will

(at least weakly) prefer to bum money using that activity.          At the other extreme, there is a

tendency not to burn money through activities for which there is a slight possibility that some

agents have little or no costs.


C. Activitv Levels

       As noted above, the most efficient signal for type (Q~,-y)can be derived by maximizing

the type’s utility subject to (3) and non-negativity.         Since type (Q~,y) uses a single

nondiscriminating activity, k (where & < hj for j E {1,2 ,... ,K}), the efficient signal is also the

solution to the following problem:


                                  Hxzk     V(X,RH, QH) -     Ykzk


subject to


                            V(X>RH, QL)     - L~z~ s V(O,RL,QL)         ,


in addition to x, z~ > 0.

       We will consider interior solutions to this problem (where the non-negativity constraint

on z~ is non-binding).   It is easy to verify that (7) (the incentive compatibility constraint) must

hold with equality. By substituting the binding constraint into the objective function, we obtain

the following equivalent problem:




                                                 11
 (8)              ~axx V(X, RH,Q~) - ~~[V(X,RH,Q~)              - V(O,RL, QL)l     -

The solution to this problem, denoted x“, is characterized by the following first order condition:


 (9)                VX(X*,RH,QH) = Akv=(x”,           RH,QL) s V=(X*,RH, QL) ,

         ,R, Q) denotes the partial derivative of V with respwt to X.b The ~uilibrium
where VX(X                                                                                     level


of the nondiscriminating activity, z;, is then chosen to satisfy (7):



 (lo)                     z; .   +
                                 [)k
                                       [V(X,RH,QL)        -V(O,RL,QL)]     .
        Equation (9) immediately establishes that money burning is never optimal when

preferences respect the single crossing property (since the condition for an intenor optimum

could never be satisfied).   However, if (as assumed in this paper), given RH, there is some

i(R~)   such that the marginal costs of x are inversely related to quality for x < ~(R~), but


positively related to quality for x > i(R~),    then one can in principle have an interior optimum

involving money burning. By equation (9), this assumption has the additional implication that

the optimal signal involves a level of x in excess of *(R~).

        It is of interest to note that, while the equilibrium achieves full separation along the

quality dimension, it also fully reveals ~~. In particular, each type choosing to bum money

through activity k will select a different level of x and ~.             This follows from implicit

differentiation of (9):




                                                     12
                          &*               VX(x*,RH, Q~)/Lk
 (11)                          —                                          >()
                          dyk - VH(X*, RH, QH) - lkvH(x*,RH,        QL)



(where we have used thesecond order condition tosign the denominator).           Note in particular

that high quality agents will rely more heavily on x, and less heavily on ~, when their individual

costs of z~ are higher.


D. The Effects of Taxation

         We now consider the effects of taxing a nondiscriminating activity.      Let k denote the

index of the activity that is subject to taxation,     We will suppose throughout the following

analysis that, fixing x, z, and R, the tax reduces the utility of every agent, regardless of type,

by the amount ~ for each unit of z~. This is easily incorporated into the preceding analysis by

defining L~    ❑   L: + r , B~ = BkO+ ~ , and, for each sender, yk = y; + ~ . That is, one can


think of ~~, which is distributed on [~,B~, as tax-inclusive costs, and y:, which is distributed


on [L~, B~], as tax-exclllsive costs.


        With this reinterpretation of our original model, one can immediately derive the following

surprising result:


~eorem     2

        Let Sk(r) denot(’ th(’ Subset of high quulity types in r that choose to signal with the k-th

        nondiscril?linating activip.   If T > T’, then Sk(T’) C Sk(r).




                                                 13
        Proof.   By definition, 1~ = (y; + r)/(L~            + r).   Consequently,




with strict inequality when y; z L:.      The desired result then follows from theorem 1.     ■




        Thmrem 2 indicates that the use of any particular nondiscriminating signal becomes more

widespread when that signal is subject to a higher rate of taxation. Intuitively, nondiscriminating

signals are “noisy” because they are contaminated by activity preferences.               When the

government subjects an activity to a publicly observable tax, this “purifies” the signal by

reducing the size of the noise as a fraction of the total cost.

        We depict the effect of taxation on activity choice graphically in figures I and II. For

the purposes of these figures, we assume that the sender chooses between two nondiscriminating

activities, the first of which may be subject to taxation. In a world with no taxes (figure I), the

sender chooses to signal through z, whenever


                                                        L2
 (13)                                      y22y;        —      .
                                                        L:


In contrast, in a world with taxes (figure II), the sender chooses to signal through z, whenever



 (14)                              y2 >




Notice that the line defining both constraints passes through the point (L~, L2), but constraint

                                                   14
(14) has a smaller slope. This means, as shown in figure II, that the tax on activity 1 enlarges

the region of the preference space in which activity 1 is chosen.

        In addition to studying the effects of taxation on the choice of a nondiscriminating

activity, it is also of interest to investigate the impact of taxation on the levels of the signaling

variables chosen in equilibrium.    Implicit differentiation of (9) with respect to 7 reveals that




                                                                               1
                &.
                                                  VX(X*,RH,QL)
 (15)           —=                                                               <0
                 d~                   VM(X*,RH,QH)      - kkV=(X-,R~,Q~)


(where, in signing this term, we have made use of the second order condition).         Thus, for an

agent who signals with the k-th nondiscriminating activity, an increase in the rate of taxation on

activity k reduces the extent to which the agent signals through the discriminating activity, x.

In effwt, the “purification” of the signal resulting from the imposition of the publicly observed

tax on z~ induces ~he agent to substitute away from x. It is then immediate from equation (10)

that, for such an individual, the total amount of utility dissipated through z~ rises with the tax

rate on z~. The effect of the tax rate on the equilibrium level of ~ is, however, ambiguous.

This reflects the offsetting effects of two factors: the higher tax rate induces the sender using

z~ to substitute from x to ~; however, a higher rate of taxation also implies that the sender can

create the same penalty for prospective imitators through a smaller level of q.

        If taxation renders a potential money-burning signal more attractive by “purifying” its

content, then one might well wonder whether an increase in the tax rate yields a Pareto

improvement.7 The following result establishes that this conjecture is, in fact, comect.




                                                 15
17zeorem 3

         An increme in the tu     rate T is Pareto improving in the following seine: it strictly

         increases payo~s for high qualiy senders who we or switch to the taed activity; it

         leaves the payofls of all other senders unaffected; under Assumption R, it leaves the

         payofs of receivers unaffected; and it strictly increaes revenue.


         Remark.     It follows immediately from this theorem that one could achieve a strict

increase in the payoffs for all agents simply by distributing the additional revenue through lump

sum transfers, divided equally among all agents.


         Proof . High quality senders who are induced to switch to the taxed activity as a result
         —

of an increase in r must be better off -- otherwise, they would not switch. For those who bum

money through activity k both before and after the tax increase, note that


                   ~U(X*,   Z*,R~, Q~, Y) = Vx(X*,R~,Q~) ~

 (16,)
                                                         dx”
                    = [VX(x*,R~,Q~)    - ~~VX(X*,R~,Q~)l ~

                                              >0,


where we have made use of equations (9), (10), and the fact that d~/dr       <0.    High quality

senders who do not use or switch to activity k are clearly unaffected by the tax increase, as are

low quality types and (under Assumption R) receivers.

         There is clearly an increase in revenue raised from senders who switch to the taxed

activity as a result of the tax increase.    For senders who already used the tied      activity,

revenues can be expressed as follows (using equation (10)):

                                                16

 (17)                                    [V(X*,R~,Q~)     - V(O,R~,Q~)l     .
                               L;+r


The term t/(L~    + t) is increasing in ~. Expression (15) indicates that x“ is decreasing in ~.


Thus, the term in square brackets is also increasing in 7. Since both terms are strictly positive,

the entire expression increases in r.                ■


        Thmrem 3 contrasts with the usual result for signaling models with money burning,

where the effects of taxation are usually completely neutral (SW e.g. Bemheim [1991] or

Bagwell and Bernheim [1996])       The usual neutrality result follows from the fact that, in the

absence of private information about rates of dissipation, taxes substitute perfectly for other

costs. In the current context, taxes enhance welfare by purifying an imperfwt signal. g

        The possibility of Pareto improving taxes in this model raises an important question: why

is the private sector unable to organize institutions that would remedy the original market failure

in an equivalent fashion? Our analysis is driven by the assumption that the private sector cannot

generate a money burning activity for which the true rate of dissipation is public knowledge.

One possible justification for this assumption is that arrangements betwen private parties are

never completely observable.

        Imagine, for example, that, in the absence of taxation, an entrepreneur senses a profit

opportunity, and sets him/herself up as a “private tax collector” (henceforth PTC). The PTC

encourages senders to purchase its “services,” which consist of exactly nothing, for a positive

price. The PTC also widely publicizes a list of its customers, along with “volume” and price.

Finally, the PTC hires an accounting firm to audit its transactions, and to certify the veracity

                                                17
of the published list. In this way, the PTC offers a private mechanism for dissipating verifiable

quantities of resources.

           Unfortunate y for private markets, however, the PTC’S services may not be viewed as

clean signals. Imagine the consequences of competition among PTCS. A PTC would not be

able to lure customers by lowering published prices, since the published price of its “service”

is irrelevant (only expenditures matter). However, a PTC would be able to attract customers

by maintaining published prices and granting smret price concessions.       Obviously, each PTC

would have an incentive to police its published prices as visibly as possible to establish

credibility. 9 However, secret price concessions between the PTC and its customers would be

very difficult to police privately.    For example, it would be hard for outsiders to detect

artificially inflated prices on other transactions between a customer and a PTC affiliate.    The

mere possibility that some PTCS might pay secret kickbacks implies that the true rate of resource

dissipation for a PTC customer would be, at least to some degrw, private information.        Thus,

the use of a PTC’S services might be taken as signaling the existence of side deals, rather than

quality.    As long as the government can credibly commit not to kick back taxes secretly on a

quid-pro-quo basis, the payment of taxes may provide a more believable means of dissipating

a fixed quantity of resources.

           Throughout this section, we have assumed that only one of the nondiscriminating

activities is subject to taxation. One can easily introduce taxes on the other activities as well.

All of the preceding analysis would still follow, with the exception of the statement concerning

revenues in Theorem 3. In principle, an increase in the tax rate on a particular activity could

reduce revenues by inducing senders to shift from more highly taxed money burning signals.



                                                18
Even so, a sufficiently large increase in the rate of taxation on every nondiscriminating signal

would still yield a Pareto improvement.


                         111. An Application   to Corporate Dividend Policy

        In this swtion, we explore an application of the general thary developed in section II

to corporate dividend policy. Part A provides relevant background on the thary of corporate

dividends. Part B elaborates on the application of our thary to corporate payout policy. Part

C examines empirical evidence to determine whether the distinctive predictions of the theory are

consistent with actual experience.


A. The Theorv of CorDorate Dividends

        Traditionally,   the widespread use of dividends as a method of distributing cash to

shareholders has been regarded as puzzling.            While it is not difficult to account for the

distribution of some earnings, dividends are treated less favorably than repurchases (even under

current law) and therefore appear to be strictly dominated as a mechanism for transferring

resources to shareholders.     The common practice of paying dividends and issuing new equity

simultaneously is especially difficult to understand, since a company could reduce dividends and

new equity issues by equal amounts, thereby reducing tax liabilities without altering net

distributions.

        Applications of signaling theory in the area of corporate payout policy have become

increasingly common (see Bhattacharya [1979,1980], Hakansson [1982], Miller and Rock

[1985], Kumar [1988], Kumar and Spatt [1987], and John and Nachman [1987]).                Yet few

authors have ventured explanations for the practice of signaling with dividends rather than



                                                  19
repurchases. Notable    exceptions include John and Williams [1985] and Bemheim [1991] .10

In effwt, both papers argue that it may be efficient to use nondiscriminating signals, such as

dividends, in situations where it is optimal to bum money. 11

       John and Williams do not consider the possibility that firms might signal profitability by

burning money in other forms, such as through charitable contributions, the construction of

conspicuous y expensive facilities, or advertising.   Bemheim [1991] mentions this possibility,

and attempts to resolve the issue by introducing -- as an extension to his basic model --

additional dimensions of private information, much as we have done in section II. In the context

of corporate dividend policy, he obtains the counterpart of our Theorem 1. Unfortunately, his

analysis of equilibrium activity levels and tax policy is confined to his basic model, in which the

choice among nondiscriminating signals is implicitly indeterminant. As we have seen in section

II, implications for tax policy and characterizations of equilibrium activity levels change when

one moves from the basic money burning model (in which rates of resource dissipation are

public knowledge) to a model in which the choice of a nondiscriminating signal is fully

determined.


B. Dividends   as ODtimal Nondiscriminatory      Signals

       To understand the application of the current analysis in this context, it is necessary to

formulate an explicit model of corporate payout policy.      Consider a signaling environment in

which the sender is a firm, and the receiver is a representative potential investor.    The firm’s

message consists of K + 1 distinct activities that reduce retained earnings, including repurchases,

dividends, charitable contributions, and so forth.     We will define x as the total amount of

resources devoted to all of these activities (henceforth “total payouts”), and we will use the

                                                20
vwtor z will to describe the allocation of x across activities.      In particular, z will be a K-

dimensional vector, where the k-th element of z describes the level of resources devoted to the

k-th activity, and where the level of the K+ l-th activity is determined as a residual. Thus, the

firm sends the “message” m = (x,z). We will arbitrarily take repurchases to be the K+ l-th

activity, so that the message m = (x, (O,O,...)) implies that the firm spends the amount x

repurchasing shares, and does not engage in any other earnings-reducing activity. We will also

take dividends to be the first element of z, so that the message m = (x,(x, O,O,.. .)) indicates that

the firm pays a dividend of x, and does not engage in any other earnings-reducing activity.

        Next, let Q denote the true (or full-information) value of the firm when m = (0,0). Even

when investors correctly infer Q, if m # (0,0) they will value the firm at less than Q, since the

message m is costly (see below), In particular, we assume that the actual value of the firm is

given by

                                                             K
 (18)                       W(X, Z,Q) “ Q - c(x, Q) - ~ d~z~ .
                                                             k=l


In this formulation, total payouts (x) reduce the full information value of the firm by c(x,Q)

(where CX(X,Q)> O), reflecting considerations such as the increased likelihood of costly

bankruptcy. Each of the first K payout activities also wastes some of the distributed resources,

relative to repurchases. Thus, if z~represents dividends, then ~~might measure the effective tax

rate on dividends, relative to the effective tax rate on repurchases,    Likewise, if z~ represents

charitable contributions, and if these contributions are not valued by shareholders, then & = 1.

        Upon observing m, investors will make inferences about the likelihood that the firm is

high quality. Let P denote the subjative probability assessment of the representative investor



                                                21
that Q = QH. We assume that investors are risk-neutral, and that the value of the stock, P, is

determined by competitive bidding among the investors, so that


 (19)                  P(p,m)     = PW(X, Z,Q~) + (1 - P) W(X, Z,Q~)             .

        We will assume that the manager cares about the current price of the firm, P, the true

value of the firm, W, and possibly about the activities ~.          In particular, the payoff to the

manager is given by

                                                            K
 (20)                           ap(p,m)   + W(X, Z,Q) + ~ kk-zk
                                                        k-l

        At first glance, it may not be obvious that this model fits into our framework.           This is

because the preceding discussion does not explicitly identify the receiver’s response. Moraver,

if we think of the receiver’s response as the “bid” P(P, m), then, contrary to the assumptions in

section II, this response depends directly upon the message m. However, since the process that

translates inferences into bids is purely mechanical, one can think of the rweiver’s response as

the formation of the belief P; that is, R(P) = P. In that case, the manager’s (sender’s) utility

takes the form of equation (1), where


 (21) V(X,R,Q)     ❑   Q - c(x,Q)     + aR[Q~   -c(x,Q~)l       + a(l   -R)[Q~       - C(X,Q~)l


and


 (22)                                 yk=(1+a)6k-Pk             .

Note that V is decreasing in x and strictly increasing in R, as required. Moreover, to the extent

there is some ~ such that cX(x,Q~) > cX(x,Q~)iff O < x < i, we will also have VX(x,R,Q~




                                                22
< VX(x,R,Q~iff O < x < i, as assumed in section II. 12

          Thus, the analysis of section II is directly applicable to our model of corporate payout

policy.     It follows that some fraction of firms will strictly prefer to use dividends as a

nondiscriminating signal (Theorem 1). As Bemheim [1991] argues, this fraction will be large

if managers have relatively little private information concerning yl (the marginal cost of shifting

the form of distribution from repurchases to dividends).

          Although managers probably acquire relatively little private information concerning ~1

compared with other ~~, it is doubtful that all of their information about ~1 is public. In general,

managers probably learn about yl through private contacts with shareholders. Large institutional

shareholders may express their payout preferences directly to management, and these preferences

may be driven in part by non-tax factors that are difficult for other investors to observe.       A

university s~king to increase the liquidity of its endowment might, for example, attempt to

influence the dividend policy of firms in which its holdings are substantial.

          Provided that managers do possess private information concerning yl, our analysis

implies that the fraction of firms with positive dividends should rise with the dividend tax rate

(Theorem 2). Increases in the dividend tax rate would also be Pareto improving. To establish

this result, one invokes the portions of Theorem 3 that do not depend upon Assumption R. One

then adds the observation that receivers are also unaffected by the dividend tax, since

competitive bidding always drives investor surplus to zero. 13


C. EmDirical Analvsis

          Although our conclusions concerning the welfare effects of dividend taxation are

provocative, they are not directly testable. The implications of Theorem 2 are, however, equally

                                                 23
striking,   and distinguish     our model from other thmries       of corporate   payout policy.

Consequently, it should be possible to test our theory by examining the effwt of dividend

taxation on the use of cash dividends.

        Previous authors have studied therelation between dividend taxation and the aggregate

level of dividends in Britain (e.g. Feldstein [1970], Poterba and Summers [1985]) and the United

States (e.g. Poterba [1987]).     Generally, an increase in the relative taxation of dividends has

bwn found to reduce the level of dividends in the aggregate. It is important to realize, however,

that the aggregate change in dividends refl~t a combination of two factors: a change in the level

of dividends for dividend-paying firms, and a change in the set of firms that choose to pay

dividends. In most models of corporate payout policy, these two effects are reinforcing. In our

model, they work in opposite directions.       While our model is certainly consistent with the

observed negative relation between dividend tax rates and aggregate dividends, it has the striking

implication that an increase in dividend taxation should nevertheless increase the fraction of

firms paying dividends.       In the remainder of this section, we examine empirical evidence to

determine whether this distinctive prediction is consistent with actual experience.

        Our empirical analysis is based on annual U.S. data for the period 1963-1988, inclusive.

The dependent variable in our analysis, FIRMTOT,, measures the fraction (normalized to lie

between O and 1) of all companies incorporated within the U.S. with ordinary common shares

listed on either the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the American Stock Exchange

(AMEX) that paid at least one cash dividend to shareholders during the year t. The recluired

information is extracted from data tapes compiled by the Center for Research in Securities Prices

(CRSP). CRSP differentiates cash dividends by frquency and tax status. For the bulk of our



                                                 24
analysis, we use the broadest possible definition of cash dividends. However, we also explore

the robustness of our results to alternative definitions, such as recurring (monthly, quarterly,

semi-annual, or annual) “normal” payments to shareholders that are fully taxable as ordin~

income to individuals.

        The key independent variable in our analysis is the dividend tax penalty, 0,, which is

defined as follows:

                                                 s
                                                          l-mfi

                                                                  Jt
                                                                       ‘




where mj[ is the marginal dividend tax rate at time t for investors in class j, zjt is the accrual-

equivalent capital gains tax rate at time t for investors in class j, wjt are equity ownership

weights, and s is the number of distinct shareholder classes. 14 We obtained historical data on

0, from Poterba [1987]. 15 Poterba’s measures of equity ownership weights for households,

pension funds, insurance companies, and banks are taken from the Federal Reserve Board flow

of funds data. The distribution of dividend income across income classes within the household

swtor is based on Internal Revenue Service data. Poterba treats each income class as a separate

shareholder category, and computes the marginal tax rate on dividend income for investors in

each class. He constructs the capital gains tax rate by assuming that the effective accrual rate

is approximately 0.25 times the statutory rate.

        Additional explanatory variables are included to control for other economic conditions.

As in essentially all previous studies of aggregate dividend levels, we include a measure of

corporate profits, PROFt.     This variable expresses corporate profits as a percent of gross

domestic product (the unit of measurement being percentage points). Our measure of corporate


                                                     25
profits is obtained from the Citibase data files, and incorporates corrections for inflationary

distortions of inventory valuation and capital consumption that result from historical cost-based

accounting.    In some specifications, we also control for the lagged value of this variable

(LPROF).

        It is noteworthy that voluntary dividend guidelines were adopted during the wage and

price control period of the early 1970s.        Poterba [1987] has found that these guidelines

significantly depressed aggregated dividend levels. It is therefore important to allow, in some

of our specifications, for the possibilityy that the guidelines also reduced the fraction of firms

paying dividends.    Thus, following Poterba [1987], we introduce an indicator variable, DG,

which equals unity for the years 1972-74. ‘b

       Finally, we introduce several macroeconomic variables to control for possible business           ‘

cycle effects on corporate dividend policy. These variables include capacity utilization expressed

as a percentage of total capacity (CAPUTIQ,       the civilian unemployment rate (UNEMPJ, and

the rate of growth in real gross domestic product computed from the fourth quarter of the

preceding year to the fourth quarter of the current year (GDPGRO~. The unit of measurement

for each of these variables is percentage points. In certain specifications, we also examine the

sensitivity of our results to the inclusion of a trend variable (YEARJ.

       Before turning to our findings, it is important to discuss our a priori expectations

concerning the pattern of coefficients on variables other than 0,. Since previous investigators

have found a strong positive relation between dividends and corporate profits, one might expect

a similar relation to exist between FIRMTOT, and PROF~. However, if companies pay dividends

to signal private information concerning profitability, there is little theoretical justification for



                                                 26
this expectation. 17 This is because the variable PROF, is public information, whereas the

fraction of firms paying dividends should be determined by the distribution of private

information.

       To understand this point, imagine a simple dividend signaling model in which there are

only two types of firms (“low quality” and “high quality”) and one method of distributing cash

to shareholders (dividends).   Let H and ~ + A (with A > O) denote, resp~tively,         the levels

of profits earned by low and high quality firms. Suppose that dividends are costly, and that the

marginal cost of paying a dividend declines monotonically in retained earnings (so that the single

crossing property is satisfied). Finally, let A denote the fraction of firms that are high quality.

For this model, H + AA is the analog of PROF. If PROF rises as the result of an increase in

either ~, A, or A, the average level of dividends increases (as observed in practice). la In

contrast, FIRMTOT equals A; changes in PROF arising from changes in H or A have no effect

on the fraction of firms paying dividends. Indmd, appropriately chosen changes in H, A, and

A reduce the frequency of dividend usage while raising average profits.

       When the single crossing property fails to hold and firms have many alternative methods

of burning money (as in the more elaborate signaling model described in section 111.B), the link

betw=n average profitability and the fraction of firms paying dividends becomes even more

obscure. It difficult to see why the average level of profits across all firms would have an effect

on the relative desirability of different nondiscriminatory methods of burning money (e.g.

dividends vs. charity).   Thus, our model (like other more standard signaling models) has no

particular implication concerning the effect of PROF, on FIRMTOT,.

       Similar remarks apply with respect to our macrtionomic              variables (CAPUTI~,



                                                27
UNEMPI, and GDPGROJ.            Generally, there is no reason to believe that more vigorous

macroeconomic activity (as indicated by higher capacity utilization, lower unemployment, or

higher GDP growth) would change the distribution of private information in a way that would

systematically raise or lower the fraction of firms paying dividends. Ind~,   even the thmretical

link between macroeconomic activity and the level of dividends (for dividend-paying firms) is

obscure: the marginal cost of paying dividends might rise during recessions because firms find

themselves closer to insolvency, or it might rise during booms b~ause          the payment of a

dividend requires firms to forego more profitable investment opportunities.

       An inspection of the data reveals quite a strong positive correlation betw=n the fraction

of firms paying dividends, and the effective tax rate on dividends. The key series are depicted

in figure III. During the first few years of our sample, the fraction of all listed firms paying

dividends (FIRMTOT) appears to move in the same direction as 0.            However, this pattern

reverses in the late 60s, Between 1968 and 1979, 0 falls and then rises, while FIRMTOT rises

and then falls. Subsequent to 1979, 0 rises and FIRMTOT falls monotonically.         Overall, the

correlation coefficientt between FIRMTOT and 0 is -0.5648.         When only NYSE stocks are

included, the correlation coefficient becomes -0.8547.     The sign of this correlation is robust

across subperiods. Since the 1980s witnessed several rounds of tax reform, a wave of mergers,

and rapid growth of repurchase activity, one natural point to divide the sample is 1981/82. For

the pre-1982 sample, the correlation coefficients are -0.2476 for all listed companies and -0.4534

for companies listed only on the NYSE; for the post-1981 sample, these correlation coefficients

are -0.8721 and -0.8674, respective] y.

       When interpreting these results, it is important to keep in mind that Odeclines when the



                                               28
dividend tax rate rises.   Thus, the empirical patterns indicate that an increase in dividend

taxation tends to be associated with an increase in the fraction of firms paying dividends. To

the extent this finding proves robust when empirically tested while controlling for other relevant

macrtionomic    factors, it would be consistent with the implications of Theorem 2, and difficult

to reconcile with other views of corporate dividend policy.

       The results in table I measure the relation between dividend taxation and the fraction of

companies paying dividends in the NYSE/AMEX sample, controlling for other explanatory

variables. 19 The dependent variable (FIRMTOT) has been multiplied by 100 to scale the

coefficients more conveniently.     Each regression specification is initially estimated using

ordinary least squares. However, the Durbin-Watson statistics generally indicate (with varying

degrees of significance) positive autocorrelation of the OLS residuals in our sample. Therefore,

each regression was re-estimated using the Cochrane-Orcutt iterative procedure to correct for

AR(1) residuals. To verify that the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure is appropriate, the GLS residuals

associated with the Cochrane-Orcutt estimates are then tested for first- and second- order

autocorrelation using the Breusch-Godfrey LM test.

       Equations (1) and (2) control for corporate profits, macrowonomic conditions, and the

1972-1974 dividend guidelines.    The coefficients of Oare negative and significant at levels of

confidence in excess of 99 %, indicating that a higher dividend tax rate increases the fraction of

companies paying dividends, precisely as predicted by our model. One can obtain some feel for

the magnitude of this key coefficient through an example.      Imagine that all investors face an

effective marginal tax rate on capital gains of 0.20. Then an increase in the effective marginal

tax rate on dividends (assumed for simplicity to be constant across investors) from 0.30 to 0.40



                                               29
reduces 0 from 0.875 to 0.750.         Our estimates imply that a change of this magnitude would

ordinarily be associated with a rise of 9.55 percentage points in the number of firms paying

dividends.

        The Breusch-Godfrey LM test was used as a diagnostic to determine whether the

residuals continued to follow an AR(1) or AR(2) process after application of the Cochrane-Orcutt

procedure.    These statistics, which are distributed X2(1) for the AR(1) tests and X2(2) for the

AR(2) tests (under the null hypothesis of no remaining autocorrelation) are presented, together

with the associated p-values. The tests show no evidence of first or second-order autocorrelation

surviving the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure. This finding validates statistical inferences based on

the estimated coefficients and standard errors.

        The coefficients of the other independent variables merit some comment. The fraction

of firms paying dividends is negatively related to aggregate corporate profits, but the estimated

coefficient is statistically insignificant.   While this may at first seem peculiar, it is (for reasons

discussed earlier in this section) entirely consistent with the general hypothesis that firms pay

dividends to signal profitability.    The pattern of coefficients for our macroeconomic variables

reveals no clear relation betwwn FIRMTOT, and the phase of the business cycle; FIRMTOT,

rises with capacity utilization, but also rises with unemployment and falls with GDP growth.

For the reasons discussed earlier, the absence of a clear pattern should not be regarded as

surprising.   Finally, we find that the dividend guidelines significantly depressed the fraction of

companies that pay dividends, in keeping with Poterba’s [1987] finding on the level of aggregate

dividends.

        In the remainder of table I, we explore the sensitivity of our results to alternative



                                                    30
s~ifications     of the dynamic process for dividend adjustment.        Equations (3) and (4) follow

much of empirical literature on factors determining the aggregate level of dividends by

supplementing our basic specification with a measure of lagged profits. In principle, this allows

for the possibility that dividends adjust gradually to changes in corporate profits. The estimated

coefficients of LPROF are positive but insignificant, and the other coefficients (most notably that

of 0) are little changed. The LM tests again show no evidence of a first-order autoregressive

error process.     While the test for a second-order autoregressive process is somewhat more

suggestive of difficulties, the test statistic remains insignificant even at the 10% level. ~uations

(5) and (6) incorporate the YEAR variable to account for the possible existence of a time trend.

The trend variable is insignificant, the estimated coefficients for 0, increase slightly,20 and there

is again no evidence of a problematic error structure.

        Table II contains additional results that further establish the robustness of our central

findings.   For equations (1) and (2), we reconstruct our dependent variable based on a more

narrow definition of dividends -- regularly recurring (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual)

“normal” payments to shareholders that are fully taxable as ordinary income to individuals. The

coefficients of 0, are estimated somewhat less precisely, but their magnitudes are little changed.

When the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure is used (equation (2)), the coefficient of PROFITS, changes

sign, but is still statistical y insignificant.

        For equations (3) and (4), we return to our original definition of dividends, but restrict

attention to firms listed on the NYSE.            There is only a negligible effect on the estimated

coefficients (and associated standard errors) of 0,. Once again, the coefficient on PROFITS,

changes sign, but remains statistically insignificant.



                                                     31
        Finally, for equations (5) and (6), we restrict attention to the set of firms that were traded

continuously on either the NYSE or AMEX throughout the sample period. We undertake this

exercise to explore the possibility that our results might be attributable to spurious changes in

the composition of firms listed on these exchanges.       This restriction significantly reduces the

number of firms used to calculate FIRMTOT(; while each data point in the original series was

calculated using a sample of at least 2,000 firms, our fixed-firm series is based on a sample of

467 firms.    The substantial reduction in sample size raises the possibility that the restricted

sample may not be representative.      Indd,    since the firms in this subsample tend to be older

and more stable, they are significantly more likely to pay dividends in any given year.

Nevertheless, results based on this sample provide further insight into the robustness of our key

findings.    Although the coefficients of d, are much smaller than in our basic specification,

precision is also remarkably improved, and the estimated effects remain statistical y significant

at high levels of confidence. The smaller quantitative effect of tax policy could be attributable

to the fact that older, more stable firms are less inclined to change their established dividend

policies; nevertheless, the central result comes through. The other coefficients closely resemble

those obtained in our basic specification, and there is again no evidence that the error structure

is problematic.

       We have performed a variety of other robustness exercises that, for the sake of brevity,

are not reported in either table.    For example, we have estimated separate equations using

various combinations of the independent variables.        Generally, our central findings emerge

intact. For example, the estimated coefficient of fl~is little affected by the omission of either

the macroeconomic controls or the dividend guideline dummy variable, and its t-statistic



                                                 32
continues to indicate a high level of statistical significance.   However, in both cases there is

evidence of residual first and second-order autocorrelation even after the application of the

Cochrane-Orcutt procedure.     Given the time series properties of the omitted variables, this is

not surprising. Despite the fact that statistical inference is problematic for the unreported

specifications, the robustness of the key coefficient provides us with considerable comfort.


                                         IV. Conclusions

       In this paper, we have proposed a theory of signaling via “money burning” that resolves

each sender’s indifference among alternative nondiscriminating signals.       We establish three

central results: (1) all potential money burning activities are used by some senders in

equilibrium, (2) the taxation of a nondiscriminating signal is Pareto improving, and (3) an

increase in the tax rate causes the use of the taxed activity to become more widespread.       We

have also applied this theory to the use of cash dividends as a signal of financial strength, The

central testable ireplication of the model -- that an increase in the dividend tax rate should

increase the number of firms that signal profitability by paying dividends -- has proven to be

consistent with historical experience.   This finding raises the possibility that the dividend tax

may be Pareto improving.

1.    Milgrom and Roberts note this themselves [pp. 799-800], as do Bagwell and Bemheim

[p. 28].

2.    Separation along the dimensions of z is inconsequential, since the receiver does not

care about y.

3. Naturally, the model can also give rise to a variety of pooling equilibria.   In many

standard settings, no pooling equilibria survive application of the “equilibrium dominance”

criterion proposed by Cho and Kreps [1987], which we use later to refine the set of

separating equilibria.   However, in this context, there may exist certain kinds of pooling

equilibria that satisfy this and other refinements.   We focus on separating equilibria because

we have bmn unable to identify a class of pooling equilibria that is robust against

refinements and reasonably simple in structure, for which existence is generally guaranteed.

Although we leave the properties of pooling equilibria as open issues for further research, we

conjecture that the key elements of our analysis will survive. In particular, an increase in the

rate of taxation applied to a money burning activity should induce more agents to engage in

the activity because it “purifies” the associated message (decreases the relative importance of

private information).

4.    In any separating equilibrium, low quality types are correctly identified as such.

Consequently, they experience an equilibrium response of R~. In a perfect Bayesian

quilibrium,   the receiver never chooses R < R~ for any message m. If low quality types

were assigned an equi Iibrium message involving positive levels of x or z, they could increase



                                                36
their payoff by choosing m = O. Consequently, they must choose m = O.

5.    For a fully separating equilibrium to exist, it must be the case that the maximized value

of the objective function exceeds V(O,R~,Q~. We will assume this throughout.


6.    The second order condition requires that Vu(x,R~, Q~) - k~Vn(x,R~,Q~)             <0.

This condition will be useful in the subsequent analysis,

7.    In considering whether an increase in the tax rate yields a Pareto improvement, we

abstract from the possibility that parties outside the model might benefit from the untaxed

non-discriminating activities.   In certain contexts, reductions in non-taxed discriminating

activities (such as charity) might be harmful to third parties.

8.    Theorem 3 bears some relation to the analysis of Rotemberg [1988], who demonstrated

that a tax on a signal may be Pareto improving if the single crossing property fails to hold,

and if senders are structurally prevented from burning money, We have demonstrated that

the taxation of a signal may also be Pareto improving even when senders have access to

money burning technologies, as long as there is some private information (unrelated to the

characteristics being signaled) about true rates of resource dissipation.

9.    Indeed, the manufacturers of conspicuous consumption goods often go to great lengths

to assure that discounters do not degrade the signaling value of their products; see Bagwell

and Bemheim [1994].

10.    The analysis of John and Williams has been extended by Ambansh, John, and

Williams [1987] and Williams [1988].

11.    Despite this commonality, the models considered in these two papers differ in a

number of other important respects, The relationships between them are discussed in

Bemheim [1991].

12.     As noted in Bernheim [1991], this property follows naturally from the presence of

bankruptcy constraints.

13.    It is natural to embellish the model by imagining a s~ial     class of investors who are

the initial owners of the firms. In that case, initial owners of high quality, dividend paying

firms will benefit from an increase in dividend taxation, while other initial owners will be

unaffected.

14.    By using data on 0, that are constructed in this way, we implicitly assume that

dividends are received in proportion to equity ownership.     It is well known that floor traders,

who are taxed equally on ordinary income and capital gains and losses, engage in tax

arbitrage around ex days, and indeed some evidence indicates that these individuals receive a

disproportionate share of dividends. Although it is therefore likely that 0, overstates effective

dividend taxation, movements in 0, should nevertheless capture relative movements in the

true effective dividend tax rate, particularly around major shifts in tax policy.

15,    For 1987 and 1988 data on 0, were obtained directly from James Poterba (private

communication).

16.    According to Poterba [1987], voluntary dividend controls were in effect between

November 14, 1971, and April 30, 1974. The guidelines suggested that dividends should be

limited to 4 percent above the highest payout level in the thrm years before the controls.



                                                38
17.    The expectation might be more reasonable under Jensen and Meclding’s [1976] “free

cash flow” hypothesis.

18.    If H rises, the marginal cost of dividends falls, and high quality firms must pay

higher dividends to deter imitation. If A rises, imitation results in a larger share price

increase, and high quality firms must therefore pay higher dividends to differentiate

themselves. If A rises, high quality firms pay the same level of dividends, but there are

more high quality firms.

19.    In these tables, we have adopted relatively simple functional specifications.    As a

practical matter, the relative brevity of our sample period dictates parsimony.

20.    While the standard errors of these coefficients also rise, they remain statistically

significant at high levels of confidence.
