                                              ABSTRACT

The neoclassical growth model is extended to include costly intermediated borrowing and lending
between households. This is an important extension as substantial resources are used in intermediating
the large amount of borrowing and lending between households. In 2007, in the United States, the
amount intermediated was 1.7 times GNP, and the resources used in this intermediation amounted
to at least 3.4 percent of GNP. The theory implies that financial intermediation services are an intermediate
good and that the spread between borrowing and lending rates measures the efficiency of the financial
sector.

1.   Introduction

         There is a rich class of models that study savings for retirement. But these models

abstract from the large costs of financial intermediation, despite the fact that most savings

are intermediated. This paper extends the neoclassical growth model by incorporating an

intermediation sector. It does so in such a way that it matches both the amount of

borrowing and lending between households and the resources used in intermediation.

Furthermore, all the appealing characteristics of the standard neoclassical growth model

remain unaltered. In addition, the model provides a suitable framework to evaluate not

only efficiency gains from innovations in the financial sector but also the impact of

demographic changes on intermediation and saving behavior.

         Our paper presents model that is consistent with the economic growth facts,

documented by Kaldor (1961) and used by Solow (1969) and provides a prototype

framework that allows us to address the amount of borrowing and lending between

households and the resources used in intermediation. To the best of our knowledge this is

the first such extension. One interpretation of our model would be a theory of growth

with financial intermediation. Given the large amount of recourses used in intermediation

we consider this to be an important extension of the existing growth models.

         In 2007, for the U.S economy, intermediation was large, around 1.7 times the

annual Gross National Product (GNP).1 The resources used in this process were not

inconsequential, amounting to at least 3.4 percent of GNP. These two figures together

imply that the average household borrowing rate is at least 2 percent higher than the

  About half of this is intermediated lending by commercial banks. The other half is lending by other
financial intermediaries such as mutual organizations.
                                              2

average household lending rate. Relative to the level of the observed average rates of

return on debt and equity securities this spread is far from being insignificant.

    Since our model abstracts from aggregate risk, by construction there is no premium

for bearing aggregate risk. As explained later, the household borrowing rate is equal to

the return on equity. The government can borrow at a lower rate than households – as

empirically observed. Consequently there is a difference in the return on equity and the

interest rate on government debt. For our calibrated economy this difference is 2 percent,

and abstracting from it may be inappropriate when computing statistics that report the

spread between different rates of return in the economy. We discuss this in Section 8.

       Since in equilibrium the total amount borrowed by households is equal to the total

amount of intermediated lending by households, a natural question that arises is who are

the borrowers and lenders? In our model, where the only reason for households to save is

to finance retirement over an uncertain lifetime, one set of households choose to save by

accumulating capital and a second set by purchasing annuities. Since capital

accumulation is partially financed by owners’ equity and the remainder by borrowing,

capital owners are the borrowers. In addition, since purchasing annuities is isomorphic to

lending, annuity holders are the lenders.

       We caution the reader regarding two issues. First, the model counterpart of

annuities is not limited to commercial annuities but includes, more importantly, defined

benefit pension plans and even more importantly annuity-like promises of the

government, such as Social Security and Medicare. We think of these plans as mandatory

purchases of annuities. As pointed out by Abel (1987), Social Security and Medicare are

implicit government liabilities and can be regarded as annuity-like promises of the
                                                 3

government. When we examine some implications of our theory, we will include these

annuity-like promises as part of annuity-like assets held by households.

        Payments for these “annuities” are made throughout the working life of

households and our model tries to capture this. Empirically, commercially available

annuities, purchased at or near retirement account for a very small fraction of savings for

retirement due to well-known adverse selection issues. Consequently our paper abstracts

from these annuities. The biggest annuities are in the form of Social Security retirement

benefits and Medicare, which are mandatory purchases of annuities during a household’s

working life. In addition, there are defined benefit retirement plans, which are essentially

annuities that people effectively purchase during their working life.

        An integral part of our analysis is that households endogenously borrow and lend.

Some households lend to financial intermediaries while others borrow from these

intermediaries to partially finance the capital investment in the businesses they own.

While there is a myriad of reasons why households borrow and lend, in our model, for

simplicity, we motivate this by only one such reason (the intensity for bequests). This

keeps the analysis simple and tractable. The reasons matter little for the inference we

draw.

         Later in Section 8, when we examine some implications of our theory, we will

include these annuity-like promises as part of annuity assets held by model households.2

        Second, we follow the tradition in macroeconomics assuming that households

own all the capital in the economy and rent it to businesses. Thus, we treat the capital



2
  We reemphasize that when we use the annuity construct in this paper, it includes all annuity-like
payments, including Social Security, Medicare, defined benefit pension plans and the small amount of
commercial annuities.
                                             4

owned by businesses as capital owned by the owners of these businesses, and therefore,

all debt of non financial businesses is debt of our household sector.

       The output of the intermediary sector is an intermediary good. The value added by

intermediation services is equal to the amount of borrowing times its price minus the

amount of lending times its price. In equilibrium, the amount borrowed is equal to the

amount lent. Hence, the price of this service is equal to the spread between the average

borrowing and lending rates. Improvements in the financial system which reduce this

spread are efficiency gains.

       In 2007, about half the U.S. capital stock, the value of which was 3.4 times GNP,

was financed by borrowing and half by owners’ equity. This borrowing is done to finance

owner-occupied housing, by proprietorships and partnerships to finance unincorporated

businesses, and by shared ownership corporations to finance businesses. Households who

own capital finance it partially by borrowing and partially by equity. Further, the

Modigliani-Miller Theorem holds for our economy as for a given firm the debt-equity

financing decision does not matter. In the aggregate, total equity and private debt are

determined.




Reason for household borrowing

       We begin our study by examining household saving decision. In practice, most

household savings are for retirement. However, some of it is held in highly liquid kind of

financial instruments as a substitute for costly insurance against idiosyncratic risk such as
                                                     5

a job loss.3 Abstracting from these factors has little consequence for aggregate lending. In

our model households choose between two savings strategies. One strategy is to invest in

equity and earn a real return of           percent. The other strategy is to purchase a lifetime

annuity, which is actuarially fair at                 percent. Since the lifetime remaining after

retirement is uncertain, households that choose the annuity option are in effect buying

insurance against outliving their savings.

        But, why do some households choose to save by lending to financial

intermediaries (with a low return) while others invest in equities (with a high return)? In

this study this is due to household heterogeneity in the form of differences in the strength

of preferences for bequests. That is, we assume that people are identical in all aspects

other than the intensity of their bequest motive. The only source of uncertainty is the

duration of the lifetime after retirement. Hence, an important difference between both

strategies is that buying equities strategy generates bequests upon death equal to net

worth at the time of death, while buying annuities does not.4 For our calibrated economy

people with low, say nil, bequest motive will prefer the annuity strategy while agents

with even a modest bequest motive will prefer equities.5 The strength of the bequest

motive has little consequence for aggregate bequests with bequest being largely

accidental.

        To summarize, in equilibrium, those with even a modest preference for bequests

accumulate capital assets and borrow during their working lives, and upon retirement, use
3
  In this study we do not make a distinction between these two types of saving. For issues other than the
ones we address in this paper this may be a crucial element of reality that would have to be incorporated
into the abstraction.

  We permit an annuity payment upon death. It will be positive if the bequest preference parameter is not
zero for anyone choosing the annuity strategy.
5
  As explained later, there is an additional requirement about the size of the spread.
                                                    6

capital income for consumption and interest payment on debt. Upon their death they

bequeath all their net worth. Households with little or no bequest motive buy annuities

during their working years and use annuity benefits to finance their consumption over

their retirement years.

         As mention earlier, we abstract from the small amount of direct borrowing and

lending between households and assume that all borrowing and lending between

households is intermediated through financial institutions. Furthermore, in light of the

finding that the premium for bearing non-diversifiable aggregate risk is small in models

consistent with growth and business cycle facts, our analysis abstracts from aggregate

risk.6

         The intermediation technology is constant returns to scale with intermediation

costs being proportional to the amount intermediated. To calibrate the constant of

proportionality, we use Flow of Funds Account statistics and data from National Income

and Product Accounts. The calibrated value of this parameter equals the net interest

income of financial intermediaries, divided by the quantity of intermediated debt, and is

approximately 2 percent.7

         In the absence of aggregate uncertainty, the return on equity and the borrowing

rate are identical, since the households who borrow are also marginal in equity markets.

In our framework, government debt is intermediated at zero cost, and thus its return is

  Using a model with no capital accumulation, Mehra and Prescott (1985) find a small equity premium.
McGrattan and Prescott (2000) find that the equity premium is small in the growth model if it is restricted
to be consistent with growth and business cycle facts. Lettau and Uhlig (2000) introduce habit formation
into the standard growth model and find that the equity premium is small if the model parameters are
restricted to be consistent with the business cycle facts. Many others using the growth model restricted to
be consistent with the macro economic growth and business cycle facts have found the same thing.

equal to the household lending rate. An important feature is that the government can

borrow at a lower rate than can households, which mirrors reality.

       In our model, all households in a cohort have identical labor income at every

point in their working life. As a consequence of this, there is little difference in cross

sectional consumption at a point in time. However, sizable differences in net worth

develop within a cohort over their working years. One implication is that preferences for

bequests cannot be ignored when studying net worth distributions.

       The paper is organized as follows. The economy is specified in Section 2. In

Section 3, we discuss the decision problem of the households. Section 4 deals with the

aggregation of individual behavior, Section 5 with the relevant balance sheets, and

Section 6 characterizes the balanced growth equilibrium. We calibrate the economy in

Section 7. In Section 8, we present and discuss our results. Section 9 concludes the paper.



2. The Economy

       In order to build a model that captures the large amount of observed borrowing

and lending, as well as the large amount of resources used in this process, we introduce

three key features of reality. The first feature is differences in bequest preferences, the

second is an uncertain length of retirement, and the third is costly intermediation of

borrowing and lending between households. This leads some households to buy costly

annuities that make payments throughout the retirement years. Since buying an annuity is

isomorphic to lending, households choosing the annuity option are the lenders in our

model. Households with high bequest utility save by increasing their net worth, which is

their holding of productive capital less their debt.

       We model an overlapping generations economy, and consider its balanced growth
                                                8

path equilibrium. All households born at a given date are identical in all respects except

for their bequest preference parameter . They all have identical preferences with respect

to consumptions over their lifetime, so the only dimension over which they differ is              .

Those with a not small        (type-B) borrow and own capital; others with               or weak

preferences for bequest (type-A) lend by acquiring annuities.

        What motivates bequests? While a casual consideration of bequests naturally

assumes that they exist because of parents’ altruistic concern for the economic well-being

of their offspring, results in Menchik and David (1983), Hurd (1989), Wilhelm (1996),

Laitner and Juster (1996), Altonji, Hayashi, and Kotlikoff (1997), Laitner and Ohlsson

(2001), Kopczuk and Lupton (2007), and Fuster, Imrohoroglu and Imrohoroglu (2008)

suggest otherwise: households with children do not, in general, exhibit behavior in

greater accord with a bequest motive than do childless households. This, we think, leads

us to conclude that the existing literature supports our assumption that some people have

preferences for making bequests. These empirical results lead us to eschew the

perspective of Barro (1974) and Becker and Barro (1988), who postulate that each

generation receives utility from the consumption of the generations to follow, and simply

model bequests as being motivated by a well-defined “joy of giving,”8 as in Abel and

Warshawsky (1988) and Constantinides, Donaldson, and Mehra (2007).

Households

        Any systematic consideration of bequests mandates that the analysis be

undertaken in the context of an overlapping generations model. Accordingly, we analyze

an overlapping generations economy and determine its balanced growth behavior. Each

period, a set of individuals of measure one enter the economy. Two types enter at each

date: Type A, who derive no utility from leaving a bequest, and type-B, whose utility is

an increasing function of the amount they bequeath.9 The measure of type                                  is

    . The total measure of people born at each date is 1, so                        .

         Individuals have finite expected lives. They enter the labor force at age 22, work

for     years, and then retire.10 Model age j is 0 when a person begins his or her working

life. The first year of retirement is model age               .

         All workers receive an identical wage income. Wage income grows at the

economy’s balanced growth rate                 . At retirement, individuals face idiosyncratic

uncertainty about the length of their remaining lifetime. Their retirement lifetimes are

exponentially distributed. Once individuals retire, the probability of surviving to the next

period is                , where       is the probability of death. Expected life is                   . We

emphasize that there is no aggregate uncertainty.11

         Individuals of type        , born at time t, order their preferences over age-contingent

consumption and bequests by12

  The “no utility from a bequest” assumption is a simplifying one and is not necessary for the analysis. All
that is needed is the utility from bequest be sufficiently small that the type-A choose to acquire annuities.

   We implicitly assume that parents finance the consumption of their children under the age of 22; in other
words, children’s consumption is a part of their parents’ consumption.

   The Blanchard (1985) model has individuals with exponential life. The Díaz-Giménez et al. (1992)
model has individuals with both an exponential working life and an exponential retirement life.

   Our model has no factor giving rise to life cycle consumption patterns over the working life as in
Fernández-Villaverde and Krueger (2002).

Here          is the discount factor and           is the strength of bequest parameter. Variable

        is the period consumption of a j-year-old born at time t,13 conditional on being alive

at time t + j. An individual who is born at time t and dies at age                    consumes nothing

at time t + j and bequeaths                  units of the period t + j consumption good and

consumes nothing subsequently. Each generation supplies one unit of labor inelastically

for                   . Thus, aggregate labor supply is                given that the measure of each

generation is 1.

         We only need to analyze the decision problems of an individual of a type

individual born at time t = 0. The solution to the problem for a type                  born at any other

time t can be found using the fact that along a balanced growth path

(2.2)

Further, to simplify the notation, we use             to denote the consumption of a j-year-old at

time j rather than       . An analogous change of notation applies to the other variables.

         The aggregate production function is

        Output is produced competitively, so

where     is the depreciation rate,        is both the household borrowing rate and the return

on equity, and     is the wage rate.

        Income is received as either wage income           or gross capital income      . Thus,

Along a balanced growth path, investment                          and                    .


Financial Intermediation Technology

        The intermediation technology displays constant returns to scale, with the

intermediation cost in units of the composite output good being proportional to the

amount of borrowing and lending intermediated. The cost is                   times the amount of

borrowing and lending between households.14               The intermediary also intermediates

between households lending to the government. There are no costs associated with this

intermediation. The intermediary receives interest rate             on its lending to households

and effectively pays interest rate            on its borrowing from households. Given the

technology, equilibrium interest rates satisfy

14
  Miller and Upton (1974) pioneered in having a financial sector in their dynamic general equilibrium
model. They had no intermediation costs.

                           .

          The lending contract between households and intermediaries is not the standard

one, but rather an annuity contract. A household can enter into an annuity contract at age

0.     An annuity contract specifies an age-contingent premium payment path during

working life, a benefit path contingent on being alive subsequent to retirement, and a

payment upon death. The amount being lent by an individual who has chosen the annuity

contract is the value of pension fund reserves for that contract at that point in time. These

reserves are equal to the expected present value of future payments less the expected

present value of future premium payments, if any. The present value is calculated using r

the lending rate at which households can lend to intermediaries. Competitive

intermediaries will offer any annuity contract with the property that the expected present

value of benefits is equal to the present value of the premiums using          in the present

value calculations.

          The alternative to entering into an annuity contract to save for retirement is to

accumulate capital and to borrow to partially finance that capital. Our model has three

sectors: a household sector, a government sector, and a financial sector. The non-

financial business sector is consolidated with household sector.


Government Policy

          Government policy is characterized by a tax rate      on labor income, an interest

rate      on government debt, and the path of government debt                          . The

feasible government policy parameters are constrained to a one dimensional manifold.

Theoretically it does not matter which of the three policy parameters is picked. We chose

     because it simplified finding the equilibrium and there is a wealth of observations as to
                                                          13

a reasonable value for its choice. The government finances interest payments on its debt

by issuing new debt and by taxing labor income. The government’s period t budget

constraint is

            The government pursues a tax rate policy that pegs15                   , which equals the interest

rate on government debt. This being a balanced growth analysis, government debt grows

at rate            , which means that the government deficits are positive and grow at rate

as well.

            The intermediary holds all the government debt, and there are no intermediation

costs associated with holding this asset on the part of the intermediary.

Bequests

            Aggregate bequests at date t are

(2.11)                                   .

We let               . The inheritance of a type-B born at                  is

(2.12)

and is received at date                . The inheritance of a type-A born at                   is

(2.13)                                          .

The reason that a type-A’s inheritance is slightly smaller than that of a type-B is that their

inheritances are intermediated and intermediation is costly.


15
     In this paper, we fix this at 3 percent. This is discussed further in Section 7 on calibration.

3. Optimal Individual Decisions

       We consider the optimal individual decision problem, taking as given (i) the size

of the inheritance the individual will receive at model age 30 (chronological age 52), (ii)

wages at each date of the individual’s working life, (iii) the labor income tax rate   , and

(iv) the borrowing and lending rates     and     . The first problem facing an individual is

whether to choose the annuity strategy A or the no annuity strategy B. The parameters of

the calibrated economy are such that a type-A will choose the annuity strategy, while a

type-B will choose the no annuity strategy. The second problem is to determine the

optimal lifetime consumption and savings decisions conditional on the strategy chosen.

We determine, given      , the optimal consumption/saving behavior for each strategy and

the resulting lifetime utility, and then determine which of the two strategies is best for

that individual type.

       A convention followed is that a bar over a variable denotes a constant. In the case

where the constant depends upon a person’s type, that is, on              , this functional

dependence is indicated. This is necessary because the best strategy will differ across

household types.


The Best No Annuity Strategy

       This problem can be split into two sub-problems. The first problem is the one

after retirement, which is stationary and is solved using recursive techniques. The state

variable is net worth, which is in units of the current period consumption good. The value

of a unit of k is          to a household choosing the no annuity strategy. The second

problem is to determine consumptions and savings over the working life.
                                                15

        The problem becomes stationary and recursive at retirement age T, with net worth

w being the state variable. The value function          is the maximal obtainable expected

current and future utility flows if a retiree is alive and has net worth w. The optimality

equation is



(3.1)



The solution to this optimality equation has the form

(3.2)                                       ,

where

(3.3)                             .


        The optimal consumption/saving policy for retirees is


(3.4)


The bequests, conditional on j − 1 being the person’s last year of life, is

(3.5)                  .

        The problem facing an individual at birth who follows the no annuity strategy

(which we call strategy B because it is the one chosen by those with a sufficiently strong

preference for making a bequest) is
                                                16

Here      is the present value of wages and inheritance of an individual born at         . The

solution (see Appendix 2 for more details) is


(3.7)



where                                                .


         The preretirement age j net worth of an individual following this strategy satisfies



(3.8)




The Best Annuity Strategy

         The best annuity strategy for a type        is the solution to the following:




(3.9)




where     is the lending rate and


(3.10)                                                   .
                                              17


The constant       is the present value of future wage income and inheritances using the

lending rate r of a person born at         . The superscript A denotes the annuity strategy

and not an individual type. In equilibrium, type-A will choose strategy A.

         There are other constraints, specifically, that the worker choosing this strategy

does not borrow. For the economies considered in this study, these constraints are not

binding and can therefore be ignored. If, however, the economy were such that the no-

borrowing constraint were binding for some j, then the solution below would not be the

solution to the problem formulated above.

         The nature of the annuity contract is that the payment to a retiree who is alive at

age         is   . If the individual dies at age j, payment   is made to that person’s estate.

The solution to this program is

(3.11)

(3.12)

         The net worth of an individual choosing this strategy is the pension fund reserves

associated with that individual’s annuity contract. Pension fund reserves (from the point

of view of the intermediary) for a given annuity contract for an individual born at         at

age j in equilibrium equals the expected present value at time         of payments that will

be made less the value (at time        as well) of premiums that will be received.

         For workers, they can be determined as the present value of past premiums. Thus,

pension fund reserves for individuals’ annuity holders born at        at age j satisfy



(3.13)
                                              18

For retirees, conditional on being alive, pension fund reserves for individuals born at

      at age j are equal to the expected present value of the future payments:


(3.14)



The Best Strategy

         In general there will be a        such that a household chooses strategy B if its

exceeds          and the annuity strategy otherwise. Propositions 1 is used to establish this

result under a restriction that is satisfied for the calibrated model economy.


Proposition 1: If                                   then                          .


Proof: In Appendix 1.□



         The value of           affects the relative attractiveness of the two strategies.

Proposition 2 establishes that an -household will choose the annuity strategy if             is

sufficiently small and the no annuity strategy if     is sufficiently large.

Proposition 2: For sufficiently small         ,                   . For sufficiently large ,

                 .

Proof outline: For small non-negative       , the value of insurance associated with strategy

A exceeds the value of the higher return associated with strategy B. This is why strategy

A dominates for small        . For large   , the cost of the annuity is large and the higher

return associated with the no annuity strategy dominates.            This is why strategy B

dominates for large     .□

       Figure 1 plots the difference in utilities for the two strategies, as a function of   ,

for the prices, tax rate, and bequest for our calibrated economy. We see that individuals

with bequest preference parameter             choose to annuitize.

4. Aggregate Behavior of the Household Sector

Aggregate Consumption

       Aggregate consumption depends upon the labor tax rate      and inheritance      as

well as the prices         . Equilibrium prices do not depend upon the household side,

and can be determined from the policy choice of r and profit-maximizing conditions.

Having formulated the optimal consumption strategies for the two types of individuals,

we characterize the aggregate consumption, asset holdings, and bequest at time         by

individual type given     and     and the equilibrium prices. Two aggregate equilibrium

relations must be solved for the variables   and   .
                                             21


        There are two types of households             . The type-A has         and will in

equilibrium choose the annuity strategy A given the model economy. The type-B has         ,

which is sufficiently large that the equilibrium is such that they chose not annuitize. The

measure of type-i of age j at           is


(4.1)


The aggregate consumption of the type-i households at time 0 is            :


(4.2)                                                              .


Here we have used the fact that each subsequent generation has a consumption-age

profile that is higher by a factor of        in balanced growth.

        Aggregate consumption is

(4.3)                                         .


Aggregate Asset Holdings

        The aggregate net worth at time 0 of a type           is


(4.4)                                                                  .


Net worth is prior to consumption and receipt of wage income and includes net interest

income and dividend income. In the case of the intermediary, net worth includes

intermediation cost liabilities. Net worth is prior to consumption and is denominated in

units of the current period consumption good.
                                              22

Aggregate Inheritance

        At time 0 the measure of the people aged           who die and leave a bequest is

           ; thus, the total bequests given by these households is

                                   .

Hence, the aggregate bequests at time 0 are


(4.5)                                  .



Aggregate Private Debt

        The aggregate indebtedness of a type-B satisfies

(4.6)                                              ,

because the price of existing capital in terms of the consumption good is            and the

household is obligated to make a payment of                     .


5. Balance Sheets

        Assets and liabilities are beginning of period numbers and are in units of the

consumption good. We consider only economies for which there is intermediated

borrowing and lending in equilibrium. Given there is a large amount of intermediated

borrowing and lending, these economies are the ones of empirical interest.

Type-A Sector: The assets of the type-A consist of pension fund reserves. They have no

liabilities. The value of these pension reserves (in terms of the consumption good) is:

Pension fund reserves =                                        . Their balance sheet is as

follows:
                                             23




                          Balance Sheet of Type-A Households

                                   Assets             Liabilities

                            Pension fund          0
                            reserves
                                                  Net worth



Hence, their net worth satisfies

                                                                    .


Type-B Sector: Those following the no annuity strategy have aggregate debt

and hold all the economy’s capital,    . Their balance sheet is as follows:

                          Balance Sheet of Type-B Households

                                   Assets             Liabilities




                                                  Net worth



       Here we have adjusted the assets and liabilities by a factor           to get the net

worth in units of the consumption good. Their net worth is

                                                               .


Financial Intermediary Sector: The assets of the financial intermediary are the

liabilities of the government and the type-B households, while its liabilities are the

pension assets of type-A households and the amount payable for intermediation services.

The net worth of the financial intermediaries is zero.

             Private debt =                        Amounts payable for
                                                   intermediation services =



                                                   Net worth = 0




Government: The assets of the government are the present value of the tax receipts on

labor income, while its liabilities are the debt it has outstanding.

                              Balance Sheet of the Government

                                                   Net worth = 0



       Since labor is supplied inelastically and taxed at a rate             , the government

effectively owns a fraction      of an individual’s time endowment (now and in all future

periods). In our model economy, the net worth of the government is zero and government

debt is an asset for debt holders in our model.
                                              25

6. Equilibrium Relations

        We normalize Y to 1 and determine the value of a set of balanced growth

variables at      . All variables grow at rate         except aggregate labor supply, which is

constant and equal to 40,     , financial intermediation, and aggregate consumption. Given

that Y has been normalized to 1 at time 0, the cost share relationships determine time 0

capital stock K and wage e:

(6.1)

(6.2)

        From the intermediary’s problem, the lending rate satisfies

(6.3)                    .


Three Equilibrium Conditions

        Prices          are determined from policy and technology. Therefore, only

and     are needed to completely specify the household budget constraints. Conditional on

these variables, aggregate consumption,                , and aggregate intermediation,       ,

will be determined by aggregating individual household variables. Aggregation, given the

individual decisions conditional on     and      , is specified in Appendix 2.

        One aggregate equilibrium condition is the aggregate resource constraint,

(6.4)                                              ,

where                  is investment. Intermediation services satisfy


(6.5)                                   .


We assume that type-B households hold all the capital and the intermediaries none. This
                                               26

is done to resolve an unimportant indeterminacy. Increasing the amount of capital held by

a type-B and that type-B’s indebtedness by the same amount does not affect that type-B’s

net worth, which is what is relevant. This portfolio shift by a type-B household is offset

by a portfolio shifts by other type-B households. The aggregate indebtedness of a type-B

is denoted by           and is equal to         .

        The second equilibrium condition is that the inheritance of households at a point

in time equals aggregate bequests at that point in time. We consider         and let

be the aggregate bequest at that time. The second equilibrium condition is

(6.6)                               .

        There is a third equilibrium condition, namely, the government’s budget

constraint. This constraint                          equates payments to receipts. Given

                 ,               , and the normalization            , the time 0 government

budget constraint is

(6.7)                                      .


Equilibrium

The first two equilibrium conditions are linear in            , so solving for a candidate

solution is straightforward. This solution is the equilibrium only if in addition (i) the best

strategy for type-B households is the no annuity strategy; (ii) the best strategy for type-A

households is the annuity strategy; (iii) type-B borrows and does not lend; and (iv) type-

A lend and does not borrow. The reason for the last constraint is that these equilibrium

conditions hold provided that the no-borrowing constraint on annuity holders is not

binding and it will not be binding if (iv) holds.

7. Calibration

       The parameters that need to be calibrated are those related to the

households                            ; the intermediation technology parameter { }; the

production good technology parameters                 ; and the policy parameter   . The other

two policy parameters             are endogenous. As mentioned before, the choice         as a

parameter and τ as an endogenous variable is only for convenience; reversing their roles

will not affect the results described in Section 8.



       Many of these parameters are well documented in the literature; others are not.

We proceed by listing the parameters with the selected values and a brief motivation.



Parameters Associated with Individuals

                   (Annuity holders’ c grows at almost 2 percent over their lifetimes)

                  (Implies a post-retirement life expectancy of 20 years)

                 (Assumption: Type-A individuals have low bequest intensity)

                 (Assumption: Type-B individuals have high bequest intensity)

                 (Workers retire at chronological age 63)

                     (Specified so that the amount intermediated matches U.S. data)




Intermediation parameters

                 (Consistent with the average difference in borrowing and lending rates)
                                                   28

Policy parameters

                     (Assumption about government fiscal policy)

The motivation for this policy is that this has been the approximate return on lending by

households (See McGrattan and Prescott, 2003).


Goods production parameters

                    (Capital income share)

                      (Average growth rate of U.S. per capita output)

                          (Consistent with capital output ratio = 3.4, given   .

           In calibrating      we proceed as follows. Our model economy has household,

government, and financial intermediary sectors. All nonfinancial business borrowing is

consolidated with the household sector. We start with the net interest income of the

financial intermediation sector. Fees are a small part of this sector’s product and most of

them are for transaction services, which is not intermediation in the sense used in this

study. Using data from NIPA16 for year 2007, the interest received amounted to 0.165

times gross national product (GNP)17 and interest paid amounted to 0.110 times GNP. To

estimate the services associated with intermediating borrowing and lending, we first

subtracted intermediation services furnished without payment to households as we did

not want to include implicit purchases of transaction services by the household. We also

subtracted part of bad debt viewing it as interest not received by the intermediary to

obtain an estimate of the cost of intermediating borrowing and lending between

households of 3.4 percent of GNP in 2007. See Table 1.

           Using data from the Flow of Funds, we found the debt outstanding of our

household sector, which includes nonfinancial businesses, equals 1.72 times GNP.18 The

implied intermediation spread is thus 2.0 percent and in turn the calibrated                          . This

number results in the after-tax returns being close to their historical averages (see

McGrattan and Prescott (2003, 2005)).

           In dealing with transaction costs associated with buying and selling assets and

fees such as those paid by investors to say a trust company, we follow the convention

used by US national accounts and do not include them as a part of intermediation costs.

The assets in our model are capital K, government debt, Type B household debt, and

pension fund reserves. With regard to K transactions, say the brokerage fees associated

with transferring ownership of an owner occupied house, NIPA treats these costs as an

investment and justifies this as putting the house to more productive use.                                 With

government debt transfer of ownership costs are zero in our model and virtually zero in

fact. Pension fund reserves are not traded between households, and therefore there are

almost no costs associated with transferring ownership. The total costs of buying and

selling of household debt between financial intermediaries are small and are part of

intermediation costs. Households incur brokerage fees associated with transferring

ownership of financial securities between households. These fees are not payment for

intermediating debt between households and therefore not part of the cost of

intermediated borrowing and lending between households. Brokerage fees paid by

intermediaries are part of the costs of intermediating borrowing and lending between

households.


8. Results

We considered four values for                , a parameter for which we have little information. For

each value of           we search for the         for which the intermediated borrowing and lending

between households is 1.72 times GNP. The results are summarized in Table 2, which

shows results not sensitive to the size of the bequest preference parameter                       . Given that

the aggregate results are insensitive to                  , subsequently we deal only with the case

           .19




19
     Like Cagetti and De Nardi (2006), there is little consequence of inheritance for the net worth distribution.

Balance Sheet of Households

       Table 3 details the aggregate balance sheet data for U.S households implied by

our model. Our model is calibrated so that both the privately held capital stock (    ) and

the intermediated household borrowing and lending (                 ) match US statistics;

government debt (     ) is endogenously determined. One test of our model is how well it

replicates this and other statistics, such as bequests and inheritances, for the U.S

economy. We examine each in turn.


Government Debt

       Government debt in our model, which is 4.6 times GNP, may at first sight appear

large relative to U.S. federal, state and local government debt, which was only 0.5 GNP

in 2007. However, there are huge implicit annuity-like liabilities of the U.S. government,

such as Social Security Retirement and Medicare benefits. Households value the expected

present value of these annuity-like net benefits and consider them as assets that contribute

to their net worth. Hence, in the aggregate balance sheet of our model economy, the

empirical counterpart of model government debt is explicit government debt plus the
                                                        33

expected present value of these net benefits. Careful studies by Gokhale and Smetters

(2003 and 2006) estimate the present value of these net benefits as between 4.2 and 5

GNP.20 In light of this, the stock of government debt in our model is reasonable.

           An additional point is that if no one had a bequest motive, the steady-state capital

stock would be the same, namely, 3.4 times GNP, and government debt in our model

would be slightly larger. Policy and not nature of bequest preferences is what determines

the capital-output ratio.


Bequests

           A surprising finding is that the model’s prediction regarding the magnitude of the

bequests is insensitive to the strength of the bequest motive. We believe this insensitivity

is due to the fact that bequest expenditures in the intertemporal budget constraint are

small relative to the sum of all event contingent total expenditures, coupled with the fact

that the measure of agents who leave a bequest (type B) is a small fraction of the total

population.

           Total annual bequests in our model, as seen in Table 3, are 0.035 times GNP for

           . The aggregate value of estates in 2007 that exceeded $675,000 was 0.00123

times GNP.21 Some of these estates are inter-spousal and should not be included. This is

more than offset by bequest that were under the limit for which estate tax returns had to

be filed. Adding these and inter vivo transfers and adjusting for underreporting of gifts

associated with the transfer of family businesses to the younger generation would result

in aggregate bequests being close to model aggregate bequests.

        Modigliani’s (1988) estimate of bequest flows is close to the flow in our model.

He reports bequests of 0.02 times GNP. He adds life insurance, death benefits and newly

established trusts to conclude that bequests are at least 0.027 times GNP.

        Another measure of the size of bequests is the amount an individual inherits

expressed in units of the individual’s annual wage at time of inheritance. Each individual

receives at chronological age 52 an amount equal to 1.98 times their annual wage at that

time. Menchick and David (1983) estimate average the inheritance received by all males

to be $20,000 (in 1967 dollars). We estimate the average gross annual wage for that year

as $8840, arriving at a ratio of inheritance received to annual wage equal to 2.26.22

However, correcting for inter-spousal transfers the inheritance received could well

reduced it to $13,220, which results in a ratio of inheritance received to annual wage of

1.5. These considerations suggest that inheritances are consistent with the predictions of

our model.23

Inheritance

        Another variable of interest is the fraction of wealth that is inherited. A significant

component of wealth is human capital, which is the present value of wages in our model

world where labor is supplied inelastically. The other part is the present value of

inheritance. As shown in Table 4, human capital is about 95.5 percent of wealth at entry

into the workforce and would be higher if there were population growth. These results are

for a Type A households, who discount using a 3 percent rate. The share is a little lower

22
   Nominal GDP in 1967 was $833 billion. Assuming that 70 percent of GDP is labor income (consistent
with our model economy) we obtain an estimate of total wage income of $583 billion in 1967. Then, since
the total employment in that year was 65.9 million, the average gross annual wage income is $8840.
23
   We examined the consequence of population growth and found that they were small. Bequests fall to
0.03 times GNP as the population growth increases to the point at which the growth rate of the economy
equals the interest rate.
                                              35

for type-B households who use a 5 percent discount rate. Anything that reduces the ratio

of bequests to GNP reduces this number, so for the model with a 1 percent population

growth rate, as in the United States, this ratio is near 97 percent.

                                           Table 4
                Inheritance as Fraction of Wealth at Entry into Workforce


              Type-A            0.044        0.045           0.047       0.050
              Type-B            0.035        0.036           0.038       0.040



       The issues as to the importance of bequest for the size of the capital stock are

mute in our model, as policy determines the capital stock and not the nature of

preferences for bequests. However, a statistic of interest is the one estimated by Kotlikoff

and Summers (1981). This statistic is the present value of inheritances people alive have

received, using a 3 percent interest rate. Their estimate of this number is 0.80 times the

total household net worth. Modigliani’s (1988) estimate of this number is much smaller:

0.20. Modigliani (Table 1, page 19) presents a number of other estimates, all of which

range between 0.10 and 0.20. This ratio number for our model economy is 0.18, which is

in line with these estimates.

       In our model economy 93 percent of bequests are accidental. We came up with

this number as follows. Setting              for type-B households and requiring type-B

households to follow the no annuity strategy results in this number. Treating these

accidental bequests as savings for retirement along with all type-A savings implies that

99 percent of savings is for retirement purposes and 1 percent is for bequests.

Testable Implications

         Although our model was not developed to match both the explicit and implicit

liabilities of the government, the aggregate savings predicted by our theory are

approximately equal to that observed. The total government debt and bequests / GDP

implied by our model is in line with the US historical experience. This, we believe, is an

important testable implication.


Some Micro Findings

         Our abstraction has implications for micro observations as well. Unlike the macro

findings, the model’s micro findings are not a quantitative theory of the consequence of

the bequest motive for the distributions of consumption, net worth, and equity holdings

and consequently must be interpreted with care. They do, however, show that the bequest

motive, or for that matter any factor that leads people to partially finance their capital

acquisitions with debt, is quantitatively important for these statistics. With this caveat, the

micro distributional relations for our model economy are as follows.

         Figure 2 plots the lifetime consumption patterns of the two types of households.

Type-A’s consumption grows at a constant annual rate of 1.97 percent throughout their

lifetime. Type-B’s starts out lower and grows more rapidly during their working life,

with this growth rate being 3.95 percent. Upon retirement the consumption growth rate

turns negative, falling to -0.95 percent. At retirement a type-B retiree’s consumption is

higher than an equal age type-A retiree.24



24
  There is a rich literature on the life cycle consumption patterns, including the works of Attanasio, Banks,
Meghir, and Weber (1999) and Hansen and Imrohoroglu (2008), among others. This is not the concern of
this paper, but the fact that life cycle patterns differ for those choosing to annuitize and those choosing
not to annuitize has implications for the empirical pattern of life cycle consumption.

Cross-sectional consumption

Figure 3 plots cross-sectional consumption by age for the two types. All type-A that are

alive have virtually the same consumption. Young type-B workers have lower

consumption and older workers have higher consumption. For the type-B retirees,

consumption level declines with age.

Net worth by age

In Figure 4 we plot net worth relative to current annual wage income, which has a

stationary distribution. At retirement the net worth of a type-A household is 12 times the

annual wage, and that of a type-B is 19 times the annual wage. The disparity in net worth

(corrected for age) is modest, being a maximum of about 1.6 at retirement age. After

retirement disparity falls until age 78, and then starts growing with the type-A household

becoming the one with the greater net worth. The jump in net worth at chronological age

52 is due to inheritance.

Lorenz curves

Figure 5 plots the Lorenz curves for consumption, net worth, and capital or equity

holdings. In the case of capital, we assume all type-B households have the same ratio of

debt liabilities to capital in their portfolios in order to resolve the portfolio indeterminacy

at the individual level. We truncate the distribution at age 112, so the curves are not

exact, but are very good approximations given the small fraction of population over this

age.

       Our model is not designed to address issues about wealth distribution as we have

abstracted from any heterogeneity in human capital. All agents have the same earnings

stream. Our principal findings are that there is almost no disparity in consumption levels
                                                  41

and sizable disparities in net worth levels. This shows that the dispersion in net worth is a

bad proxy for dispersion in consumption.25

        In our model economy, all individuals have the same human capital endowments.

If the model were modified to have people earn proportionally different wages, to a first

approximation an individual’s allocation is proportional to that individual’s wage.26

Thus, introducing wage disparity would add disparity in consumption and net worth.

Introducing entrepreneurs (Cagetti and De Nardi (2006)) and idiosyncratic risk

(Castãneda, Díaz-Giménez, and Ríos-Rull (2003) and Chatterjee et al. (2007)) would

increase disparity as well.

   If bequests were distributed proportional to the human capital factor, the scaling result would hold
exactly.

Cost of financial market constraints

       What are the gains to a household of having access to the equity market at no

intermediation cost? Table 5 reports the cost of not having this access, which was the

case for most Americans prior to the development of low-cost indexed mutual funds, as

being about 4.0 percent of wealth at time of entry into the workforce. This wealth is the

present value of labor income and inheritance.

Tables 5 and 6 show the percentage increase in either     , that is wealth at time of entry

into the workforce, which is necessary to compensate an              in wealth equivalents

if forced to switch to a system other than their preferred choice. Since both consumption

and bequest are linear functions of initial wealth, the percentage changes in both

consumptions and bequests are the same as the percentage change in initial wealth.

       What are the costs to a type-A if for some reason, such as adverse selection

problems or legal constraints, they do not have access to annuity markets and must use

the equity option for saving? The cost is small, being approximately 0.8 percent of

lifetime consumption.

Implications for the Equity Premium

           In our framework, there is no equity premium as there is no aggregate uncertainty.

The return on equity and the borrowing rate are both equal to 5%. This is a no arbitrage

condition. The return on government debt is 3%. If we use the conventional definition of

the equity premium – the return on a broad equity index less the return on government

debt – we would erroneously conclude that in our model the equity premium was 2%.

The difference in the government borrowing rate and the return on equity is not an equity

premium; it arises because of the wedge between borrowing and lending rates.

Analogously if in the U.S economy borrowing and lending rates for equity investors

differ, (and they do) the equity premium should be measured relative to the investor

borrowing rate rather than the government’s borrowing rate (the investor lending rate).

Measuring the premium relative to the government’s borrowing rate artificially increases

the premium for bearing aggregate risk by the difference between the investor’s

borrowing and lending rates.27 If such a correction were made to the results reported in

Mehra and Prescott (1985) the equity premium would be 4% rather than the reported 6%.

9. Concluding Comments

           In this paper, we develop a heterogeneous household economy where households

differ along only one dimension: their preferences for bequest. In equilibrium,

households with a low desire to bequeath lend and hold annuities, while those with a high

desire to bequeath borrow and own capital. This is important because the total amount of

borrowing by households and the government must equal the amount lent by households.

Our simple framework mimics reality with respect to both the amount of intermediated

borrowing and lending between households and the average spread in borrowing and

lending rates resulting from intermediation costs. In addition, amount of aggregate

savings predicted by the theory is approximately equal to the observed amount of

aggregate savings. This is an important test of our theory, as it was not developed to

match both the explicit and implicit liabilities of the government.28

           We view this as a first step in what we think will prove to be a productive

research program. Possible extensions include building in differential survival rates and

addressing the issues of adverse selection and moral hazard when pricing annuities. This

extension might justify our requirement that people choose between the annuity and the

no annuity strategies early in their careers. This research program, if successful, will

require extension of the theory of household lifetime consumption behavior because the

bequest motive is not the only salient factor that differentiates people. Differences in

preferences with respect to consumption today versus consumption in the future and

differences in preferences that give rise to differences in lifetime labor supply are likely

to be important as well.

       Another possible extension is to model non-steady-state behavior as in

Geanakoplos, Magill, and Quinzii (2004) who consider the importance of demographic

waves for stock market valuation or as in Braun, Ikeda, and Joines (2007) for saving

behavior within the overlapping generation framework.

        The prices            , tax rate , and inheritance implied by      are given to an
individual. Note             . Let                       represent the maximum attainable
utility of an agent of measure zero in this economy who follows strategy A (annuity) or B
(bequest) respectively as a function of         . Define                       .


Proposition 1: If                           then


                                                        .


Proof: The maximum utility as a function of        attainable by an agent who follows an
annuity strategy (A), taking as given the parameters of the economy, can be expressed as:


                                                                    ,


where




(       and    are defined in Section 3).

Similarly, the maximum utility as a type      who follows an annuity strategy (B) is


                                                                    ,

(        and   are defined in Section 3).

Using the properties of the logarithm function and defining          =          =


(A1.1)


Since the first term is independent of      it follows that


(A1.2)                                                                      ,



where                      which does not depend on           .




                                                                                      This



implies the second term in (A1.2) is positive, i.e.,



To prove our assertion that                 is positive, we proceed in three steps:

    a. We show that                   ;

    b. We show that                ; and that

    c.
                                               49



Some straightforward algebra yields



(A1.3)



From (A1.3) it is readily seen that                                      . This follows since the last
term tends to       and all the other terms are bounded. This coupled with the fact that

                         proves that                      .



The second derivative             is negative by direct differentiation,

                                                              ,


since the denominator is always positive and the numerator is negative.



Finally it can be shown that                        under the condition stated in the theorem.
Notice that (taking the limit of A1.3) when                   ) equation A1.2) is positive if and only
if


                                                                           .


The last term in the above expression has already been shown to be positive. Thus a
sufficient condition for this inequality is


                                                      .



This inequality can be written as


Since a), b), and c) are satisfied, it follows that                                . QED

General formulas

There are two types           . The A-type has         and in equilibrium choose the
annuity strategy given the model economy. The measure of type i of age j at  is

Aggregate quantity for variable Z of type             agents at     is       ,

where     is the individual allocation of type-i at age j born at   . Notice that we have

used the fact that each subsequent generation has a consumption-age profile that is higher
by a factor of         under balanced growth. Aggregate quantity of Z at time 0,     is




Agent Type-B

Aggregate assets of agent type-B and aggregate bequest

The aggregate assets for B-type agents are computed using the law of motion of Net
Worth. From the individual problem,




From equations (3.4) and (3.7), the consumption for type B is given by

and


Using (A2.2) aggregate net worth is




The summation over j=0,…,T-1 is performed numerically, while for total net worth of the
retirees is



(A2.5)                                                                             ,


where from the individual problem




Since         all bequests are coming from the type-B, and as shown in Section 3.1 is
given by




if a type-B dies prior to the end of the previous period subsequent to consuming, and zero
otherwise.

Since the measure of agents dying at each age           is                   the
aggregate bequest is
                                             52




Using (A2.5) it is straightforward to find that

Aggregate consumption type B

Similarly, using (A2.2) and (A2.3) the aggregate consumption of type B agents at time 0
can be expressed as

Agent Type A

Aggregate assets of agent type A

The aggregate bequest is measured in units of agent type B assets, therefore the
inheritance received by agent type A measured in her assets’ units is
                   . The aggregate assets for agents type A are computed using the law
of motion of Net Worth. From the individual problem,




(A2.8)




Using (A2.2) aggregate net worth is calculated as




As for type B, the summation for j=0,…,T is performed numerically. Since in the
calibration,       . From equation (3.11) consumption for type A agents, born at period
zero when they reach age j (at time j), is




Then, agents alive at time 0 of age j consume



(A2.9)


Using (A2.8) and (A2.9) net worth for retired agents can be written as


                         .


Then
                                            54




Aggregate consumption type A

Again, using (A2.2) and (A2.9), the aggregate consumption of type A agents at time 0
can be expressed as

(A2.10)                                                  ,

Notice that both the net worth of the intermediary and the government are 0.

Equilibrium Conditions

There are three equilibrium conditions that can potentially be used to solve the model:


1) Feasibility:                      Y=          +X+                    ,
                                          55


where

2) Bequest=inheritance:               =


3) Assets Markets                              +         =          +K


Since this is a linear system in         one equation is redundant, and the solution is
straightforward. We chose to use the first two equilibrium conditions, and then we check
that the third one is satisfied as well.
