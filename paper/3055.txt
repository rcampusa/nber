  SYNTHETIC EUROCURRENCY INTEREST RATE FUTURES CONTRACTS:                    THEORY AND EVIDENCE



                                              ABSTRACT


          In this paper, we develop a theoretical (arbitrage) pricing model for a Eurocurrency

  interest rate futures contract and measure its hedging effectiveness. This synthetic

  Eurocurrency interest rate futures contract is obtained by combining exisiting Eurodollar

  interest rate futures contracts with near term and far term currency futures contracts based

  on the covered interest rate parity relationship. In theory, the cash flows of the synthetic

  contract perfectly replicate the cash flows of a Eurocurrency interest rate futures contract.

  Our empirical results show that the synthetic contracts are relatively efficient in hedging

   non-dollar borrowing rates. These results have implications for the practice of hedging

   non-dollar interest rate risk and for the development of actual Eurocurrency interest rate

  futures markets.
