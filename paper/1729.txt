                  Birth Outcome Production Functions in the U.S.


                                    ABSTRACT


        This paper contains the first infant health production functions that

   simultaneously consider the effects of a variety of inputs on race—specific

   neonatal mortality rates. These inputs include the use of prenatal care,

   neonatal intensive care, abortion, Federally subsidized organized family

   planning clinics, maternal and infant care projects, community health cen-

   ters, and the WIC program. The empirical analysis is based on a cross sec-

   tion of U.S. counties in 1977, and the incidence of low birth weight (2,500

   grams or less) is employed as an intermediate outcome. This allows us to

   examine the extent to which prenatal inputs operate directly on neonatal

   mortality and also allows us to examine their indirect effects on mortality

   rates through low birth weight. Since mothers with poor endowed birth out-

   comes will attempt to offset these unfavorable prospects by utilizing more

   health inputs, major emphasis is placed on two—stage least squares estimates

   of the production function. Our results underscore the qualitative and

   quantitative importance of abortion, prenatal care, neonatal intensive care,

   and the WIC program in black and white birth outcomes.

              BIRTH OUTCOME PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS IN THE U.S.


           Hope Corman, Theodore J. Joyce, and Michael Crossnian*


     Neonatal mortality rates declined sharply in the U.S. between 1964 and

1982——from 17.9 deaths of infants less than one month old per thousand live

births to 7.7 deaths per thousand live births.' During this period there

were significant changes in a number of the important health inputs related

to neonatal mortality. Federally subsidized programs such as family

planning clinics, community health centers (CHC5), maternal and infant care

(M and I) projects, the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women,

Infants and Children (WIC), and Medicaid were either expanded or imple-

mented for the first time. In addition, the use of prenatal care grew, and

there were numerous medical advances resulting in high technology neonatal

intensive care units. Finally, during this period, abortion was legalized.

     The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the utilization

of these important health inputs on race—specific neonatal mortality.

Specifically, we use a production function approach to examine the rela-

tionship between health outcomes and the use of these important health

inputs. Although a number of studies have treated subsets of these

inputs,2 none has entered them together in a multivariate birth outcome

equation estimated with data covering a large percentage of all births in

the U.S.

     Our empirical analysis is based on a cross section of U.S. counties in

1977, with the neonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants within the first

27 days of life per thousand live births) as the principal birth outcome,

and with the incidence of low birth weight (2,500 grams or less) as an
                                   —2—

intermediate outcome. This allows us to examine the extent to which prena-

tal inputs operate directly on mortality and also allows us to examine their

indirect effects on mortality rates through low birth weight.

     In models developed by Harris (1982) and Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982,

1983a, 1983b), mothers with poor endowed birth outcomes will attempt to

offset these unfavorable prospects by utilizing more health inputs. Thus,

the decision to use the health inputs may not only affect the outcome, but

the potential outcome may also may also affect utilization. We adopt two

strategies to account for this potential reverse causality. First, major

emphasis is placed on two—stage least squares estimates of the production

function with prenatal care, abortion, and neonatal intensive care as endo—

genous (choice) variables. Second, we control for the health endowment

directly, using the incidence of low birth weight as a proxy for the

endowment. If birth weight is, in fact, an appropriate endowment measure,

the production functions can be estimated using ordinary least squares. We

then test for the appropriateness of this proxy variable approach.


                         I. Analytical Framework


     Following Corman and Grossman (1985) and the theorectical literature

that they cite, we assume that the parents' utility function depends on

their consumption, the number of births, and the survival probability of

each birth (which does not vary among births in a given family). Both the

number of births and the survival probability are endogenous variables. In

particular, the survival probability production function depends upon such

endogenous inputs as the quantity and quality of medical care, nutrition,
                                   —3—

and the own time of the mother. In addition, the production function is

affected by the reproductive efficiency of the mother, including the unob-

served biologically endowed probability that her infant will survive the

first month of life, and other aspects of her efficiency in household pro-

duction.

    Maximization of the parents' utility function subject to production

and resource constraints generates a demand function for survival in which

the survival probability or its complement, the neonatal mortality rate, is

related to input prices (whose direct and indirect cost components are

negatively related to input availability), efficiency, income, and tastes.

The interaction between the survival demand and the production functions

determines demand functions for medical care and other endogenous inputs.

These demand functions depend on the same set of variables as the demand

function for survival.

     The preceding ideas are formalized in a structural equations model

that incorporates the relationship between neonatal mortality and its two

most proximate determinants——low birth weight and prematurity. In par-

ticular, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that low birth weight

(less than or equal to 2,500 grams or 5.5 pounds) is the most important

endogenous risk factor in neonatal survival outcomes (for example, Harris

1982; Lewit 1983; Institute of Medicine 1985).   There also is a con-

siderable amount of evidence that prematurity, reflected by gestational

ages of 36 weeks or less, is the most important and most proximate endoge—

nous risk factor in birth weight outcomes (for example, Taffel 1980;

Rosenzweig and Schultz 1981, 1982, 1983b; Harris 1982; Lewit 1983). The
                                          —4—

system of equations is designed to obtain estimates of the direct and

indirect (through low birth weight) effects of five basic health inputs on

neonatal mortality. These inputs are prenatal medical and nonmedical care

(including appropriate nutrition), perinatal and neonatal care, the use of

abortion services, the use of contraceptive services, and maternal

cigarette smoking.3 Although the equations in the model have meaningful

interpretations at the family level, the empirical analysis pertains to

county—level data for the year 1977. Differences between micro effects

and those at a more aggregate level are noted where relevant.

    The basic model consists of the following nine equations:


                 d =                                    (1)
                       f1(n,   m, a, c, b, e)

                 b =           a, c, s, g,     e)       (2)
                       f2(m,
                 g =           a, c, r,   e)            (3)
                       f3(m,
                 r =           c, x, e)                 (4)
                       f4(a,
                 n =                                    (5)
                       f5(p,   y, x, e)

                 m =
                       f6(p,   y, x, e)                 (6)

                 a =
                       f7(p,   y, x, e)                 (7)

                 c =
                       f8(p,   y, x, e)                 (8)

                 s =           y, x, e)                 (9)
                       f9(p,

Equations (1), (2), (3), and (4) are production functions, while equations

(5)—(9) are input demand functions.        In equation (1) the probability that

an infant dies within the first month of life or the neonatal mortality

rate at the county level (d) is shown as a vector of perinatal and neonatal

care inputs (n), a vector of prenatal medical and nonmedical inputs (in),
                                        —5—

the use of abortion services (a), the use of contraceptive services (c),

the probability that the infant is born light (b), and the infant's biolo-

gical endowment (e).4 In equation (2) the probability of a light (2,500

grams or less) birth or the fraction of light births in a county is a func-

tion of the inputs in equation (1) except neonatal care and also depends on

maternal cigarette smoking (s), the probability that the birth is premature

(g, which represents the probability that gestational age is less than 37

weeks), and the endowment. In equation (3) the probability of a premature

birth or the county—level fraction of such births is related to the inputs

in equation (2) except cigarette smoking and also an endogenous risk factor

in prematurity such as mother's age at birth (r)5 and the endowment. In

equation (4) the endogenous risk factor is expressed as a function of its

determinants, including an observed exogenous risk variable (x, a measure

of which is specified in Section II). In equations (5)—(9) the inputs

depend on a vector of price and availability measures (p), socioeconomic

characteristics that reflect command over resources and tastes (y), the

exogenous risk measure, and the biological endowment. Each of the nine

equations contains an unspecified disturbance term (iii, i1,..., 9) that is

uncorrelated with uj(j'1). In addition each uj is uncorrelated with the

set of right—hand side variables in the equation that contains it.

     The four production functions are structural equations because they

show relationships among endogenous variables. Substitution of the input

demand functions and equations (3) and (4) into (1) and (2) yields the

following reduced form equations


                 d =              y, x, e)        (10)
                         f10(p,
                 b   =
                         f11(p,   y, x, e) .      (11)
                                      —6—

     Corinan and Grossman (1985) estimated the reduced form neonatal

mortality rate equation (10) using the county data base described in

Section II. Here we focus on the estimation of the structural neonatal

mortality rate production function (1) and the quasi—structural mortality

production function obtained by substituting equations (2), (3), and (4)

into equation (1):


                 d =
                       f12(n,   m, a, c, s, x, e) .   (12)

This procedure enables us to calculate the direct and indirect (through low

birth weight) effects of the basic health inputs on neonatal mortality.

     If the infant's biological endowment (e) were an observed variable,

unbiased estimates of the production function could be obtained by ordinary

least squares. Since this is not the case, the endowment must be treated

as one component of the disturbance term in each equation. Hence, our

model generates a recursive system of equations whose disturbance terms may

be correlated. In particular, although the researcher has no information

about the endowment, the mother and her physician have at least some infor-

mation about it. This information is likely to lead mothers with poor

endowed birth Outcomes and their physicians to try to offset these unfa-

vorable prospects by choosing a different mix of inputs than other mothers

(Rosenzweig and Schultz 1981, 1982, 1983a, 1983b; Harris 1982).

     To be specific, mothers with poor endowments have incentives to seek

prenatal care earlier in their pregnancies than other women, and their phy-

sicians are likely to obtain larger amounts of neonatal care for them. In

addition, such women are more likely to smoke less, to abort their pregnan—
                                   —7


des, or to use contraceptive services. Under these circumstances, ordi-

nary least squares estimates of the parameters of the production function

are biased and inconsistent because the inputs are correlated with the

disturbance term, which reflects in part the endowment. In particular, the

effects of the inputs on favorable infant health outcomes are understated.6

     To circumvent the above problem, production functions are obtained by

two—stage least squares. In the first stage of this procedure, the input

demand functions and the reduced form birth weight equation are fitted

with explanatory variables that are uncorrelated with the endowment by

assumption. In the second stage the predicted values of the inputs and low

birth weight rather than the actual values are used as regressors.

     It should be noted that the biases that arise when equation (12) is

estimated by ordinary least squares are likely to be more severe than the

biases that arise when equation (1) is estimated in a similar manner. This

is because equation (1) includes birth weight, which may be a very useful

proxy for the infant's endowed probability of survival. Put differently,

it is possible that the endowment has no effect on neonatal mortality with

low birth weight held constant. We explore this proposition in empirical

tests, discussed in Sections II and III.

     Certain restrictions must be imposed to insure that each equation in

the system satisfies rank and order conditions for identification. The

most important restrictions are: (1) neonatal care has no impact on low

birth weight; (2) cigarette smoking affects neonatal mortality only through

its effect on low birth weight; (3) prematurity affects mortality only

through low birth weight; and (4) cigarette smoking has no effect on prema—
                                   —8—


turity. With regard to the first restriction, decisions to use neonatal

care services are made after birth, and low birth weight causes more use of

these services.7 For the other assumptions, there is considerable sup-

porting evidence.8

     It should be noted that certain prenatal inputs may have different

interpretations, depending on whether a micro data set or aggregate data set

is used. Differences arise at the county level because abortion availabi-

lity, for example, varies among counties and because the underlying fre-

quency distribution of health endowments (the distribution that would be

observed in the absence of abortion) also varies. Suppose that availabi-

lity varies but the underlying frequency distribution does not. Since less

healthy fetuses are more likely to be aborted, the actual health endowment

of infants born in counties with high abortion rates will exceed the health

endowment of infants born in counties with low abortion rates.9 Consequently,

an expansion in the abortion rate will lower the fraction of light births.

If the underlying frequency distribution of endowments varies among coun-

ties, abortion rates will be higher in counties with low underlying

endowments, all other things the same, and the correlation between the

abortion rate and the actual endowment is reduced and may even be negative.

This underscores the need to treat the abortion rate as an endogenous

variable.

     Some persons would question the inclusion of the use of abortion ser-

vices, prenatal care services, and contraceptive services in the basic

neonatal mortality rate production function given by equation (1). These

persons would argue that the inputs just mentioned operate on the observed
                                  —9—

neonatal mortality rate solely by lowering the fraction of light births,

which is entered in the equation. This is a plausible proposition in the

presence of complete measures of the quantity and quality of perinatal and

neonatal care. But if such measures are absent or incomplete, as they are

in our data, and are positively correlated with abortion, prenatal care,

and contraception, the latter inputs can have negative impacts on birth

weight—specific neonatal mortality. For instance, consider women who have

a relatively high propensity to identify and abort defective fetuses.

Subsequent prenancies of such women are likely to be better planned ("more

wanted") and to receive larger quantitites of unmeasured inputs that

improve birth outcomes.


                      II. Empirical Implementation


A. Data and Measurement of Birth Outcomes

     We have constructed the data base from a variety of sources which are

described in detail in Corman and Grossman (1985). Briefly, neonatal

deaths by race for the years 1976 through 1978 were taken from the National

Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Tape. Births by race for

those years were obtained from the NCHS Natality Tape. White and black

births by weight and month in which prenatal care began (one characteristic

at a time as opposed to conditional distributions) for the same three—year

period were also taken from the Natality Tape. Information on abortion

rates and on the use of organized family planning services was acquired

from the Alan Cuttmacher Institute (the technical assistance division of

Planned Parenthood). Hospital inpatient days in neonatal intensive care
                                     — 10 —




units   were derived from the American Hospital Association and from Ross

Laboratories. Socioeconomic characteristics of counties were taken from

the Area Resource File.

        The analysis focuses on the neonatal mortality rate as opposed to the

postneonatal rate. This is because many postneonatal deaths are due to

infectious diseases and accidents, causes which are insensitive to most

prenatal inputs. Separate regressions are fitted for white and black birth

outcomes, rather that a non—race specific equation which enters the percen-

tage of black births. By fitting race—specific equations, we circumvent a

possible source of multicollinearity, if race and input usage are corre-

lated. Moreover, in preliminary regressions we tested and rejected the

hypothesis that slope coefficients but not intercepts are the same for whi-

tes and blacks.

        Counties are the units of observation because they are the smallest

units for which aggregate data are available. Some counties are so small,

however, that people may receive medical care outside the county. Also,

small counties experience large fluctuations in birth rates simply due to

random movements. These problems are reduced by including only large coun-

ties. Our sample includes counties with at least 50,000 persons in 1970,

and for black regressions, at least 5,000 blacks. The 677 counties in the

white regressions and 357 counties in the black regressions account for

about 80 percent of the white and black populations in the U.S. in

1970.10 In addition to selecting large counties, we attenuate random ele-

ments by employing three—year averages of the race—specific neonatal mor-

tality rate and percentage of low—birth weight births, weighting

regressions by the square root of the race—specific total number of births.

B.   Measurement of Right—Hand Side Variables

     Whenever possible, county— and race—specific variables are employed in

the regressions. Race—specific variables are denoted by an asterisk.

Table 1 contains definitions of the variables, and Table 2 contains their

means and standard deviations. When possible, variables pertain to one or

more years in the 1975—1978 period. The neonatal intensive care input per-

tains to 1979 and the WIC input and the poverty variable pertain to 1980.

In these cases the assumption is made that the 1975—1978 measure is highly

correlated with the one actually used. Table 2 distinguishes between raw

and interaction variables, discussed below.

      The key inputs at issue in this paper are prenatal care, abortion,

organized family planning clinic services, maternal and infant care (N and

I) projects, community health centers (CHC5), WIC, and neonatal intensive

care. All of these measures are expected to have negative regression coef-

ficients in the neonatal mortality rate production function. Additional

risk factors such as smoking and women in high—risk age groups are expected

to have positive coefficients.

      The use of prenatal medical care services is given by a three—year

average of the percentage of live births for which prenatal care began in

the first trimester (first three months) of pregnancy. This measure is

more desirable than the number of prenatal care physician visits for two

reasons. First, the latter variable is mechanically related to the length

of the pregnancy. Also, the decision to initiate prenatal care is made by

     aAn asterisk (*) next to a variable means that it is race—specific.
All variables are county—specific unless otherwise indicated.

     bVariable is available for whites and nonwhites as opposed to whites
and blacks.

     cSince numerator of this variable is not race—specific, denominator
also is not race—specific.

     dVariable is available for nonblacks and blacks as opposed to whites

     em counties where prenatal care was unknown for over 50 percent of
births, we considered the value as missing. Prenatal care data were
missing for 83 counties in the white sample and 45 counties in the black
sample. For counties with known values, prenatal care was estimated on the
basis of the percentage of women employed, the percentage of women with at
least a high school education, and percentage of poor women. The coef-
ficients were then used to generate values for the unknown counties. Note
that the coefficients of production functions estimated by a two—step proce-
dure, one which did not repredict prenatal care for the unknown counties,
were almost identical to the coefficients presented in Section III.

aAn asterisk denotes a race—specific variable. The white data pertain to
677 counties, while the black data pertain to 357 counties. Means and
standard deviations are weighted by the race—specific total number of
births in the period 1976—1978.

bFamily Planning, BCHS Projects, and WIC variables are interacted with the
race—specific fraction of poor women (Poverty) in the county. The Neonatal
Intensive Care variable, which is state—specific, is interacted with the
race—specific and state—specific fraction of low—birth weight births.

cRaw variable is not race—specific. Interacted variable is race—specific
under the assumption of equal use rates by white and black poor women.

the mother, while the number of visits given that care has begun is deter-
mined more by medical protocol.

        The use of abortion services is reflected by a three—year average of

the state—specific resident abortion rate (abortions performed on state

residents per thousand women aged 15 to 44 in the state). Abortion rates

are centered on 1976 rather than 1977 because Grossman and Jacobowitz's

(1981) estimates suggest that abortions performed in the first half of a

given year affect the neonatality mortality rates in the second half of the

year.

        Organized family planning use is given by the percentage of teenagers

with family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level in 1975 who

used organized family planning clinics in 1975. The denominator pertains

to poor women because the relevant public program is aimed at the poor.

The numerator refers to teens for two reasons. First, race—specific usage

data were only available for this age group. Second, research indicates

that use of family planning services by teenagers may have larger impacts

on neonatal mortality than use of these services by older women.

        The use of the maternal and inf ant care program and the community

health center program is given by the sum of maternity patients in M and I

projects and female users aged 15 to 44 of community health centers in 1976

per thousand poor women aged 15 to 44 in 1975. Note that we, again, use

poor women in the denominator since we are referring to programs aimed at

the poor. This variable is termed BCHS (Bureau of Community Health Services)

project use because the Bureau of Community Health Services (renamed the

Bureau of Health Care Delivery and Assistance in 1982) is the agency within
                                   — 16 —



the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that has overall admi-
nistrative responsibility for both H and I projects and CHCs.

     There is a possibility that BCHS project use may be a causal deter-

minant of the use of prenatal care services by low—income women. Thus, the

inclusion of both variables in the same regression may mask the effect of

the latter variable on infant health outcomes. This is not a serious

problem because only 20 percent of the counties in the white regressions

and 30 percent of the counties in the black regressions had at least one

BCHS project in 1976. More importantly, there is a strong rationale for

including both variables in the production function because prenatal care

services delivered to low—income women as reflected by BCHS project use may

have a different impact on birth outcomes than prenatal care services deli-

vered to other women. In addition, BCHS project users may receive more and

better obstetrical and newborn care than other poor women.

     The nutritional adequacy of diets of pregnant low—income women is

measured by the number of state—specific eligible pregnant women served by

the WIC program in 1980 per thousand state—specific eligible women also in

1980. The use of neonatal intensive care services is measured by the sum

of the state—specific number of hospital inpatient days in Level II and

Level III neonatal intensive care units in 1979 divided by a state—specific

three—year average of the number of low—birth weight births centered on

1977.12 The denominator pertains to light neonates because they are the

primary users of the input at issue. We use a state—specific variable

because many states have developed either informal or formal regional

referral networks for ill neonates, suggesting that the market area for
                                      — 17 —




this    care is larger than the county.

       Our smoking variable, the state—specific daily number of cigarettes

smoked per adult 18 years and older in 1916, was taken from Lewit (1982)

who estimated it from his micro—level study of the demand for cigarettes

with Coate (Lewit and Coate 1982). Specifically, Lewit and Coate used the

1976 Health Interview Survey to estimate micro demand functions for

cigarettes based on income, price, educaton, age, sex and race. Their pro-

cedure capitalizes on cross—sectional differences in the price of cigaret-

tes primarily due to differences in state excise tax rates. Lewit applied

the coefficients of the fitted demand functions to state means of the inde-

pendent variables to arrive at the figures used here. The advantage of

Lewit's variable over the readily—available tax—paid sales per state is

that his measure adjusts for the substantial "bootlegging" of cigarettes at

both the individual and the group level. Because of this smuggling, data

from tax—paid sales underestimate consumption in high—tax states and

overestimate it in low—tax states.

       Our final variable represents the exogenous risk factor, x, in equation

(12). For this variable, we use the number of women who are either teens

or in their forties as a fraction of all women of childbearing age. These

are the age groups considered most at risk for negative birth outcomes.


C. Estimation

       Neonatal intensive care units are aimed at low—birth weight births, and

community health centers, organized family planning clinics and the WIC

program are aimed at the poor.     It follows that the impact of the use of

neonatal intensive care on neonatal mortality is larger, the larger is the
                                    — 18 —




fraction   of low—birth weight births. Also, the use of inputs provided by

public programs is larger the larger is the fraction of poor women.'3 To

account for these effects, we interact the neonatal intensive care measure

with the race—specific fraction of low—birth weight births. Tinder the

assumption of equal use rates by white and black light neonates, the

resulting variable can be interpreted as the race—specific number of inpa-

tient days in neonatal intensive care units per birth. Similarly, the WIC

and BCHS program measures are interacted with the race—specific fraction of

women aged 15 to 44 with family income less than 200 percent of the poverty

level, and the teenage family planning measure is interacted with the race—

specific fraction of women 15 to 19 with family income less than 200 per-

cent of the poverty level. The interacted teenage family planning measure

gives the race—specific number of teenage users as a percentage of all

race—specific teenagers. Under the assumption of equal use rates by poor

white and black women, the other interacted poverty variables can be

interpreted as the race—specific number of users of a given program per

thousand race—specific women aged 15 to 44•14

    The neonatal mortality equations (1) and (12) are fitted using a two—

stage least squares procedure for the reasons discussed in Section I.

Specifically, the unobserved health endowment, which is captured in the

error terms of the production function, is believed to be correlated with

the use of the health inputs. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982) refer to this

problem as population "heterogeneity.' Such "heterogeneity" causes ordi-

nary least squares (OLS) estimates to be biased and inconsistent. If

income and availability measures are uncorrelated with the health
                                   — 19 —




endowment, however, these variables carl serve as instruments in a two—stage

least squares (TSLS) estimation procedure.

    We test for the significance of the correlation between the production

function residuals and the health inputs, using Wu's T2 statistic (Wu 1973)

as described by Nakamura and Nakamura (1981). If the null hypothesis of

zero correlation between the error term and the regressors is not rejected,

then OLS is an appropriate technique. For this reason, we perform OLS as

well as the two—stage least squares techniques, on equations (1) and (12).

A comparison of Wu statistics for equations (1) and (12) allows us to exa-

mine whether birth weight is a reasonable proxy for the health endowment.

It should be noted that in both OLS and TSLS estimates of the production

functions, we use a linear function form'5 and use weights appropriate for

aggregate data.

    En the first stage of our two—stage estimation procedure, birth weight,

prenatal care, abortion, and neonatal intensive care use are predicted on

the basis of female schooling, female poverty levels, the percentage of

high—risk women, neonatal Intensive care availability, abortion availabi-

lity, organized family planning availability, BCHS project availability,

and the Medicaid program. These right—hand variables are similar to those

used in Corman and Grossman's (1985) reduced form estimates. Predicted

values of these four endogenous variables are then entered into the neona-

tal mortality equations.

    Ideally, in our two—stage procedure, we would treat all right—hand

variables in equations (1) and all variables except the percentage of high—

risk women in equation (12) as endogenous. Doing so, however, would create
                                   — 20 —




severe problems of multicollinearity and would tax the data to an inor-

dinate degree. The public program input measures are all treated as exoge-

nous in the estimation procedure. This procedure can be justified because

these programs are used by poor women as opposed to all women, and the

programs are relatively new. Joyce's (1985) empirical estimates of input

demand functions suggest that differences in their use among counties are

governed to a large extent by differences in their availability.

Technically, our procedure is analogous to viewing the capital input in a

firm's production function as fixed in the short run but varying among

firms for historical reasons.'6 We do not estimate values for the smoking

variable in a first stage because the smoking variable was already esti-

mated on the basis of income, price, education, age, sex and race, as

described above. Our procedure is based on the reasonable assumption that

prenatal and neonatal input availability measures have zero coefficients in

the cigarette demand function.'7


                              III. Results


    Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two—stage least squares (TSLS) estima-

tes of the black and white neonatal mortality production functions are pre-

sented in Table 3. The first set of regressions for each race (Al, A2, Bi,

and B2) excludes the endogenous risk factor of low birth weight. As dis-

cussed in Section I, the substitution of low birth weight by its structural

determinants yields what we have termed the quasi—structural production

function. The remaining regressions show the direct effect of an input on

neonatal mortality by holding constant the percentage of low—birth weight
births.

    The TSLS regression coefficients of prenatal care, abortion, and

neonatal intensive care are substantially larger in absolute value than

their corresponding OLS coefficients in the quasi—structural regressions

(Al, A2, Bi, and B2). The fact that this difference is greater for blacks

is a noteworthy result for as Rosenzweig and Schultz (1983a) have noted,

OLS and other direct correlational estimates of prenatal care's effect on

early infant deaths may be seriously underestimating its true impact on

infant health. For instance, the prenatal care coefficients estimated by

OLS in regressions (Al) and (BI) suggest that prompt initiation of prenatal

care is more effective in lowering neonatal mortality among whites than it

is for blacks. The TSLS estimates reveal just the opposite [regressions

(A2) and (B2)J. This implies that remedial behavior among black pregnant

women may be an important response to information regarding the health of

the fetus.

    Based on the Wu test, the null hypothesis of zero correlation between

the health inputs and the disturbance term can only be accepted when the

percentage of low—birth weight births is held constant [regressions (A3),

(A4), (B3), and (B4)]. This suggests that the unobserved health endowment

is effectively controlled for by this endogenous risk factor. Further evi-

dence to this effect is that the difference between the TSLS and OLS coef-

ficients is reduced appreciably, and even eliminated, in the structural as

opposed to the quasi—structural regressions. Consequently, the TSLS coef-

ficients should be used to measure the total effect of an input on neonatal
                                    — 23 —




mortality,   whereas the OLS estimates are appropriate when gauging an

input's direct effect.

     A comparison of the OLS coefficients of neonatal intensive care use

estimated with and without birth weight held constant [regressions (Al),

(A3), (Bi), and (B3)] is instructive because neonatal intensive care is the

one input that conceptually has no causal impact on low birth weight. The

comparison reveals that the white and black coefficients rise in absolute

value by a factor of 2.3 and 1.2, respectively, when birth weight is held

constant. These results are consistent with the interaction model deve-

loped in Section II (see footnote 13). The failure to control for low

birth weight biases the OLS estimate of the neonatal intensive care para-

meter since light infants are more likely to be place in a neonatal inten-

sive care unit and also are more likely to die.

     Note, however, that the replacement of low birth weight with its endo—

genous determinants and the use of instrumental variables to correct for

the correlation between neonatal intensive use and the disturbance term

should yield an estimated coefficient that is equivalent to the one

obtained by OLS in the specification including low birth weight. We tested

whether the difference between the neonatal intensive care coefficients in

these two specifications was significantly different from zero. For each

race, the null hypothesis of no difference was easily accepted. The t—

statistic was   .48 for whites and .22 for blacks.'8

    Based on the Wu test, further discussion of the results will focus on

regressions (A2), (B2), (A3), and (B3). All four equations are significant

at the 1 percent level, as indicated by F—values. For whites, in the 2SLS
                                    — 24 —



estimate   of the quasi—structural model (A2), all coefficients have their

predicted signs, and five of the eight are highly significant. For the com-

parable black estimates (B2) seven of the eight coefficients have predicted

signs, although not as many of the variables have strong significance

levels. In the white OLS equation holding birth weight constant (A3), all

coefficients have correct signs and have t—values greater than one in abso-

lute value. In the comparable black equation (B3), all coefficients have

correct signs, although fewer are significant compared to the white

equation. Altogether, the model works well in predicting variations in

neonatal mortality rates based on medical program usage.

    The effects of WIC, abortion, and prenatal care on race—specific neona-

tal mortality fall in absolute value when birth weight is held constant

[see regressions (A2), (A3), (B2), and (B3)]. For blacks, the abortion

coefficient falls 65 percent. Nevertheless, its risk—specific effect is

still greater than the corresponding white one, although its significance

level is only 10 percent.19 WIC and prenatal care reduce neonatal mortality

solely by reducing the percentage of low—birth weight births. Put dif-

ferently, the estimated effects are zero once the risk factors are held

constant. For whites, the WIC coefficient falls by 67 percent, the abor-

tion coefficient falls by 24 percent, and the prenatal care coefficient

falls by 70 percent when the risk factor is included in the set of

regressions. In spite of these reductions, the prenatal care and abortion

coefficients retain their significance at the 1 percent level.

   The above results imply that expansions in prenatal care use lowers

risk—specific death rates for whites but not for blacks. These findings
                                    — 25 —




suggest that the quality of prenatal care is positively related to the
quality and quantity of perinatal and newborn care received by white

mothers. The absence of this relationship for black women is plausible

since the early initiation of prenatal care by these women is a recent

phenomenon. For instance, in 1969, 72 percent of white women and 43

percent of black women started their prenatal care in the first trimester

of pregnancy (Taffel 1978). The corresponding figures in 1977 were 77

percent of white women and 59 percent of black women (see Table 2).

    In the case of abortion, the above results suggest that the process of

fetal selection encouraged by abortion may be improving the survivability

of risk—specific births as well as reducing the incidence of low birth

weight. The former effect may be the result of births being better planned

or "more wanted." As mentioned in Section I, bi rths which are not averted

may receive more of the unmeasurable inputs such as better nutrition and

higher quality care that enhance the healthiness and survivability of

newborns of a given birth weight.

    The sizable risk—specific BCHS project use and family planning use

coefficients reflect positive relationships between these inputs and the

percentage of low—birth weight births. The BCHS result suggests that poor

women who obtain prenatal care from N and I projects or community health

centers probably do not start to receive care until fairly late in their

pregnancies. Moreover, these women may have poor endowed birth outcomes.

Consequently, the receipt of care from BCHS projects does not lower the

incidence of low birth weight, but it appears to raise the quantity and

quality of perinatal and newborn care.

    The sane argument may apply for organized teenage family planning use.

Chamie et al. (1982) report that counties that serve a high proportion of

women at risk of pregnancy are more likely to provide gynecological and

prenatal care than counties that serve a smaller proportion of such women.

Jones, Namerow, and Philiber (1982) find that more than half of the first—

time clients of large metropolitan family planning clinic previously had

been pregnant. In short, a rise in the proportion of low—income women who

use organized family planning services may be indicative of a population

that has been integrated into a network of prenatal and perinatal care.

The births to these women may still be problematic (that is, premature or

light), but with better support and care their infants are more likely to

survive.

    One way to gauge the magnitudes of the estimated relationships between

infant health inputs and outcomes is to apply the relevant coefficients to

national trends in the inputs between 1964 and 1977.20 This exercise

allows us to shed light on the sources of the rapid decline in the U.S.

neonatal mortality rate starting in 1964 by computing the contribution of

each input to the downward trend in neonatal mortality. The extrapolations

end in 1977 because the regressions pertain to that year. In the period at

issue the white neonatal mortality rate declined by 7.5 deaths per thousand

live births, from 16.2 to 8.7, or by 46 percent. The black neonatal mor-

tality rate declined by 11.5 deaths per thousand live births, from 27.6 to

16.1, or by 42 percent.

    The results of estimating the implied changes in white and black neona-

tal mortality rates due to trends in the inputs are shown in Panels A and B

of   Table 4, respectively. The direct effect is obtained from the OLS

neonatal mortality rate production function that includes birth weight as a

regressor. The total effect is obtained from the TSLS estimate of the

quasi—structural production function. Subtraction of the former from the

latter yields the indirect effect. Thus, the indirect effect shows the

reduction in the neonatal mortality rate due to an increase in one of the

health inputs between 1964 and 1977 that operates via a reduction in the

percentage of low—birth weight births.2'

     For whites, the statistical analysis "explains' 25 percent of the

decline in neonatal mortality. The increase in abortion makes the largest

contribution to the decline (.8 births per thousand live births) followed

by prenatal care and WIC (.4 deaths per thousand live births each) and

neonatal intensive care (.1 deaths per thousand live births). Prenatal

care and WIC each has a substantial indirect effect which accounts for

approximately two—thirds of the total effect of the input in question.

      For blacks, the statistical analysis explains 56 percent of the

decline in neonatal mortality. As in the case of whites, abortion makes

the largest contribution (2.1 deaths per thousand live births) followed by

prenatal care (1.9 deaths per thousand live births), WIC (1.3 deaths per

thousand live births), and neonatal intensive care and organized family

planning (.5 deaths per thousand live births each). Prenatal care, WIC,

and abortion have sizable indirect effects, and in each case the indirect

effect is larger than the direct one.

     Some caution should be exercised in interpreting the results in Table 4

because an increase in abortion use, for example, due to an increase in
                                     — 29 —




abortion   availability is likely to cause organized family planning use to

fall. Put differently, these computations do not provide the reduced form

effects that are required to evaluate fully the contributions to reductions

in neonatal mortality between 1964 and 1977 of the increased availability

of the inputs considered here. Nevertheless, they do provide insight with

regard to the role of the expansion in the use of one input with all other

inputs held constant. Caution also should be exercised because the results

pertain to the actual benefits in terms of neonatal mortality of increases

in the inputs in the period considered rather than to the potential bene-

fits of future expansions. Note, however, that a ranking of the magnitude

of the effect of each input based on a 10 percent increase in its 1977

value is very similar to the ranking presented in Table 4.

    A final caveat is that, although our production functions include a

neasure of the quantity of neonatal intensive care, they exclude a measure

of its quality. Even if the state—of—the—art in neonatology is fixed in

the cross section, clearly it is not fixed over time. In light of the

rapid advances in perinatal and neonatal science since 1964, we undoubtedly

understate the growth in a comprehensive measure of the neonatal intensive
              22
care input.

    It is notable that practically all the black regression coefficients in

Table 3 and all the estimated black effects in Table 4 exceed the

corresponding white coefficients or white effects. This is a key finding

because it suggests that the inputs at issue have the potential to reduce

the excess mortality rate of black babies, an important goal of public

health policy in the U.S. for a number of years. It also is notable that
                                   — 30 —




the combined contribution of abortion, prenatal care, and neonatal inten-
sive care to the reduction in black neonatal mortality (4.5 deaths per

thousand live births) exceeds the combined contribution of WIC, BCHS pro-

ject use, and organized family planning use (1.8 deaths per thousand live

births). This is an important result because the first three inputs are

used by all segments of the population, while the last three are used by

the poor.   It implies that blacks may benefit more from developments that

affect neonatal mortality rates in all segments of the population than from

programs that are targeted at the poor.

    At the same time, the results do not imply that the construction and

subsidization of additional neonatal intensive care units has a more

favorable benefit—cost ratio than an expansion in BCHS project use for

blacks, if, for example, these were competing programs. The direct effect

of BCHS project use on black neonatal mortality (.2 deaths per thousand

live births) is smaller than the direct effect of neonatal intesive care

(.5 deaths per thousand live births). But the projects probably are

cheaper to construct and maintain than sophisticated neonatal intensive

care units. This suggests that BCHS projects may be attractive vehicles to

lower birth weight—specific black mortality rates. Their benefit—cost

ratio would be even more favorable if techniques could be developed to

enable them to reduce the percentage of low—birth weight births.23


                               IV. Discussion


    Our results underscore the qualitative and quantitative importance of

abortion and prenatal care services in black and white birth outcomes. We
                                     — 31 —




find   that black neonatal mortality rates are more sensitive to use of these

basic health inputs than are white neonatal mortality rates. We also pre-

sent evidence with respect to the potential importance of neonatal inten-

sive care in the determination of neonatal mortality rates, particularly

for blacks. Neonatal intensive care ranks fourth in importance behind pre-

natal care, abortion and WIG in explaining declines in both white and black

neonatal mortality between 1964 and 1977. Given the absense of cross—

sectional or time—series indexes of the quality of care, the impact of

neonatal intensive care undoubtedly is understated. Clearly the develop-

ment of more comprehensive measures of this input deserves high priority on

an agenda for future research.

    Between 1964 and 1982 the white neonatal mortality rate fell by 4.9

percent per year (annually compounded), and the black neonatal mortality

rate fell by 4.2 percent per year. Recent rates of decline have fallen

short of these approximately two—decade historical trend values, especially

for blacks. For instance, from 1981 to 1982, the black neonatal mortality

rate fell by 2.2 percent, and the white rate fell 4.2 percent.24

    Since the beginning of 1981, budget cutbacks by the Reagan Administ-

ration have curtailed the rates of growth of such poverty—related programs

as WIG, H and I projects, community health centers, subsidized family

planning clinics, and Medicaid. When inflation is taken into account, the

absolute sizes of some of these programs declined in real terms. These

developments have caused some persons to attribute the deceleration in the

rate of decline in neonatal mortality to the Reagan Administration's poli-

cies (for example, Miller 1985).
                                   — 32 —




    Our results provide suggestive, although far from definitive, explana-

tions of the slowdown in the downward trend in neonatal mortality. The

abortion rate of white women reached a peak in 1980 and was stable between

1980 and 1981. The abortion rate of black and other nonwhite women peaked

in 1977 and declined every year since then with the exception of 1980

(Bureau of the Census 1984). The percentage of white women who began pre-

natal care in their first trimester of pregnancy fell between 1980 and

1981, and the percentage of black women who began prenatal care in their

first trimester fell between 1981 and 1982 (National Center for Health

Statistics various years). The introduction and diffusion of new tech-

niques in neonatology slowed appreciably in the late 1970s and early 1980s

(McCormick 1985).

    The role of public policy in the above developments is not clearcut. In

part the recent trend in abortion may reflect the end of the diffusion of a

relatively new contraceptive technique. In part it also may reflect the

Hyde Amendment which has banned Federal funding of abortions under Medicaid

except in cases when the woman's life was in danger since September 1977

(except for the months of February through August 1980). Medicaid cutbacks

may have made it more difficult for pregnant low—income women to initiate

prenatal care in the first trimester, although the recession of 1981—1982

also may have played a role. Our results identify the use of the WIC

program as a much more important determinant of black neonatal mortality

than the use of CHCs, M and I projects, or organized family planning ser-

vices. Declines or modest increases in the percentage of poor black

pregnant women serviced by WIC may have retarded the rate of decline in
                                       — 33 —



black   neonatal mortality, but definitive recent trends in this statistic

are not available. In summary more research is required to provide a

fuller explanation of the behavior of the U.S neonatal mortality rate since

1980. Our    study   represents a useful first step in this process.

liminary estimates published in a variety of places.

     2For example, see Williams 1974, 1979; Grossman and Jacobowitz 1981;

Goldman and Grossman 1982; Hadley 1982; Harris 1982; Paneth et al. 1982;

Rosenzweig and Schultz 1981, 1982, 1983a, 1983b; Lewit 1983, Kotelchuck et

al. 1984. No study entered all variables together in a multivariate birth

outcome equation estimated with data covering a large percentage of all

births in the U.S.

     3The amount of time worked by the mother during pregnancy and her use

of alcohol are excluded from the theoretical model because of lack of data.

Rosenzweig and Schultz (1981, 1982, 1983b) exclude the number of months the

mother worked while pregnant from their final estimates of infant health

production functions because its coefficient was insignificant in prelimi-

nary regressions. In a recent report on low birth weight, the Institute of

Medicine (1985) concludes that the association between maternal alcohol use

and unfavorable birth outcomes is much less uniform than that between

maternal cigarette smoking and these outcomes. Heavy alcohol consumption

during pregnancy raises the risk of delivering a baby with fetal alcohol

syndrome. The empirical evidence is less clear, however, with respect to

the effects of moderate or light alcohol use.

     4Note that an increase in e is associated with a more favorable

endowment.

     5Other endogenous risk factors in the prematurity production function

include parity and legitimacy status of the birth. These factors are not

incorporated into the model because we do not estimate the prematurity pro-

duction function, as explained below. Clearly, we do not ignore the risk
                                       F —3


indicators just cited because they are caused to a large extent by abortion

and contraceptive services at the county level.

      61n the case of cigarette smoking, the detrimental impact of this

input is understated in absolute value.

      7Given the advanced state of perinatal science, infants requiring

neonatal intensive care services may be identified prior to birth. Even in

this situation low birth weight still causes neonatal intensive care, and

causality from use to birth weight can be ruled out.

      8The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1980) summarizes

numerous studies supporting restriction (2). Restriction (3) is consistent

with research of the Institute of Medicine (1985) and Harris (1982).

Restriction (4) is supported by Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983b). In

part prematurity is excluded from equation (1) because gestational age is

difficult to measure and was not reported on the birth certificates of a

number of states during the period of our empirical analysis. If equation

(1) is viewed as the one that is obtained by replacing g and r by their

determinants, then cigarette smoking must be excluded from the prematurity

equation. This is necessary for the quasi—structural mortality and birth

weight production functions to satisfy the rank condition. These equations

are

      d =   d(n,   m, a, c, b, x, e)

      b = b(m, a, c, s, x, e)

If s enters the equation for d, the rank condition is satisfied for the

birth weight production function but is violated for the mortality produc-

tion funtion. Empirical estimates of the above mortality function (not
                                   F —4


shown) do not differ from the ones presented in Section III, which exclude

x. Joyce (1985) estimates equations (1)—(3) and explores the role of pre-

maturity in infant health outcomes using a subset of the Counties employed

in this paper.

     91n general the use of abortion services is related to such risk

characteristics as mother's age, parity, and marital status, which in turn

are related to the endowment.

    '0One county with a population of at least 50,000 persons in 1970 was

eliminated from the sample because it was the only such county charac-

terized as an isolated rural county with no incorporated place with a popu-

lation of at least 2,500 persons in 1970.   In addition, the District of

Columbia was excluded because of difficulty of defining its relevant market

area. In particular, many nonresidents use its sophisticated neonatal

intensive care hospitals, and these facilities are not likely to be widely

available to its relatively large black population. A second reason for

excluding the District of Columbia Is that Stanley K. Henshaw, who estima-

tes resident abortion rates for the Alan Guttmacher Institute, informed us

that figures for the District of Columbia are very unreliable.

    ''Neonatal death rates associated with births to teenage mothers are

substantially higher than births to women beyond the age of 20 (for

example, Joyce 1985). Moreover, Forrest (1980) finds that the use of orga-

nized family planning services by teenagers has a sizable negative effect

on teenage birth rates.

    '2Patient days in Level I units are excluded from the numerator because

these units do not provide specialized state—of—the—art services. No

distinction is drawn between Level II and Level III patient days due to

definitional problems in the available data.

                             and       u2 are disturbance terms. Because birth weight—specific
death rates are not availabie at the county level, substitute the last two

equations into the first one:

                                                                                        +   v.
where v. =
            j          jlj + (l—k.)u
                       k.u    .

                                                         .    . Hence,
                             (ad./an.) =

For      a similar argument with respect to poverty programs, see Grossman and

Jacobowitz (1981).

         '4The interacted family planning variable is obtained by dividing the

race—specific number of teenage family planning users by the race—specific

number of women aged 15 to 19. The raw family planning variable is

obtained by assumming the race—specific fraction of women aged 15 to 19
                                   F—6

with family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level equals the

race—specific fraction of women aged 15 to 44 with family income less than

200 percent of the poverty level. The raw family planning variable is

shown in Table 2 for illustrative purposes; it is not used to create the

interacted variable.

    15We choose a linear rather than a logistic functional form because

linear coefficients are more easily interpreted. Maddala (1983, p. 30)

argues that a linear form is appropriate for large, aggregate probability

samples such as ours.

    '6We do not employ public program use measures to predict prenatal care,

abortion, neonatal intensive care, and birth weight in the first stage.

Instead, public program availability measures are employed, except in the

case of WIC where there is no availability measure. Production functions

obtained with public program use measures as first stage predictors were

similar to those presented in Section III.

    '7Although cigarette consumption is labeled as an endogenous variable in

Section IV, it should be noted that the same variable is used in OLS and

two—stage estimation procedures.

    18To calculate the standard error of the difference between the two

coefficients, we made use of 1-lausman's (1978) result that the variance of

the difference between two estimates of the same coefficient is equal to

the sum of the variances. This holds if both estimates are consistent and

one of them is efficient under the null hypothesis of no difference.

    '9Statements concerning statistical significance in the text are based

on one—tailed tests except when the estimated effect has the "wrong sign."
                                         F—7

In this case two—tailed tests are used.

    20The sources for the initial year and terminal year values of the

inputs in the extrapolations and the assumptions that underlie these

values are available in the Appendix to this paper, which is available on

request.
    21
         Consider the following model:

                 d =    + a1x +   cz2k
                 k =    +

where k is the percentage of low—birth weight births and x is any input.

If Ax is the change in x between 1964 and 1977, then the direct effect is

ct1Ax, the indirect effect is $1ct2Ax, and the total effect is (ct1+1cz2)Ax.

Note that the indirect effect of neonatal intensive care is restricted to

be zero because conceptually it is not a cause of low birth weight.
    22
         In addition to the caveats mentioned in the text, it should be noted

that the contribution of abortion may be overstated because all states had

laws that outlawed abortion except when it was necessary to preserve a

pregnant woman's life in 1964. Many illegal abortions were performed in

that period. If illegal abortions affected neonatal mortality in the same

manner as legal abortions, we overstate the abortion effect in Table 4. It

is plausible, however, that differences in illegal abortion rates among

states and counties in 1964 had much weaker impacts on neonatal mortality

than differences in legal abortion rates in 1977. This is because it pro-

bably was more difficult for low—income women, who undoubtedly have poorer

endowed birth outcomes than other women, to obtain illegal abortions.

    23Similar comments apply to the direct effect of organized family
                                  F—S

planning, although here some caution is required because the main purpose

of organized family planning clinics is to deliver contraceptive services.

    24Neonatal mortality rates for years after 1982 are not used here

because they are preliminary.
