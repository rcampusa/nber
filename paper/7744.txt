1        Introduction


Economic regulation of the environment arguably began with the 1990 Clean Air Act

Amendments. Among their provisions, those establishing the tradeable permit program

for sulfur dioxide emissions have received the most attention by economists (Joskow,

Schmalensee, and Bailey, 1998). However, Section 812’s requirement that EPA evaluate

the benefits and costs of the Act’s implementation may, over time, be recognized as equally

important. This mandate is likely to foster a more direct role for economic analysis in both

the evaluation and the design of environmental policy. The results of this paper suggest

that it will be essential to incorporate general equilibrium effects into benefit measures of

large policy changes.


        To date, the literature has been unbalanced in its treatment of general equilibrium

effects. Hazilla and Kopp (1990) provide the first estimates of the importance of general

equilibrium effects for the costs of environmental regulations, but do not address benefits.1

The costs of complying with environmental regulations are estimated to be three to four

percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). EPA’s Retrospective Analysis (1997) of

the benefits of the air quality legislation from 1970 to 1990 reports a staggering 42 trillion

(1990) dollars in benefits as their mid-range estimate. This is about five and a half times

the current estimates for 1999 real GDP. However, the partial equilibrium analysis used by

    1
     Smith and Espinosa (1996) do consider the environmental benefits of air quality improvement using a
calibrated CGE model for countries in the European Union and its major trading partners. While their
approach allowed air pollution to have a non-separable effect on preferences, their calibration procedure
assumed that there was a private good serving as a perfect substitute for the roles assumed for air quality.
Our approach estimates the role of air pollution in household choice and relaxes the perfect substitution
assumption.




                                                     1
EPA to determine the benefits of large air quality changes realized over the twenty year

period can hardly be considered appropriate.2


       Our research adapts the Epple and Sieg (1999) locational equilibrium estimator to mea-

sure household preferences for air quality. This approach offers a behaviorally consistent

framework to estimate the effects of spatially delineated non-market goods for household

preferences. Our benefit estimates control for households’ adjustments to large policy

changes, treating them as they should be, namely as composites of air quality and prices

changes. We apply the locational equilibrium approach to study improvements in air qual-

ity between 1990 and 1995 in Southern California. We observe ozone reductions ranging

between 4 and 36 percent across the different locations in the five counties in our sample.

We find that general equilibrium estimates of Hicksian willingness to pay for these ozone

reductions are between 2 and 4 percent of annual household income. In contrast, the esti-

mates of annual benefits in the EPA’s Retrospective Analysis for a single year (1990) were

about $10,000 for each household - over 25 percent of average income.


       In addition to demonstrating the importance of general equilibrium effects, this re-

search extends past efforts to measure consumer preferences for environmental amenities in

two ways. First, most revealed preference approaches for measuring consumer values for

amenities rely on models that either assume preferences satisfy both weak complementarity

(Mäler, 1974) and the Willig (1978) condition or require a spatial distribution of ameni-

   2
    In addition, the peer reviewers for the EPA Retrospective Analysis recommend to re-evaluate the mea-
surement of individual’s willingness to pay for changes in the risk of premature mortality. The majority
of the benefits in the EPA analysis stem from changes in mortality risks for older adults. The committee
argues that the values estimated for statistical lives may be too large for this group. See Schmalensee and
Cropper (1997).



                                                    2
ties that offers a continuum of choices.3 The locational equilibrium framework does not

require either. In fact, the single crossing property (used to assure an equilibrium sorting

of households) can be seen as a relaxation of the Willig condition. Second, even in situa-

tions where a combination of theory and data allow estimation of marginal willingness to

pay functions from reduced form hedonic models, these functions are partial equilibrium

descriptions of behavior. They do not incorporate the adjustments that reflect general equi-

librium responses to large scale environmental changes. Moreover, there are complex self

selection and endogeneity issues that arise in these equilibrium matchings that are difficult

to incorporate in reduced form models.


    The remainder of the paper is organized into seven sections. In the next section we

describe the highlights of our findings. Section three contrasts our approach with the

past literature measuring the benefits of air quality improvements. Section four reviews the

locational equilibrium estimator and describes how it can be adapted to use data on housing

expenditures to improve the resolution in estimating household preferences. Section five

describes the unique data set on housing prices and characteristics, air quality, and public

education that are available for Southern California. Section six summarizes our estimation

results for the model. Section seven outlines the general equilibrium benefit measurement.

Finally, Section eight discusses conclusions and implications.

   3
     Hedonic methods rely on the assumption of a continuum of air quality alternatives. There has been no
systematic analysis of the implications of departures from this assumption. This issue is especially important
to environmental amenities, where it is likely that within the market area assumed for a hedonic there would
be a discrete number of alternative values for the available amenity services.

2    Overview of Results


Figures 1 and 2 summarize the features and implications of the general equilibrium benefit

estimates computed using our estimates of household preferences for housing, air quality,

and public education. Figure 1 plots our estimates of the general equilibrium willingness

to pay (WTP) for the improvement in ozone that occurred in Southern California between

1990 and 1995. Each point is an average, computed for the households estimated to be

members of the ninety-two school districts we use as the communities in the locational

equilibrium model. For each community, average WTP is plotted against the estimated

average income in that community. Figure 1 displays the diversity in gains from the air

quality improvements between 1990 and 1995. Average gains range from approximately

$200 to over $2000.


INCLUDE FIGURE 1


    The differences in WTP by income should not be taken as a gauge of the responsive-

ness of the Hurwicz and Uzawa (1971) income compensation function to income. Because

these differences are means for general equilibrium solutions, they are distinguished by five

characteristics. Households in each community are assumed to have different (unobserved)

tastes for public goods and different incomes. They also experience different changes in

ozone concentrations, housing prices, and public education. Our averages of general equi-

librium WTP for each school district reflect the effects of all of these differences on the

average attributed to each community.


    To understand how this happens, consider a stylized description of the general equilib-


                                             4
rium solution and WTP computation. We alter community attributes from the initial 1990

ozone conditions to the 1995 ozone readings for each of the 92 communities. At first, house-

holds are not in equilibrium; some of them have opportunities to increase their well-being

by moving. The same conditions assuring an initial equilibrium sorting allow us to compute

the new distribution of households among communities and resulting housing prices. This

process implies households that change their community will experience changes in three

variables affecting our measures of their general equilibrium WTP – the ozone concentra-

tion, the price they face for a homogeneous unit of housing, and their quality of public

education. For those households that do not change community, their WTP reflects only

the changes in ozone and the new general equilibrium housing prices for that community.


INCLUDE FIGURE 2


   Figure 2 depicts the extent of the ozone changes and the proportionate changes in prices

to sustain the new equilibrium sorting. We find that there is a strong positive correlation

between ozone changes and predicted price changes. Our model thus predicts that some

of the households that used to live in the high amenity communities will relocate to take

advantage of the relative larger air quality improvements and more attractive housing prices

(in relative terms) in the less affluent communities. The communities with the largest

improvements in air quality experience increases in housing prices of up to 7.8 percent. In

contrast, housing prices in communities with small improvements of air quality decrease in

equilibrium up to 6.5 percent.

3        The Previous Literature


Following early efforts to estimate the incremental willingness to pay for ozone reductions in

Los Angeles (Brookshire, Thayer, Schulze, and d’Arge, 1982), the majority of the revealed

preference estimates for the benefits from air quality changes rely on hedonic models and

use measures of particulate matter to characterize air quality conditions.4 Several method-

ological lessons emerge from this literature. This section summarizes a few of the insights

from the first round of hedonic research in this area and then outlines the findings and

potential limitations of the newest studies.


        Early work establishes that it is reasonable to expect that home-buyers take account

of air pollution as a site specific amenity and that the significant negative relationship be-

tween housing values and air pollution is not a statistical “artifact”. The conditions for

identifying the function describing the marginal rate of substitution between air quality

and a numeraire are acknowledged to be more complex than initially outlined by Rosen

(1974) because of: the nonlinearity in household’s budget constraints (and related joint

determination of the marginal prices for housing and site characteristics); the importance

of additional, correlated but unobservable, characteristics that determine households’ loca-

tional choices; and the supply responses of housing producers to households’ demands for

dwelling and site characteristics. Data limitations also have important effects on the results

from these early hedonic models. Nonetheless, Smith and Huang (1995) conclude that the

estimated marginal values for reductions in particulate matter do consistently respond to

    4
        For a review and a meta-analysis of these early studies see Smith and Huang (1995).




                                                       6
income, increases in air pollution (as measured by Total Suspended Particulates), and local

housing market conditions. They also find that use of estimates of these marginal values

without adjustment for how they are developed leads to dramatic differences in the benefits

attributed to air quality improvement.


   Recent studies extend the literature in a number of ways ways. Chattopadhyay (1999)

focuses on identification of the second stage marginal willingness to pay function (MWTP)

based on maintained preference restrictions. He uses a selected sample for Chicago acquired

through FHA mortgage applications and assumes a single, specific preference function to

identify the MWTP function using housing sales for this one area. Beron, Murdoch, and

Thayer (1999) is another study which attempts to implement the second stage of the he-

donic analysis. They achieve identification through variation in marginal price functions

for air quality improvements over time, assuming that the market is changing during the

period spanned by their sample of housing sales. However, the use of different hedonic price

functions alone may not be sufficient to identify the second stage. Palmquist (1991) notes

that the multiple markets must differ significantly to identify the marginal rate of substi-

tution equations. Beron et al. (1999) also face the problem that variation in important

socio-economic characteristics cannot be measured for years other than 1980 and 1990.


   Chay and Greenstone (1998) attempt to relax exogeneity assumptions in their analysis

and propose the use of the attainment status of each county as an instrument for air pollution

improvements. They argue that if this instrument can be considered an exogenous gauge of

air quality improvement then it avoids problems associated with departures from random

assignment of pollution readings across units of observations used in a hedonic regression.

                                              7
However, the attainment/non-attainment status of a county as an instrument to capture

regulation induced changes in particulate matter may not be as unambiguous as Chay and

Greenstone (1998) imply.5


       Overall these studies identify new methods and data for overcoming some of the limita-

tions of the early research attempting to measure the willingness to pay for improvements

in air quality. They also document a set of shortcomings with reduced form frameworks

for measuring consumer preferences. By design these reduced form approaches tend to be

exceptionally demanding in the data required to recover sufficient information to evaluate

consumer preferences for non-market amenities from observed price responses alone. As

such they motivate this effort to consider an alternative type of revealed preference method

based on a well-defined locational equilibrium model.


       Our approach differs from the previous literature by supplementing the available detailed

micro data on actual housing prices with aggregate information on housing markets and

income as well as for school and environmental quality. The locational equilibrium model

used in this paper imposes restrictions on the observable distributions of households given

the diversity in local public goods and housing prices. This permits us to estimate the

underlying structural parameters of the model and to construct welfare measures that take

into account the equilibrating adjustments of households to non-marginal changes in air

quality.

   5
    Crandall (1983) and Melnick (1983) describe a regulatory system over the first decade used in their
analysis, 1970-1980, that would not be a reliable indicator of air pollution. As a result both of the authors’
evaluations suggest that the monitoring networks for air quality and for point source compliance were
inadequately developed to allow attainment to be consistently linked to air quality. For the latter period,
1980-1990, the argument may be more plausible because the air quality monitoring and compliance networks
were established.

4     Locational Decisions and the Valuation of Environmental
      Amenities

4.1    A Locational Equilibrium Model


The starting point for our work is a model of residential decisions in a system of multiple

communities.6 The metropolitan area consists of a finite number of communities which in

our case are school districts. Each is assumed to have fixed boundaries. There is a continuum

of households living in the metropolitan area. Households differ with respect to income, y,

and their valuation of public goods. This unobserved heterogeneity is captured by a taste

parameters for public goods, α. A household is fully characterized by its preference-income

tuple (α, y). The continuum of households in the metropolitan area is implicitly described

by the joint distribution of (α, y), which is represented by the density, f (α, y).


    Each household has preferences defined over a composite of local public goods. We

assume the local public good has two components. The first component corresponds to

local public education which is provided by each community. The second is our exogenous

environmental amenity. It is not affected by local community decisions and is determined

by the mix of point and mobile sources of air pollution emissions that are outside the choice

process described by the model. Each community has a local housing good, hj , and a

composite private good, bj . Denote with pj the gross-of-tax price of a unit of housing services

      This approach follows a long tradition in urban economics and local public finance beginning with
Tiebout (1956). Our model is a natural extension of earlier work by Epple, Filimon, and Romer (1984)
and Epple and Romer (1991) which was first used in empirical work by Epple and Sieg (1999) and Epple,
Romer, and Sieg (2000). Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) provide an alternative approach for estimating
differentiated product models. For a recent application of that approach to study school choice in California
see Bayer (1999).

in community j. The preferences of a household are represented by a utility function,

U (α, hj , bj , gj ) that satisfies the standard properties. Households maximize utility with

respect to a budget constraint:


                                                 max U (α, hj , bj , gj )                               (4.1)
                                                 (hj ,bj )

                                                 s.t. pj hj = y − bj


Household preferences are represented in our structural model using the indirect utility

function given in (4.2). In principle, this can be derived by solving the optimization problem

given in (4.1).

                                                                                      η+1

The necessary conditions for an equilibrium sorting of households among communities can

easily be characterized when individual preferences satisfy the ”single crossing” property.

This condition requires that the slope of an ”indirect indifference curve” in the (g, p) plane


                                                                             Vg
                                        M (α, y, gj , pj ) = −                                          (4.3)
                                                                             Vp


be monotonic in y, given α (and α, given y).


      This restriction contrasts with the dual requirements of weak complementarity and the

Willig [1978] condition for some revealed preference approaches to non-market valuation.7

Weak complementarity requires that there exist a non-essential private good, linked to the

  7
      The notable exceptions would be hedonic models and discrete choice random utility models.



                                                             10
environmental amenity, so that the value of improvements in that amenity is zero if none

of the private good is consumed. For example, it assumes that improvements in water

quality at a lake are only of value to those who use the lake for recreation. In terms of

the indirect utility function, this condition implies Vg = 0 when the weak complement’s

price is at the choke price. This condition restricts the same slope used to define the

single crossing property to be independent of income. The Willig condition is required to

develop Hicksian welfare measures for changes in amenities from market demands (Bockstael

and McConnell, 1993). By characterizing households with indirect utility functions, the

locational equilibrium framework not only allows the necessary conditions for an equilibrium

to be used in recovering preference estimates, it also relaxes the requirements for consistent

revealed preference estimates.8


       The specification of the household decision process and our indirect utility function in

(4.2) implies that households consider public goods and housing prices at the extensive

margin as a choice among a finite set of alternative communities. Then conditional on this

decision, they select the optimal amount of housing which is independent of gj . For a given

location, the specification of preferences over gj parallels what would be found in definitions

for public goods giving rise to non-use value (Hanemann, 1988; Randall, 1991). In our case

the necessary conditions for an equilibrium sorting of households, heterogeneous in their

preferences for gj , is what allows us to identify this separable component. Similar strategies

may have promise in measuring this rather specialized conception of the non-use values for

other public goods.


      Our model is also somewhat similar to a hedonic property value framework in that it

is important to control for the heterogeneity in housing characteristics when measuring

the separate community specific housing prices, the p0j s. To do so, we draw a distinction

between housing characteristics and public goods conveyed by location. We retain the

hedonic model’s assumption of a continuum of choice in the structural characteristics and lot

size. Thus, within each community the “law of one price” is realized through a hedonic price

function controlling for differences in housing characteristics. Public goods are available in

a finite set of choice alternatives.9


      Preference and income heterogeneity implies different individuals will prefer the public

good provision and gross-of-tax housing price in different communities. If preferences satisfy

the single crossing properties, a locational equilibrium satisfies three properties: boundary

indifference, stratification, and ascending bundles (Epple and Platt, 1998). The boundary

indifference conditions (a set of (α, y) such that V (α, y, gj , pj ) = V (α, y, gj+1 , pj+1 )) define

household membership in each community. With preferences given by (4.2) the set of agents

in community Cj is defined as:

                          (                                                 !          )
                                                                y 1−ν − 1
                 Cj   =     (α, y)    Kj−1 ≤ ln(α) − ρ                          ≤ Kj              (4.5)
                                                                  1−ν

  9
    As a result it is possible, as Bockstael and McConnell (1999) suggested recently, to have changes in
environmental quality that might not lead to a behavioral response.

                                                                                             )             (4.6)



     The single crossing properties imply that, holding tastes constant, households will strat-

ify by income among the set of communities. Likewise holding income constant, those

households with greater taste for public goods will tend to live in the high public good

communities. The ascending bundles condition implies rankings of communities by housing

prices and public good levels will be the same.


     Integrating f (α, y) over the set Cj defined by equation (4.5) provides a measure of the

households in each community, denoted P (Cj ). Quantities for housing expenditures can be

derived in a similar fashion. More specifically, Roy’s identity implies that the logarithm of

housing expenditures is given by the following equation:


                        ln(pj hj ) = ln(B) + (η + 1) ln(pj ) + ν ln(y)                                     (4.7)


Furthermore it is easy to show that marginal distribution for ln(y) in community j is given

by

                            Z   ∞                                                          .
            fj (ln(y)) =             1{(y, α) ∈ Cj } f (ln(y), ln(α)) d ln(α)                    P (Cj )   (4.8)
                             −∞



where 1{(y, α) ∈ Cj } is an indicator function associated with community j. Equations (4.7)

and (4.8) completely describe the marginal distribution for ln(pj hj ) in each community. In

the estimation procedure, we match quantiles of housing expenditure distributions. The


                                                        13
r-th quantile of the logarithm of housing expenditures in community is given by ln(B) +

(η + 1) ln(pj ) + ν qln(y) (r) where qln(y) (r) is the r-th quantile of the log-income distribution

in community j.


   The estimation procedure outlined in the next section exploits only the necessary con-

ditions for residential choices in equilibrium to define identifying restrictions. However, we

need to compute the locational equilibrium of the model to compute welfare estimates for

non-marginal changes in the ozone concentrations. To close the model, we assume that

housing stock is owned by absentee landlords and that the housing supply is given:


                                          Hj   = lj pτj                                      (4.9)


where lj is a community specific constant, which reflects the differences in land endowments

and other fixed factors, and τ is the constant supply elasticity. In the CGE analysis, we

calibrate the housing supply function such that the predicted initial housing demand equals

the housing supply for our estimated model. To solve for the new equilibrium prices after

an (exogenous) change in the level of public good provision, we solve a system of nonlinear

equations given by the J local housing market clearing conditions. Given the hierarchical

structure of the model, we can start with an initial guess for the new housing price in the

first community. We then compute the housing prices for all other communities such that

the first J − 1 housing markets clear. We keep adjusting the housing price of the first

community until the last housing market also clears.




                                                14
4.2    Estimation


Estimation is implemented in two steps. In the first step, quantiles of the distributions of

housing expenditures are matched with their empirical counterparts along the lines sug-

gested by Epple and Sieg (1999) treating the community specific intercepts as fixed effects.

For every parameterization of the joint distribution of income and tastes for the population

of the metropolitan area and the indirect utility function of the households, the model de-

termines a joint distribution of income, housing expenditures, and taste parameters for each

community. The estimation strategy is based on the idea that the difference between the

empirical quantiles of the distributions of housing expenditures observed in the data and

the quantiles predicted by the model should be small, if the model is evaluated at the true

parameter vector. The boundary indifference equation implies that quantiles of the housing

expenditure distribution of community j depend on gj only through the community specific

intercepts Kj . We treat the Kj ’s as unknown parameters and constrain them to replicate

the characteristics observed for each community’s population. A subset of the parameters

of the model can then be estimated using a Minimum Distance Estimator. One of the

advantages of matching housing expenditure distributions instead of income distributions is

that we can additionally identify and estimate the parameters of the indirect utility function

which related to the housing demand of households.10


    Matching the predicted housing distributions with those derived from panel data of

housing transactions in each community simplifies identification and estimation of the pa-

  10
     In order to implement these estimators, we also need to estimate prices per unit of housing independently
of the structural model. We will discuss this point in detail in the next section of the paper.



                                                     15
rameters which govern the demand for housing. It also allows income to be treated as a

latent variable in the estimation procedure. This is particularly useful if one believes that

residential choices and housing demand are based on a more comprehensive measure of

income than current income.


   In the second step, the levels of public good provision implied by the first round estimates

are matched with those observed in the data, conditional on differences in housing prices

and other amenities. Solving equation (4.6), which characterizes the community specific

intercept, for the levels of public good provision yields the following equation:

                                                                           1/ρ

where Qi = e           1+η      . Note that all variables on the right hand side of equation (4.10) are

either observed or have been estimated in the previous step of the estimation procedure.

We then replace the (unobserved) level of public good provision, gj , with a linear index

x0j γ + ωj , where ωj reflects unobserved characteristics of each community, xj is the vector

of local public goods and amenities. γ is a parameter vector to be estimated. This yields a

well defined nonlinear regression model. We construct an instrumental variable estimator

for the remaining structural parameters of the model as outlined in detail in Epple and

Sieg (1999). The second step completes the estimation procedures and allows us to recover

almost all structural parameters of the underlying model.

4.3    General Equilibrium Welfare Measurement


The conventional partial equilibrium Hicksian willingness to pay, W T PP E , for a change in

air quality conditions is defined as:


                         V (α, y − W T PP E , ḡj , pj ) = V (α, y, gj , pj )                (4.11)


It is the reduction to income required to equalize utility realized with the local public goods

index adjusted to reflect the improved air quality, ḡj , with that of the original conditions, gj .

However, households will adjust their community locations in response to the changes in air

quality. The new equilibrium should involve new housing prices as well. Thus, the evaluation

of the policy change should reflect the general equilibrium market adjustment induced by the

improvement in non-market environmental amenities. This general equilibrium willingness

to pay, W T PGE , is given in (4.12)


                         V (α, y − W T PGE , ḡk , p̄k ) = V (α, y, gj , pj )                (4.12)


Notice that both g and p are assumed to change and that the definition allows for households

to adjust their location, e.g., the subscripts for (ḡk , p̄k ) need not match (gj , pj ). Thus, the

general equilibrium willingness to pay requires a solution for the new general equilibrium

distribution of households and associated price vector. With these new housing prices

and amenities households remaining in community j can be expected to experience new

conditions because the level of amenities and prices in j change from (gj , pj ) to (ḡj , p̄j ).

Households moving from j to a new community k would have their amenities and price



                                                 17
change from (gj , pj ) to (ḡk , p̄k ).


    One final aspect of the welfare measurement concerns the distinction between owners

and renters. Our definitions of W T PGE to this point assume all households are renters and

ignore the differences in rental payments, ∆Rj :


                                          ∆Rj   = (p̄j − pj ) Hj                     (4.13)


The difference offers an approximate gauge of the importance of the owner/renter distinc-

tion.


    In summary, the framework allows a measure of mean willingness to pay after taking

account of the re-location and price adjustment associated with a large exogenous change

in local public goods. Because these computations are developed by numerical simulation,

it is also possible to consider how this mean gain is distributed across communities and

income groups by computing the conditional expectations based on the initial conditions

for households in the region.



5       Data


Our analysis focuses on the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area which consists of the area west

of the San Gabriel Mountains and includes parts of five counties: Los Angeles, Orange,

Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura. We assume that the school district corresponds

to the community a household selects in making its locational decisions. To implement

the model household characteristics by school district, quality measures for local public

5.1     Housing Markets


A comprehensive data base on housing markets in the LA metropolitan area was assembled

based on housing transactions collected by Transamerica Intellitech. These data contain

housing characteristics and transaction prices for virtually all housing transactions in South-

ern California between 1988 and 1992. Table 1 reports means of the main variables in the

housing sample by counties for these years.

   One potential drawback associated with using California data relates to Proposition 13,

which in 1978 limited property taxes to one percent of assessed value and limited growth

in assessments. It has been argued in the literature that Proposition 13 created a lock-in


                                                     19
effect on homeowners. A household faces a tax on mobility because property taxes are based

on the market value at the time of the last sale. If the current market value exceeds the

assessed value, the revaluation creates additional mobility costs. O’Sullivan, Sexton, and

Sheffrin (1995)’s detailed quantitative analysis of these lock-in effects indicated that they

are small – “for the average household a 13 percent inflation rate will lengthen the average

time between moves by only approximately two months” (Pg. 138).


   Closely related to the lock-in effect are questions relating to turn-over in housing markets

and the representativeness of our measures for the distribution of housing expenditures. It is

important to gauge whether our sample is representative of the underlying housing stock of

each of the school districts. The pattern of housing expenditures across communities is quite

close between the US Census and our estimates, with a correlation of 0.99. However, prices

tend to be uniformly higher in the US Census. Across our 92 school districts, prices are 6 to

12 percent higher in the census (inter-quartile range). In addition, homes are much younger

in our data set. Fifteen percent of our houses are younger than 1 year, whereas in the

1990 census only three percent of homes were built in 1989-1990. The over-sampling of new

homes (relative to what would be desired for measures of the overall housing stock) is not

surprising, because newly built homes will automatically show up in housing transactions,

whereas older homes will only show up when they turn over. According to the 1990 US

Census, 70 to 80 percent of all households change houses within 10 years. Given the scope

of our housing data, we expect to capture most of these housing transactions in our sample.

Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the houses in the US Census have a housing tenure

which is greater than 10 years. By construction our sample only contains a fraction of these


                                             20
houses.


5.2   Housing Prices


An important aspect of the empirical analysis of a model of households’ locational and

housing choices involves constructing inter-community housing price indices that control for

the observed differences in the quantity and quality of housing consumed within and across

communities. We assume that it is possible to unbundle the local public goods and amenities

from the effects of structural and lot characteristics. This approach focuses attention on

adjusting for the heterogeneity in houses by using an assumed continuum of choices for

the structural characteristics of housing to develop a price index for a homogeneous unit

of housing in each community. The market value of a specific house located in a given

community can be converted into the imputed rent using the approach outlined in Poterba

(1992). We also observe a vector of housing specific characteristics denoted by zjn . Let ujn

denote the unobserved housing characteristics. We assume that the quality adjusted units

of housing is given by:


                                               0
                                    hjn = eδ       zjn + ujn
                                                                                        (5.1)


By definition, rent measured for a quality adjusted unit is the product of the adjusted

housing price and the number of quality adjusted housing units. Using our specification

for hjn in equation (5.1) in this definition and taking logarithms provides a well-defined

regression model, that we use to construct housing price indices for each community in the

sample.


                                             21
   We estimate a large number of different regression models of the type described above.

Sieg, Smith, Banzhaf, and Walsh (1999) discuss the specific details of these regressions. This

comparison of alternative approaches suggests that housing price estimates are robust across

different econometric specifications and index formulas. They do not depend significantly

on spatial and temporal aggregation schemes used in constructing the data set and the

community choice set. Summary statistics for housing price index estimates based on the

simple fixed effects regression are reported in Table 2. The estimates indicate that relative

prices differ by as much as six to one across communities, although the large majority of

the housing prices only differ by small amounts.


5.3   Air Quality


Data for observed concentrations of ozone and particulate matter less than 10 microns

diameter (PM10 ) were obtained from the California Air Resources Board monitoring records.

Southern California provides some of the most extensive air quality monitoring in the world.

In the five counties of interest no fewer than 45 monitors were measuring ozone each year

from 1987 to 1992 (after eliminating monitors active on less than 50 days), and, beginning

in 1987, no fewer than 19 were measuring PM10 .


   Two issues arise in using these data in our models of community and housing choice.

First, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between air quality monitors and school

districts. Thus, an interpolation problem must be addressed in associating school districts

with air quality levels based on spatially discrete measures. Fortunately, the large number

of monitors minimizes the compromises created by this interpolation. In Riverside County,

                                                   23
for example, half of all houses are within 4.3 miles of at least one monitor, and 90 percent

are within 8.3 miles. Air pollution is measured using a centered three-year average (about

the sales year) of pollution readings for the nearest monitor to each house. We investigate

the effects of distance weighed pollution measures and found no significant difference in

the conclusions derived with these measures compared to this temporal average of nearest

monitor’s readings. We assign a three year centered average to each house in the sample

that sold during the temporal window (1988 - 1992). The community measure is then

computed by averaging over the houses in the community.


   Three measures of air pollution – ozone concentration, ozone exceedances and particulate

matter are considered in evaluating the effects of air quality. Ozone is measured in parts

per million (ppm) as the average of the top 30 one hour daily maximum readings at a given

monitor during a year. We also consider the observed exceedances of the one hour federal

standard for ozone. Particulate matter was measured by the annual geometric mean (in

micro grams per cubic meter for particulate matter of 10 microns or less in size). Both

pollutants have been well documented to impact health status and have been found to

influence housing prices in hedonic studies (Smith and Huang [1995], Beron et al.[1999]).

In general the effects of particulate matter is through impacts on increased mortality rates

and effects on materials. These impacts have not been shown to have any threshold, so

annual mean for particulates is often used in epidemiological and economic analyzes of its

effects. Table 2 reports the annual geometric mean of PM10 levels in our study area. In the

case of ozone however, human health effects are more likely to be triggered at higher levels.

The focus on maximum concentrations provides the rationale for considering the average of


                                             24
the 30 highest ozone readings or the number of days violating the federal standard, which

is also expressed in terms of an order statistic.


5.4   School Districts and School Quality


Table 2 reports some descriptive statistics for the main variables characterizing 92 school

districts in the sample. We find that school districts differ significantly in their size. The

smallest districts only contain a few thousand households. The largest school district in the

sample is LA unified with more than 1.4 million households, more than 30 percent of the

total population in the LA metropolitan area.


   The current school finance system in California was mainly shaped by two events: the

1971 decision of the state supreme court in Serrano vs. Priest and the approval of Propo-

sition 13 in 1978 by voters in California. Before Serrano vs. Priest local school districts

had fiscal autonomy. After this ruling the state imposed limits on spending and taxation

of local districts and allocated aid in order to off-set inequalities in local spending. The

basic idea was to achieve convergence of expenditures per student by increasing the aid to

poorer districts and capping the amount of expenditure growth in the richer districts. In

addition, Proposition 13 limited the growth rates of expenditures over the last twenty years.

As a result of these events, today most school districts in California have lower per capita

expenditures per students than school districts elsewhere in the United States.


   Despite the general trend towards equalizing expenditures per student, differences in

expenditures per student arise for several reasons. First, the state equalization formula

does not completely equalize expenditures. School districts with large tax bases can generate

                                              25
higher expenditures even under the existing set of rules determining transfers. In addition,

school districts can obtain additional funds for special education programs. While these

funds are aimed at covering the additional costs for teaching disadvantaged students, there

is at least some evidence that these funds are also used to improve the overall quality

of education (Cullen and Figlio (1999)). Finally, special fees and voluntary contributions

have been important in supplementing local expenditures where school districts have been

especially constrained by the reform. Brunner and Sonstelie (1996), for example, report that

in 1992 nine of the twelve school districts that raised over $500 in voluntary contributions

per student experienced a decline in revenue limit funding. Table 2 reports some descriptive

statistics of the instructional expenditures per student in our sample. In our sample, the

mean educational expenditures are $4852. While the range of educational expenditures

is more than $2500, most observations are within a few hundred dollars of each other.

Instructional expenditures show even less variation. The sample mean is $2619 with an

estimated standard deviation of $320. Both measures do not reflect cash and non-cash

voluntary contributions to school districts.


   With small differences in educational expenditures, a better measure of school quality

would be based on outcomes rather than state formula spending. There exist substantial

differences in school quality among districts, measured by test scores. There are a num-

ber of comprehensive tests which have been designed and implemented by the California

Department of Education. The primary purpose of these state wide testing programs is to

monitor the performance of schools and provide some information to parents. We construct

measures of performance from standardized test scores for each school district using the


                                               26
1992-93 California Learning Assessment System Grade Level Performance Assessment test.

Each student taking this exam is assessed at one of six performance levels (with six the

highest level). In Table 2 we report average writing, reading and math scores of the school

districts in our sample. All three test scores significantly differ among school districts. Math

scores range from 1.46 to 3.33. Reading scores range from 2.29 to 3.77.



6      Estimation Results

6.1     Results from the Locational Equilibrium Estimator


The parameters of the locational equilibrium model are estimated using a two step proce-

dure. The first matches the distributions of housing expenditures of the 92 school districts

observed in our sample with those predicted by our equilibrium model. The second stage

matches the observed indices of public good provision with those predicted by our first stage

estimates. Table 3 reports the parameter estimates and the estimated standard errors of

the parameters which are identified in the first stage. The sample size is 222,865.

    Function value: 0.0028. Degrees of freedom: 270.



     In general all parameters have the expected signs and are estimated reasonably ac-

curately. Permanent income is treated as a latent variable with the same mean as the


                                                       27
distribution of current income which is equal to 10.52. Hence we can interpret the estimate

of σln(y) as an estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution of permanent income.

The estimate of σln(y) is 0.34 which is much lower than 0.75, the estimated standard de-

viation of current income from the census. This finding suggests that the distribution of

permanent income in the metropolitan area has a smaller variance than the distribution of

current income, i.e., current income contains a significant transitory component. The point

estimate for the correlation between income and tastes for local public goods is negative and

equal -0.31, which suggests a limited amount of stratification by income among communities

in the sample.


   We can also identify and estimate the income elasticity of demand for housing, ν. The

point estimate of ν is equal to 0.86 with an estimated standard error of 0.02. This estimate

is consistent with Polinsky (1977)’s early summary of the income elasticity estimates for

consistent micro models. These estimates range from .75 to .90 depending on the other

variables included in what he describes as the ”correctly specified metro equation”. The

estimated price elasticity of housing, η, is -0.16 with an estimated standard error of 0.06.

This is not as close to the early estimates reported by Polinsky. While this estimate is

about one-fifth the average he reports, it can be expected to be sensitive to the procedures

used to adjust prices (or quantities) to measure the demand for a homogeneous bundle of

housing services. The estimates Polinsky selected as best addressed this issue by using the

Bureau of Labor Statistics’ index of the annual cost of a standardized package of housing.

This index does not have the same resolution as our individualized hedonic price index.

Moreover, he reports estimates (by Carliner (1973) and others) on either side of his central


                                             28
measure with some as low as -.10.


   We therefore conclude that the estimated income elasticity of demand for housing cor-

responds to past estimates and incorporates recognition of the importance of distinguishing

the permanent and transitory components of income, as noted in this earlier literature. Our

price elasticity estimate is at the lower end of the range of estimates (in absolute magnitude).

However, these earlier studies have either used selected micro samples (i.e. the FHA data

bases), aggregate measures without the ability to adjust for the heterogeneity in housing,

or assumed site amenities should be bundled with the structural and lot characteristics. It

may well be that after adjustment for the distinctions in site and structural attributes were

made that the existing price elasticity estimates would be more closely aligned with our

findings.


INCLUDE FIGURE 3


   Figure 3 offers another way of evaluating our estimation strategy by plotting the empir-

ical and the predicted quantiles of the housing expenditure distribution. Our model fits the

data reasonably well. We match 92 distributions of housing expenditures in the first stage

with a model that has only 7 parameters. Given this tight specification of the model, the fit

of the model is remarkably good. The correlation between the estimated and the predicted

25th (50, 75) quantile is 0.90 (0.86, 0.82).


   In the second stage of the estimation procedure we can identify and estimate the re-

maining parameters of the indirect utility function and the underlying distribution of tastes

for public goods. We estimate the parameters in the second stage using a GMM estimator

which uses functions of the rank of the community as instruments. Table 4 reports the

findings of this analysis. All estimated models use the average math score in the commu-

nity to measure school quality. Three different measures of air quality are considered. The

first approach uses average of the 30 highest ozone levels observed in a given year. The

second uses the number of ozone hourly exceedances. Finally, the third model considers a

geometric mean of PM10 . Column I reports the baseline model which ignores air quality.

Columns II through IV report estimates obtained when we add one of the three measures

to our index of public good provision. Finally, column V uses a specification which included

multiple measures air quality.


   In general, the parameter of the air quality has the expected negative sign when one

measure of air quality is included as in columns II through IV. Higher air quality increases



                                                    30
the level of local public good. If we include multiple measures of air pollution, we continue

to estimate a negative sign for ozone, but the sign of PM10 reverses and is now positive. This

finding suggests that here too, as in the case of hedonic models (Palmquist, 1991) it is hard

to identify the separate effects of different air quality measures in our sample. Analyzing the

estimated standard errors, we find that the effect of ozone is estimated with much greater

precision than the effect of PM10 . The coefficient of ozone is typically significantly different

from zero at reasonable levels of confidence. As a result of these findings and the dramatic

improvements in ozone concentration in the area during the nineties we focus our policy

scenarios on the model in column II.



7     The Benefits for Ozone Changes – 1990 to 1995

7.1    Context for the Policy Analysis


Between 1990 and 1995, Southern California experienced significant air quality improve-

ments. As we noted at the outset (and plotted in Figure 2), the decline in ozone concentra-

tions ranged from 3 to 36 percent across the school districts in our sample. In Los Angeles

County the number of days exceeding the federal one hour ozone standard dropped by 27

percent from 120 to 88 days. Such large changes have been frequent topics of local news-

paper articles and home buying guides and are widely recognized by home buyers.11 These

changes were similar in magnitude to nationwide changes in ozone that were attributed to

  11
     For example, the LA Times’ Sunday section (September 27, 1998) included an article “Nothing to Sneeze
At” describing where to “buy” air free of smog.




                                                   31
the air quality regulations in EPA’s Retrospective Analysis.12 They estimated that ozone

concentrations in 1990 were about 90 percent of what they would have been without the

regulations. Thus, a comparison of our estimates of the general equilibrium willingness to

pay for improvements in Southern California (as one time increments) in comparison to

partial equilibrium measures for the same change offers a convenient basis for gauging how

large the errors in partial equilibrium welfare estimates can be.


       Our description of these results is divided into four subsections. First we discuss the

general equilibrium W T P estimates by county, highlighting differences in the gains across

communities as identified in Figure 1. In the next subsection we describe how relaxing

our assumption of an inelastic supply function affects our results and consider the change

in housing expenditures before and after the reduction in ozone concentration. The next

subsection develops the Bartik-Kanemoto upper and lower hedonic bounds and describes

how these estimated bounds compare to the general equilibrium estimates by county. In the

last subsection we comment on the role of the Willig condition for non-market valuation.


7.2      General Equilibrium Benefit Estimates


The first five columns of Table 5 summarize the key features of the general equilibrium

welfare estimates in 1990 dollars for the communities in each county. Column I reports the

average (across the school districts in each county) proportionate change in ozone. Column

II reports the partial equilibrium estimate, W T PP E , for the ozone change with prices held

  12
     The EPA Retrospective Analysis [1997] considered changes in all the criterion air pollutants that could
be attributed to federal air pollution regulations since 1970. The ratio of control to non-control in 1990 for
ozone measured by the one-hour peak concentration ranged from a low of .60 to a high (indicating increases)
of 1.20.

at their original value in each school district. Column III reports the general equilibrium

estimate, W T PGE , for the ozone change which incorporates adjustment of households in

response to the change in air quality. Column IV provides the proportionate change in

public good provision in equilibrium. Column V summarizes the corresponding average

     We find that average partial equilibrium estimates of the welfare gains range from $286

in Ventura County to $1724 in LA County. Orange, Riverside and San Bernadino county

have average gains of approximately $1200. In contrast, the general equilibrium estimates

range from $832 in Riverside county to $1773 in LA county. A comparison between Column

1 and Column 2 shows that the partial and general equilibrium estimates differ by as much

as $1008 dollars.


     Within each county there is also diversity in the WTP estimates by community (school

district). In LA, for example, the W T PGE estimates range from $994 to $3004 across school

districts. It is important to reiterate that this heterogeneity stems from three characteristics

                                                      33
of our general equilibrium analysis. First, the “commodity” used in defining the WTP is

a composite. It allows for an exogenous change in ozone, with households permitted to

move and alter the air quality they actually experience. The definition given in equation

(4.11) captures this effect in distribution between gj and ḡk . While our analysis assumes

that education is invariant in each community, household re-location can cause the final

education experienced by a household to be different after the re-location.


   Second, households are allowed to have different tastes for public goods. Thus, it is

possible–and our estimates confirm–that a few households would actually experience wel-

fare losses that would, with conventional methods, be treated as welfare gains. These losses

stem from general equilibrium adjustments. These households experience air quality im-

provements along with increases in housing prices. If their taste parameter for the public

goods is low the composite can yield a loss.


   Finally, households have different incomes. Thus the initial level of utility realized under

baseline conditions will be different. This outcome is central to the stratification across

communities. It also provides an important motivation for relaxing the Willig conditions

which would restrict gains due to improvements in non-market resources respond to income.


   The differences between partial and general equilibrium estimates also have a strong

impact on evaluating the distributional consequences of the improvements in air quality.

Comparing Column II and III, we find that the GE benefit estimates for Riverside and

San Bernadino counties are much lower than P E estimates, while the opposite is true for

Orange and Ventura county. Columns IV and V provide some explanations for the gap



                                               34
between partial and general equilibrium measures.


   As discussed above, the difference between W T PGE and W T PP E is driven by the failure

of partial equilibrium measure to account for price changes and household adjustments.

In the post improvement equilibrium, consumers face a new locus of community choices

((p, g) pairs). The level of public good provision, g, increases in all 92 school districts.

Prices decrease in districts with small improvements and increase in communities with larger

improvements. In general, the new equilibrium is characterized by a reduction in the price

of achieving a given level of g. The differences between general and partial equilibrium

welfare measures mainly arise from the failure to account for the varying price changes

associated with public goods changes. In counties with small changes in g (Orange and

Ventura) prices drop in the new equilibrium. The partial equilibrium (p, g) pairs in these

counties provide a much lower level of utility, at all levels of y and α than do those that

are available under the GE prices. Hence, the general equilibrium welfare measures exceed

the partial equilibrium measures. Exactly the opposite is the case in the counties that

experienced the largest improvements in air quality (Orange and San Bernardino).


   To further understand the effects of adjustment, it is useful to consider stylized descrip-

tions of behavior at the disaggregate level. Because the largest air quality improvements

occurred in the lower ranked communities, households adjust their locational choices by

migrating toward these communities. This consumer response to the increased supply of

higher quality air leads to decreased prices in the higher ranked communities and increased

prices in the lower ranked communities. Ignoring ownership effects, households in high

amenity communities will not only gain due to any further improvement of air quality, but

                                             35

will also gain due to lower housing prices under the new equilibrium. As we noted earlier

some, although not many, households with low tastes for the public good are worse off in

the new equilibrium because of price increases in the low g communities.


   Table 6 provides some additional insights into the distribution of WTP estimates by

income groups. We find that W T PGE estimates are consistently larger than W T PP E esti-

mates when aggregated across all communities in the sample. W T PGE range from $1039

for the 1st quartile to $2320 for the 4th quartile. These contrast with the results in Table

5 computed for households in each county separately.


   The general equilibrium WTP measures are especially important for large scale changes

in non-market amenities like those that have taken place in California. In these circum-

stances the analysis must incorporate the price changes resulting from adjustment to the

change. Of course, it is also important to acknowledge that the merit of including these

induced price effects depends on our ability to reliable predict them.


   Several indirect gauges of the plausibility of our estimates are possible. First, we com-

pute the community specific price index in 1995 based on actual sale prices and compare

these prices with our computed GE measures. This is not an ideal standard. Our analysis




                                             36
holds incomes at the estimates implied by the model and assumes that school quality is

constant while the hedonic function for 1995 reflects actual incomes of home buyers as well

as all changes in local conditions. Nevertheless, we find that there is a significant positive

correlation between the computed prices and the price indices.


   The model’s qualitative predictions about mobility are also consistent with observed pat-

terns among the five counties in our sample. Of the five counties Ventura, San Bernardino,

and Riverside counties experienced the largest population growth during the time period.

These are also the counties which experienced the largest improvement in air quality. These

findings are consistent with the patterns discussed by Kahn (1997) in his analysis of housing

market changes based on the 1980 and 1990 census.


   Finally, a further gauge of the overall plausibility is the size of the average willingness

to pay in comparison to income. Two types of comparisons are reported – using averages

by by community in Table 5 and averages by income quartile in Table 6. Both types of

averages yield estimates that fall in the range from 2.2 to 4.5 percent.


7.3   Supply Response and Owner/Renter Distinctions


The last two columns in Table 5 recompute the general equilibrium willingness to pay

measures for supply elasticities of 1 and 2. The differences among the three GE estimates

are much smaller than those compared with the P E estimates. For example, comparing

Column III with Column X, we find that the largest differences in the average W T PGE

estimates by county is $112 dollars for San Bernadino county. For all other counties the

differences are much smaller. In contrast the differences between the Column II and Column

                                             37
III are up to $1008. Hence we conclude that the average W T PGE estimates are not sensitive

to the specification of the housing supply functions.

   As Palmquist (1988) noted, in developing measures of willingness to pay for large scale

amenity changes we should note that changes in rents (or expenditures or housing) affect

property owners differently from renters. Table 7 summarizes this aspect of our model’s

implications. Rent changes which are defined as the expenditures for the initial amount

of housing, vary substantially across counties with Los Angeles experiencing the smallest

changes (in absolute magnitude) and Ventura the largest. Introducing a supply response to

price does alter the distribution of gains between owners and renters as illustrated by the

last two columns in Tables 5 and 7.


7.4     Comparison to Hedonic Upper and Lower Bounds


In the absence of information that permits identification and estimation of second stage

marginal willingness to pay models, conventional hedonic property value models have been

used to approximate incremental willingness to pay estimates. An alternative proposed

independently by Bartik (1988) and Kanemoto (1988) is to use hedonic models to bound



                                             38
the willingness to pay. Their proposed upper and lower bounds for the WTP are defined

as:


                                U B = p90 (x, g95 ) − p90                                 (7.1)

                                 LB = p95 − p95 (x, g90 )                                 (7.2)


where x is a vector of housing characteristics, pt (·) is the hedonic price function estimated

for transactions in year t, pt is housing price in year t (measured in 1990 dollars) and gt

ozone readings for year t for properties sold in that year.


      Equation (7.1) defines the upper bound. It uses an estimate of the hedonic property

value model with actual sales in 1990 to compute what the housing prices would be with

1995 ozone conditions. The lower bound, given in equation (7.2), uses the sales in 1995 to

estimate a hedonic price function and computes the prices in 1990 if these houses had the

1990 ozone concentrations. All sales prices are adjusted to 1990 dollars and measured in

annualized terms using Poterba (1992)’s tax corrected annualization factor.


      Comparison of the upper and lower bounds with our WTP estimates provides another

gauge of the importance of general equilibrium adjustments for benefit estimates derived

from large scale environmental changes. We compare the bounds with our WTP estimates

by county. The results are given in columns VII and VIII of Table 5. Both the upper

and the lower bounds exceed our estimates for W T PGE . The lower bound is generally

closer to our estimates but the smallest difference is over 20 percent. The hedonic functions

underlying these estimates were specified to be linear to avoid issues associated with the bias



                                              39
in estimates for the predicted prices from the hedonic price function.13 While there is no

reason to expect the WTP estimates for a specific preference function will fall between these

bounds, our results provide further indication of the overstatement in partial equilibrium

approximations of general equilibrium welfare gains.


7.5      Welfare Estimates and the Willig Condition


It is also possible to use our estimates to offer some perspective on the potential importance

of relaxing the Willig condition. Recall when weak complementarity is used to link an

amenity to the demand of a private good, we must also assume (−Vg //Vp ) is independent

of income. In our case, the W T PGE includes a change in g and p. This condition is

equivalent to requiring that the WTP per unit of the complementary good is independent

of income. A gauge of the importance of this assumption can be developed for a situation

where the “commodity” providing the basis for the WTP is a composite (i.e. involving

changes in both g and p) using:


                             ∂(W T P/h)           1 ∂W T P   WTP
                                                                           
                                             =             −     ν                                   (7.3)
                                ∂y                h  ∂y       y


Given our estimates, the second term in this expression will be small and departures from

the assumption that the expression is zero will stem from the first term inside the brackets.


       The responsiveness of W T PGE to income, ∂W T PGE /∂y, is evaluated at a constant level

of utility. This expression reduces to a gauge of the sensitivity of the marginal utility of

  13
     We also considered a semi-log (i.e. log of price) and the discrepancies were somewhat smaller but both
bounds remained larger than our estimates for W T PGE . A summary with estimates of the hedonic functions
is available from the authors.



                                                    40

Table 8 summarizes our estimates for the range of average values (across school districts in

each county). It also reports the elasticity for W T PGE with respect to income, a concept

proposed by McFadden and Leonard (1993) to gauge the plausibility of WTP estimates.14

       The marginal utility of income is as much as 62 percent greater with the policy than

without. For most school districts, the differences are between 10 and 20 percent. Even in

smallest cases, the circumstances describing each household’s taste for public goods, housing

prices and income suggest the demand responsiveness required to offset these changes in

WTP with income would need to be substantial.


       These findings are also important to the early proposals to use changes in land prices

  14
   There is little direct intuition about what to expect for the elasticity of W T PGE with respect to income
(Hanemann, 1999).




                                                     41
to measure the effects of spatially delineated changes in public goods (Lind, 1973; Starrett,

1981). Capitalization relies on two key assumptions: (a) no direct effects of the change

being evaluated at the boundary of the area and (b) no sorting within the community.

These estimates provide a gauge of the importance of sorting by describing its potential

impact on the incentives of different households to sort, given the changes in the public

goods and housing prices.



8    Conclusion


We have shown that is is possible to develop general equilibrium benefit estimates for large

policy changes using as an example ozone improvements in Southern California between

1990 and 1995. Locational equilibrium models allow estimation of households’ preferences,

and offer the opportunity to compute the general equilibrium price effects of these large,

spatially delineated, changes in air quality. The framework incorporates observed income

and unobserved preference heterogeneity. As a result important additional insights can be

drawn about: measures of the distribution of gains by location and by income group, esti-

mates of the allocation of gains between owners and renters, and analysis of the importance

of assumptions underlying conventional revealed preference methods. Many of these effects

have never been estimated before. This application is the first to be conducted at this scale.

Further applications should evaluate the importance of preference specification, the incor-

poration of other spatially delineated public goods and transaction costs for our findings.

Nonetheless, our comparison of general equilibrium approximations suggests that this may

be an important area for further research essential to improving the benefit analyses of large

                                             42
scale policy interventions.
