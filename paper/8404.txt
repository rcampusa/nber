1     Introduction
Exchange rates et+1 are linked to domestic and foreign marginal utility growths or discount
factors mdt+1 and mft+1 by the equation:1
                                      ln eet+1 = ln mft+1 ln mdt+1 :                                     (1)
                                           t

Exchange rates vary a lot, as much as 10% per year. However, following the calculations
of Hansen and Jagannathan (1991), equity premia imply that marginal utility growths vary
much more, by at least 50% per year. Equation (1) then tells us that domestic and foreign
marginal utility growths must be highly correlated across countries { international risk
sharing is better than you think. Conversely, if risks were not shared internationally { if
marginal utilitypgrowths were uncorrelated across countries { it tells us that exchange rates
should vary by 2  0:5% = 71% or more { exchange rates are much too smooth.
   To formalize this idea, we compute the following index of international risk sharing:2
                                                                                 

                                                                     2

The numerator measures how di erent marginal utility growths are in the two countries {
how much risk is not shared. The denominator measures the volatility of marginal utility
growths in the two countries { how much risk there is to share. A 10% exchange rate volatility
and a 50% marginal utility growth volatility in each country imply a risk sharing index of
1 0:12= (2  0:52)=0:98: A lot of risk is shared.
    Our index is not quite the same as a correlation. Like a correlation, it is equal to one
if ln mf = ln md . Also, the index is equal to zero if ln mf and ln md are uncorrelated, and
it is equal to minus one if (pathologically) ln mf = ln md . However, perfect risk sharing
requires that the domestic and foreign marginal utility growths are equal, not just perfectly
correlated. ln mf =2  ln md is a violation of risk sharing just as much as if marginal utility
growths are uncorrelated, and we want a measure of risk sharing to detect violations of scale
as well as of correlation. If ln mf =2  ln md, our index is 0:8:
    1
      We discuss this equation in detail below, including the case of incomplete markets. For now, you can
regard it as a change of units from the marginal utility of domestic goods to the marginal utility of foreign
goods. Among many others, Backus, Foresi, and Telmer (2001), Brandt and Santa-Clara (2001), Nielsen and
Saa-Requejo (1993), and Saa-Requejo (1993) exploit this equation to relate the dynamics of the exchange
rate to the dynamics of the domestic and foreign discount factors.
    2
      We connect logs and levels in a continuous time formulation below. In this formulation, the variances
that enter the index can be interpreted as variances of either log changes or percent changes.

                                                     1
1.1      Interpreting the Calculation

Transport Costs
Risk sharing requires frictionless goods markets. The container ship is as important as 24
hour trading.3 Suppose that Earth trades with Mars in complete and frictionless capital
markets. If Mars enjoys a positive productivity shock, Earth-based owners of Martian assets
rejoice in anticipation of their payo s. But trade with Mars is still impossible, so the real
exchange rate between Mars and Earth must adjust exactly to o set any net payo . In the
end, Earth marginal utility growth must re ect Earth resources, and the same for Mars. If
the underlying shocks are uncorrelated, the exchange rate variance is the sum of the variances
of Earth and Mars marginal utility growth, and we measure a zero risk sharing index.
    At the other extreme, if there is costless trade between two countries, and the real
exchange rate is therefore constant, marginal utilities can move in lockstep. With constant
exchange rates, we measure a perfect risk sharing index of one.
    Actual economies produce a mix of tradeable and non-tradeable goods, and transport
costs vary by good and country-pair. Thus, actual economies lie somewhere between the two
extremes. If there is a positive shock in one country, asset holdings by the other countries
should lead to an out ow of goods. But, it is costly to ship goods, and those costs increase
with the volume being shipped. Therefore, real exchange rates move and their uctuations
blunt risk sharing. Our index lies between zero and one. Where it lies between zero and one
is the interesting empirical question.
Incomplete Markets
Incomplete asset markets are the second reason that risk sharing may be imperfect. If no
state-contingent payments are promised, marginal utilities can diverge across countries, even
without transport costs and a constant exchange rate.
    Also, with incomplete asset markets, the discount factors mdt+1 and mft+1 that we can
recover from asset market data are not unique. For example, given a domestic discount
factor mdt+1 , any discount factor of the form mdt+1 + "t+1 also prices all of the assets, where
"t+1 is any random variable uncorrelated with asset payo s.4 Equation (1) does not hold for
arbitrary pairs of domestic and foreign discount factors.
   3
     Obsfeld and Rogo (2000) emphasize the importance of transport costs for understanding a wide range
of puzzles in international economics.
   4
     Precisely, "t+1 is any random variable with Et ("t+1 xdt+1 ) = 0 and Et ("t+1 ete+1t xft+1 ) = 0, where xd and
xf denote the payo s of the domestic and foreign assets, respectively.




                                                        2
    To think about incomplete markets and multiple discount factors, start by considering
a single economy with many agents. In an incomplete market, individuals' marginal utility
growths may not be equal. However, the projection of each individual's marginal utility
growth on the space of asset payo s should still be the same.5 Individuals should use the
available assets to share risks as much as possible. For example, we should not see one
consumer heavily invested in tech stocks and another in blue chip stocks, so that one is more
a ected than the other when tech stocks fall { unless di erences in preferences or non-market
risks translate the di erent asset payo s into equal shocks to marginal utility growth.
    With this example in mind, we evaluate equations (1) and (2) using the unique discount
factors mdt+1 and mft+1 that are in the space of domestic and foreign asset payo s (evaluated
in units of domestic and foreign goods, respectively), and hence are the projection of any
possible domestic and foreign discount factor on to the relevant spaces of asset payo s. These
are also the minimum-variance domestic and foreign discount factors, respectively. We show
that equation (1) continues to hold with this particular choice of discount factors. Our
index of international risk sharing thus answers the questions: How e ectively do countries
use existing asset markets to share risks? How much do exchange rate changes blunt the
e ectiveness of risk sharing using existing asset markets?
    Overall risk sharing can be better or worse than the result of our calculation, so our
calculation does not yield an upper or lower bound. If the additional risks (the residuals
in regressions of marginal utility growth on asset payo s) are perfectly correlated across
countries, the numerator of the index (2) does not change, but the denominator increases.
In this case, true risk sharing is better than indicated by our index. Omitted assets are the
most likely source of additional positively correlated risks. Additional assets make discount
factors more volatile, but typically do so in the same way for domestic and foreign investors.
Additional common shocks { such as international business cycles { have the same e ect.
    If the additional risks are uncorrelated across countries, true risk sharing is lower than our
calculation. In this case, both the numerator and denominator of the index (2) increase by
the same amount. As the additional uncorrelated risks increase in magnitude and ultimately
swamp the exchange rates and discount factors that we measure, the true risk sharing index
declines to zero. Quantitatively, though, additional risks have to be on the same order as the
   5
     The projection is the tted value of a regression of marginal utility growth on the asset payo s. It
is the \mimicking portfolio" for marginal utility. The prediction that this projection should be equal
across individuals can be derived from the individual's
                                                           rst order conditions. Each individual's marginal
utility growth mi satis es pt = Et mit+1 xt+1 , and thus (since residuals are orthogonal to tted values)
pt = Et [proj(mit+1 jX )xt+1 ] where X denotes the payo space of all traded assets. There is a unique
discount factor x 2 X such that pt = Et (xt+1 xt+1 ) for all x 2 X Since this discount factor is unique,
proj(mit+1 jX ) = x is the same for all individuals. See Cochrane (2001) for elaboration on this theme.

                                                     3
50% volatility of the minimum variance discount factor to seriously a ect our risk sharing
index. It is diÆcult enough to understand the 50% volatility of the minimum variance
discount factor; do we really believe that there are other country risks, orthogonal to asset
market returns, that add up to an additional 50% volatility of marginal utility growth?
    In sum, with incomplete asset markets and no strong information about the correlation of
unspanned risks across countries, the proportion of true risks that are shared can be higher
or lower than our calculation. For this reason, we stick with the above interpretation of risk
sharing through existing capital markets, rather than try to read the index as a bound on
the fraction of total risks that are shared.6

1.2     Consumption-Based Estimates and Home Bias

Poor Risk Sharing in Consumption Data
The conclusion that almost all risk is shared internationally lies in stark contrast to the
picture painted by consumption data. Consumption growth is poorly correlated across
countries, and this apparently poor international risk sharing is one of the major puzzles
of international economics.7 In addition, it is not very volatile, so when consumption growth
is multiplied by reasonable risk aversion to produce marginal utility growth, consumption-
based models cannot produce the observed volatility of the exchange rate via equation (1),
just as they cannot reproduce the observed equity premium. This observation has lead some
authors to conclude that exchange rates are much too volatile.8
    The di erence, of course, is that we measure marginal utility growth from asset markets
rather than from consumption data. We measure marginal utility growth directly, rather
than from consumption or portfolio choices via a utility function. Asset markets and
consumption data (plus a utility function and parameters) give quite di erent pictures of
marginal utility growth. Based on asset data, it appears that there is a lot of risk ((ln md )
and (ln mf ) are large) and that risk is shared surprisingly well across countries (md and mf
move together). Alternatively, exchange rates are surprisingly smooth (( ln e) is small).
   6
     By using an upper limit on the volatility of the discount factors in the denominator of the index (2), in
the style of Cochrane and Saa-Requejo (1999), one can obtain a lower bound on overall risk sharing, but we
do not pursue this calculation here.
   7
     Important contributions to this literature include Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992), Backus and
Smith (1993), Brennan and Solnik (1989), Lewis (1996, 2000), Tesar (1993).
   8
     See Flood and Rose (1995), Mark (1985), Meese and Rogo (1983), Obsfeld and Rogo (2000), and
Rogo (1999). Perfect insurance is also rejected within a country, see for example Cochrane (1991) and
Mace (1991). However, it is quite likely that aggregate consumption is better insured across countries using
stock markets than idiosyncratic income is insured within countries.


                                                      4
Based on consumption data and power utility, in contrast, it appears that there is little risk,
that risk is poorly shared, and exchange rates are surprisingly volatile.
    Our aim in this paper is only to document the asset-market view of exchange rates and
risk sharing, not to reconcile it with consumption data. Even in a single-country setting,
reconciling the asset-market view { a high equity premium and large discount factor volatility
{ with consumption data seems to require dramatic departures from the conventional power
utility setup (e.g., habits as in Campbell and Cochrane, 1999, or countercyclical idiosyncratic
risk as in Constantinides and DuÆe, 1996). Reconciling the asset-market view with the
smoothness and poor correlation of consumption and other quantity data is likely to require
similarly large departures from separable power utility.
Home Bias Puzzle
The home bias puzzle is that US investors largely hold US securities, Japanese investors
largely hold Japanese securities, and so forth.9 Typical investors are quite far from holding
a uniform world market portfolio that one might imagine underlies perfect risk sharing.
    Exchange rate volatility { induced by nontraded goods { is a natural source of home bias.
Returning to the example of Earth and Mars, once Earth-based investors understand that
exchange rate movements will o set any gains from holding Martian securities, their optimal
portfolios may ignore those securities. While this reasoning helps to understand the home
bias in consumption-based models that produce little variation in marginal utility growth,
it has not yet been successful in quantitatively explaining the puzzle.10
    Related, exchange rate volatility induces some home bias in mean-variance optimal
portfolio calculations.11 The exchange rate is almost as volatile as stock returns, and it
tends to be poorly correlated with both domestic and foreign stock markets. This makes
foreign stocks less desirable to the domestic investor relative to domestic stocks, and vice
versa for the foreign investor. Unfortunately, the mean-variance optimal degree of home bias
is a great deal lower than the observed home bias, leaving the puzzle largely unresolved.
   9
     French and Poterba (1991) observe that Americans held 94% of their equity wealth in the US stock
market. The analogous gure for Japan was 98%. Baxter and Jermann (1997) point out that since human
capital is domestic, adding labor income risk actually worsens the puzzle. Tesar and Werner (1995) show
that foreign portfolios turned over much faster than domestic portfolios, and argue that this suggests that
transactions costs do not drive the home bias. See Lewis (1999) for a survey of the home bias puzzle.
Interestingly, there is also a small home bias at home. Coval and Moskowitz (1999) nd that fund managers
hold stocks of companies that are on average somewhat closer to them than the market as a whole.
  10
     In fact, Baxter, Jermann, and King (1995) show that nontradable goods cannot explain the puzzle
quantitatively in the context of a multi-country general equilibrium model.
  11
     See for example, Black and Litterman (1992).


                                                    5
    The home bias puzzle does not con ict with our calculation. Our risk sharing index is
based on a direct measure of marginal utility growth. The home bias puzzle refers to an
optimal portfolio calculation for a speci c utility function, underlying income process, and
asset return process. It is quite possible to see large amounts of risk sharing in marginal
utility growth, but still to be puzzled by the underlying economic model that generates it
and the portfolio positions that support it. For example, if the underlying income shocks are
highly correlated, or if risk sharing is achieved by other means (e.g., government transfers,
direct payments to relatives abroad, other assets), or if preferences are not the simple one-
period quadratic utility over wealth, we can see volatile and highly correlated marginal utility
growths despite very little asset cross-holding.
    The minimum variance discount factor is the projection of marginal utility growth onto
the space of asset payo s. It is not itself the optimal portfolio or the \market" portfolio. The
minimum variance discount factor is proportional to the minimum second-moment portfolio,
which is on the bottom of the mean-variance frontier. (See Cochrane, 2001.) In a mean-
variance setting, the optimal, tangency, and market portfolios are all on the top of the mean-
variance frontier. Domestic and foreign discount factors can therefore be highly correlated
even if the optimal portfolios that help generate the marginal utilities are not.
    Another di erence between our calculation and a portfolio problem is that the two key
ingredients to our risk sharing index are the mean stock returns and the variance of the
exchange rate, since the mean stock returns drive the volatility of the discount factors. In
thinking about risk sharing from a portfolio perspective, it is more natural to focus on the
correlation of international stock returns. The variance and correlation of stock returns are
only of secondary importance to our risk sharing calculation (they help to determine the
loadings of the projection).
    We assume that investors can buy stocks internationally { their rst-order conditions
for international stock purchases are satis ed. (This assumption is implicit in the home
bias puzzle because otherwise the home bias is hardly puzzling.) It does not matter for
our calculation whether they actually do so { whether their optimal portfolios contain large
positions in foreign assets or not. In the language of the international nance literature, we
assume that the capital market are fully integrated. Dumas, Harvey, and Ruiz (2000) nd
that this is consistent with the data for the large countries that we study.

2      Calculation
We adopt a continuous time formulation. While the notation is a little more tedious, this
allows us to translate more easily between logs and levels.

2.1     Discount factors and the risk-sharing index

We rst describe how to recover the minimum-variance discount factor from asset markets
in general, and then we specialize the discussion to our international setting.
    Suppose that a vector of assets has the following excess return process:12
                              dR = dt + dz      with E(dzdz0 ) = dt:                                 (3)
There is also a riskfree asset:
                                              dB
                                              B
                                                   = rdt:                                              (4)
    With this notation, the discount factor:
                                       d
                                         = rdt   dz                                    (5)
                                                      0 1

prices the assets, i.e., it satis es the rst order conditions:
                                                                
                                       d                       d
                             rdt = E
                                         and dt = E  dR :                              (6)
In this formulation, d= plays the role of m in the introduction. Equation (5) shows why
mean asset returns determine the volatility of marginal utility growth. Holding constant ,
the higher  is, the more d= loads on the shocks dz, and the more volatile is d=.
    We can add to this discount factor any shocks dw that are uncorrelated with dz, and
this has no e ect on the pricing relationship (6). Since dw and dz are uncorrelated, discount
factors so formed will have greater variance. This implies that the discount factor (5) is
the unique discount factor formed as a linear combination of shocks to assets dz. It is the
minimum-variance discount factor, and it is the projection of any valid discount factor on
to the space spanned by the shocks dz.
  12
    An excess return is the di erence between any two value processes, e.g., dR = dS=S   dV =V .   We often
use a riskfree asset for dV =V , but this is not necessary.


                                                   7
   We can construct the log discount factor, required in equations (1) and (2), via Ito's
lemma:
                                                          
                           d 1 d2               1
                 d ln =
                             2 2 = r + 2    dt   dz                            (7)
                                                     0  1       0 1


and then evaluate its variance as:
                                   1 2 (d ln) = 0 1 :                            (8)
                                               dt

    We now specialize the formulas to our international context. To nd the domestic and
foreign discount factors that price domestic and foreign stocks and bonds, we simply need
to express the appropriate vectors of excess returns  and covariance matrices . We write
the real returns on the domestic riskfree asset B d , domestic stocks S d, exchange rate e (in
units of foreign goods/domestic goods), foreign riskfree asset B f , and foreign stocks S f as:
                                  dB d                          d

                                  Bd
                                              = rddt; dS Sd
                                                             = ddt + dzd ;
                                                de
                                                 e
                                                   = edt + dze;                                 (9)
                                  dB f                      dS f
                                   Bf
                                              = rf dt;       Sf
                                                                    = f dt + dzf :
We collect the shocks in a vector dz and write the covariance matrix as:13
                   2       3                           2                   3
                      dz d
                                         1                 dd  de df         0       0




              dz = 4 dz e 5 and  = E(dzdz 0 ) = 4 ed ee ef 5 :                              (10)
                   6       7                           6                   7    0       0


                                         dt

   Next, we nd the excess returns in terms of this notation. The excess domestic stock
return is simply:
                                              dS d   dB d                 
                                 dR   d
                                             Sd      Bd
                                                            =   d     rd dt + dz d :           (11)
To invest in the foreign riskfree bond, the domestic investor also faces currency risk. Hence,
the excess return is:
                 d(eB f ) dB d
                     eB f
                                 = de + rf dt rddt = (e + rf rd )dt + dze:
                                 Bd            e
                                                                                          (12)
 13
      We use the notation dd etc. because there may be several risky assets in each economy.

The foreign excess return to foreign stocks is:
                                                dS f       dB f                

but we need the domestic counterpart to this foreign excess return. Accounting for exchange
risk, the domestic returns to holding a foreign stock and riskfree asset are d(eS f )=eS f and
d(eB f )=eB f respectively. Thus, the corresponding domestic excess return is:14

    Stacking the three excess returns (11), (12), and (14), the vector of mean excess returns
to a domestic investor is:

                                                                  d    rd

and the covariance matrix of excess returns is just . It follows that the minimum-variance
domestic discount factor is:

By Ito's lemma we then have:

      Alternatively, we could de ne an excess return for the domestic investor in the foreign stock as deS
                                                                                                       eS f    Bd     .

    We derive the foreign discount factor analogously. The foreign discount factor must price
the foreign stocks, the domestic riskfree asset, and the domestic stocks. This is symmetric to
the domestic discount factor, except for Ito terms. Again, all we need is to nd the relevant
 and . The foreign excess return from holding foreign stocks is already given by equation
(13). The foreign excess return from borrowing at the domestic interest rate and investing
at the foreign interest rate is:15

  15
    Note that d 1e = e12 de + e13 de2 and d(11=e=e) = dee + dee22 . We write the foreign excess return slightly
unconventionally as the return to borrowing domestically to invest in foreign assets. This speci cation
highlights the symmetry between domestic and foreign investors. Of course, the sign of an excess return
makes no di erence to the volatility of the discount factor (see equation (8)).

2.2       Incomplete Markets

When markets are incomplete, the minimum-variance discount factors recovered from asset
markets are not the only possible ones. We can always scale the minimum-variance domestic
marginal utility d by a positive martingale and obtain another candidate for domestic
marginal utility:
                                                    d = dd                                          (25)
where:
                                 dd
                                 d
                                         = dwd with E(dwddz) = 0:                                       (26)
The resulting marginal utility growth (by Ito's lemma):16
                              dd     dd dd       dd
                                d  =  
                                         d
                                           +   d
                                                  =   d
                                                          + dwd                          (27)
satis es the rst-order conditions (6) and is hence a valid discount factor. We therefore need
to think more carefully about what our calculation for variance-minimizing discount factors
says about marginal utility growth with incomplete markets. This section formalizes the
discussion in the introduction.


   Notice that we increase the riskiness of marginal utility by multiplying it by a positive martingale.
  16

Through Ito's lemma, this amounts to adding zero-mean noise to minimum-variance marginal utility growth.

                                                          11
Minimum-Variance Discount Factors Satisfy the Identity
Given a domestic marginal utility d , the choice f = ked (with any constant k) prices the
foreign assets. But not all foreign discount factors satisfy this relation. If one does, another
formed by adding dw does not. Thus, the basic identity: f = ked and its key implication
                                   d ln e = d lnf   d lnd                                (28)
that allows us to use exchange rates to measure the di erence between the domestic and
foreign discount factors, does not hold for arbitrary choices of the discount factors.
    Fortunately, the basic identity f = ked and equation (28) do hold for the minimum-
variance discount factors. To see this result, note from the de nitions (15) and (21) that we
can write:
                                          2       3
                                             ed
                               f = d 4 ee 5 = d e ;                                 (29)

                                              ef


where e denotes the middle column of . Thus, we can relate the domestic and foreign
minimum-variance discount factors by:
                         df     dd
                          f dd + (r r )dt +   dz
                              =         d  f       e0  1
                                 d
                                                                                 (30)
                              = d + (r r )dt + dz :
                                        d  f        e



Notice that the domestic and foreign discount factors load equally on the domestic and
foreign stock return shocks, and their loadings on the exchange rate shock di er by exactly

Risk Sharing Index with Additional Risks
Consider now a pair of arbitrary domestic and foreign discount factors dd =d and
df  =f  formed from the minimum-variance discount factors dd =d and df =f by the
addition of noises dwd and dwf with E(dwddz) = 0 and E(dwf dz) = 0, respectively. Using
these alternative discount factors, the risk sharing index is:
                                                            
                                       2 d lnd d lnf 
                               1 2(d lnd ) + 2 (d lnf  ) :                    (32)

    To relate this expression to the risk sharing index using the minimum-variance discount
factors, express lnd = lnd + ln d from equation (25). Then:
                           d lnd    = d lnd + d ln d
                                                                                              (33)
                                      = d lnd + 12 2 (dwd)dt + dwd
where we use Ito's lemma on (26). There is a similar expression for the foreign discount
factor. This implies that:
                                                                       

                                                 13
Substituting the last two expressions into equation (32), the risk sharing index using the
alternative discount factors is:
                                                           

    We can now formalize the incomplete markets discussion in the introduction. If the
\extra shocks" are the same across countries, dwd = dwf , then the numerator is unchanged
and the denominator increases. Our risk sharing index therefore increases if the extra shocks
are the same across countries. If the extra shocks have

however, then  dw dw =  dw ) +  (dw . The extra terms in the numerator and
                2    d      f       2    d     2   f

denominator are the same, which increases the ratio (since it starts below one) and pulls the
risk sharing index towards zero. Note however that the denominator increases as well as the
numerator. There must be more risk as well as less risk sharing, since we add uncorrelated
components. Negatively correlated additional shocks drive the risk sharing index towards
minus one while also increasing each country's overall risk.

3    Results
We implement the continuous time formulas in Section 2 with straightforward discrete time
approximations and monthly data. We start with domestic excess stock returns Rtd+ , foreign
excess stock returns Rtf+ , the exchange rate et (in units of foreign currency per dollar),Pand
domestic and foreign interest rates rtd+ and rtf+ , where  = 1=12 years. With ET  T1 Tt=1 ,
we then estimate the instantaneous risk premia and variances required in the risk sharing
measure (24) by the obvious sample counterparts to the continuous time moments:

We use real returns, real interest rates, and a real exchange rate, each adjusted ex-post
by realized in ation. Since the risk sharing index is based entirely on excess returns, the
calculation is fairly insensitive to how one handles interest rates and in ation. However,
excess nominal returns are not quite the same as excess real returns, so we start with real
returns to keep the calculation as pure as possible.
    We use the US as the domestic country, and the UK, Germany, and Japan as the foreign
countries. Table 1 presents summary statistics important to our calculation. The top panel
shows the mean and standard deviation of the excess returns on the domestic and foreign
stock indices and the exchange rate (annualized and reported in percent), and the bottom
panel shows the correlations between the returns. (The excess return on the exchange rate is
the return on borrowing domestically at the riskfree rate, converting to the foreign currency
at the current exchange rate, lending at the foreign riskfree rate for one month, and then
converting back to the domestic currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the
month.) Autocorrelation-corrected standard errors are in parentheses.17
    The table reminds us of the high equity risk premium, not only in the US but also abroad.
The mean excess stock index returns range from 4.78% in Japan to 10.31% in the UK and are
all statistically signi cant. The standard deviation ranges from 14.70% in the US to 18.74%
in Japan, resulting in annualized Sharpe ratios of 0.63 in the US, 0.57 in the UK, 0.43 in
Germany, and 0.26 in Japan. The estimates of the exchange rate risk premium e+ rf re are
positive for the UK and Germany and negative for Japan, but are all small and statistically
indistinguishable from zero. The volatility of the exchange rates is almost as high as that
for stocks, ranging from 11.51% to 12.89% (about the same magnitude as the volatility of
long-term bond returns). The stock returns are positively correlated across countries, with
correlations ranging from 0.34 to 0.57, while the exchange rates are poorly correlated with
stock return both in the US and abroad, with correlations less than 0.15.
    Table 1 also reminds us of how diÆcult it is to estimate equity risk premia. For example,
the US risk premium of 9.21% is measured with a 2.81% standard error. The reason is,
of course, the high volatility of stock returns prelative to the size of the mean return. The
standard error of the mean return (Rt+)= T , and its more precise incarnation in our
GMM standard errors, dooms precise measurement of the risk premium. This is the central
source of uncertainty in the risk sharing index.
    Using these return moments and the average ex-post real one-month interest rate to proxy
for the real riskfree rate in each country, we compute the minimum-variance domestic and
  17
    To obtain standard errors, we stack equations (37) into a vector of moment conditions and treat that
vector in the framework of GMM estimation (Hansen, 1982). We use Newey and West's (1987) estimator of
the moment covariance matrix with a six-month correction for serial correlation.

                                                  15
foreign discount factors for the three country pairs (i.e., US versus UK, US versus Germany,
and US versus Japan) from equations (16) and (22). Figure 1 plots these discount factors to
obtain a visual idea of their correlation. On the left, we plot the logarithms of the levels of
US and foreign marginal utility. On the right, we show a scatter plot of the US versus foreign
marginal utility growths. As the pictures show, the US and foreign marginal utility growths
are nearly the same. They do di er, by the exchange rate, but marginal utility growth is so
volatile relative to the exchange rate that they do not di er by much. Therefore, domestic
and foreign marginal utility growths are very close. This is our basic point.
    Table 2 calculates the volatilities of the minimum-variance domestic and foreign discount
factors. These volatilities have the interpretation of the maximum Sharpe ratios obtainable
by trading in the international assets. We see that the maximum Sharpe ratios are of the
order of 0.63 to 0.69, and are very similar for investors in each pair of countries. The reason
for this similarity is that all investors essentially have the same set of assets available to
them, with the only distortion caused by the exchange rate volatility. (US investors take on
exchange rate risk to invest abroad and the opposite for foreign investors.) For the observed
exchange rate volatilities, this distortion is very small. If exchange rates were more volatile,
the discount factor volatilities would di er more across countries.
    Table 2 also presents our central result, the risk sharing index (24). The numbers are
all at or above 0.98, implying a very high level of international risk sharing. This result is
driven by the relatively low volatilities of the exchange rates compared to the volatilities
of marginal utility growth. The risk sharing index for Japan is the lowest, with a value of
0.98, re ecting the lower volatilities of marginal utility growth (due to the lower equity risk
premium in Japan) and the higher exchange rate volatility.
    The standard errors on the volatilities of marginal utility growth are quite high, ranging
from 0.13 to 0.21. This is because the variance of marginal utility growth depends on the
mean excess returns d and f (see equation (18)), which, as we saw in Table 1, are diÆcult
to estimate precisely. However, the standard errors on the risk sharing index are very small.
The risk sharing index of 0.98 is measured with a standard error of about 0.01. The index
is so close to one that even substantial uncertainty about the volatility of marginal utility
growth does not much a ect its value. Even if the variance of marginal utility growth were
20% lower, the risk sharing index would still be 0.96.
    To explore in more detail the e ect of uncertainty about the equity risk premium on
our calculation, we report in Table 3 the risk sharing index for di erent equity premia.
There is no point in redoing the experiment for all three countries, so we use a simple set
of representative numbers for this and following experiments. We use a stock excess return
                                              16
volatility of 18% for both countries. We set the exchange rate volatility to 12%. We assume
a correlation of 0.4 between the stock indices and zero correlation between the stock indices
and the exchange rate. We set the domestic exchange rate risk premium to zero.18 Our
baseline is a stock excess return premium of 8% in each country. In the notation of the
formulas, our assumptions for the sensitivity analyses are:
                            e + rf     re  = 0; d rd = f rf = 0:08
                              (dz d ) =  (dz f ) = 0:18;  (dz e ) = 0:12                            (38)
                          (dz d ; dz f ) = 0:4; (dz d dz e ) = (dz f dz e ) = 0:

The risk sharing index for these parameter values is 0.98, just as in the data. For Table 3,
we vary the domestic and foreign equity risk premia d rd and f rf from 2% to 10% and
report the corresponding values of the risk sharing index.
    You may distrust the 1975{1998 sample period and suspect that our surprisingly high risk
sharing index is driven by an abnormally high equity risk premium in that period. However,
Table 3 shows that even a 6% equity risk premium, rather than the 9% estimate for the
US, still produces a risk sharing index of 0.97. Even a very low 4% equity risk premium in
both countries implies a risk sharing index of 0.91. (We focus on equity risk premia below
8% based on our own priors that this sample premium represents some good luck. Also,
parameters that potentially lower an 0.98 index are more interesting than parameters that
potentially raise it even closer to one.)
    Table 3 also shows that the risk sharing index is driven by the larger of the domestic
and foreign equity risk premia. As long as one of the risk premia is high, above 6% say,
the risk sharing index is also high, above 0.96. Only when both premia drop below 4%
does the risk sharing index decrease substantially. The risk sharing index is driven by the
maximum Sharpe ratio in portfolios of the domestic and international assets. As long as the
Sharpe ratio in one of the countries is high and the exchange rate is not too volatile, the
internationally obtainable Sharpe ratio is also high.
    This fact contributes to the small standard errors of our risk sharing index in Table 2.
To see much di erence in the risk sharing index, not only one, but both equity risk premia
must be much smaller than they appear in sample (below 4%).
    To get a better sense for the marginal utility growths recovered from asset markets, we
show in Table 4 the (negative of the) loadings d0  1 and f 0 1 of the domestic and foreign
  18
    This assumption gives foreigners a currency risk premium of ee  0:12 = 1%. However, the results
are all driven by the equity risk premia and are very insensitive to the assumed exchange rate risk premium.

                                                     17
discount factors on the excess return shocks dz. As we showed in equation (30), the discount
factor loadings on the stock return shocks are exactly the same, and the foreign discount
factor loads by minus one more on the exchange rate shock, so that the di erence between the
two discount factors is exactly equal to the exchange rate. Also sensibly, the loadings on the
stock market shocks are all positive, which, together with the minus sign in equations (16)
and (22), means that marginal utility declines when either stock market rises. Finally, since
the weights are larger on the stocks than on the exchange rate, the volatility in marginal
utility growth comes mostly from stock market shocks.
    Risk sharing measures based on consumption data typically show much less risk and
much worse risk sharing. To examine the discrepancy between our asset market view of
risk sharing and consumption data, we calculate discount factors and risk sharing measures
implied by consumption data and standard power utility.
    Table 5 shows annualized standard deviations and correlations of log consumption growth
for the three country pairs. Since high frequency consumption data is notoriously noisy, we
consider both quarterly and annual data. (Temporally aggregating consumption data is likely
to reduce the e ect of measurement errors. See Bell and Wilcox, 1993, and Wilcox, 1992.)
The table con rms the usual results. Consumption growth is very smooth, with standard
deviations of 1.4% to 3.1%. Using CRRA utility with u0(c) = c , log marginal utility growth
is d ln = d ln c. As is well known from the equity risk premium literature, we therefore
need a very large , at least 20, to generate from this smooth consumption the 60% volatility
of marginal utility growth implied by asset markets in Table 2.
    Table 5 also shows that consumption growth is far from perfectly correlated across
countries, with correlations ranging from 0.17 to 0.42. The correlations are highest between
the US and UK and lowest between the US and Germany. Although an outsider might nd
these correlations reasonably high, they are not one, which is the heart of the puzzle that
international risks do not seem to be perfectly shared (see Obsfeld and Rogo , 2000).
    Assuming for simplicity that the domestic and foreign representative investors have the
same level of relative risk aversion, we can compute the risk sharing index as:19
                                                                           
                        2 d lnd d lnf                 2 d ln cd d ln cf
                 1 2 (d lnd) + 2 (d lnf ) = 1 2 d ln cd  + 2 d ln cf  :           (39)
Notice that the risk aversion coeÆcients drop out of the index when both countries have the
same level of risk aversion. As shown in Table 5, this calculation results in a risk sharing
  19
    In incomplete markets, consumption-based discount factors are not related by equation (28), so we
cannot use exchange rates in the numerator of the risk sharing index.

                                                 18
index of 0.17 to 0.36. These are much lower than what is implied by asset markets, and they
capture in our index the usual conclusion that risks are poorly shared internationally. (The
index is lower than the consumption growth correlation because the index penalizes size as
well as correlation. The greater standard deviation of foreign consumption growth would
count against risk sharing even if consumption growths were perfectly correlated.)
    How much non-market risk would it take to drive the asset market based risk sharing index
down to the values suggested by consumption data and power utility? Table 6 investigates
this question quantitatively. (Of course, this calculation will add to the total discount factor
volatility, so we cannot consider it a reconciliation of consumption and asset market views,
but it is still worth making.) Similar to the experiment in Table 3, start with the parameter
values (38). We then vary the volatility of the additional risks dwd and dwf from zero to
40% and the correlation between them from minus one to plus one. The table reports the
corresponding values of the risk sharing index, calculated from equation (36).
    If we assume that the extra risks are uncorrelated (a reasonable assumption), the volatility
of extra risks has to be more than 40% to reduce the risk sharing index to below 0.7 (which
is not even close to the 0.3 implied by consumption data). In this calculation, the minimum-
variance marginal utility growth already has a standard deviation of 57%, so we have to add
unspanned risks of the same magnitude to see a substantial reduction in risk sharing. Since
the volatility of marginal utility growth is already a famous puzzle, another set of risks of
the same magnitude, uncorrelated with market returns, seems excessive.
    Omitted assets and international business cycles are likely to induce a positive correlation
between the extra risks. Table 6 shows that a positive correlation slows down the rate at
which the index decreases with the volatility of the extra risks. For example, with correlation
of 0.8, the risk sharing index with 40% volatility of unspanned risks is still 0.92. As explained
in the introduction, with a perfect correlation, the index increases as we add extra risks.
    A negative correlation between the unspanned risks across countries brings down the risk
sharing index more quickly. (There is little reason to think that the extra risks are negatively
correlated, except perhaps due to beggar-thy-neighbor policies.) With a correlation of -0.8,
for example, a 0.5 risk sharing index can be obtained with slightly more than 30% volatility
of extra risks. With an extra 50% volatility, the index is in the neighborhood of the numbers
implied by consumption data. (However, we then need risk aversion of 35 to 40 to reconcile
the consumption data with the in ated volatility of marginal utility growth.)
    In sum, though overall risks can be better or worse shared than our index, substantially
worse risk sharing does not seem quantitatively plausible. One has to believe in a lot of extra

                                               19
risks, or have those risks strongly negatively correlated across countries, to generate overall
risk sharing close to the traditional values inferred from consumption data.
    Suppose that risks are in fact not well shared internationally. Then, the exchange rates
are surprisingly smooth. To make this point quantitatively, we solve in Table 7 for the
exchange rate volatility that is consistent with a risk sharing index of 0.35 (the highest value
implied by the consumption data). As in Table 3, we start with the parameters (38) and
vary the domestic and foreign equity risk premia d rd and f rf from 4% to 8%. (Since
our index is driven by the maximum risk premium, we set d rd = f rf .) The standard
deviation of the implied minimum-variance discount factors ranges from 28% to 57%. As
in Table 6, we then add to these minimum-variance discount factors unspanned risks dwd
and dwf with volatilities ranging from zero to 40% and a correlation of either zero and 0.4.
Table 7 reports the exchange rate volatilities that makes equation (36) evaluate to 0.35.
    Table 7 shows that for equity risk premia of 6% to 8% (still lower than our estimates),
the exchange rate volatility should at least be about 40%, and closer to 60% for most
speci cations. While unspanned risks lower the implied exchange rate volatility somewhat,
since they make discount factors less correlated for given exchange rates, even 40% extra
risks are not in the ballpark to get down to a 10% exchange rate volatility. Only when the
risk premia are as low as 4% and the extra risks are uncorrelated (or negatively correlated)
with more than 35% volatility does the implied exchange rate volatility drop to its historical
level. However, to evaluate whether this is a realistic scenario, notice that the extra risks are
more than 1.25 times as volatile as the minimum variance discount factor (with a standard
deviation of 28%). This means that less than 40% of all risks are spanned by the traded
assets, which is clearly an extreme amount of market incompleteness.

4     Conclusion
We present an asset markets view of international risk sharing. The high Sharpe ratios
obtainable in international asset markets imply that marginal utility growth is very volatile
for both the domestic and foreign country { there is a lot of risk to share. Compared to this
volatility, the volatility of exchange rates is very small. Since the exchange rate between two
countries is the only di erence between their marginal utility growths, we therefore conclude
that there is a surprisingly high level of international risk sharing. Alternatively, if risks
really are poorly shared, exchange rates are much too smooth. Both conclusions are in stark
contrast to the standard ndings from consumption data.
    Since markets are incomplete, our risk-sharing index answers the question, \To what
                                               20
extent do exchange rate movements blunt the risk-sharing possibilities of existing asset
markets?" The answer is \not much," and \there is a lot of risk to be shared." Risks
that induce marginal utility movements uncorrelated with asset payo s can lower overall
risk sharing, but we argue that reasonably sized and correlated risks cannot lower overall
risk sharing by much.
     We conducted our analysis only for country pairs and two assets in each country { the
stock market and a riskfree asset. Taking into account more countries at once and more
assets will make our results even stronger since the maximum Sharpe ratio obtainable in
international asset markets can only increase. Furthermore, adding conditioning information
is likely to increase the implied level of risk sharing as well. For example, Brandt and Santa-
Clara (2001) nd that the volatility of exchange rates drops at times very signi cantly,
which means even higher values of the risk sharing index at those times (holding xed the
volatilities of marginal utility growth).

This table shows annualized summary statistics for real excess returns on stock indices and exchange
rates for the US, UK, Germany, and Japan. The stock indices are total market returns from
Datastream, the interest rates are for one-month Eurocurrency deposits from Datastream, and the
CPI is from the International Monetary Fund's IFS database. The stock returns (Stock) are excess
returns over the one-month interest rates. The exchange rate returns (X-rate) are excess returns for
borrowing domestically, converting to the foreign currency, lending at the foreign interest rate, and
converting the proceeds back to the domestic currency. Monthly data from January 1975 through
June 1998. Serial-correlation adjusted standard errors in parenthesis.
