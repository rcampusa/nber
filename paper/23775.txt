                                         ABSTRACT

We study the welfare implications of scalable price targeting, an extreme form of third-degree
price discrimination implemented with machine learning for a large, digital firm. Targeted prices
are computed by solving the firm's Bayesian Decision-Theoretic pricing problem based on a
database with a high-dimensional vector of customer features that are observed prior to the price
quote. To identify the causal effect of price on demand, we first run a large, randomized price
experiment and use these data to train our demand model. We use l1 regularization (lasso) to
select the set of customer features that moderate the heterogeneous treatment effect of price on
demand. We use a weighted likelihood Bayesian bootstrap to quantify the firm's approximate
statistical uncertainty in demand and profitability. We then conduct a second experiment that
implements our proposed price targeting scheme out of sample. Theoretically, both firm and
customer surplus could rise with scalable price targeting. Optimized uniform pricing improves
revenues by 64.9% relative to the control pricing, whereas scalable price targeting improves
revenues by 81.5%. Firm profits increase by over 10% under targeted pricing relative to optimal
uniform pricing. Customer surplus declines by less than 1% with price targeting; although nearly
70% of customers are charged less than the uniform price. Our weighted likelihood bootstrap
estimator also predicts demand and demand uncertainty out of sample better than several
alternative approaches.

1     Introduction
The growing access to vast customer databases and analytic tools has made the practice of personalized
targeted marketing more accessible to the mainstream firm. We study scalable price targeting (SPT), an
extreme form of third-degree price discrimination that targets prices using large quantities of observable
customer features. Theorists have long recognized the possibility that with a very granular segmentation
scheme, like SPT, third-degree price discrimination could approximate first-degree, or “perfect,” price
discrimination1 :

            “... it is evident that discrimination of the third degree approximates towards discrim-
       ination of the first degree as the number of markets into which demands can be divided
       approximate toward the number of units for which any demand exists.” (Pigou, 1920, Part
       II, chapter XVI, section 14)

   Despite a long theoretical interest in price discrimination (e.g. Pigou, 1920; Varian, 1980; Stole,
2007), perfect price discrimination has historically been regarded as a purely theoretical prospect2 :

            “[The monopolist] cannot, except in extraordinary circumstances, introduce either the
       first or the second degree of discrimination, and that the third degree is of chief practical
       importance.” (Pigou, 1920, Part II, chapter XVI, section 6)

Academics only recognized the mass potential for more individualized, personalized pricing in practice
during the early days of the commercial internet (Shapiro and Varian, 1999; Smith, Bailey, and Brynjolf-
sson., 2000). It was not until 2015 that the prospect of SPT practices prompted a report by the Counsel
of Economic Advisors (CEA) devoted entirely to differential pricing with big data (CEA, 2015). Rec-
ognizing how “...big data and electronic commerce have reduced the costs of targeting and first-degree
price discrimination” (CEA, 2015, page 12), the report mostly drew dire conclusions about the potential
harm to customers:

           “[Differential pricing] transfers value from consumers to shareholders, which generally
       leads to an increase in inequality and can therefore be inefficient from a utilitarian stand-
       point” (CEA, 2015, page 6).

A similar concern for customer harm has been echoed in the recent mainstream business media3 .

    1 Statistical uncertainty typically limits the segmentation to an imperfect form of targetability. The approximation is also
typically closer under unit demand since SPT typically cannot target a different price to each infra-marginal unit purchased
by a customer.
     2 In practice, most targeted pricing structures use coarse segmentation strategies that vary prices across broad groups of

customers. Examples include seniors discounts at the movies and geographic or “zone” pricing by retailers across communi-
ties in a metropolitan area.
     3 See for instance, “How Online Shopping Makes Suckers of Us All,” (Useem, 2017)



                                                               1
    The growing pressure for public policies with the potential to curb or limit data-based pricing has
heightened the need for more scientific inquiry into the empirical implications of price discrimination
with big data. The extent to which SPT is used in practice is unknown and, to the best of our knowledge,
the literature has not yet produced field evidence that SPT generates incremental profits in practice. On
the demand side, the move from uniform to SPT can theoretically increase total welfare (Varian, 1989),
and can also theoretically increase total consumer surplus specifically (Cowan, 2012). The targeting of
prices re-allocates value from strong consumers (who are targeted with prices greater than the uniform
price) to weak consumers (who are charged less than the targeted price). Whether the re-allocation is
sufficient to increase total consumer surplus is an empirical question and depends on the curvature of
demand.
    We conduct an empirical case study of SPT to analyze its implications for firm profits and customer
well-being. We first develop a practical and scalable approach to implement targeted pricing for a firm
with access to a large cross-section of customer purchase data and detailed, customer-specific variables.
On the demand side, our approach is structural in the sense that we impose parametric structure on our
model to ensure the necessary smoothness in prices for implementing price optimization by the firm. We
assume that the heterogeneity in customers’ price sensitivities can be characterized by a sparse subset of
an observed, high-dimensional vector of observable customer characteristics. The firm’s empirical goal
consists of making statistical inferences about demand from heterogeneous customers, as opposed to
making inferences about specific underlying parameters associated with customer characteristics. Thus,
we cast our demand analysis as a heterogeneous treatment effects problem using price as a continuous
treatment variable.
    On the supply side, we use a Bayesian Decision-Theoretic formulation of the firm’s pricing problem
(Wald, 1950; Savage, 1954), defining the posterior expected profits as the reward function to account
for statistical uncertainty. We use a weighted likelihood bootstrap (WLB) of a l1 -regularized logistic
regression to approximate the firm’s statistical uncertainty about demand across customers with different
observable profiles. The WLB provides us with approximate draws from the appropriate posterior density
of the parameters of interest (Taddy, Gardner, Chen, and Draper, 2016). We use these draws to quantify
the uncertainty around the firm’s demand and profits under different pricing decisions.
    Our empirical application, based on a collaboration with Ziprecruiter.com, a large, online recruit-
ing firm, implements our proposed approach via a sequence of randomized controlled price experiments
for new customers. We use the experimental data to design, implement and evaluate a real-time, scal-
able business-to-business pricing algorithm that optimizes the price charged for each prospective new
customer that reaches the paywall on Ziprecruiter’s website. The analysis proceeds in three phases.
    To estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of price on demand, our first phase consisted of
a randomized controlled price experiment. During September 2015, the experiment randomly assigned
each new customer arriving at the website’s paywall to one of ten price buckets ranging from $19 to $399,
including a control condition of $99 which was the firm’s regular base price at that time. Descriptive
analysis of the data revealed (i) evidence for a downward-sloping demand relationship, (ii) that status

                                                    2
quo pricing of $99 was on the inelastic region of demand, and (iii) evidence supporting an opportunity
to raise prices profitably. Our model-free analysis of demand provides prima facie empirical evidence of
the downward-sloping demand relationship in the field. In this regard, we add to a small and growing
literature using firm-sanctioned field experiments to obtain plausible estimate of the treatment effect of
marketing variables on demand (see Einav and Levin 2010). The fact that Ziprecruiter has authorized us
to disclose its identity and the details of the underlying experiment also supports the growing importance
of transparency and disclosure when using firm-sponsored experiments for scientific research (see Einav
and Levin 2014).
     In Phase II, we used the experimental data to estimate (i.e. “train”) a demand model using the WLB
estimator to calibrate the price-response as a function of job and customer characteristics. Our model
estimates reveal a considerable degree of heterogeneity in willingness-to-pay. The in-sample targeted
prices that maximized the posterior expected profit from each customer ranged from as low as $142 to
as high as $499; but all the prices exceeded the status quo price of $994 . Based on our optimization, we
predicted posterior expected profit gains of 56% and 80% for our uniform and targeted pricing structures,
respectively, relative to Ziprecruiter’s status quo price of $99. Moreover, we predicted that our targeting
scheme would capture over 40% of the potential profitability from the theoretical benchmark of perfect
price discrimination.
     In Phase III, we implemented a second field experiment with a new sample of prospective new cus-
tomers to test the recommended pricing structures against its status quo of $99 per month. Typically,
researchers explore the potential counter-factual gains using simulations based on their model estimates.
Our second experiment provides a novel opportunity to test the performance of our microeconomic-
based counterfactuals out of sample (see also Misra and Nair 2011; Ostrovsky and Schwarz 20165 ). The
predicted uncertainty in conversion and profits were very close to the empirical distribution of “realized”
conversion and profits, providing an out-of-sample assessment of our WLB method. We also found a
close agreement between our predicted and realized implications for surplus. Relative to the status quo
of $99, we observed profit gains of 68% and 84% for uniform and targeted pricing, respectively. Sur-
prisingly, Ziprecruiter’s $99 price was considerably below the profit-maximizing uniform price. This
under-pricing is still dramatic even when we consider the impact on future profits and customer reten-
tion several months after the experiment. The implementation of SPT increases Ziprecruiter’s profits
by more than 10% relative to a uniform optimal price, indicating a strong economic incentive for the
implementation of differential pricing.
     On the demand side, we also used Phase III to analyze the impact of SPT on customer surplus. In
the targeting cell of our experiment, 67% of the customers are targeted a lower price than the optimal
uniform price. Even though we predict that total customer surplus falls by a small amount (less than 1%),

    4 Ziprecruiter   capped the targeted prices at $499.
    5 Misra and Nair (2011) test the performance of a more efficient incentives-based compensation scheme for sales agents in

a large firm, and Ostrovsky and Schwarz 2016 test the performance of optimally-derived reserve prices for Yahoo!’s sponsored
search auctions

the majority of customers benefit from SPT. Interestingly, the strong customers who are targeted higher
prices than the optimal uniform price nevertheless exhibit a higher conversion rate on average than weak
customers. As public policy advocates debate the “fairness” aspects of differential pricing, it is imporant
to note that many customers would be exluded from service under a uniform pricing policy. Moreover,
the typical strong customer tends to be a larger company with 20 employees (relative to 10 employees
for weak customers), suggesting that our targeting scheme redistributes surplus from larger to smaller
customers. Public policy might also benefit from a focus on the redistributive aspects of differential
pricing between customers.
    Our findings contribute to the empirical literature on third-degree price discrimination (see the sur-
vey by Verboven 2008). By running a price experiment, we avoid the typical price endogeneity concerns
associated with demand estimation. In the domain of digital marketing, Bauner (2015) and Einav, Far-
ronato, Levin, and Sundaresan (2017) argue that the co-existence of auctions and posted price formats on
eBay may be price discriminating between customer segments. Einav, Farronato, Levin, and Sundaresan
(2017) conclude that “richer econometric models of e-commerce that incorporate different forms of het-
erogeneity ... and might help rationalize different types of price discrimination would be a worthwhile
goal for future research.”
    Our work also contributes to the broad empirical literature on targeting across customers (e.g., Ansari
and Mela, 2003; Simester, Sun, and Tsitsiklis, 2006; Dong, Manchanda, and Chintagunta, 2009; Kumar,
Sriram, Luo, and Chintagunta, 2011). A small subset of this literature has analyzed personalized pricing
with different prices charged to each customer (e.g. Rossi, McCulloch, and Allenby 1996; Chintagunta,
Dubé, and Goh 2005; Zhang, Netzer, and Ansari 2014; Waldfogel 2015; Shiller 2015). Our work is
closest to Shiller (2015) who also uses machine learning to estimate heterogeneous demand. Most of this
research uses a retrospective analysis of detailed customer purchase histories to determine personalized
prices. These studies report large predicted profit improvements for firms. However, the implications for
targeted pricing are typically studied through model simulations based on demand estimates. In contrast,
we run field experiments, not only to estimate demand, but also to provide a field validation of the impact
on firm profits and customer well-being out of sample. The extant work’s findings and methods also have
limited applicability beyond markets for fast-moving consumer goods due to the limited availability of
customer purchase panels in most markets. In contrast, we devise a more broadly practical targeting
scheme based on observable customer features.
    Surprisingly, more practical approaches that, like SPT, target based on observable customer features
(as opposed to shopping histories) have been found to be of limited value. For example, Rossi, McCul-
loch, and Allenby (1996) conclude that “...it appears that demographic information is only of limited
value” for the targeting of prices of branded consumer goods. Similarly, Shiller and Waldfogel (2011)
claim that “Despite the large revenue enhancing effects of individually customized uniform prices, forms
of third degree price discrimination that might more feasibly be implemented produce only negligi-
ble revenue improvements.” In the internet domain, Shiller (2015) finds “...demographics alone to tailor
prices raises profits by 0.8% [at Netflix].” In sum, the extant literature has thus far found limited evidence

                                                      4
that firms would benefit from SPT. In contrast to past work on SPT, we find that targeting on observable
customer characteristics (without observing customer behavior) leads to substantial profit increases.
    Finally, our work is also related to the recent literature conducting inference when machine learning
algorithms are used to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (e.g., Wager and Athey, 2015; Cher-
nozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Duflo, Hansen, Newey, and Robins, 2016; Athey and Imbens, 2016a).
The extant literature has developed procedures for inference in the context of discrete (typically binary)
treatment effects. In contrast, our SPT structure requires conducting inference over the heterogeneous
effects of price, a continuous treatment, on customer demands.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we set up the prototypical decision-
theoretic formulation of monopoly price targeting based on demand estimation. In section 3, we derive
our empirical approach for estimating the demand parameters and quantifying uncertainty. We summa-
rize our empirical case study of targeted pricing at Ziprecruiter.com in section 4. We conclude in section
5.


2     A Model of Decision-Theoretic Monopoly Price Targeting
In this section, we outline the key elements of a data-based approach to monopoly targeted pricing. We
cast the firm’s pricing decision as a Bayesian statistical decision theory problem (e.g., Wald 1950; Sav-
age 1954; Berger 1985 and also see Hirano 2008 for a short overview along with Green and Frank 1966
and Bradlow, Lenk, Allenby, and Rossi 2004 for a discussion of Bayesian decision theory for marketing
problems). The firm trades off the opportunity costs from sub-optimal pricing and the statistical uncer-
tainty associated with sales and profits at different prices. We treat the firm’s uncertainty as statistical
knowledge about customers and demand. Bayes theorem provides the most appropriate manner for the
firm to use available data to update its beliefs about customers and make informed pricing decisions.
Failure to incorporate this uncertainty into pricing decisions could lead to bias, as we discuss below. We
also discuss herein the potential short-comings of a simpler approach that “plugs in” point estimates of
the uncertain quantities instead of using the full posterior distribution of beliefs. For an early applica-
tion of Bayesian decision theory to pricing strategy see Green (1963). For a more formal econometric
treatment of Bayesian decision-theoretic pricing that integrates consumer demand estimation, see Rossi,
McCulloch, and Allenby (1996); Dubé, Fang, Fong, and Luo (2017)6 .
    We start by describing the demand setup and defining the sources of statistical uncertainty regarding
customers and their demand. The demand model represents the firm’s prior beliefs about the customer.
On the supply side, we then define the firm’s information set about the customer. By combining the
firm’s prior beliefs (the demand model) and its information (the customer dat), we then define several
decision-theoretic (or “data-based”) optimal pricing problems for the firm.

                                                               5
2.1    Demand
On the demand side, we start with a relatively agnostic, multi-product derivation of demand to illustrate
the generalizability of our approach across a wide class of empirical demand settings. Consider a popu-
lation of i = 1, ...H customers. Each customer i chooses a consumption bundle q = (q1 , ..., qJ ) ∈ RJ+ to
maximize her utility as follows:

                                  q̄ (pi ; Ψi , εi ) = argmax U (q; Ψi , εi ) : p0i q 6 I
                                                             
                                                                                                                        (1)
                                                       q


where U (q; Ψi , εi ) is continuously differentiable, strictly quasi-concave and increasing in q, I is a budget,
pi = (pi1 , ..., qiJ ) ∈ RJ+ is the vector of prices charged to customer i, Ψi represents customer i0 s potentially
observable “type” (or preferences) and εi ∼ i.i.d. Fε (ε) is an i.i.d. random vector of unobserved, random
disturbances that are independent of Ψi .


2.2    Firm Beliefs and Pricing
Suppose a firm knows the form of demand, 1, and has prior beliefs about Ψi described by the density
 fΨ (Ψi ). Let D denote the customer database collected by the firm. We assume the firm uses Bayes Rule
to construct the data-based posterior belief about the customer’s type:

                                                             ` (D|Ψi ) fΨ (Ψi )
                                         fΨ (Ψi |D) = R                                                                 (2)
                                                           ` (D|Ψi ) fΨ (Ψi ) dΨi

where ` (D|Ψi ) is the log-likelihood induced by the demand model, 1 and the uncertainty in the random
disturbances, εi . Let FΨ (Ψi |D) denote the corresponding CDF of the posterior beliefs. Note that we
assume the firm does not update its beliefs Fε (ε) about the random disturbances, εi .
    Given the posterior FΨ (Ψi |D), the firm makes decision-theoretic, data-based pricing decisions. We
assume the firm is risk neutral and faces unit costs c = (c1 , ..., cJ ) for each of its products. For each
customer i, the firm anticipates the following posterior expected profits from charging prices pi :
                                                     Z Z
                             π (pi |D) = (pi − c)0         q̄ (p; Ψi , ε) dFε (ε) dFΨ (Ψi |D) .                         (3)

The firm’s optimal targeted prices for customer i, p∗i , must therefore satisfy the following first-order
necessary conditions:
                    Z Z                                           −1 Z Z
       p∗i   = c−          ∇ p q̄ (p∗i ; Ψi , ε) dFε (ε) dFΨ (Ψi |D)          q̄ (p∗i ; Ψi , ε) dFε (ε) dFΨ (Ψi |D) .   (4)

   Using the terminology from the literature on price discrimination (e.g. Tirole, 1988; Pigou, 1920),
we are technically implementing a form of third-degree price discrimination. In our model, the firm can
never learn εi even with repeated observations on the same customer (i.e. panel data). Therefore it will


                                                              6
never be possible for the firm to extract all of the customer surplus even when all the uncertainty in Ψi
is resolved. Unlike most practical implementations of third-degree price discrimination, however, our
proposed approach will potentially allow for customer-specific, or “personalized” pricing (e.g. Shapiro
and Varian, 1999; Shiller, 2015). In practice the pricing is not exactly personalized since customers with
the same posterior expected Ψi would be charged the same price even if they differ along unobserved
dimensions.
    Suppose the firm uses a uniform pricing strategy across all its H customers. The posterior expected
profit-maximizing uniform prices, p∗ , must satisfy the following first-order necessary conditions:
           "                                                         #−1
               H Z Z                                                        H Z Z
   ∗
  p = c−     ∑         ∇ p q̄ (p∗i ; Ψi , ε) dFε (ε) dFΨ (Ψi |D)           ∑          q̄ (p∗i ; Ψi , ε) dFε (ε) dFΨ (Ψi |D) . (5)
               i                                                            i

    The integration of the profit function over the firm’s posterior distribution of beliefs adds computa-
tional complexity. Consider a simpler “plug-in” approach that instead maximizes the profits evaluated
at point estimates of Ψ. For instance, consider the plug-in estimate of profits evaluated at the point
estimates Ψ̂i = E (Ψ|D):
                                     π pi |Ψ̂i = (pi − c)0 q̄ p; Ψ̂i , ε .

                                     p̃i = c − [∇ p q̄ ( p̃i ; Ψi , ε)]−1 q̄ ( p̃i ; Ψi , ε) .                               (7)

The price recommendation in equation 7 is computationally simpler to determine than those in 4 because
the former avoids the integration of the profit function over the entire posterior distribution. However, by
Jensen’s inequality, we also know that in general the plug-in approach is biased:
                                                          
                                                 π pi |Ψ̂i =6 π (pi |D) .

    This bias could mislead the manager’s assessment of uncertainty, leading to potentially sub-optimal
pricing rules if p̃i 6= p∗i . In our empirical case study below, we will analyze the extent of bias associated
with the plug-in approach.


2.3    Welfare
By revealed preference, monopoly SPT weakly increases the firm’s profits. The optimal targeted prices
in 4 could always accommodate charging every customer the uniform price in 5: p∗i = p∗ , ∀i.
    The impact of targeted prices on consumer surplus is less straightforward. Cowan (2012) proposes a
novel approach that interprets the shift from uniform prices, p∗ , to a targeted price, p∗i as an equivalent
change in marginal cost. Under targeted prices, the firm sets the price p∗i to equate the marginal revenue
from customer i with the marginal cost, c. Under the uniform price, the firm sets the price p∗ , which

                                                                7
generates marginal revenue MR   ¯ i from customer i. We can therefore think of the shift from p∗ to p∗i as
the equivalent change in price associated with a cost shift from c to MR   ¯ i : pi (MR
                                                                                      ¯ i ) versus pi (c) . This
interpretation of targeting as an equivalent cost shift enables the use of pass-through comparative statics,
as in Weyl and Fabinger (2011).
    Following Cowan (2012), we define the following pass-through condition whereby the price-elasticity
of demand is larger in magnitude than the curvature of the pass-through over the range from c to MR       ¯ i:

                                                                   p00i (k)
                                                 ηi,p > pi (k)            2                                             (8)
                                                                   p0i (k)

where pi (k) is the optimal price charged to consumer i at virtual cost k. When the pass-through condition
holds, the consumer surplus function CS (pi (k)) is convex in the virtual cost k. The change in total
consumer surplus can therefore be bounded:

                        ¯ i − c) p0i (c) q̄i (c) ≥ ∆CS ≥ ∑ (MR
                    ∑ (MR                                    ¯ i − c) p0i (MR
                                                                            ¯ i ) q̄i (pi (MR
                                                                                            ¯ i )) .                     (9)
                     i                                         i

For many demand models, including the one we study in section 4.1 below, the lower bound can be
positive, implying that consumer surplus can increase theoretically.


3     Empirical Approach
The execution of the firm’s data-based pricing strategies in equations 4 and 5 depends on the ability to
construct an estimate of the posterior distribution F (Ψi |D). The extant literature on price targeting has
developed non-linear panel data methods to estimate F (Ψi |D) using repeated purchase observations for
each customer panelist (e.g. Rossi, McCulloch, and Allenby 1996; Chintagunta, Dubé, and Goh 2005).
In practice, many firms may not have access to panel databases. In many business-to-business and e-
commerce settings, for instance, firms are more likely to have access to data for a broad cross-section of
customers, but not with repeated observations.7 We consider a scenario with cross-sectional customer
information that includes a detailed set of observable customer characteristics. Our approach consists of
using these characteristics to approximate Ψi .


3.1     Approximating Individual Types
Suppose we observe data
                                                  D = {(qi , xi , pi )}N
                                                                       i=1




    7 Ideal panel data would allow the firm estimate types using fixed effects estimators but there would remain the issue of
pricing to new customers which is our focus here.


                                                             8
for a sample of N customers, where qi ∈ RJ+ is a vector of purchase quantities, pi ∈ RJ+ are the prices
and xi ∈ RK is a vector of customer characteristics. We assume that xi is high-dimensional and fully
characterizes the preferences, Ψi . We consider the projection of the individual tastes, Ψi , onto xi :

                                               Ψi = Ψ (xi ; Θ0 )

where Θ0 is a vector of parameters. Note that for our pricing problem in section 2.2, above, we are not
interested in the interpretation of the arguments of the functionΨ (xi ; Θ) . So we could be agnostic with
our specification. For instance, we could represent the function Ψ (xi ; Θ) as a series expansion:
                                                          ∞
                                         Ψ (xi ; Θ0 ) =   ∑ θ0sψs (xi)
                                                          s=1

where {ψn (xi )}n≥0 is a set of orthonormal basis functions and Θn0 = (θ1 , ..., θn ) are the parameters for an
expansion of degree n. We are implicitly assuming that some sparse subset of the vector xi is informative
about Ψi and that we posses some methods to identify this sparse subset.
    We focus on applications where, potentially, K  N and Θn0 is relatively sparse. Even though
our approach consists of a form of third-degree price discrimination, in practice, it can capture very
rich patterns of heterogeneity. We assume the firm has a very high-dimensional direct signal about
demand, x. For instance, if the dimension of xi is K = 30, our approach would allow for as many as
2K = 1, 073, 741, 824 distinct customer types and, hence, targeted prices.


3.2    Approximating F (Ψi |D): The Weighted Likelihood Bootstrapped Lasso
With K  N, maximum likelihood is infeasible unless one has a theory to guide the choice of coefficients
to include or exclude. Even for large K and K  N, maximum likelihood could potentially produce bi-
ased estimates due to over-fitting. The literature on regularized regression provides numerous algorithms
for parameter selection with a high-dimensional parameter vector, Θ (e.g. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Fried-
man (2009)). Most of this literature is geared towards prediction. Our application requires us to quantify
the uncertainty around our estimated coefficient vector, Θ̂, and around various economic outcomes such
as price elasticities, firm profits and customer value, to implement decision-theoretic optimized pricing
structures. In addition, the approach must be fast enough for real-time demand forecasting and price
recommendations.
    To address these practicality concerns, we use an idea from Taddy, Gardner, Chen, and Draper (2016)
to approximate the posterior FΨ (Ψ|D) using a variant of the Bayesian Bootstrap (e.g. Rubin (1981);
Newton and Raftery (1994); Chamberlain and Imbens (2003); Efron (2012)). The approach generates
both a point estimate of Ψ and an approximate sample from the full posterior distribution FΨ (Ψ|D) .
The approach provides an approximation of the posterior distribution required for the decision-theoretic
pricing problem. In addition, the approach does not require large-sample approximations. Alternative


                                                      9
approaches using asymptotic approximations have been developed but are cumbersome to implement
and not easily scalable to the types of scenarios discussed in this paper.

3.2.1    The Bayesian Lasso

We start with our regularization procedure. Following Tibshirani (1996), suppose each model parameter,
Θ j , is assigned an i.i.d. Laplace prior with scale τ > 0: Θ j ∼ La (τ) where τ = Nλ . We can write the the
posterior distribution of Θ analytically:

                                                                          J
                                           FΘ (Θ|D) ∝ ` (D|Θ) − ∑ τ j |Θ j |                                             (10)
                                                                       j=1


where ` (D|Θ) is the log-likelihood of the demand data as before. This framework is termed the Bayesian
Lasso (Park and Casella 2008) on account of the Bayesian interpretation of the Lasso penalized objective
function. The MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimator that optimizes (10) can be shown to be equivalent
to the Lasso regression:
                                                         (                            )
                                                                              J
                                      Lasso
                                    Θ         = argmax ` (D|Θ) − Nλ           ∑ |Θ j |    .                              (11)
                                                 Θ∈RJ                         j=1

In Appendix A, we describe the path-of-one-step estimators procedure used to select λ and generate
estimates of Θ and its sparsity structure (see also Taddy (2015b)).

3.2.2    Quantifying Uncertainty

While the MAP estimator generates a point estimate of the posterior mode it does not offer a simple
way to calibrate the uncertainty in these estimates. Park and Casella (2008) propose a Gibbs sampler
for a fully Bayesian implementation of the Lasso, but the approach would not scale well to settings with
very large-dimensional xi 8 . Instead, we simulate the approximate posterior using a Weighted Likeli-
hood Bootstrap (WLB) of the Lasso problem. The Weighted Likelihood Bootstrap (Newton and Raftery
(1994)) is an extension of the Bayesian Bootstrap originally proposed by Rubin (1981).9 As discussed
in Efron (2012), the BB and the WLB are computationally simple alternatives to MCMC approaches. In
our context, the approach is scalable to settings with a large-dimensional parameter space, and is rela-
tively fast, making customer classification and price discrimination practical to implement in real time.
Conceptually, the approach consists of drawing weights associated with the observed data sample and

    8 Challenges include drawing from a large-dimensional distribution,     assessing convergence of the MCMC sampler, tuning
the algorithm and storing a non-sparse simulated chain in memory.
     9 To be clear, our implementation only uses the first stage of the WLB procedure described in Newton and Raftery (1994)

and does not implement the Sampling-Importance-Resampling (SIR) stage. Newton and Raftery (1994) show that the first
stage is sufficient to obtain a first order approximation of the posterior. We could also describe our implementation simply as
a variant of the Bayesian Bootstrap but we chose to call it the WLB to acknowledge the contribution of Newton and Raftery
(1994) who first outlined the possibility of recasting the Rubin (1981) framework of using the weighted likelihoods.


                                                             10
solving a weighted version of (11). The application of Lasso to each replication ensures a sparsity struc-
ture that facilitates the storage of the draws in memory. This is a promising approach to approximating
uncertainty in complex econometric models (see e.g. Chamberlain and Imbens (2003)).
    We construct a novel WLB type procedure to derive the posterior distribution of Θ̂|λ ∗ , F (Θ). Con-
sider our data sample D = (D1 , ..., DN ). We assume that the data-generating process for D is discrete
with support points (ζ1 , ..., ζL ) and corresponding probabilities φ = (φ1 , ..., φL ) : Pr (Di = ζl ) = φl . We
can allow L to be arbitrarily large to allow for flexibility in this representation. We assume the following
Dirichlet prior on the probabilities

                                                            L
                                           φ ∼ Dir (a) ∝ ∏ φlal −1 , al > 0.
                                                            l=1

   Following the convention in the literature, we use the improper prior distribution with al → 0. This
assumption implies that any support points, ζl , not observed in the data will have φl = 0 with posterior
probability one: Pr (φl = 0) = 1, ∀ζl ∈
                                      / D. This prior is equivalent to using the following independent
exponential prior: Vl ∼ Exp (1) where Vl = ∑Lk=1 φk φl .
   We can now write the posterior distribution of observing a given data point, D as follows

                                                N
                                       f (D) = ∑ Vi 1{D=ζi } , Vi ∼ i.i.d.Exp (1) .
                                               i=1

   The algorithm is implemented as follows. For each of the bootstrap replications b = 1, ..., B:
                                 N
   1. Draw weights: Vib

will use this sample to quantify the uncertainty associated with various functions of Ψi such as profits
and demand elasticities.

One useful interpretation of our proposed model would have us consider the Lasso penalization λ ∑Jj=1 |Θ j |
as well as the Dirichlet weighting ( f (D)) as components of our overall prior. Under this interpretation,
                                                                        B
the proposed sampling algorithm obtains approximate samples, Θ̂b b=1 , from the posterior of interest.
                                                                  

Accordingly, the framework is coherent from a Bayesian perspective in spite of the non-standard prior.
    Our proposed algorithm deals with two sources of uncertainty simultaneously. In particular, by re-
peatedly constructing weighted Lasso type estimators we are in effect integrating over the model space
spanned by the set of covariates. As such, our draws can also be used to construct posterior probabilities
associated with the set of covariates retained in the model. At the same time, the sampling procedure
also accounts for usual parameter uncertainty.
    The extant literature has often followed a two-step approach based on the oracle property of the
Lasso (Fan and Li, 2001; Zou, 2006). When the implementation of the LASSO is an oracle procedure,
it will select the correct sparsity structure for the model and will possess the optimal estimation rate.
Accordingly, in a first step we could use a Lasso to select the relevant model (i.e. the subset of relevant
x) and in a second step we could obtain parameter estimates after conditioning on this subset. We term
this procedure Post-Lasso-MLE and use it as a benchmark in later sections. The post-Lasso-MLE is
somewhat of a straw-man since several authors have already found poor small-sample properties for
such post-regularization estimators (e.g. Leeb and Potscher, 2008) that, effectively, ignore the model
uncertainty by placing a degenerate prior with infinite mass on the model selected by the first stage
Lasso.


4    Scalable Price Targeting at Ziprecruiter.com
We conduct a case study of targeted pricing at Ziprecruiter.com to illustrate the implementation of the
WLB estimator, the application to SPT and to validate our proposed approximation of the posterior of
Θ. The case study involves a sequence of two randomized controlled price experiment using a sample of
Ziprecruiter’s prospective enterprise customers. The data from the first experiment are used to train our
demand model and to produce price recommendations. A second experiment is then conducted using
a new sample of Ziprecruiter’s prospective enterprise customers to validate our recommended pricing
structures as well as our inference procedure.
    Ziprecruiter.com is an online firm that specializes in matching jobseekers to potential employees. The
firm caters to a variety of potential employers across various industries that subscribe to Ziprecruiter.com
to gain access to a stream of resumes of matched and qualified candidates from which they might be able
to recruit. These firms pay a monthly subscription rate that they can cancel at anytime. Job applicants can
use the Ziprecruiter.com platform for free. In a typical month in 2015, Ziprecruiter hosted job postings
for over 40,000 registered paying firms.
    Our analysis focuses on prospective customers who have reached the paywall at ziprecruiter.com for


                                                    12
the first time. Amongst all prospective customers, Ziprecruiter’s largest segment consists of the “starters,”
typically small firms with less than 50 employees, looking to fill between 1 and 3 jobs. Since starters
represent nearly 50% of the customer base, we focus our attention on prospective starter firms. Another
advantage of focusing on small customers is that they are unlikely to create externalities that would
warrant lower pricing. For instance, Ziprecruiter might want to target low prices to certain very large
recruiters in spite of high willingness-to-pay to create indirect network effects that stimulate demand
from the set of applicants submitting their resumes. At the beginning of this project the base rate for a
“starter” firm looking for candidates was $99/month.
    Each prospective new firm that registers for Ziprecruiter’s services navigates a series of pages on the
ziprecruiter.com website until they reach the paywall. At the paywall, they must use a credit card to pay
the subscription fee. Immediately before the request for credit card information, a firm is asked to input
details of the type of jobs they wish to fill as well as characteristics describing the firm itself. During
the registration process, the customer reports several characteristics of its business and the specific job
posting. Table 2 summarizes the variables we retained for our analysis from the much larger set of
registration features. While the set looks small, it generates 133 variables10 . After completing this
registration process, the customer reaches a paywall and receives a price quote. Ziprecruiter currently
uses a non-linear price schedule based on the number of months of service for which a new customer is
willing to pre-commit to service. The first row of Table 1 reports Ziprecruiter’s regular pricing schedule
used prior to the experimental period.


4.1    Empirical Model of Demand
In our case study of prospective customers that have reached Ziprecruiter’s paywall, demand consists
of a binary decision yi = 1 (if purchase) or 0 (if do not purchase). A customer i obtains the following
incremental utility from purchasing versus not purchasing

    For our analysis below, we use a linear specification of the functions α and β

                                                    α (xi ; θα ) = xi0 θα

However, in principle, one could use any arbitrary function of xi . We also assume that the random util-
ity disturbance εi is distributed i.i.d. logistic with scale parameter 1 and location parameter 0. These
assumptions give rise to the standard binary Logit choice probability

                                                                 exp ( p̃0i Ψi )

    Note that for our demand specification, the treatment effect of price on choice is continuous. In
most data-mining applications, variables are treated as categorical. Our structural approach, which will
involve optimizing the price on the supply side, motivates our use of a smooth and continuous price
effect.


4.2     Pricing
Suppose Ziprecruiter collects a database for a sample of N consumers, D = (D1 , ..., DN ), where Di =
(yi , xi , pi ). Suppose also that Ziprecruiter uses the WLB approach described in section 3.2 to estimate
the posterior beliefs about the demand parameters, FΨ (Ψi |D) . For SPT, we use the following contraction
mapping to enable the real-time calculation of customer-specific prices when a new customer reaches the
paywall at ziprecruiter.com11 . We start with an initial guess p0 and then iterate the following sequence

                                                     P pki ; Ψi FΨ (Ψi |D) dΨi

have optimization software integrated with its customer paywall.

4.3     Customer Surplus
We now revisit the lower bound on the change in consumer surplus when the firm switches from uniform
to SPT under our logit demand. We assume throughout that marginal cost is 0. First consider the case
where there are two customers and the firm has resolved all the uncertainty in the demand parameters so
that its posterior is degenerate at α (x) = (−0.9, 0.3)0 and β (x) = (−0.01, −0.011)0 . It is straightforward
in this case to show that the pass-through condition holds as long as the purchase probability is less than
0.5. The purchase probability is less than 0.3 for both consumers under both uniform pricing and SPT.
Moreover, the lower bound on ∆CS is 0.024 and, thus, total consumer surplus and total welfare increase.
In fact, consumer surplus increases by $0.038.
    Now suppose the firm faces uncertainty in the demand parameters. "     For#instance,
                                                                                  "      suppose the#!  uncer-
                                                                       αi (x)       1.e − 4       0

                                                                       βi (x)          0      1.e − 6
ensure that most of the posterior mass over β is negative we set the standard error to about 101th of the
value of the mean). In this case, we verify numerically that the pass-through condition holds over the
range of interest. The lower bound on ∆CS is 0.023 and, thus, total consumer surplus and total welfare
increase. In fact, consumer surplus increases by $0.034. These examples illustrate that, theoretically,
SPT can increase total consumer surplus for our framework.


4.4     Experiment One
The first phase of the case study consists of a price experiment to generate choice data with exogenous
price variation. The experiment was conducted between August 28, 2015 and September 29, 2015. Dur-
ing this period, 7,867 unique prospective customers reached Ziprecruiter’s paywall. Each prospective
customer was randomly assigned to one of ten experimental pricing cells. The control cell consisted of
Ziprecruiter’s standard pricing schedule, row one of Table 1. To construct our test cells, we changed
the monthly rate by some percentage amount relative to the control cell. The corresponding quarterly
and annual rates were computed by using the same percentage deviation from the control cell. Fol-
lowing Ziprecruiter’s practices, we then rounded up each rate to the nearest $9. The nine test cells are
summarized in rows two to ten of Table 1.

4.4.1   Model-free analysis

The results from the first stage experiment appear in Figure 1. As expected, we observe a statistically
significant, monotonically downward-sloping pattern of demand. Demand is considerably less price
elastic than Ziprecruiter’s current pricing would imply. A 100% increase in the price from $99 to $199
generates only a 25% decline in conversions. Given that most of Ziprecruiter’s services are automated


                                                     15
and it currently has enough capacity to increase its current customer base by an arbitrary amount, the
marginal cost per customer is close to $0. This means that Ziprecruiter is likely under-pricing its service.
    In practice, many firms are reluctant to run field experiments because of the opportunity costs of
testing a sub-optimal price (Anderson and Simester (2011)). Figure 2 plots Ziprecruiter’s monthly rev-
enues per customer at each tested price level. Interestingly, the experiment itself generated incremental
revenues for Ziprecruiter. By running the experiment, Ziprecruiter increased the average monthly rev-
enue per prospective customer by 14% relative to what it would have earned had it charged everyone
$99. The incremental profitability of the higher tested price levels more than offset the high conversion
at extremely small test price levels that are well below the control level of $99.
    Figure 2 visualizes Ziprecruiter’s pricing incentives. Along our grid of tested price levels, the average
monthly revenue per prospective customer is maximized $399. Although, once we take into account
statistical uncertainty, we cannot rule out that the revenue-maximizing price lies somewhere between
$249 and $399. Ziprecruiter could increase its monthly revenues from new customers by raising its
prices by more than 100%. However, the experiment alone may be insufficient to help Ziprecruiter
determine the optimal price increase. A model is ultimately needed to design the optimized pricing
structures.

4.4.2      Demand estimation

The second phase of the case study consists of using the choice data from the field experiment to estimate
the Logit demand model using our WLB estimator discussed in section 4.112 . The price experiment
avoids the usual concerns about price endogeneity that plague the demand estimation literature. During
the registration stage, our prospective customers provided responses on 12 categorical variables. We
break the different levels of these variables into 133 dummy variables, xi . We include the main effects of
these 133 dummy variables in the intercepts of our model, α, and the 133 interaction effects with price
in the slopes, β .13 For comparison, we also report results for the MLE estimates of a model including all
266 covariates, which we expect would suffer from over-fitting. In addition, we report results from the
unweighted Lasso penalized regression estimates with optimal penalty selected by cross-validation.14 .
    In Table 3, we report the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) associated with the MLE estimator
that includes all 266 coefficients and with the Lasso estimator. The BIC includes a penalty for the number

   12 We  use the gamlr function in the R package “gamlr” to implement the logistic Lasso at each iteration of our Bayesian
Bootstrap. We simulate the weighted Lasso procedure as follows. For each iteration, we draw a vector of weights for each
observation in our sample. We then draw a subsample by drawing with replacement from the original sample using our
weights. The logistic Lasso is then applied to this new subsample.
    13 These variables were chosen from larger set of over 120,000 covariates (including interactions) available to the firm.

This particular subset was relevant to the subset of customers involved in the experiment. The methods proposed herein scale
well with larger sets - we have implemented a version for the firm with the complete set of covariates. Others have had success
with the general approach, e.g. Taddy (2015a) successfully implements the approach in a distributed computing environment
for applications with thousands of potential covariates.
    14 The Lasso algorithm can easily accommodate much larger dimensions in a distributed computing environment. For

instance, Taddy (2015a) presents a case study with 11,940 attribute dimensions.


                                                             16
of model parameters. We also report the range of BIC values across the 100 bootstrap replications of
the Lasso estimator used for constructing our Bayesian Bootstrap estimate of the posterior, F (Θ) . As
expected, the switch from MLE to Lasso improves the in-sample BIC considerably: 10,018 versus 8,366.
This improvement suggests over-fitting with the MLE. Across our 100 bootstrap replications, our WLB
estimator produces a range of BIC values from 7,805 to 8,940.
    To see the important role of both variable selection and model uncertainty, note that across the 100
bootstrap replications, we retain as few as 58 to as many as 188 variables in the active set. 172 of the
parameters have more than a 50% posterior probability of being non-zero. If we look at the 6 parameters
with a more than 90% posterior probability of being non-zero, these include diverse factors such as
“price”, “job in British Columbia”, “company type: staffing agency,” “employment type: full_time” and
“is resume required.” There is no a priori “obvious” candidate types of variables that emerge suggesting
that the variable selection is important.
    As an additional verification, we also examine the out-of-sample fit of each of our estimators. We
randomly sample 90% of the firms (with replacement) from the original 7,866 as a training sample. The
remaining 10% of firms are held out as a prediction sample. The second column of Table 3 reports
the out-of-sample fit for each estimator. Once again, the entire range of BIC values from the WLB is
below the BIC of the MLE. These findings are consistent with our concern that MLE may suffer from
over-fitting, generating potentially less reliable estimates of the firm’s posterior uncertainty.

4.4.3      Price Optimization

We now use our demand estimates to calibrate Ziprecruiter’s decision-theoretic price optimization prob-
lem. Since we do not impose any restrictions on the range of parameter values, we cannot rule out the
possibility of positive price coefficients or excessively large willingness-to-pay, two issues that could
interfere with the optimization. During the price optimization procedures, we drop any draws for which
β̂ (x) ≥ 0 or α̂(x) ≥ 200015 . A summary of the various pricing scenarios analyzed is provided in Table 4.
               β̂ (x)
     We begin with an analysis of optimal uniform pricing. At the current price of $99, the posterior
expected own-price elasticity of demand is only -0.36 with a 90% posterior credibility interval of (-0.43,-
0.3). Consistent with our model-free analysis above, Ziprecruiter.com is pricing on the inelastic region
of demand. Optimal pricing for an information good like Ziprecruiter would be set at the unit-elastic
point of demand. Recall from Figure 2 that the revenue-maximizing price appears to lie between $249
and $399. We can rule out $399 as being too high since there is close to a 100% posterior probability
that the own-elasticity is well above -1 at that point. At a price of $249, the posterior expected own-price
elasticity is -0.91 and the 90% posterior credibility interval is (-1.09,-0.74). Therefore, we cannot rule
out the probability that this price maximizes expected revenues. More formally, the optimized uniform
price, as defined in equation 5, is $280.52. Figure 4 displays Ziprecruiter’s posterior expected revenue
function under uniform pricing. The plot visualizes that Ziprecruiter is currently underpricing its service

  15 In   total, we only drop 6% of the posterior draws across Ψbi for all i = 1, ..., N and b = 1, ..., B..


                                                                  17
by nearly 63%, when charging $99 instead of $280.53.
    An important component of the decision-theoretic approach consists of the integration of profits over
the firm’s posterior distribution FΨ (Ψ|D) . As explained in section 2.2, a simpler plug-in approach will
be biased towards lower profitability, possibly leading to under-pricing. The plug-in approach produces
a recommended price of $241. If we compute the posterior profits at a price of $241, the range is not
very different from the range in posterior profits at our WLB-based optimized price of $281. There is
nevertheless a 96% posterior probability that $281 is more profitable than $241.
    In fact, Ziprecruiter subsequently decided to implement a uniform price of $249 instead of $281.
Taking into account the parameter uncertainty, there is a 96% probability that the $218 price is more
profitable than the $249 price. But, Table 4 indicates that the two prices produce very similar ranges of
posterior profits at the 95% credibility level. Ziprecruiter concluded that $249 was a more conservative
recommendation.
    We now explore targeted pricing. Figure 3 summarizes the estimates of heterogeneity. In panel (a),
we report the distribution of customers’ posterior mean price sensitivities16

                                                             1 R

The dispersion across customers suggests a potential opportunity for Ziprecruiter to price discriminate.
In panel (b), we report the distribution of customers’ posterior mean surplus when Ziprecruiter prices its
monthly service at $99:
                                                                                      

The measure of surplus measures the dollar value created to a customer by the availability of Ziprecruiter’s
service (versus only the no-purchase option). Panel (b) illustrates the wide dispersion in value consumers
derive from the availability of Ziprecruiter when it costs $99. The 2.5th percentile, median and 97.5th
percentile customers derive $20.49, $74.84 and $280.95 in surplus respectively. The magnitudes and
degree of dispersion in value indicate an opportunity for Ziprecruiter to target different prices across
customers reflecting differences in the value they derive from the service.
    Figure 5 summarizes the targeted pricing results. Ziprecruiter wanted to ensure that the targeted
prices seemed natural to customers and also did not create a back-lash. Hence, they rounded all the
targeted prices down to the closest $9. For instance, a targeted price of $251 would be rounded down to
$249. They also capped the prices at $499. We use our demand estimates to assess the predicted per-
formance of this scheme for our September 2015 customer sample. We observe considerable dispersion
   16 For each customer, we drop positive draws, i.e. we do not average over draws r where xi βˆr < 0. This trimming is
important for the pricing analysis since positive support of the price sensitivity will lead to unbounded pricing. Across our
entire sample of customers, we end up dropping only 4.5% of the draws. Without trimming, only 15 of our 7,867 customers
would have a positive posterior mean price sensitivity (about 0.19% of our sample).


                                                             18
in the targeted prices, ranging from as low as $119 to as high as $499. The upper bound of $499 binds
for 455 of our customers, or 5% of the sample. All of the targeted prices are strictly larger than the
$99 baseline price. Interestingly, the mean targeted price, $272.95, is almost identical to the optimized
uniform price, $280.57. Figure 6 plots the relationship between the estimated price sensitivity of each
customer and the corresponding targeted price. As expected, we observe a strong positive correlation
between the targeted prices are the price sensitivities. In Table 4, we compare the profits for the Imple-
mented Targeting scheme and the theoretical Targeting scheme without any rounding or capping. The
Implemented Targeting scheme While there is a 95% posterior probability that the unrestricted Targeted
prices are more profitable than the Implemented Targeted prices, the expected profit difference is only
about 4%. Ziprecruiter concluded that this small difference justified the simplicity of the implemented
scheme.
    Once again, we can compare our decision-theoretic price recommendations to a plug-in approach.
Figure 7 displays the density of targeted prices using our decision-theoretic approach and the WLB char-
acterization of uncertainty. The figure also displays the targeted prices using the plug-in approach. As
expected, the distribution of prices is shifted to the left using the plug-in estimator, which (by Jensen’s
Inequality) under-estimates the posterior profitability at any given price. There is a 99% posterior proba-
bility that our WLB-based targeted prices generate higher overall profits than the plug-in based targeted
prices. In spite of this bias, all of the prices are strictly greater than $99.
    We now compare the expected posterior profits per customer from our various pricing structures. The
posterior mean profits from the implemented uniform price of $249 and the implemented targeted prices
are 56% higher and 71% higher respectively than the profits under the control monthly price level of
$99. Taking into account our posterior statistical uncertainty around the parameter estimates, there is
a more than 99% posterior probability that baseline profits are lower than uniform and targeted profits,
respectively. In the next section, we discuss the follow-up experiment to test the relative profitability of
these three pricing structures.
    Based on conversations with Ziprecruiter management, we also do not expect any competitive re-
sponse from other platforms. Since our recommendations involve raising prices, mitigating any concerns
about triggering a price war. Furthermore, pricing is not transparent in this industry since prices are not
posted in a public manner. At Ziprecruiter, for instance, a firm must complete the registration process
to obtain a price quote. Since our targeting is based on a complex array of customer characteristics, it
also seems unlikely that our SPT structure would lead to unintended strategic behavior by Ziprecruiter’s
customers (e.g., (Fudenberg and Villas-Boas, 2006; Chen, Li, and Sun, 2015)). Moreover, customers
need to report their registration characteristics truthfully to ensure that Ziprecruiter’s matching algorithm
identifies the most appropriate CVs for recruiting purposes.

4.4.4   Lifetime Value of the Customer

Our analysis of the September 2015 sample was based on myopic pricing geared towards instantaneous
profits. A potential concern is that raising the price not only lowers current conversion, it may also lower
long-term retention, thereby lowering long-term profitability. We now consider the a longer four-month
horizon to accomodate the renewal behavior for each starter firm up to the end of December 2015.
     Figure 8 reports the expected net present value of profits in September over a 4-month horizon. The
top panel assumes a discount factor of δ = 0 and corresponds to our static analysis from the previous
subsection. The bottom panel assumes a discount factor of δ = 0.996 and assumes a monthly interest rate
of 0.4% (or an annual interest rate of 5%). While the net present value of profits is much higher in each
cell under δ = 0.996, our ranking of prices is quite similar. To understand this finding, it is helpful to
look at both the initial conversion rate along with the retention rates. In Table 5, we report the acquisition
and retention rates for each of the experimental price cells. As expected, conversion and retention both
fall in the higher-price cells. However, survival rates are still low enough that the profit implications in
the first month overwhelm the expected future profits from surviving customers. As a result, the optimal
Uniform price does not look much different from the myopic (one-month-horizon) case.

4.4.5   Degree of Targetability

As explained above, our proposed targeting scheme is imperfect in the sense that we cannot estimate a
prospective customer’s logistically-distributed idiosyncratic utility shock, ε, as in equation 12. There-
fore, our targeted pricing structure, while granular, is a form of third-degree price discrimination. Any
set of customers with the same observable traits, x, would all be targeted the same price. We now assess
our targeting scheme by comparing it to the theoretical benchmark of perfect price discrimination, or
first-degree price discrimination.
     Suppose the firm was able to estimate each customer’s utility shock, ε. Customer i’s maximum
willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Ziprecruiter service is

                                                      (α (xi ) + ε)
                                           W T Pi =                 .                                    (16)
                                                         β (xi )

Under perfect price discrimination, the firm would set the targeted price

                                           pPD
                                            i = max (W T Pi , 0)


and consumer i would deterministically buy as long as W T Pi ≥ 0.
   Since the researcher (unlike the firm in this case) does not observe ε, the expected probability that a




                                                      20
consumer with preferences (α, β ) would purchase at the perfect price discrimination price is

                                Pr buy|p, = pPD α, β
                                                       
                                                           = Pr (W T P ≥ 0)
                                                                     1                                 (17)
                                                           = 1 − 1+exp(α) .

The corresponding expected profit from this consumer is

                  π pPD |α, β       = E (W T P|W T P ≥ 0, α, β ) Pr buy|p = pPD α, β .
                                                                                   
                                                                                                       (18)

In Appendix B, we show that
                                                                                       
                  E (W T P|W T P > 0, α, β ) =     α
                                                   β   + β1 −α + [1+exp(α)]ln[1+exp(α)]
                                                                        exp(α)            .

    We can now assess how well our proposed targeting scheme performs relative to the theoretical
benchmark of perfect price discrimination. In the final row of Table 4, we report the results if the firm
was able to price discriminate. The expected conversion, equation 17, increases considerably, more
than double the rate under targeted pricing, since every consumer with a positive W T P would buy. The
expected profit per lead, equation 18, also increases considerably to $98.58. Nevertheless, our proposed
targeting scheme is expected to generate 46% of the potential profits under perfect price discrimination.
There is a 90% posterior probability that our proposed targeting structure could generate as much as 55%
of the profits under perfect price discrimination. These profit differences are visualized in Figure 9 where
we plot the posterior CDF of profits in our control, Implemented Uniform and Implemented Targeting
pricing structures respectively. In sum, targeting on the observed customer features at the registration
stage explain almost half of the customer willingness-to-pay according to our model estimates.


4.5    Experiment Two
The third phase consisted of a second price experiment to validate the price recommendations out of
sample and to validate the approximate inference procedure. The experiment was conducted between
October 27, 2015 and November 17, 2015 using a new sample of prospective customers that arrived to
the ziprecruiter.com paywall during this period and had not previously paid for the firm’s services. Each
prospective customer during this period was randomly assigned to one of the three following pricing
structures:

   1. Control pricing – $99 (25%)

   2. Uniform pricing – $249 (25%)

   3. Targeted pricing (50%).

We over-sampled the targeted pricing cell to obtain more precision given the dispersion in prices charged
across customers. For our optimal uniform pricing cell, all customers were charged a monthly rate of

                                                    21
$249. This price was chosen given the fact that (i) the profit implications relative to the optimum were
minimal and (ii) the management believed that $249 would be more palatable on account of similar
prices being used elsewhere in the industry. For our targeted pricing cell, customers were targeted a
price based on the values of xi they reported during the registration stage. As explained in the previous
section, we then rounded the targeted price down to the nearest $9, discretizing the targeted prices into
$10 buckets ranging from $119 to $499. For instance, a customer with a targeted price of $183 would be
charged $179.
    During this period, 12,381 prospective customers reached Ziprecruiter’s paywall. Of these prospec-
tives, 5,315 were starters and the remainder were larger firms. Amongst our starters in the November
2015 study, 26% were assigned to control pricing, 27% to the uniform pricing and 47% to the targeted
pricing. In the targeting cell, the lowest targeted price was $99 and, hence, neither of our test cells ever
charged a prospective customer less than the baseline price of $99.
    To verify that our three experimental cells are balanced, we compare the targeted prices that would
have been used had we implemented our targeting method in each cell. Figure 10 reports the density
of targeted prices in each cell. The three densities are qualitatively similar, indicating that the nature of
heterogeneity and willingness-to-pay is comparable in each cell. This comparison provides a compelling
test for the balance of our randomization as it indicates that our distribution of targeted prices would look
the same across each of the experimental cells.

4.5.1   Model-free analysis

We begin by comparing the realized conversion and subscription revenue across our three pricing struc-
tures, control ($99), Optimal Uniform ($249) and SPT. To account for sampling error in our analysis, we
bootstrap our sample 1,000 times (sampling with replacement).
    Results are summarized in Table 6. As expected, average conversion is higher in the control cell
which has the lowest monthly price. Average conversion is almost identical in the uniform and targeted
cells, at 15%. However, the average profit per customer is higher in the targeted cell, as one would
theoretically expect. Overall, the uniform pricing increases expected profits per customer by 67.74%
relative to control pricing; although our bootstrapped confidence interval admits a change as low as
46%. Targeted pricing increases expected profits by 84.4% relative to control pricing; although our
bootstrapped confidence interval admits a change as low as 64%. These improvements from targeting
exceed our predictions based on the September sample discussed above in section 4.4.3. Finally, although
not reported, our bootstrap generates an 87% probability that targeted profits will exceed uniform profits.
These profit differences are visualized in Figure 11 where we plot the posterior CDF of profits in our
control, Uniform and Targeted pricing structures respectively. The CDF is computed using our bootstrap
draws of the mean profits per customer. Although not reported in the table, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
easily rejects the hypothesis of identical profit distributions for control and uniform (p < 0.01) and of
identical profit distributions for uniform and targeted (p < .01).


                                                     22
    In sum, the November experiment demonstrates the large, permanent increase in profitability achiev-
able by optimized prices and, moreover, by targeting different prices across customers based on their
identifiable traits at the registration stage. The targeting scenario performs even better than we had pre-
dicted based on our September sample.

4.5.2   Customer Welfare

To analyze the impact of SPT on customer surplus, we focus on the 2,485 customers assigned to the
targeting cell. Using the model estimates, we use (9) to compute the bounds on the change in consumer
surplus associated with switching from the optimal uniform price ($281) to the optimized targeted prices.
Over 98% of the customers satisfy the pass-through condition in (8). We obtain an upper bound of -$3.39
and hence customer surplus is predicted to fall for this sample of customers.
    Another advantage of our November experiment is that we can analyze the “actual” behavior of
targeted customers. Recall that customers were in fact charged a simplified version of the targeted
prices, rounded as explained above. Even though total surplus is predicted to fall, 67% of the prices
targeted to these customers are lower than the optimal uniform price. Therefore, SPT strictly benefits the
majority of the customers. Furthermore, total predicted conversion increases by close to 1%, meaning
that more of the market will likely be covered under SPT. Figure 13 reports the total surplus across all
customers assigned to each targeted price cell. As a comparison, we also report the total surplus for
those customers had they instead been charged the optimal uniform price. The figure indicates that a
small group of customers with very high willingness-to-pay ($499 or above) are subsidizing the majority
of customers who are targeted a price less than the uniform rate.
    In Figure 14, we look at the realized conversion rate in each cell. In spite of the fact that strong cus-
tomers subsidize weak customers, the realized conversion rate is actually higher for the strong customers
(16.54%) than for the weak customers (13.9%). Moreover, for the extreme strong customers targeted a
price of $499, conversion is higher than in any of the weak customer cells, even though most of the latter
are charged prices that are less than half of $499.
    Interestingly, there is no a priori obvious type of variable that drives the differences in targeted
prices. As an exploratory exercise, we correlate the 133 non-price registration features with an indicator
for whether each of the 2,485 firms is charged a targeted price lower than the optimal uniform price.
The features “Company Type: Small” and “Employment Type: part time” both correlate positively with
being targeted prices lower than uniform (correlations of 0.22 and 0.23 respectively). The median strong
customer, a firm targeted a higher price than the optimal uniform price, has 20 employees. In contrast,
the median weak customer, a firm targeted a lower price than the optimal uniform price, has only 10
employees. Overall, there is an observed association between smaller firms and being targeted a relatively
low price. Interestingly, several of the features related to job benefits are strongly negatively correlated
with being targeted prices below uniform: “job total benefits,” “job medical benefit,” “job vision benefit”
and “job dental benefit” (with correlations of -0.48, -0.44, -0.40 and -0.44 respectively). These diverse


                                                     23
findings suggest an important role for variable selection in determining which of the 133 registration
features is best-suited to price targeting.


4.6   Validation of the Proposed Inference Procedure
We now compare the predictions and sampling properties from our WLB estimates and the realized
outcomes from the November data. These comparisons allow us to judge how well our proposed WLB
approach worked. Since the sample of prospective customers changes in November 2015, we apply
the WLB estimates obtained from the September 2015 sample to predict the purchase behavior for the
November 2015 sample. Table 7 summarizes our predictions for conversion and profits per customer.
The profit predictions are comparable to our predictions from the end of September (see Table 4). The
posterior mean conversions do not differ by more than 1 percentage point across cells. The posterior
mean profits never differ by more than $1 across cells. Most important, our posterior credibility intervals
on profits are very similar, suggesting that the population of prospective customers in November is not
too different from the training sample in September.
    By comparing Table 7 and Table 6, we can evaluate the properties of our inference approach. The
realized mean profits per customer in each of the three cells (Table 6) falls within the predicted 95%
credibility intervals for each of the cells (7). The predicted mean conversion rates are also very close to
the realized mean conversion rates and fall within the predicted 95% credibility intervals. In sum, the
WLB inference approach appears to have produced reliable predictions regarding both conversion and
profits in each of the cells.
    In Figure 12, we compare the empirical distribution of the realized conversion rates in each of the
November pricing structure test cells to the predicted distribution using WLB, post-Lasso MLE and
MLE respectively. As described earlier, the post-Lasso MLE follows a two-step approach - the first step
implements a Lasso to select the relevant model (i.e. the subset of relevant x) and in a second step obtain
parameter estimates after conditioning on this identified subset. The MLE estimator simply uses all
available covariates (feasible for the current problem). All confidence intervals for these methods rely on
standard Bootstraps. Each panel compares the densities of conversion for each of our compared methods
in a given pricing cell. For SPT, we report densities for 6 of the 39 price tiers. The density of realized
conversion rates is computed by bootstrapping with replacement from the November data in a given cell.
    The figures indicate a relatively good match between our approximate posterior using WLB and the
actual observed data. In contrast, the post-Lasso MLE approach predicts considerably less uncertainty
than our WLB approach. The post-Lasso MLE would likely lead to managerial over-confidence when
compared to the actual conversion rates, which exhibit much more variation. This overconfidence is
particularly striking under SPT, where we have much smaller samples for each of the targeted price
tiers. Furthermore, comparing to the actual mean conversion, the mean conversion under post-Lasso
MLE is systematically less accurate than for the WLB. The figure illustrated additional out-of-sample
performance for our WLB procedure.


                                                    24
    In each of the three panels, we also report the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure for (1) WLB rel-
ative to the true distribution (DKL (true||W LD)), and (2) post-Lasso MLE relative to the true distribution
(DKL (true||post − Lasso MLE)). The KLD
                                                                
                                                           a (Θ)
                                                  Z
                                   DKL (A||B) = a (θ ) log         ,
                                                Θ          b (Θ)

where a and b denote the densities of A and B respectively, measures the amount of information lost when
distribution B is used to approximate distribution A. We find that the KLD is considerably higher for post-
Lasso MLE than for WLB, suggesting that WLB is a much better approximation of the true distribution
of conversion. Across each of the panels, the percentage difference between the KLD for post-Lasso
MLE and for WLB ranges from 50% to 746%. Perhaps not surprisingly, the largest improvements for
WLB arise in the control and uniform pricing cells where we have more observations per cell.
    The relatively poor performance of post-Lasso MLE reveals the important roles of both variable se-
lection and model uncertainty. Even when we take the best features from the Lasso, the corresponding
MLE still performs worse than WLB both on prediction and uncertainty quantification. Although not
reported herein, a naive approach that includes all the features in the MLE leads to considerably worse
prediction and uncertainty quantification. These findings indicate that price targeting based on registra-
tion features is a big data problem for Ziprecruiter.


5    Conclusions
A long theoretical literature has studied the potential profit improvements associated with monopoly
price discrimination. However, only recently have academics and practitioners begun to recognize the
practicality of more granular personalized price discrimination structures using big data, or SPT. Not
surprisingly, there is still a lot of uncertainty about the impact of such practices on firm profits and
customer well-being. Our field experiments provide some preliminary evidence on the practicality and
implications of SPT. The algorithm is fast and sufficiently scalable to accommodate a large number of
customer features. We find that SPT increases profits by over 10% relative to optimized uniform pricing,
both in and out of sample. In fact, relative to Ziprecruiter’s historic price of $99 per month, SPT increases
profits by over 80%. We also find that the proposed algorithm does a reasonable job accounting for the
statistical uncertainty in demand.
     A surprising finding in the field experiments is that Ziprecruiter had previously been under-pricing
its monthly service by almost 65%. Even when we assess the optimal uniform price over a horizon of
several months, accounting for customer acquisition and retention, we still find that Ziprecruiter increases
its profits dramatically by a large price increase. The evidence is consistent with our conversations with
Ziprecruiter’s management team, which had devoted considerable human capital to the development of
the platform and the technology, but not to the optimization of revenues.


                                                      25
    Turning to the demand side, our model estimates predict that total customer surplus decreases slightly
(under 1%) under SPT relative to optimal uniform pricing. However, the majority of customers are in
fact targeted prices that are below the optimal uniform rate. In sum, the redistributive aspects of SPT
cause the majority of customers to benefit. Current public debate surrounding the fairness of differential
pricing needs to consider these redistributive aspects of SPT.
    Our results are based on a single case study of a large digital human resources platform. The gener-
alizability of our findings may be limited beyond settings where, like ours, consumers are unlikely to be
able to game the targeting structure. We assume that customers are irrational in the sense that they do not
attempt to misrepresent their “types” to obtain lower prices (e.g., Acquisti and Varian, 2005; Fudenberg
and Villas-Boas, 2006). Our findings also do not consider the potential role of longer-term customer
backlash based on fairness concerns regarding differential pricing, which could lead to more price elastic
demand in the long run under SPT. This type of backlash might be more problematic in a consumers
goods market where targeted pricing may be more transparent and less accepted17 . Finally, our findings
focus on the monopoly price discrimination problem for Ziprecruiter.com. We do not consider the impact
of SPT in a competitive market, which could lead to a toughening or softening of price competition18 .
    In addition to our substantive evidence, we have also developed a Bayesian Decision Theoretic scal-
able price targeting method that can accommodate large-dimensional, observable heterogeneity. The
approach bridges basic microeconomic principles with machine learning in a manner that is practical
and scalable. The approach is potentially generalizable to more complex demand environments with
multiple products and non-discrete-choice. An interesting extension would be the application of the
method to an oligopolistic setting in which the firm not only faces uncertainty about demand, it also
faces uncertainty about its rival’s likely actions.
    In this paper, we approximate the posterior distribution of demand using a weighted likelihood boot-
strap of the lasso estimator. Subsequent to our analysis, new research has emerged with formal results on
the sampling properties of similar machine-learning estimators applied to settings with high-dimensional
observed heterogeneity with discrete treatments (Athey and Imbens, 2016b,a) and, more recently, with
continuous treatments (Hansen, Kozbur, and Misra, 2017). We believe this to be a fertile area for future
work on both the theoretical and applied fronts.

where λ > 0 controls the overall penalty and |Θ j | is the L1 coefficient cost function. Note that as λ → 0,
we approach the standard maximum likelihood estimator. For λ > 0, we derive simpler “regularized”
models with low (or zero) weight assigned to many of the coefficients. Since the ideal λ is unknown a
                                               λ
priori, we derive a regularization path, Θ̂|λ λT=λ , consisting of a sequence of estimates of Θ corre-

                                                     1
sponding to successively lower degrees of penalization. Following Taddy (2015b), we use the following
algorithm to construct the path:
                
    1. λ1 = in f λ : Θ̂|λ1 = 0

    2. set step size of δ ∈ (0, 1)

                                     ω j = |Θ j |       , j ∈ Ŝt
                                                    n                            o
                                     Θ̂t = argmin ` (Θ) + N ∑Jj=1 λ t ω tj |Θ j | .
                                               Θ∈RJ

The algorithm produces a weighted-L1 regularization, with weights ω j . The concavity ensures that the
weight on the penalty on Θ̂tj falls with the magnitude of |Θ̂tj |. As a result, coefficients with large values
earlier in the path will be less biased towards zero later in the path. This bias diminishes faster with
larger values of γ.
    The algorithm in 20 above generates a path of estimates corresponding to different levels of penaliza-
tion, λ . We use K-fold cross-validation to select the “optimal” penalty, λ ∗ . We implement the approach
using the cv.gamlr function from the gamlr package in R.
