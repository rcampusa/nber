       Asset Markets, Tariffs, and Political Risk


                          ABSTRACT



     The paper examines a simple model in which exogenous

political risk creates uncertainty about tariffs. The model

predicts a relation between consumption and tariffs that

differs radically from that implied by models without asset

markets or political risk. Given the probability distribution

of tariffs, domestic consumption and utility (ex post) are

lower in states of the world with a domestic tariff and no

foreign tariff than with a foreign tariff and no domestic tariff.

This conclusion emerges despite the fact that the opposite

would be obtained in the absence of asset markets. So economists

should not be surprised if observed relations between consumption

and tariffs differ from the predictions of static theory in

either time—series or cross—sections.

I.   Introduction

       The theory of protection has been developed in nonstochastic models

without international asset trade. Extensions of the theory of international

trade to encompass uncertainty have focused primarily on stochastic

technologies or stochastic prices faced by a small economy. Helpman and Razin

(1978) and Pomery (1984) survey and develop some of these models. However,

little work has been done on the effects of uncertainty that results from the

political process, even though that process is often thought to be an

important source of uncertainty. Political risk has been cited, for example,

as a reason for segmentation of international capital markets (see the survey

by Adler and Dumas, 1983) and as an important factor affecting international

direct investment.

       This paper examines a simple model in which exogenous political risk

creates uncertainty about tariffs. We focus on the effects of this risk on

optimal portfolio allocation, and the implications of asset market trade for

resource allocation and ex post consumption and utility. We show that in a

world with political risk, a tariff that increases consumption when no assets

can be traded decreases ex post consumption and utility in the presence of

complete asset markets.      We present a model of a two-country world with

exogenous, random tariffs.      Households trade in asset markets, and choose

optimal protfolios that depend on the stochastic properties of these random

government policies.     We show that, given the probability distribution of
                                                                                  2

tariffs,    domestic consumption and utility are lower in states of the world

with a domestic tariff than in states with a foreign tariff.            In fact,

domestic consumption in states with a foreign tariff is higher than that with

no tariffs. Our model, therefore, predicts a relationship between consumption

and tariffs that differs radically from the relations implied by models that

ignore asset markets.


II. A simple Random Tariffs Model

        Consider a world of 2 countries, 2 goods that are endowments to the
countries, and 4 states of the world.     In state of the world 0, there are no

tariffs. In state of the world 1, the domestic country imposes a tariff at

rate t.     In state 2, the foreign (but not the domestic) country imposes a

tariff at the same rate t.      In state of the world 3, both countries impose

tariffs at rate 't.   Assume that all tariff revenues are refunded to consumers

in the country imposing the tariff, in a lump-sum manner. Assume that states

1 and 2 have equal probabilities, and denote the probability of any state by

        Call the two goods X and Y. Let X and Y denote endowments of X and Y in

the home country.     Let     and Y denote foreign endowments, and assume that

X = Y      and Y X, and that      is sufficiently large relative to V    that   the

home country will always be an exporter of X and an importer of Y, in the

cases discussed here. We interpret the random tariffs as resulting from

uncertainty in the political process.

         Assume that there is a representative consumer in each country and that

tastes are identical across countries. Trade occurs because of different

endowments. Moreover, assume that the function U(x,y)      U(y,x), for all x,y,

and that U12 = 0.       Let the representative consumer choose his holdings of

Arrow-Debreu securities (claims to a unit of good i in state j)   to   maximize
                                                                                                  3

foreign consumption of X, y. foreign consumption of Y, p. the relative price

of X in state i in terms of X in state 0, q. the relative price of Y in state

I in terms of Y in state 0, and a bar over a variable in parentheses indicates

that this stands for an aggregate value of a variable, taken as given by the

individual in his utility-maximization. The interpretation of (2) and (3) is

easy. Consider (2). The first term on the right-hand-side shows the value of

exports of X in state i (measured in units of X in state 0) added together.

These exports are just the state-dependent payments that a person in country

one commits himself to by selling Arrow-Debreu securities. The second term

shows imports in the two states in which the home country's government does

not impose a tariff. The third term shows imports in the two states in which

there is a home tariff, and the final term shows that the tariff revenue is

refunded to people in country one. The bar indicates that the representative
                                                                                    4

consumer takes this refund as given when he chooses his portfolio, since it

depends on the aggregate choices in the economy over which he has no control.

Intuitively, in state 0 the two countries are identical in all respects except

the particular goods in which they are endowed. But the endowments have equal

value and the countries pool their goods in state 0.

obtains higher consumption and higher utility when state 2 occurs than when

state 1 occurs, i.e. the domestic country is better off when the foreign

country imposes a tariff.     In fact, the domestic country is better off when

the foreign country imposes a tariff than with free trade.           And- the domestic

country is better off with free trade than if it imposes a tariff.                      The

domestic country prefers state 2 (a foreign tariff) to state 0 (no tariffs) to

state 3 (tariffs in both countries) to state 1 (a domestic country tariff).

Whatever the foreign country does, the domestic country is better off without

a tariff, and whatever the domestic country does, it is better off if the

foreign country imposes a tariff.          (In each case, the term "better off"

obviously refers to ex post consumption and utility, as ex ante consumption

and utility are identical across countries in our example.) The ranking of

states in this model is very different from the standard trade model or in an

uncertainty model without asset markets.

        As an example, let the utility function be ln(x) +       ln(y).   Then

Notice that a tariff improves the terms of trade, e.g. in state 0 the terms of

trade are unity while in state 1 the terms of trade are (2+2t)/(2+t). Despite

the improvement in the terms of trade, consumption is lower, i.e. x1 =
                                                                       x0 but
y1 <   y0.       The log utility function also leads to a simple comparison of

consumption in the presence of asset trade and consumption in the standard

trade model (without asset trade). In the absence of asset markets, domestic

consumption in state 1 (with a domestic tariff) would be



    x1=XW

                                                                                 (26)

                2+r

Tildas over variables have been used to denote the solution in the absence of

asset trades.              Without asset trades, the domestic country clearly prefers

state 1 to state 2.                Notice the relations between (26)-(27) and (21)-(23).

Consumption in state 1 in the presence of asset trade is identical to

consumption in state 2 in the absence of asset trade, and consumption in state

2 in the presence of asset trade is identical to consumption in state 1

without asset trade. So with this utility function, asset markets lead the

country to attain the same consumption when the other country imposes a tariff

as it would if it imposed a tariff in a world without asset trade. Also in

this example, the effect of a tariff on the terms of trade is smaller with
                                                                              8


asset markets than without them. Without asset markets, the terms of trade   in
state 1 would be (2+t)/2.      (This is an increase from unity in state 0.) With

asset markets, the terms of trade in state 1 are

       The symmetry conditions that we have assumed in this section are not

important to the main idea, though they vastly simplify the solution. The

important point is that individuals with access to asset markets attempt to

insure against adverse states of nature. Optimal portfolios eliminate (in one

sense) variations in wealth across states of nature, though they cannot

eliminate substitution effects from variations in prices.        Individuals who

have "sold" their wealth gain in a good state to "buy" wealth that offsets a

loss (the wealth effect of a fall in the terms of trade) in another state,

face only substitution effects from tariffs. Since these substitution effects

are associated with distorted prices when a home tariff is imposed,

individuals are worse off in this case.       On the other hand, when the other

country imposes a tariff, there is a pure substitution effect that raises

utility.

          In Figure l.a, the domestic country is shown in state 1. Figure l.b

shows the foreign country in state 1. Points A and A* show consumption levels

that would occur in state 0 (no tariffs), while points B and B show

consumptions in state 1 in the presence of complete asset markets. The dashed

line shows that the tariff has improved the domestic country's terms of trade,

but the budget lines rotate through points C and C because of optimal asset

trades. The domestic country consumes less with the domestic tariff, while

the foreign country consumes more. Consumptions in state 2 are shown as D and

D.

               In the log-utility example, expected utility is unaffected by the

    ability to trade in asset markets.               However, this conclusion does not

    generalize to other utility functions or to models with production. But the

    question arises as to why anyone would trade assets in the example.             The

    answer is that if other people trade assets and you do not, then you will have

    lower expected utility. This occurs because you will obtain a positive income

    effect from a domestic tariff (making you better off if state 1 occurs) but

    you will receive a fall in income if there is a foreign tariff (state 2).

    These income differences are of equal magnitude (at given prices), so that

    concavity of your utility function guarantees you lower utility if you do not

    purchase the assets than if you do.              Similarly, if no one else purchases

    assets, you can raise your expected utility by buying them.


    III.       Tariff Probability and Size
                                                                             10

        In the previous sections it was shown that when there is a complete set

of asset markets and tariffs are the result of a political process with some

randomness attached, optimal portfolio investment radically alters the

covariation of consumption and tariffs,      Instead of consuming more with a

domestic tariff that improves the terms of trade, a country consumes less in

states of the world in which it imposes a tariff, and consumes more in states

in which the other country imposes a tariff.

        We now investigate the effects of changes in the size of tariffs and the

probabilities that they will be imposed. We show that, in our-example from

section II, an industry in the domestic country has an incentive to lobby for

tariff protection in the sense of a higher probability that the tariff will be

imposed or a larger tariff.

        In order to make the problem tractable in the absence of symmetry

between the countries, assume that the utility functions of the representative

individuals in the domestic and foreign countries are of the HARA class, which

contain the quadratic, the constant relative risk-aversion, and constant

absolute risk-aversion utility functions as special cases, which permit

aggregation in fairly general circumstances, and which lead to simple

relations between individual allocations and economy—wide allocations that

have been called sharing rules."        (See Milne (1979), Rubinstein (1974),

Grauer, Litzenberger, and Stehie (1976), and Dumas (1982)). The HARA utility

function class is the class that has


    -   U1    = A + Bx
        U11

The utility functions that produce this result are
                                                                                      11
            1             B
    U(c) .T—T(A + Bc)          ,




    U(c) = -Aexp(-   )         , B0,

    U(c)   ln(A+c)             ,
                                   B1.

We will assume throughout that the utility functions we work with are additive

in the various goods consumed.

      In each of the two countries, there is a representative individual who

consumes both goods and receives endowments of each good. Assume that all

individuals have     an       identical   HARA utility function but that the
representative person in the home country has the endowment (X,Y) while the

representative person in the foreign country has the different endowment

(X,Y). Again let X be the domestic countryts export good, assume there are

four possible states of the world that differ only insofar as tariffs are

concerned, as in the previous section.           However, we drop the symmetry

assumptions made in section II, e.g. we no longer require ¶12 =
                                                                  113
                                                                        or ¶ =   t.
      The representative individual in the domestic country maximizes (1)

subject to (2). The representative individual in the foreign country has an

analogous problem but with (a) a different endowment, (b) possibly a different

tariff rate, and (c) tariffs imposed in states 2 and 3 rather than 1 and 3.

      Although each individual chooses eight assets (paying off two different

goods in each of four states of the world) in the model, the HARA utility

assumption can be used to solve the model by drastically reducing the

dimensions, in particular, note that relative prices in the two countries of

all state-indexed-goods are equal except when a tariff is imposed on one of

the goods. Thinking of consumption of X in state 0 as the numeraire, the

marginal rates of substitution of Y in state 0, X in state 1, and Y in state 2

(with X in state 0) are equal across countries. E.g.
                                         * —1/B                                         12
                —1/B
     1T1(A-I-Bx1)             'TT1(A+Bx1)
                                                                     (29-)
                     IJB                    1/B
     1T0(A-4-Bx0)             1T0(A+Bx0)




Consequently

     A+Bx1 — 2A+BXW
                                                                             (30)
     A+Bx0      2A+BXW

where XW and            are total world endowments of X and Y. The form of (30) is

all that is needed for the simplifications. The assumptions that endowments

are state-independent or that all parameters of utilities are equal across

countries could be relaxed easily.                   (30) and its analogues from the other

marginal rates of substitution mentioned above imply that one can define a

number (independent of the state) v such that

          A+Bx0 = A+By0
          ____    ____ = A+Bx1
                         ____ = A+By2                              (31)
          2A+BXW           2A+BYW        2A+BXW   2A+BYW

(31) and market-clearing conditions for these four state-indexed goods can be

used to solve for x0, y0, x0, y0, x1, x, y2, and y as functions of total

world endowments and the parameter v.

        Four goods remain: Y in state 1. X in state 2, and both X and Y in state

3.    The relations between the marginal rates of substitution in the two

countries between these goods and X in state 0 yield




     A+By1      B  A+By1
     A+B    (+t) =                                                            (32)

The market-clearing conditions can be used with these four equations to solve

for the remaining allocations.                       With state-independent endowments, it is

obvious that y1 =                 and x2 =          A little manipulation reveals that
                             y3              x3.

       =          + 1(l+t)B]l -                    = y3                                    (36)



        BXW + A[l (l_t*)B
                                                                            (37)
    x2=          1-     -B =x3
                    B[l +—--'(l+t*)



With these allocations known as functions of v, one can calculate price

functions (of v)             directly     from marginal rates of substitution. When these

prices and allocations are substituted into the budget constraint, one can

solve for v as a function of endowments, the tariffs, the state-probabilities,

and the parameters of utility. v                    is    a measure of relative wealths of the two

countries.

      The log-utility example of section II is obtained by setting A = 0 and

B = 1, in which case


    x0 = x1 = vXW                                                                             (38)


       =         = vYW                                                                        (39)


    x2 =   x3 = XW[l +-i-Y(l+1)']'                                                          (40)



    y1 = y3 = yW[1            ÷-_(l+t)]l                                                    (41)
                                                                                                                14

Foreign consumptions can be obtained from these quantities-and the equilibrium

conditions.           Substituting into the conditions equating marginal rates of

substitution with relative prices, we obtain

These expressions for prices still involve the parameter v which is a measure

of the relative wealth of the domestic country as compared to the foreign

country, as is obvious from (31) and (38)-(41).                                         v depends on relative

endowments of the two goods in each country (and in each state), as well as

probabilities of tariffs and magnitudes of tariffs.                                     If each country has no

endowments of its import good (Y = X                              =   0),   then

                                                     l+'23
It is obvious from (46) that -                              > 0 and --z- < 0       (to see the latter, note

that v E 1-v has a form symmetric to (46)). Thus, given the probabilities of

each state of the world, the home country benefits from a higher home tariff
                                                                                            15

     and loses from a higher foreign tariff, even though, ex post, the home country

     prefers the state in which it does not have a tariff and in which the foreign

     country does.2 The existence of asset markets does not prevent domestic

     political pressure for higher tariffs in some states of the world.

           Now consider domestic political pressure to alter the probability of a

     home tariff.    It is obvious from (46) that an increase in               offset by an

     equal fall in it0,   or   an increase in it3   offset   by an equal fall in it2,   raises
     v. Thus there is an incentive for the home country to lobby for tariffs in a

     way that increases the probability of a tariff regardless of what the other

     country does.


     IV.   Conclusions
           The main conclusion of the paper is that, in a world with asset markets

     and political uncertainty, the observed relations between tariffs and

     consumption may differ radically from thos predicted by standard trade theory

     (without asset markets). In our example, domestic consumption of both imports

     and exports is higher when there is a foreign tariff (and no domestic tariff)

--   than when there is a domestic tariff (and no foreign one). (This conclusion
     was obtained despite the fact that the tariffs are small enough to improve

     domestic welfare if no assets are traded.) Economists should not be surprised

     if observed relations between consumption and tariffs differ from the

     predictions of the standard trade theory in either time-series or cross-

     sections.

           In our example, a country prefers states of the world in which it does

     not impose a tariff and/or the foreign country does. However, a country is

     made better off by a higher probability of a domestic tariff, lower

     probability of a foreign tariff, and by a higher (conditional) domestic tariff
                                                                            16

and lower foreign tariff. From this standpoint, the optimal policy is "talk-

loudly but carry a small stick," presuming that anyone will believe the talk.

        Of course, assets are not likely to be priced in accordance with tariff

probabilities that fail to reflect actual tariff frequencies (and sizes) over

time.    If imposing a tariff today leads asset markets to revise upward the

probability that tariffs will also be imposed in the future, then there is an

"investment" aspect to imposing a tariff.      Part of the return from this

investment can be captured by not imposing a tariff at some future date.

        We have discussed a world with complete asset markets, and it would be

useful to obtain some results when asset markets are more restricted. That

would reduce the ability of individuals to insure, though some asset trades

that cannot be made directly by individuals may be indirectly available

through multinational corporations. We have also neglected all uncertainty

except that due to the political process. Nor have we examined the intra-

country redistributions of income between factors due to tariffs when asset

trades are permitted. Finally, we have followed "standard" trade theory in

treating tariffs as exogenous. We leave for future research the incorporation

of domestic political equilibria and international trade negotiations into a

model of tariffs with uncertainty and asset markets.

                                  Appendix on Production

         Production can be incorporated into the model of section II without
changing the nature of the results.             Suppose the domestic economy has

production opportunities described by


    F(X,Y)            0                                                       (47)


or V   = f(X)     with f1 and f11 negative. Similarly, let


    G(,Y) =               0                                                   (48)


describe the foreign country's production opportunities, and let        =

wigh g1 and g11 negative.
       To maintain symmetry, assume that F(X,Y) = G(Y,X) everywhere. Then f

and g are identical functions: the two countries have different production

opportunities, but each has the same opportunities for producing the other

country's good. We continue to identify X with the domestic country's export

good. Symmetry implies

where f1' is the inverse function of f1.                                    It is obvious from (50) that

X3 <            so         >         and the domestic country produces less of its export good

and more of its importable in state 3 than in state 0.

            In state 0, (11) is still the solution for consumptions, where

production must now be indexed by state, and X0 is given in (50). Similarly,

(12) with X replacing XW gives consumption in state (3), where


      X' =                          +                                                          (51)

The first term in (51) comes from (50); the second term comes from (50) and

the symmetry condition Y3 =                                    If U1 =   0 then (13)-(16) still hold with X
                                                    X3.
replaced by X in (13) and by X in (14).                                         Then (18) holds with X

replacing X', and (19) with X replaced by X2. These state-dependent world

production levels are given by

       w
      X1 =
                 -1            l          +          -1        p2
                                                                                             (52)
                           p2(l+t)
and


                 -1        p2              -l             p1

                                                     p2(l+t)                                 (53)



Then (53) and (19) imply

Thus consumption in state 1 is
                                                  y1
                                                       <   while   consumption in state 2

implies that domestic country prefers state 2 (foreign tariff) to state 1

(domestic tariff) as in the endowments model.

         In the log-utility example from the previous section, we have

         We have not constructed an example with a closed-form solution for both

productions and consumptions, but suppose the production function of the

domestic country is


    F(,Y) = 2lnX + mY.


Then f() =        x2,        f11(z) =   ( Z)1/3    Thus

domestic tariff increases domestic production of Y and reduces foreign

production of Y, with a net increase in world production of Y and a fall in

sectors than when production is fixed at (X0,Y0). Adding production to the

model reinforces the results of section II because the tariff distorts

production in the country in which it is imposed.
