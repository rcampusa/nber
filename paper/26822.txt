                                         ABSTRACT

Although women earn approximately 50 percent of science, technology, engineering and math
(STEM) bachelor's degrees, more than 70 percent of scientists and engineers are men. We
explore a potential determinant of this STEM gender gap using newly collected data on the career
trajectories of United States Air Force Academy students. Specifically, we examine the effects of
being assigned female math and science professors on occupation choice and postgraduate
education. We find that, among high-ability female students, being assigned a female professor
leads to substantial increases in the probability of working in a STEM occupation and the
probability of receiving a STEM master's degree.

                                           1. INTRODUCTION

        Women are underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce. In 2015, the

most recent year for which data are available, only 28 percent of employed scientists and

engineers were women.1 One reason for this substantial gender gap is that, up until the late

1990s, the majority of all science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) bachelor's degrees

were earned by men (National Science Foundation 2017). Another contributing factor is that

women who earn STEM degrees are more likely than their male counterparts to pursue careers in

education or healthcare as opposed to science or engineering (Beede et al. 2011, p. 6).2

        Interventions intended to address the STEM gender gap are often predicated on the

assumption that female students who are interested in math and science suffer from a lack of

same gender-role models (e.g., Handelsman et al. 2005). In fact, several studies provide

evidence that exposure to female math and science professors encourages female college

students to pursue STEM degrees (Rask and Bailey 2002; Bettinger and Long 2005; Carrell,

Page and West 2010). Much less, however, is known about the relationship between professor

gender and longer-run post-graduation outcomes.

        Using newly collected data on the career trajectories of United States Air Force Academy

(USAFA) students who graduated during the period 2004-2008, we examine the impact of

professor gender in freshman-year math and science courses on post-graduation outcomes.

Information on these outcomes was obtained from the Air Force Personnel Center for the period

2004-2016, so we are able to follow students for a minimum of 8 years after graduation,

provided that they remained in the Air Force. One of the advantages of using data from the

USAFA is that students there are quasi-randomly assigned to freshman-year math and science

classes, which are mandatory.

       Our results provide credible evidence that freshman-year interactions with female math

and science professors can profoundly affect career trajectories. Specifically, we find that,

among high-ability female students (i.e., those with math SAT scores in the upper quartile of the

distribution), a greater share of female professors in math and science courses is associated with

an increase in the probability of graduating from the USAFA with a STEM degree, an increase in

the probability of working in a STEM occupation, and an increase in the probability of receiving

a STEM master's degree. Finally, we find evidence that, among high-ability female students,

assignment to freshman-year female math and science professors reduces the probability of

receiving a professional degree (e.g., a medical, dental, or law degree). Based on these results,

we conclude that actively recruiting female math and science professors--and encouraging them

to interact and mentor their female students--could have meaningful and long-lasting effects on

the career trajectories of women.



                                2. BACKGROUND AND DATA

       Non-economists have proposed a variety of interventions aimed at encouraging women to

choose STEM majors and careers (Cronin and Roger 1999; Blickenstaff 2005; Lagesen 2007;

Redden 2007; Bilimoria, Joy and Liang 2008; Dworkin et al. 2008; Mavriplis et al. 2010). These

interventions include ensuring students have equal access to classroom resources (Blickenstaff

2005), promoting a more inclusive workplace culture (Cronin and Roger 1999), and providing

more networking opportunities for women working in STEM fields (Mavriplis et al. 2010).



                                                 2
         Economists have, by and large, focused on increasing the supply of female professors in

mathematics and the hard sciences. Increasing the supply of female professors is often justified

on the grounds that female students interested in STEM lack role models, but can also be

justified on the grounds that they simply learn more from female professors, perhaps as a result

of gender-based differences in teaching style or expectations about academic performance

(Carrell, Page and West 2010, p. 1103). It has been also argued that professors can influence the

career choices of STEM students through providing emotional support, encouragement, and

networking opportunities (Johnson 2007; Carlone and Johnson 2007; Thiry, Laursen and Hunter

2011).



2.1. Previous studies

         Only two, essentially descriptive, studies have examined the relationship between

professor gender and post-graduation outcomes. Rothstein (1995) found a positive correlation

between the fraction of female faculty and the likelihood that female undergraduates would go

on to obtain an advanced degree. Jagsi et al. (2014) examined data on U.S. medical school

graduates for the period 2006-2008. These authors found no evidence that specialty choice was

related to the fraction of full-time faculty who were female.3

         By contrast, researchers have expended considerable effort exploring how instructor (i.e.,

teacher or professor) gender affects academic outcomes such as test scores and grades. Previous

studies in this area include: Canes and Rosen (1995), Neumark and Gardecki (1998), Bettinger


3
 Kofoed and McGovney (2019) found that quasi-random assignment to a female mentor at the U.S. Military
Academy led to an increase in the probability that female cadets chose their mentor's occupation. Gershenson et al.
(2018) found that random assignment to a black teacher increased the likelihood of black students graduating from
high school and enrolling in college. Gaule and Piacentini (2018) found that female Ph.D. candidates who worked
with female advisors were more likely to pursue an academic career.

and Long (2005), Hoffman and Oreopoulos (2009), Carrell, Page and West (2010), Fairlie,

Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2014), Muralidharan and Sheth (2016), Kato and Song (2018), and

Lim and Meer (forthcoming). However, with some notable exceptions (Carrell, Page and West

2010; Muralidharan and Sheth 2016; Kato and Song 2018; Lim and Meer forthcoming), the

results of these studies should be viewed with some skepticism given that students are not

typically assigned to their instructors at random.

       One of the best known (and most often cited) studies in this literature is by Carrell, Page

and West (2010). These authors used detailed data on students from the USAFA to examine the

effects of professor gender on academic performance and major choice. They found that female

students who were assigned to a female professor received higher grades in freshman-year math

and science classes than their counterparts who were assigned to a male professor. Among high-

ability female students (as measured by math SAT scores), assignment to female professors was

also associated with an increase in the likelihood of graduating from the USAFA with a STEM

degree. We begin our empirical analysis, below, by examining the effects of being assigned a

female professor on the same outcomes as were used by Carrell, Page and West (2010).



2.2. The USAFA and its Students

       The students and academic curriculum at the USAFA are similar in many respects to

other selective liberal arts colleges, with an emphasis on balancing "Science, Technology,

Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) with the arts and humanities" (USAFA n.d.). Students

complete a fully accredited academic program that offers 27 majors and 4 minors, and graduates

earn a Bachelor's of Science degree along with a commission in the U.S. Air Force. The average

SAT math and verbal scores of entering students are 672 and 642, respectively, and the



                                                 4
admission rate is 13 percent. A regimented daily schedule includes military training and

athletics in addition to 8-9 hours of dedicated academic time for a typical student. Students at

the USAFA are required to take a series of core courses, totaling approximately 85 semester

hours, in the basic sciences, engineering, social sciences, and humanities.4 Mandatory classes

with small enrollments at the USAFA ensure that our findings do not reflect the effect of

professor gender on attendance, but rather the effects of close contact between students and

professors during class and during office hours.

        Course scheduling is completed in a centralized process that amounts to pseudo-random

assignment of students to professors. Courses are offered in multiple sections usually containing

no more than 24 students. Each section may be offered in any of approximately 14 designated

time slots, called "periods", and the first-year mandatory math and science courses that are the

focus of this study generally have sufficiently high enrollment so that multiple sections are

offered in each period. Students register for courses (but not sections or periods) before the start

of each semester, and then the registrar assigns students to sections in a two-step process. First,

students are assigned to periods by an algorithm that seeks to minimize scheduling conflicts, for

example, due to sports practice; students are then randomly assigned to a section within their

assigned period.

        The scheduling process results in two primary sources of variation in professor gender.

First, while the assignment of students to periods gives no weight to student preferences, some

students (e.g., intercollegiate athletes) are more likely to be assigned to certain periods based on

scheduling constraints, and female (or male) professors may prefer teaching in these same

                                                       5
periods. Although this process could produce systematic relationships between unobservable

student and professor characteristics, we expect that any such relationships are far weaker and

more idiosyncratic than in a typical scheduling system in which students choose sections based

on personal preference and knowledge of professors. Second, assignment of students to sections

within each period is randomized by a computer algorithm, ensuring that observable and

unobservable student and professor characteristics are uncorrelated within periods.



2.3. The USAFA Data

        Our analysis draws upon longitudinal data for 838 female and 3,925 male students who

graduated from the USAFA during the period 2004-2008. Forty-two students who graduated

during this period were excluded from the analysis because of missing data. We merged

academic records with information on post-graduation outcomes obtained from the Air Force

Personnel Center (AFPC) for the period 2004-2016. Table 1A provides summary statistics

pertaining to the students who contributed data to the analysis; summary statistics for their

USAFA professors are reported in Table 1B, with introductory STEM courses summarized in

Table 1C.

        Throughout the analysis, student pre-treatment characteristics are used as controls.

Information from the USAFA Registrar's office allowed us to create indicators for attending a

preparatory school, enlistment in the military prior to entering the USAFA, having been recruited

as an intercollegiate athlete, gender, race, and age. We also use three numerical scores created

by the USAFA Admissions office to describe a candidate's academic, leadership, and athletic

potential.5 On average, female students entered the USAFA with better academic and leadership


5
  The academic composite score is a weighted average of two academic performance factors: 1) prior academic
record (PAR) and 2) college admission test scores. The PAR is a measure of academic performance based on a

                                                       6
composite scores than their male counterparts, while male students entered with better fitness test

scores (Table 1A).

         We linked every freshman-year math and science course taught at the USAFA to its

professor using records from the registrar's office and the USAFA's historical archives.

Information (i.e., academic rank, educational attainment, and civilian versus military) was

obtained on 280 professors (48 female and 232 male) who taught introductory math and science

courses during the academic years 2000-2006. Female professors taught approximately 19

percent of the 1,350 first-year math and science sections (Table 1A and 1C).

         Classroom and student characteristics by professor gender are reported in Table 1C.

Male professors, on average, taught slightly larger classes than their female counterparts (19.35

versus 18.83 students per class). The other characteristics, however, are quite similar across the

genders. As a formal test of whether course assignment can be thought of as random, we regress

faculty gender on the pre-enrollment characteristics (e.g., math and verbal SAT scores, academic

score, leadership score, and fitness score). The results of this exercise, which are reported in

Table 2, provide no evidence of a systematic relationship between pre-enrollment characteristics

and professor gender in the full sample. Even when the sample is broken into quartiles based on

math SAT scores, only one out of the 24 estimated coefficients are significant at conventional

levels (Panel A). A similar pattern of results is obtained when the sample is restricted to female

students (Panel B).



combination of high school class rank, high school GPA, and the quality of the high school attended. College
admission test scores include the scores earned on either the SAT Reasoning test (verbal and math) or the ACT test
(English, reading, math, and science reasoning). The leadership composite score is computed by the USAFA
admissions office and measures high school leadership activities such as student council offices, Eagle Scout
participation, and captaining a sports team. The fitness score is from a fitness assessment required of all students
prior to admittance. See Carrell, Page and West (2010) or (https://www.academyadmissions.com/admissions/) for
more details on the academic composite, leadership composite, and fitness test scores.

2.4. Post-Graduation Outcomes

         As noted in the introduction, the primary source for occupation and other post-graduation

outcomes of USAFA students is the AFPC. During their senior year, USAFA students are

assigned to a job in a three-step process. First, students decide whether they wish to pursue one

of approximately 4 rated occupations (which primarily involve piloting aircraft) or whether they

wish to pursue a non-rated occupation such as intelligence, developmental engineer, or scientist.6

Second, students submit their top 6 occupation choices to the AFPC, along with a relative weight

for each choice. Finally, using these choices and weights, an algorithm matches USAFA

graduates with their first job.7 However, this initial assignment may not correspond to the

occupation into which the graduate eventually settles. There are ample opportunities to switch

jobs and the initial assignments include "graduate study", which we code as non-STEM despite

the fact that graduate school may prepare students for a STEM career. Of the 4,311 USAFA

graduates in our sample whose occupation history is observed, 3,673 were initially assigned to a

non-STEM occupation (including pilot and graduate student). Two years after graduation, 160

had switched from a non-STEM to a STEM occupation; 4 years after graduation, 182 had

switched from a non-STEM to a STEM occupation.8


6
 Rated occupations include pilot (both conventional and unmanned), navigator, combat systems operator, and air
battle manager. Hereafter, we refer to all rated occupations as "pilots".
7
  The matching algorithm has the joint objectives of satisfying Air Force staffing needs, ensuring that the student is
qualified for the job to which he or she is assigned, and meeting student preferences. Students must satisfy
eligibility requirements for an occupation before listing it. While many occupations are open to all students, some
require a specific academic degree (e.g., listing "physicist/nuclear engineer" requires a bachelor's degree in physics,
astronomy, astrophysics, engineering physics, or nuclear physics). Appendix Table A3 lists all the occupations
observed in our data. Of the 178 distinct occupations listed, 9 are defined as STEM and 169 (including pilot) are
defined as non-STEM. The algorithm gives more weight to the occupational preferences of the highest-ranked
students within a graduating class, where rank is primarily determined by grade point average.
8
 Of the 1,036 high-ability students (i.e., those with math SAT scores in the top quartile) with occupation history,
846 were assigned to a non-STEM occupation upon graduation. Two years after graduation, 53 had switched from a
non-STEM to a STEM occupation; 4 years after graduation, 64 had switched to from a non-STEM to a STEM
occupation.

                                                           8
         We report the percentage of USAFA graduates in our sample who worked in a STEM

occupation by gender in Table 1A. Any USAFA graduate who held a STEM-related job before

2016 (or before leaving the Air Force) is counted as having worked in a STEM occupation.

Female graduates were more likely to have worked in a STEM occupation than their male

counterparts (22% vs. 20%), but they were less likely to have been a pilot (22% vs. 51%) and

more likely to have worked in what we are describing as a "professional occupation" (5% vs.

2%).9 Twenty-eight percent of female students obtained a STEM bachelor's degree but, of those

who obtained a STEM bachelor's degree, only 42 percent went on to work in a STEM

occupation.10 Approximately one percent of female students who obtained a STEM bachelor's

degree went on to work in a professional occupation.

         In addition to occupation, we observe receipt of a master's degree, receipt of STEM

master's degree, and receipt of a professional degree (e.g., a medical, dental, or law degree).

Graduates of the USAFA are not expected to obtain a graduate or professional degree unless they

are assigned to an occupation that requires it. Although a graduate degree is required for

advancement in some occupations (e.g., operations research analyst, scientist, or academic

instructor), whether and when to pursue additional education is ultimately the individual's

choice.11



9
 Specifically, the category "professional occupation" includes chaplain, dentist, general practice physician, judge
advocate, lawyer, and surgeon.
10
   Throughout the paper, we exclude biological sciences from STEM bachelor's degrees because the gender gap is
most pronounced for other STEM fields. This exclusion also aligns with Air Force STEM occupations and with the
findings emphasized by Carrell, Page, and West (2010).

11
   It is important to note that, although pursuing an advance degree is not typically required of USAFA graduates, it
increases the likelihood of promotion. Air Force policy with regard to how much weight to give advanced degrees
in promotion decisions has changed three times since 2000, but the fact that officers know it could be important
towards future promotion may influence their choice to complete a graduate degree. See Switzer (2011) and the Air
Force Times (www.airforcetimes.com) for more information detailing the Air Force policies towards the obtainment
of advanced academic degrees.

                                                          9
        Female USAFA graduates were more likely to earn a master's degree within 6 years

(49% vs. 36%), and were equally likely to earn a STEM master's degree within 6 years (12%).

Among female graduates with a STEM bachelor's degree, 33 percent went on to earn a STEM

master's degree within 6 years. Slightly less than 2 percent (1.7%) of female graduates with a

STEM bachelor's degree earned a professional degree within 6 years.12



                                     3. STATISTICAL METHODS

        We begin by examining the effects of being assigned a female professor on the academic

outcomes used by Carrell, Page and West (2010). Following these authors, we estimate:



(1)     Yicsjt = 1 + 1 Fi + 2 Fj + 3 Fi Fj + Xi 2 + Pj 3 + ct + icsjt,



where Yicjst is the normalized grade for student i in freshman math/science course c and section s

taught by professor j in semester t.13 Fi is an indicator equal to 1 if student i was female and

equal to 0 otherwise. Fj is an indicator equal to 1 if professor j was female and equal to 0

otherwise. The coefficient 1 represents the mean difference in performance between male and

female students when they are assigned to a male professor, 2 represents the effect of being

taught by a female professor on the grades of male students, and 3 represents the effect of

assignment to a female professor on the grades of female students (relative to those of male




 By comparison, among male graduates with a STEM bachelor's degree, 22 percent went on to earn a STEM
12

master's degree within 6 years; less than 1 percent earned a professional degree within 6 years.

  There are three semesters per year at the USAFA (spring, summer, and fall) and our data on academic outcomes
cover 5 years, or 15 semesters (t = 1,2,3...15).

                                                      10
students). Because freshman-year math and science courses are mandatory, and because

assignment to sections is quasi-random, the estimate of 3 can be given a causal interpretation.

       The vector of controls, Xi, is composed of student characteristics including race,

ethnicity, SAT verbal score, SAT math score, academic composite score, leadership composite

score, and fitness score. In addition, we include indicators for graduating class (i.e., cohort), age,

whether the student attended preparatory school, whether the student was a recruited athlete, and

whether the student enlisted in the Air Force prior to entering the USAFA. Professor

characteristics, represented by the vector Pj, include indicators for academic rank, terminal

degree, and civilian status. Course-by-semester fixed effects are represented by the term ct.

Standard errors are corrected for clustering at the professor level.

       We use a modified version of equation (1) to examine academic outcomes in follow-on

STEM courses:



                                         | 
(2)    Yic's't' = 1 + 1 Fi + (2 + 3Fi)         + Xi 2 +  c's't'+  ic's't',
                                          




where Yic's't' is the normalized grade for student i in the follow-on course c', section s', and

               | 
semester t'.        is the fraction of student i's first-year math and sciences courses that were
               

taught by female professors. 2 is the effect of having more female professors in first-year math

and science courses, and 3 is the effect of having more female professors on the academic

outcomes of female students relative to male students. In equation (2), the vector Xi also

includes other professor characteristics from student i's freshman year (i.e., the proportion who

held the rank of Associate Professor, the proportion who held the rank of Professor, the

proportion who were civilian, and the proportion who held a terminal degree). Following

Carrell, Page and West (2010), these regressions include course-by-section-by-semester fixed

effects, represented by the term  c's't'.

         A modified version of equation (2) is used to examine whether student i took an

advanced math course, whether student i graduated with a STEM degree, and whether student i

left the USAFA without graduating:



                                        | 
(3)      Di = 1 + 1 Fi + (2 + 3Fi )            + Xi 2 +  i,
                                            




where Di is one of the three outcomes described above. Again, our focus is on 3, the effect of

having more female professors on the academic outcomes of female students relative to male

students. Equation (3) is also used to examine the effects of professor gender on several post-

graduation outcomes, including: working in a STEM occupation, receipt of a master's degree,

receipt of STEM master's degree, receipt of a professional degree, and separation from the Air

Force.



                                               4. RESULTS

4.1. Effects of Professor Gender on Academic Outcomes

         Estimates of 3 for the full sample are reported in the top panel (Panel A) of Table 3.

Although these estimates are all positive, they are, without exception, generally small and

statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventional levels.

         In Figure 1, we explore the role of pre-treatment ability as measured by math SAT scores.

Specifically, we report estimates of 3 for the outcomes in columns 1-4 of Table 3, restricting the

                                                   12
sample to different ranges of the SAT math distribution. Consistent with the results of Carrell,

Page and West (2010), there is evidence that professor gender matters most among high-ability

students. The estimates of 3 are small and statistically insignificant when the sample is

restricted to students in the bottom quartile of the ability distribution. Likewise, when the

sample is restricted to students between the 5th and 30th, the 10th and 35th, or the 15th and 40th

percentiles of the ability distribution, the estimates of 3 are small and insignificant. In fact, it is

not until the sample is restricted to students between the 70th and 95th percentiles of the ability

distribution that we consistently observe positive and significant estimates of 3 for all academic

outcomes. Based on the estimates of 3 reported in Figure 1, we will focus on students in the top

quartile of ability distribution for the remainder of the analysis. Carrell, Page and West (2010)

also focused on students in the top quarter of the ability distribution as measured by math SAT

scores.

          Among female students in the upper quartile of the ability distribution, it is clear that

assignment to a female professor improves academic performance and increases the likelihood of

graduating with a STEM degree. For instance, female students in the upper quartile of the ability

distribution are, on average, 37.1 percentage points less likely to graduate with a STEM degree

than their male counterparts if all of their first-year math and science courses are taught by male

professors (Panel B, Table 3), but increasing the fraction of first-year classes taught by female

professors from 0 to 20 percent is associated with more than a one-third reduction in this gap.14

Carrell, Page and West (2010, p. 1127) estimated a positive but smaller interaction effect for

STEM degree completion (0.258 versus 0.665) in the top quartile, but these authors had three


14
  3 represents the effect of increasing the fraction of first-year female professors from 0 to 100 percent. The effect
of increasing the fraction of first-year female professors by 20 percentage points is 0.665 x 0.2 = 0.133, which is 36
percent of the 0.371 gap.


                                                          13
additional years of data which we did not have access to and they used a narrower definition of

first-year math and science courses. Consistent with the results of Carrell, Page and West

(2010), we find no evidence that the fraction of first-year female professors in math and science

classes is associated with leaving the USAFA without graduating.



4.2. Effects of Professor Gender on Occupation

        Our principal interest is in the relationship between professor gender and post-graduation

outcomes, beginning with occupation. Only about a quarter of U.S. women who earn a

bachelor's degree in math, science or engineering go on to work in a STEM occupation (Beede

et al. 2011, p. 6), but this figure is much higher among the USAFA graduates: in fact, 42.4

percent of female students in our sample who earned a STEM bachelor's degree from the

USAFA went on to work in a STEM occupation at some point during their Air Force career.

        In Table 4, we report OLS estimates of equation (3). Specifically, we examine three

dichotomous outcomes: whether a USAFA graduate became a pilot, whether he/she worked in a

STEM occupation, and whether he/she worked in a professional occupation.15 In the full sample,

we find little evidence that being assigned to female first-year professors affects the occupation

of female graduates (Panel A).

        Restricting our attention to students in the top quartile of the ability distribution as

measured by math SAT scores, the results indicate that increasing the fraction of female

professors in first-year math and science courses from 0 to 100 percent is associated with a 0.463

increase in the probability of female students working in a STEM occupation (Panel B, Table


15
  These occupational categories (pilot, STEM and professional) are not mutually exclusive. If, for example, a
graduate started her career as a pilot and then went on to work in a STEM occupation then she was counted as
having worked in both occupational categories.


                                                        14
4).16 This estimate suggests that, by doubling the fraction of first-year math and science classes

taught by female faculty (from 20 to 40 percent), the USAFA could increase the probability of

high-ability female students working in STEM by 0.093 (0.2 x 0.463), which represents a 28

percent increase relative to the sample mean of 0.338. Put another way, if the USAFA doubled

the fraction of first-year math and science classes taught by female professors, this estimate

suggests that 2.6 additional female students from each graduating class would work in STEM at

some point during their career.17

         As noted above, USAFA students submit their top 6 occupation choices to the AFPC in

their senior year. We explore whether professor gender in first year STEM courses affects these

choices in Appendix Table 1.18 Although there is little evidence that professor gender is related

to job choice, we do find evidence that being taught by female professors in freshman-year math

and science courses encourages high-ability female students to switch from non-STEM to STEM

occupations within 2, 4, and 6 years of graduating (Appendix Table A2). For example,

increasing the fraction of female professors in first-year math and science courses from 0 to 100

percent is associated with a 0.620 increase in the probability that high-ability female students

worked in a STEM occupation within 6 years of graduating. This estimate suggests that, by

doubling the fraction of first-year math and science classes taught by female faculty (from 20 to



16
  In Figure 2, we report estimates of 3 for three post-graduation outcomes (working in a STEM occupation, receipt
of a STEM master's degree within 4 years, and receipt of a STEM master's degree within 6 years) restricting the
sample to different ranges of the SAT math distribution. Again, there is evidence that professor gender matters most
among high-ability students.

 During the period 2004-2008, 140 female students with math SAT scores in the top quartile graduated from the
17

USAFA, or an average of 28 per year. This latter figure multiplied by 0.093 is equal to 2.6.
18
  Specifically, we used the following indicators on the left-hand side of equation (3): whether the student's first job
choice was to become a pilot, whether their first job choice was in a STEM-related occupation, whether their first or
second job choice was in a STEM-related occupation, and whether any of their 6 job choices were in a STEM-
related occupation. The estimate of 3 was positive and sizable among high-ability students for whether any job
choice was in STEM, but not statistically significant at conventional levels.

40 percent), the USAFA could increase the probability of high-ability female students working in

STEM by 0.124 (0.2 x 0.620), which represents a 38 percent increase relative to the sample mean

of 0.323.19



4.3. Effects of Professor Gender on the Receipt of Advanced Degrees

         Upon graduating from the USAFA, students typically begin their occupation training

immediately. The length of this training varies from less than a year (aircraft maintenance

officers, intelligence officers, space and missiles officers) to multiple years (pilots, medical

doctors and surgeons). After completing occupation training, students may choose to pursue a

master's degree, although it should be noted that, if a student is assigned to a professional

occupation (e.g., lawyer, medical doctor, or chaplain), earning a professional degree is usually

considered part of the formal occupation training process. In addition, the Air Force offers

several programs through which officers can receive monetary support to obtain advanced

degrees. These programs include tuition assistance for degrees completed concurrent with

another assignment and sponsorships for full-time study.

         Of the 4,416 students who graduated the USAFA between 2004 and 2008 (and who

served in the Air Force at least 4 years after graduation), 800 received a master's degree within 4

years, 274 received a master's degree in a STEM field, and 65 received a professional degree. In

the Panels A and C of Table 5, we report the estimates of the relationship between professor

gender and the probability of pursuing an advanced degree within 4 years of graduating from the




19
  At the USAFA, female professors are less likely to have the rank of associate or full professor and more likely to
be civilian. Interacting professor gender with the proportion of assistant professors, proportion of associate/full
professors, proportion of professors with a terminal degree, and proportion of professors who are civilian in equation
(3) has little impact on the main results reported in Tables 3 through 5.

                                                         16
USAFA. In the Panels B and D of Table 5, we explore the relationship between professor

gender and receipt of an advanced degree within 6, as opposed to 4, years of graduation.

         The results suggest that the effects of professor gender are not limited to occupation. For

instance, among high-ability female students, assignment to female first-year math and science

professors is positively associated with receipt of a STEM master's degree.20 Specifically,

increasing the fraction of female professors in first-year math and science courses from 0 to 100

percent is associated with a 0.426 increase in the probability that high-ability female students

receive a STEM master's degree within 4 years of graduation (Panel C) and a 0.488 increase in

the probability that high-ability female students receive a STEM master's degree within 6 years

of graduation (Panel D). These estimates suggest that by doubling the fraction of first-year math

and science classes taught by female faculty (from 20 to 40 percent), the USAFA could increase

the probability of high-ability female students obtaining a STEM master's degree within 6 years

of graduation by at least 0.098 (0.2 x 0.488). Put another way, if the USAFA doubled the

fraction of first-year math and science classes taught by female professors, 2.7 additional female

students from each graduating class would obtain a STEM master's degree within 6 years.21

         As noted in the introduction, women who earn STEM degrees are less likely than their

male counterparts to work as a scientist or engineer but are more likely to pursue careers in

education or healthcare (Beede et al. 2011, p. 6). Estimates reported in Table 5 suggest that any

tendency among female undergraduates to obtain a professional (as opposed to a STEM) degree

may be counteracted by assignment to female professors. Specifically, increasing the fraction of


20
  Panels B and C of Figure 2 show little impact of professor gender until the sample is restricted to students above
the 70th ability percentile, motivating our continued focus on the top quartile .

 During the period 2004-2008, 140 female students with math SAT scores in the upper quartile graduated from the
21

USAFA, or an average of 28 per year. This latter figure multiplied by 0.098 is equal to 2.7.


                                                         17
female professors in first-year math and science courses from 0 to 100 percent is associated with

a 0.211 decrease in the probability that high-ability female students receive a professional degree

within 4 years of graduation (Panel C) and a 0.305 decrease in the probability that high-ability

female students receive a professional degree within 6 years of graduation (Panel D).



4.4. Effects of Professor Gender on Separation from the Air Force

        Students are contractually obligated to serve as an active-duty commissioned officer in

the Air Force for a minimum of 5 years after graduating from the USAFA. However,

approximately 11 percent of female student and 7 percent of male students in our sample left the

Air Force within 4 years of graduation.22

        Separation from the Air Force could have been non-voluntary, although some graduates

likely voluntarily transferred to reserve or guard positions.23 Once a USAFA graduate separates

from the active duty Air Force, we have no method of tracking them and no further information

about their career trajectories. If separation were related to professor gender and the outcomes

under study, our inability to track graduates could produce biased, and even misleading,

estimates of 1 through 3.

        In Table 5, we report estimates of the relationship between professor gender and the

probability of separating from the Air Force within four years of graduating from the USAFA.

Female graduates of the USAFA are 4.4 percentage points more likely to separate from the Air


22
  The 5-year active-duty service commitment is for non-pilot occupations. Pilots have a 10-year active-duty service
commitment after successful completion of pilot training. The mean years of active-duty service in our sample was
8.5.
23
  Voluntary transfer programs include the Air Force "Palace Chase Program" through which members of the active
duty Air Force can transfer to reserve or guard positions in the Air Force, or Department of Defense programs
through which members can transfer to positions into one of the other four services (e.g., Army, Navy, Marine
Corps, or Coast Guard).


                                                        18
Force than their male counterparts, but there is no evidence that professor gender affects this

outcome: the estimate of 3 is small and statistically insignificant (Panel A). Likewise, there is

no evidence that professor gender affects separations within 4 years among high-ability students

(Panel C).

       Finally, in Panels B and D of Table 5, we report estimates of the relationship between

professor gender and the probability of separating from the Air Force within 6 years of

graduating from the USAFA, an outcome that captures the behavior of students who completed

their obligatory 5 years of post-graduation service. Again, professor gender does not appear to

influence whether USAFA graduates left the Air Force.



                                        5. CONCLUSION

       Researchers and policymakers alike have searched for effective methods of increasing the

representation of women in STEM occupations. Economists have focused much of their

attention on evaluating efforts to provide young women with STEM role models by, for instance,

assigning them to female math and science professors (Rask and Bailey 2002; Bettinger and

Long 2005; Carrell, Page and West 2010). However, there is a dearth of evidence with regard to

whether the effects of such efforts persist after graduation.

       Using newly collected data on the academic outcomes and career trajectories of students

from the USAFA who graduated during the period 2004-2008, we examine the effects of being

assigned female math and science professors as a freshman on a variety of outcomes. One of the

advantages of using data from the USAFA is that students there are quasi-randomly assigned to

first-year math and science classes. We find that, among high-ability female students (i.e., those

who scored in the top quartile of the math SAT), being assigned a female professor is associated



                                                 19
with substantial increases in the probability of working in a STEM occupation and the

probability of receiving a STEM master's degree within 6 years of graduation. By contrast, it is

associated with a decrease in the probability of receiving a professional degree (e.g., a medical,

dental, or law degree).

       Our results mirror and extend those of Carrell, Page and West (2010). These authors,

who also used USAFA data, found that high-ability female students who were assigned female

math and science professors did better in follow-on math courses and were more likely to choose

a STEM major. Our findings, which are not explained by attrition from military service, suggest

that actively recruiting more female math and science professors could have long-lasting effects

on the career trajectories of women, especially those of high ability.

       Future research might fruitfully explore why professor gender appears to be such an

important determinant of choosing STEM majors and occupations. While gender-based teaching

styles may affect student academic performance, the post-graduation effects we find are

consistent with the argument that female professors serve as lifelong role models whose

influence extends well past graduation, and suggest that interventions aimed at encouraging them

to interact and mentor their female students could, over time, substantially narrow the STEM

gender gap.

Notes: Each column shows estimates from a separate course-level regression of an indicator for professor gender on student
characteristics. Quartiles are based on SAT math score. The sample is limited to students who graduated from the USAFA
and are not missing SAT scores or other admissions scores (academic composite, leadership composite, or fitness score).
Student characteristics include SAT math score, SAT verbal score, academic composite score, leadership composite score,
fitness score, and (not shown in table) indicators for race, recruited athlete, preparatory school attendance, enlisted prior to
entering the Academy, and age 17-19. SAT scores, academic, leadership and fitness scores are divided by 100. Pooled
regressions based on courses taken by both male and female students include a female indicator. Standard errors clustered
at the professor level are reported in parentheses.

*Statistically significant at the 10% level; ** at the 5% level; *** at the 1% level.

Notes: Regressions in columns (1) and (2) are at the student-course level, with normalized course grade as the dependent
variable. Regressions in columns (3)-(5) are at the student level, with indicators for taking a higher-level math course,
obtaining a STEM bachelor's degree, and attrition before graduation as the respective dependent variables. Column (1)
shows coefficients based on the gender of the professor of the first-year course, while the remaining columns show
coefficients based on the proportion of female professors in first-year courses. The sample is limited to students who
graduated from the USAFA for all regressions except column (5). Controls in all regressions include SAT math score, SAT
verbal score, academic composite score, leadership composite score, fitness score, and indicators for race, recruited athlete,
preparatory school attendance, enlisted prior to entering the Academy, age 17-19, and cohort. In addition, the student-
course level regressions include course-semester fixed effects (column 1) or course-section-semester fixed effects (column
2). Furthermore, column (1) controls for indicators for professor being female, holding the rank of Assistant Professor,
holding the rank of Associate Professor or Professor, having a terminal degree, and being a civilian; columns (2)-(5)
controls for the proportion of the student's professors in first-year STEM courses with each of these characteristics.
Standard errors clustered at the professor level (columns 1 and 2) or robust standard errors (columns 3-5) are reported in
parentheses.

Notes: Each column reports the results of a separate student-level regression. The dependent variable is an indicator for the
student ever working in the occupation indicated in the column heading. See Table A3 in the Appendix for a list of STEM
occupations; professional occupations include doctor, surgeon, dentist, lawyer, and chaplain. Controls include SAT math
score, SAT verbal score, academic composite score, leadership composite score, fitness score, and indicators for race,
recruited athlete, preparatory school attendance, enlisted prior to entering the Academy, age 17-19, and cohort. All
regressions also control for the proportion of each student's professors in first-year STEM courses who held the rank of
Associate Professor or Professor, the proportion who held a terminal degree, and the proportion who were civilian. Robust
standard errors in parentheses.

Notes: The dependent variable is an indicator for attainment of the specified degree (columns 1-3) or separating from the
Air Force (column 4) within 4 years (Panels A and C) or 6 years (Panels B and D). The sample is restricted to USAFA
graduates who served in the Air Force at least 4 years (Panels A and C) or 6 years (Panels B and D) for columns 1-3 and to
all USAFA graduates in column 4. Panels C and D are further limited to students in the top quartile of SAT math. Controls
include SAT math score, SAT verbal score, academic composite score, leadership composite score, fitness score, and
indicators for race, recruited athlete, preparatory school attendance, enlisted prior to entering the Academy, age 17-19, and
cohort. All regressions also control for the proportion of each student's professors in first-year STEM courses who held the
rank of Associate Professor or Professor, the proportion who held a terminal degree, and the proportion who were civilian.

Notes: Each column reports the results of a separate student-level regression. The dependent variable is an indicator for the
student ranking the indicated occupation or occupation category as inputs to the occupational matching system. See the text
(section 2.4) for a description of the occupational matching system and Table A3 for a list of STEM occupations. The
sample is limited to USAFA graduates for whom occupational preference data were available. Controls include SAT math
score, SAT verbal score, academic composite score, leadership composite score, fitness score, and indicators for race,
recruited athlete, preparatory school attendance, enlisted prior to entering the Academy, age 17-19, and cohort. In addition,
regressions include controls for the proportion of the student's professors in first-year STEM courses who held the rank of
Associate Professor or Professor, the proportion who held a terminal degree, and the proportion who were civilian. Robust
