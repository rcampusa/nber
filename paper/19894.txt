                                             ABSTRACT

This paper argues that openness to new, unconventional and disruptive ideas has a first-order impact
on creative innovations—innovations that break new ground in terms of knowledge creation.
After presenting a motivating model focusing on the choice between incremental and radical innovation,
and on how managers of different ages and human capital are sorted across different firms with different
degrees of openness to disruption, we provide firm-level, patent-level and cross-country evidence
consistent with this pattern. Our measures of creative innovations proxy for innovation quality (average
number of citations per patent) and creativity (fraction of superstar innovators, the likelihood of a very
high number of citations, and generality of patents). Our main proxy for openness to disruption is the
age of the manager—based on the idea that only companies or societies open to such disruption
will allow the young to rise up within the hierarchy. Using this proxy at the firm, patent and country
level, we present robust evidence that openness to disruption is associated with more creative innovations,
but we also show that once the effect of the sorting of young managers to firms that are more open
to disruption is factored in, the (causal) impact of manager age on creative innovations is small.

1        Introduction

This paper investigates the impact of economic and social incentives on “creative innovations,”
which we identify with the most in‡uential, innovative and original patents. Though there are cur-
rently more than half a million patents granted by the US Patent and Trademark O¢ ce (USPTO)
per year, only a handful are truly transformative in terms of their contribution to society’s knowl-
edge and their impact on the organization of production, and probably only a small fraction account
for the bulk of the value created.1 For example, within the …eld of drugs and medical inventions,
there were 223,452 patents between 1975 and 2001, but the median number of citations of these
patents within the next …ve years was four. A few patents receive many more citations, however.
One was the patent for “systems and methods for selective electrosurgical treatment of body struc-
tures”by the ArthroCare Corporation (with 50 citations), which has also had a major impact on the
…eld by improving many existing surgical procedures and devices used, inter alia, in arthroscopy,
neurology, cosmetics, urology, gynecology and laparoscopy/general surgery. Another example is
Amazon’s patent for “method and system for placing a purchase order via a communications net-
work,”which received 263 citations within …ve years (while the median number of citations within
this class is …ve) and has fundamentally altered online businesses.
        An idea dating back to Joseph Schumpeter (1934) associates creative innovations and entre-
preneurship not only with economic rewards to this type of transformative idea, but also with the
ability and desire of potential innovators and entrepreneurs to signi…cantly deviate from existing
technologies, practices and rules of organization and society and to engage in “disruptive innova-
tions.” This is natural; as Schumpeter emphasizes, innovation is a deviation from existing, inertial
ways of doing things, and thus relies on “mental freedom” from, or even “rebellion” against, the
status quo (pp. 86-94). Similarly, technologies that will cause the most fundamental “creative de-
struction” naturally correspond to, and perhaps are driven by, “deviant” and disruptive behavior.
This notion is pithily captured by an inscription prominently displayed on the walls of Facebook’s
headquarters in Silicon Valley:

             “Move fast and break things.”

        This perspective suggests that societies and organizations that impose a set of rigidly speci…ed
rules, discourage initiative and deviations from established norms, shun or even ostracize rebellious
behavior, and do not tolerate those that “move fast and break things” will signi…cantly lag be-
hind their more open, “individualistic”or “risk-taking”counterparts in creative innovations— even
though they might still be able to function successfully with existing technologies. In the rest of the

between citations and patent quality.


                                                        1
paper, we thus refer to this constellation of social and economic incentives as openness to disruption
(short for openness to disruptive innovations, ideas and practices).
   We …rst provide a simple model of the interplay between “corporate culture”(…rm type capturing
how open the …rm is to disruption) and innovation strategies. Firms can engage in an incremental
innovation by building on their existing leading-edge products. In addition, high-type …rms (those
that have a corporate culture open to disruption) can attempt a radical innovation, which involves
combining diverse ideas to generate a technological improvement in a new area. We also assume that
the skills of young managers who have more recently acquired general skills (or are less beholden
to a particular type of product or technology) can be fruitfully utilized in the process of radical
innovation. In the model, though incremental innovations also increase productivity, it is the radical
innovations that are the engine of growth. This is because incremental innovations in a particular
“technology cluster” run into diminishing returns (as in Akcigit and Kerr, 2010, or Abrams et
al., 2013), while radical innovations create new technology clusters, which increase productivity
directly, and also indirectly, by making another series of incremental innovations possible.
   Our model predicts a reduced-form cross-sectional relationship between manager age and radical
innovation. But this relationship does not correspond to the causal e¤ect of manager age on creative
innovations. Rather, manager age is both an economically relevant variable and more generally a
proxy for openness to disruption, as highlighted by our model where young managers tend to work in
…rms that are open to radical innovation, but also contribute to the likelihood of radical innovations
in such …rms. These forces can also be seen from the longitudinal predictions of the model: …rms
that hire younger managers should subsequently have more creative innovations (because hiring a
young manager is associated either with a change in a …rm’s type or a change in the …rm’s innovation
strategy as it runs out of productive incremental innovation opportunities). But because …rms that
are more open to disruption need not immediately hire a young manager, the increase in creative
innovations can precede the hiring of a younger manager.
   The model further clari…es that radical innovations will generate higher quality patents that
are more likely to receive a high number of citations and tend to be more general in terms of the
range of citations they receive (because they are expanding into new areas), and this provides us
with an empirical strategy to measure the creativity of innovations (and present evidence about
several aspects of the model’s implications).
   Our theoretical framework also predicts another relationship we investigate empirically: prod-
ucts with higher sales will encourage even high-type …rms and young managers to pursue incre-
mental innovations (because of Arrow’s (1962) replacement e¤ ect), and those with many patents
will tilt things in favor of radical innovations (because of diminishing returns and more generally
because there is a substantial knowledge base to build upon for such an expansion).


                                                  2
      Finally, our model further suggests that institutions or attitudes that ban or discourage ex-
pansion into new areas or combinations that have not been previously experimented with can be
highly detrimental to radical innovations. Equally, those that prevent young managers from leading
companies could slow down creative innovations by failing to use their more recent vintage skills
in radical innovations. Such institutions and attitudes typically vary across countries, and this
reasoning suggests that similar relationships might be found in the cross-country data.
      The bulk of our paper comprises an empirical study of the ideas illustrated by our theoretical
model. We investigate whether companies with younger managers engage in more radical and
creative innovations. As already noted, manager age is a natural proxy for openness to disruption,
since companies with a corporate culture open to disruption are more likely to allow young managers
to rise up to the top of the corporate hierarchy.2
      Our empirical work uses several di¤erent measures of creative innovations, all computed from
the USPTO data. These are the average number of citations per patent; the fraction of superstar
innovators, which corresponds to the fraction of patents accruing to an innovator classi…ed as a
“superstar” on the basis of the number of citations; tail innovations, which we measure as the
fraction of patents (of a country or company) that are at the pth percentile of the overall citations
distribution (such as the 99th percentile) relative to those that are at the median, thus capturing
the likelihood of receiving a very high number of citations normalized by the “median” number of
citations; and generality index, constructed by Hall, Ja¤e and Trajtenberg (2001), which measures
the dispersion of the citations that a patent receives from di¤erent technology classes. We report
several salient and robust pattern using these data.
      First, we establish a very robust cross-sectional correlation between CEO (or top management)
age and all of our measures of …rm-level creative innovation (with or without a variety of …rm-
level controls). In summary, …rms that tend to employ younger CEOs receive a greater number
of citations per patent, have a greater fraction of their patents generated by superstar innovators,
have more tail innovations, which are at the very high percentiles of the citations distribution, and
have more general patents.
      Second, we …nd similar (but somewhat smaller) results when we focus on “within-…rm” vari-
ation generated by CEO changes: when a younger CEO takes charge, innovations (new patent
applications) become more creative. Recall, however, that, as our theoretical analysis highlights,
these within-…rm results are still a mixture of the sorting e¤ects and the causal e¤ect of manager
age on creative innovations.
      Third, related to this last point and again consistent with our theoretical model, we show that
  2
    Interestingly, in the examples of major innovations mentioned above, these were produced by companies with
unusually young leadership. The average age of top managers at ArthroCare Corporation was 41 at the time, and
only 33 at Amazon (compared to an average age of 54.84 among Compustat companies).


                                                      3
there is a signi…cant increase in creative innovations before a …rm switches to a younger CEO, but
once it does make the switch, there is a further increase in the creativity of their innovations.
   Fourth, we also use the structure of our model, in conjunction with the reduced-form patterns in
the data, to shed further light on the relative roles of sorting and the causal e¤ect of manager age on
innovation. Namely, we utilize a simple indirect inference procedure to estimate from the reduced-
form regression coe¢ cients some of the key parameters of our model, including those governing the
causal e¤ect of manager age on creative innovations. This exercise implies that the causal e¤ect of
manager age on creative innovations is small and is dwarfed by the sorting e¤ects resulting from
the fact that …rms that are more open to disruption, and thus more creative, tend to hire younger
managers.
   Fifth, we exploit the patent-level variation to estimate the separate impacts of CEO and inventor
age on the creativity of innovations. Our results indicate that both matter, with roughly similar
magnitudes. But we also …nd that younger CEOs tend to work with younger inventors (though
CEO age has a fairly precisely estimated impact even after controlling for inventor age). These
two …ndings, which suggest that …rms typically undertake many associated changes while they are
switching towards generating more creative innovations, further corroborate our interpretation that
much of the cross-sectional (and within-…rm) evidence re‡ects sorting of younger managers to …rms
with corporate cultures that are more open to disruption.
   Finally, we also use the …rm-level data to shed light on our model’s prediction that …rms with
greater sales should be less willing to encourage new, potentially disruptive ideas, practices and
innovations, while …rms that are technologically more advanced, and thus not able to pro…tably
function without engaging in major innovations, should be more likely to encourage this type of
disruptive innovation. Our …rm-level data enable us to investigate this idea by simultaneously
including interactions of CEO age with (log) sales and (log) number of patents of the …rm. Though
the results here are somewhat less strong than our main …ndings, they are broadly consistent with
the notion that CEO age interacts negatively with sales and positively with the number of patents.
   We conclude the paper by showing in Section 5 that the …rm-level results aggregate up to
the country level, so that countries that employ younger managers appear to have more creative
innovations controlling for other factors. For this exercise, we use the average age of (top) managers
(e.g., CEO and CFO) in the 25 largest listed companies in the country (when available), which we
collected from publicly available sources. We …nd a fairly stable relationship between manager age
and creativity of innovations at the country level as well, suggesting that the forces we emphasize
might account for cross-country di¤erences in the type and quality of innovations.
   The cross-country context is also useful for us because it provides a corroboration that manager
age is indeed capturing practices related to openness to disruption. We do this by utilizing the


                                                  4
individualism and uncertainty avoidance indices of “national cultures” constructed by the Dutch
social scientist Geert Hofstede.3 Our results using these indices are similar to those based on
average manager age, suggesting that, at least at the country level, our manager age variable is
likely to be capturing some aspects related to a society’s openness to disruption.
       Our paper is related to several literatures. First, we build on and extend the emerging litera-
ture on the interplay between micro and macro aspects of innovation. In particular, we build on
Klette and Kortum’s (2004) model of innovation dynamics by including a choice between radical
and incremental innovations, and by incorporating the dimension of matching between managers
of di¤erent vintages of human capital (age) and type of innovation.4 The burgeoning empirical
literature in this area (e.g., Foster, Haltiwanger and Krizan, 2001, Lentz and Mortensen, 2008,
Akcigit and Kerr, 2010, Hurst and Pugsley, 2011, Syverson, 2011, Kogan et al., 2012, Acemoglu et
al., 2013) focuses on R&D, patent and productivity dynamics. We depart from this literature both
by focusing on the choice between radical (creative) and incremental innovations, and by presenting
a detailed analysis of the relationship between creativity of innovations and manager age.
       Second, three papers most closely related to our work are MacDonald and Weisbach (2004),
Gorodnichenko and Roland (2012) and Fogli and Veldkamp (2013). MacDonald and Weisbach
construct an overlapping generations model in which each generation makes technology-speci…c
human capital investments. They show that younger agents are the ones who invest in human
capital complementary to new technologies. Their framework does not incorporate innovations
and thus has no distinction between creative, radical innovations vs. incremental innovations.
Gorodnichenko and Roland draw a link between innovation and individualism and provide evidence
using Hofstede’s individualism data. Despite the similar motivating questions, the approaches of
the two papers are very di¤erent. While Gorodnichenko and Roland look at aggregate measures
of productivity, such as TFP or labor productivity, we focus on creative innovations de…ned using
patent citations data from the USPTO. We therefore …rst start with a microeconomic model of how
…rms choose their innovation strategies and how managers of di¤erent ages endogenously sort across
di¤erent types of …rms. Our main empirical work instead uses the proxy for openness to disruption
we have constructed ourselves based on the age of managers across countries and, more centrally,
focuses on …rm-level and patent-level analysis across US companies. Fogli and Veldkamp also use
Hofstede’s individualism index in their theoretical and empirical analysis of “individualistic”social
   3
     The individualism index is based on Durkheim’s (1933) distinction between collectivism and individualism, and
measures the extent to which a society functions by relying on loosely knit social ties and thus permits and condones
individual actions even when they con‡ict with collective goals and practices, particularly in a business context. The
uncertainty avoidance index, on the other hand, is an inverse proxy for a society’s tendency for risk-taking based in
part on ideas from Cyert and March’s seminal (1963) book.
   4
     This matching aspect is common with theoretical analyses of the role of managers, in particular, Lucas (1978),
Garicano (2000), and Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2004).



                                                          5
networks and the di¤usion of new technologies, but their emphasis is on how new technologies
di¤use over di¤erent network structures and their empirical work exploits exposure to di¤erent
types of diseases to generate cross-country variation in societal network structures.
       Third, our work is linked to the small literature on age and creativity. Galenson and Weinberg
(1999, 2001), Weinberg and Galenson (2005), Jones and Weinberg (2011) and Jones (2010) provide
evidence that a variety of innovators and top scientists are more creative early in their careers, but
they also acquire other types of human capital (perhaps generating di¤erent types of creativity)
later on. Jones (2009) develops a model in which scientists have to spend more time mastering a
given area and have to work in teams because the existing stock of knowledge is growing and thus
becoming more di¢ cult to absorb and use. Relatedly, Sarada and Tocoian (2013) investigate the
impact of the age of the founders of a company on subsequent performance using Brazilian data.5
       Fourth, our work is related to the literature pioneered by Bertrand and Schoar (2003) and
Bloom and Van Reenen (2007, 2010) which investigates the relationship between CEO and manager
characteristics and …rm performance. Benmelech and Frydman (2014), for example, show that
military CEOs pursue more conservative investment and …nancial strategies (lower investment in
R&D), are less likely to be involved in …nancial fraud, and perform better during times of distress.
Bennedsen et al. (2008) show that the death of a CEO or shocks to the CEO that potentially a¤ect
her focus (death of an immediate family member) impact pro…tability or operating returns. Kaplan
et al. (2012) provide evidence from a factor analysis that CEO ability is positively correlated with
subsequent …rm performance. Also noteworthy in this context is Barker and Mueller (2002), who
show that …rms with younger CEOs spend more on R&D.
       Finally, there is a growing literature on the impact of cultural factors and practices on long-run
economic development. The distinction between individualist and collectivist cultures is deep-
rooted in sociology (e.g., Durkheim, 1933) and has been widely applied within the sociology,
anthropology and psychology literatures (e.g., Parsons, 1949, Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck, 1961,
Schwartz, 1994, Triandis, 1995, and Hofstede, 2001). It has been emphasized within the economics
literature by Greif (1994), though we are not aware of any other studies emphasizing or empirically
investigating the impact of “openness to disruption”.6 More closely related to our focus in this
context is Schumpeter’s (1934) vision of an innovator as creating disruption, partly in response
to economic incentives and partly for psychological motives that lead them to seek challenges and
   5
     See also Azoulay, Manso and Zivin (2011) who document the impact of changes in incentives driven by large
academic awards and grants on creativity, and Azoulay, Zivin and Wang (2010) who investigate the impact of the
death of a very productive co-author on academic productivity.
  There is also an extensive literature in social psychology, mostly using survey and experimental evidence, on age
and various attitudes both in general and in business. See, e.g., the survey by Walter and Scheibe (2013).
   6
     Other aspects of cultural practices have been emphasized as major determinants of economic developments by,
among others, Tabellini (2008a,b), Fernandez and Fogli (2009), Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2010), and Alesina,
Giuliano and Nunn (2011).


                                                        6
deviate from norms, is more closely related to our focus. Traces of this approach can also be seen
in Adorno et al.’s (1950) psychological study of authoritarianism, and in McClelland’s (1961) and
Winslow and Solomon’s (1987) approaches to entrepreneurship (see Kirzner, 1997, for a survey).
These ideas have been applied in a cross-country context by Shane (1993, 1995), Hofstede (2001),
Schwartz (1994), Schwartz and Bilsky (1990) and others. To the best of our knowledge, no other
work links these ideas to creative innovations, develops a formal theory along the lines of what we
are attempting here, or provides systematic evidence based on …rm- or patent-level data.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents our motivating model.
Section 3 describes our data sources and variable construction and provides a few basic descriptive
statistics. Section 4 presents our main empirical results, which are based on …rm-level data. Section
5 returns to the cross-country data and shows that the patterns we identify in the microdata appear
to aggregate up to the country level. Section 6 concludes.


2     Motivating Theory

In this section, we provide a simple model of radical and incremental innovations to motivate both
the conceptual underpinnings of our approach and some of our empirical strategies.

2.1    Production

We consider a continuous-time economy in which discounted preferences are de…ned over a unique
…nal good Y (t). This …nal good is produced by labor and a continuum of intermediate goods j,
each located along a circle, C, of circumference 1. The production technology takes the following
constant elasticity of substitution form
                                                 Z
                                           1
                             Y (t) =                  qj (t) kj (t)1   dj L ;                        (1)
                                       1          C

where kj (t) denotes the quantity and qj (t) the quality (productivity) of intermediate good j used in
…nal good production at time t, while L is the total amount of production labor, which is supplied
inelastically.
    We follow Klette and Kortum (2004) in de…ning a …rm as a collection of leading-edge (best)
technologies. A perfectly enforced patent for each leading-edge quality technology is held by a
…rm, which can produce it at constant marginal cost            in terms of the unique …nal good. Because
costs and revenues across product lines are independent, a …rm will choose price and quantity to
maximize pro…ts on each of its product lines. In doing so, it will face an iso-elastic inverse demand
derived from equation (1), which can be written, suppressing time arguments, as:

                                           pj = L qj kj ; 8j 2 C:


                                                       7
The pro…t-maximization problem of the …rm with leading-edge technology for intermediate good j
can then be written as
                                                   n                                o
                                        (qj ) = max L qj kj1                   kj       8j 2 C:
                                                kj 0

The …rst-order condition of this maximization problem implies a constant markup over marginal
cost, pj = =(1           ), and thus

2.2      Managers

In addition to workers, the economy is also populated by managers, who play both an operational
role (reducing costs for …rms) and manage innovation.
      Managers enter and exit the economy following a stationary Poisson birth and death process,
so that the measure of managers, M , and their age distribution is constant over time. We index a
manager by her age a, or equivalently by her birth date b. Denoting the death rate of managers
by , the fact that the measure of managers is constant at M implies that the age distribution
of managers is simply given by an exponential distribution, i.e., the fraction of managers who are
below the age a is 1         e   a .7

      When a manager is born, she acquires the knowledge associated with the average technology in
the period in which she is born, giving her a knowledge base of
                                                Z
                                           qb     qjb dj:
                                                              C

Similarly, we denote the current period’s knowledge stock— current average technology— by
                                               Z
                                           qt     qjt dj:
                                                              C

Managers will be hired by monopolists to manage production and innovation in their leading-edge
products. In equilibrium, managers will be paid a wage wb;t as a function of the current period’s
technology, qt , and their knowledge, qb . We assume that M < 1, which implies that the measure
of managers is less than the measure of product lines in the economy, so some product lines will
  7                                                                                               birth                birth
      It is also straightforward to see that if the birth rate of managers is given by                    , then M =           = .


                                                              8
not use a manager. This simpli…es the analysis by providing a simple boundary condition for the
determination of equilibrium wages of managers. We also assume that M is not too small, which
will ensure that all …rms that need a manager for a “radical innovation,” as described next, are
able to hire one (one can take M ! 1 without any loss of generality).

2.3          Corporate Culture and Innovation Dynamics

The economy is populated by two types of …rms, with …rm type denoted by                                 2f   H ; Lg   where
 H       >    L.   Firm type does not a¤ect productivity directly, but in‡uences the success of radical
innovations. In particular, high-type …rms, i.e., those with                =      H,   are those with corporate cultures
that are open to disruption, and will thus have a comparative advantage in radical innovations. In
contrast, we will suppose that low-type …rms, i.e., those with                       =    L,   is incapable of engaging in
radical innovations, thus setting           L   = 0. Firm type is initially determined upon entry (as described
in the next subsection). Thereafter, a low-type …rm switches to high type at ‡ow rate ' 2 (0; 1).8
         The productivity of each intermediate product is determined by its location along a quality
ladder in a given product line. In addition, as noted above and following Klette and Kortum (2004),
each leading-edge technology gives the …rm an opportunity for further innovation. Innovation
dynamics at the …rm level are determined by whether the …rm pursues an incremental innovation
or a radical innovation strategy. Low-type …rms can only engage in incremental innovations as we
describe next.


Incremental Innovation                 Incremental innovations improve the productivity of a product line
within the current technology cluster.9 A technology cluster here refers to a speci…c family of tech-
nologies for that product line. Because incremental innovations take place within this technology
cluster, they will run into diminishing returns. We model this by assuming that the additional
productivity improvements generated by an innovation decline in the number of prior incremental
innovations within a technology cluster. In addition, again for the same reason, incremental in-
novations build on a narrow technology base and create improvements only over this base. This
implies that, as illustrated in Example 1 below, incremental innovations will have few citations and
limited “generality”(captured by the dispersion of citations they receive from di¤erent technology
classes as we discuss further below).
         We assume that all …rms (regardless of their type) can successfully innovate incrementally at
the exogenous rate            > 0. The nth incremental innovation in a technology cluster improves the
current productivity of product line j by a step size              n (qj ; qt ),   where qj is the current productivity
     8
         We assume that there are no switches from high type to low type to simplify the expressions and the analysis.
     9
         Our modeling of technology clusters follows Akcigit and Kerr (2010) and Abrams et al (2013).




                                                             9
of the technology, and qt is the current period’s technology, and

                                                                                      n
                                        n (qj ; qt )   = [ qt + (1         ) qj ]                                   (3)

with       2 (0; 1),   > 0, and       2 (0; 1). This functional form implies two features. First, each
innovation builds both on the current productivity of the product line where it originates, with
weight 1        , and on average technology, qt , with weight                       . Second, productivity gains from
incremental innovations decline geometrically, at the rate                         , in the number of prior incremental
innovations in the technology cluster.
       Denoting by tn the time of the nth incremental improvement for product line j, the evolution
of the technology of product line j in a technology cluster that started with productivity qj0 after
n incremental innovations can then be written as
                                        Xn
                         qjn = qj0 +                    q (ti ) + (1       ) qj0      i
                                              i=0
                                                            1        n+1            Xn
                              = qj0 1 + (1              )                  +                    i
                                                                                                    q (ti ) :
                                                                1                         i=0


Radical Innovations Radical innovations combine the current technology of the product line
the …rm is operating, the knowledge base of the manager, and the available knowledge stock of
the economy to innovate in a new area (creatively destroying the leading-edge technology of some
other …rm). Similar to Weitzman’s (1998) approach based on recombination, this combination of
knowledge bases creates a new technology cluster. Because they create new technology clusters,
radical innovations tend to receive more citations, are more likely to have a very high number of
(“tail”) citations, and have greater generality.
       If there is a radical innovation in a particular product line, the innovator will initiate a new
technology cluster in a di¤erent product line (and will still keep its original product line). The
creation of a new technology cluster generates a larger improvement on current technology, and
also provides the innovator with the opportunity to start a new series of incremental innovations.
Because radical innovations are not directed and each …rm controls an in…nitesimal fraction of all
products, the likelihood that it will be the …rm itself radically innovating over its own product
is zero.10 Thus radical innovations are associated with “Schumpeterian creative destruction.” We
next describe the technology for radical innovations.
       A successful radical innovation leads to an improvement over the product line uniformly located
on the circle C, and thus generates creative destruction. In particular, if there is a successful radical
innovation over a product line with technology qj , this leads to the creation of a new leading-edge
  10
     It may be more plausible to assume that radical innovations also take place over a range of products that are
“technologically close”to the knowledge base of the innovator. Provided that there is a continuum of products within
this range, this would not a¤ect any of our results.


                                                                10

where the superscript 0 denotes the fact that a radical innovation initiates a new cluster with no
prior incremental innovations.


Managers’Role For each of their active product lines, …rms hire managers who in‡uence their
revenues in two ways. First, a manager of age a = t                    b contributes qt f (a) to the revenues of a
…rm when the aggregate technology level is qt (e.g., by reducing costs).11 We presume (but do
not need to impose) that f is increasing, so that more experienced managers are better at cost
reductions. If the …rm hires no manager, then it does not receive this additional revenue. Second,
a manager a¤ects the ‡ow rate of radical innovations for …rms attempting such radical innovations,
as we describe next.
       A …rm of type     has a baseline ‡ow rate of radical innovation (regardless of whether they are
pursuing radical or incremental innovations) equal to                     . In addition, if it pursues a radical
innovation strategy, hires a manager with knowledge qb and the current technology in the economy
is qt , it will also have a ‡ow rate of radical innovation equal to

                                                            qa;                                                       (4)

where
                                                     qb
                                                       qa
                                                     qt
is the relative average quality of managers of age a, and               2 (0; 1] (and the superscript, rather than
a subscript, here emphasizes that this is a ratio of two averages). This speci…cation implies that
low-type …rms, with        L   = 0, cannot engage in radical innovations— i.e., both                  L   and     L   are
equal to zero.
       Moreover, since both high- and low-type …rms have the same rate of success, at the rate , when
they attempt incremental innovations, our model also implies that                        captures the comparative
advantage of …rms for radical innovation. In addition, young managers also have a comparative
advantage in radical innovation— since the contribution of the manager of age a to cost reductions
is the same for all …rms, and younger managers contribute to the ‡ow rate of radical innovation
with high-type …rms.
       The parameter       captures the role of institutional or social sanctions on radical innovations.
Such sanctions may permit only the implementation of certain radical innovations, thus making
successful innovations less likely.12
  11
     We model this contribution as an additive element in the revenues of the …rm so as not to a¤ect its monopoly
price and quantity choices of the …rm via this channel.
  12
     In particular, in the context of our modeling of product lines along the circle C, we may assume that such sanctions

Radical Innovations and Citation Patterns                      The next example provides more details on the
evolution of technology clusters and the citation pattern for the patents related to the incremental
and radical innovations therein.

                                       j                     j                          j

In this example, Pn denotes the nth patent registered at the patent o¢ ce and                  n   denotes the step
size as described in equation (3). The …rst technology cluster starts with a radical innovation
associated with a patent P1 . The productivity improvement due to this patent is                   0.   Subsequently
a new incremental innovation in this technology cluster, with patent P2 , follows on P1 , increasing
productivity by another         1   <   0.   After this innovation, there is a radical innovation P3 in the
second product line, followed by two subsequent incremental innovations P4 and P5 . Since P5 and
P6 are second incremental innovations in their technology clusters, they increase productivity by
 2   <   1.   Note that P1 ; P3 ; P8 ; P11 and P13 are radical innovations starting new technology clusters.
As described above, these come from innovations in other product lines operated by high-type
…rms. Suppose also that the …rm operating technology cluster 1 with patent P7 is a high-type …rm,
and successfully undertakes a radical innovation after P7 , launching a new technology cluster on a
di¤erent product line (shown above as patent P8 ).
     Consider next the patterns of citation resulting from these innovations. It is natural to assume
that each incremental innovation will cite all previous innovations in its technology cluster, which
is the pattern shown in the next table. (Alternatively, such patents might also cite patterns from
previous technology clusters on the same product line, with very similar patterns). In addition, it
is also plausible that, because a radical innovation is recombining ideas from its own product line
and the product line on which it is building, it should be citing the fundamental ideas encapsulated
in the patents that initiated the two technology clusters. For this reason, patents P8 ; P11 , and P13
cite the patents initiating the previous technology cluster in this product line as well as the patent
permit a …rm operating product line j to successfully innovate over technologies that are su¢ ciently close to itself.
Suppose, for example, that j may be allowed to innovate only on product lines that are at most a distance from
itself. Then the case of no restrictions would correspond to = 1=2, so that radical innovations over any product
lines on the circle C are possible, while   < 1=2 would correspond to restrictions and thus lower the likelihood of
successful radical innovations.

initiating the most recent technology cluster in their own product line. The next table shows this
citation pattern for the …rst …ve patents.

                                            Cited             Citing
                                             P1 :       P2 ; P6 ; P7 ; P8 ; P11
                                             P2 :       P6 ; P7
                                             P3 :       P4 ; P5 ; P8
                                             P4 :       P5
                                             P5 :       none

For example, P2 builds only on P1 and thus only cites P1 , and is in turn cited by P6 and P7 . P1 is
cited not only by the patents that build on itself within the same product line, P2 , P6 , P7 and P11 ,
but also by P8 because this new patent comes out of recombining ideas based on this technology
cluster and those in some other product line. This pattern then implies that radical innovations will
receive more citations and will receive more “general” citations as well. They will also be heavily
overrepresented among “tail innovations,”meaning among patents receiving the highest number of
citations. These are the patterns we will explore in our empirical work.

      We close the model by assuming that new …rms enter at the exogenous ‡ow rate x > 0, and
entry corresponds to a (radical) innovation over an existing product line uniformly at random,
which thus initiates a new technology cluster. We further assume that immediately after entry, a
…rm’s type is also drawn at random. In particular, successful entrant is high-type,                     =   H,    with
probability       2 (0; 1), and is low-type,        =    L    (= 0), with the complementary probability, 1            .
Thereafter, …rm type (corporate culture) evolves according to the Markov chain described above.

2.4      Value Functions and Firm Maximization

Recall that a …rm makes the innovation decision in each of its product lines to maximize its present
discounted value, which we denote by W (!
                                        q ;n!) where s 2 fH; Lg, !

            ! is the vector of the number of incremental innovations in each of these product lines,

      Here and elsewhere, we suppress time as an explicit argument of the value functions to simplify notation.

We can explain the right-hand side of this value function as follows: for each product line m =
1; :::; mf , the …rm receives a revenue stream of              qf;jm as a function of its productivity in this
product line, qf;jm . In addition, it has a choice of the age of the manager it will hire to operate
this product line (formally choosing a 2 R+ [ f;g, which is suppressed to save on notation),
and if the manager’s age is a, it will have additional revenue/cost savings of qt f (a) and pay the
market price for such a manager of age a at time t, wa;t . Summing over all of its product lines
gives the current revenues of the …rm. In addition, the …rm can undertake an innovation on the
basis of each of its active product lines. Since we are looking at a low-type …rm, all innovations
will be incremental, thus arriving at the rate . When such an innovation happens in product
line m that has already undergone nf;jm incremental innovations, the mth element of !
                                                                                    qf changes
from qf;jm to qf;jm +           and n goes up by one. We represent this with the arguments of the
                              nf;jm +1   n                o
                            !                                !n fn

                                             !   !
relinquishes its current value function W (q ; n )). The …rm might also lose one of its currently

active product lines to creative destruction, which happens at the endogenous rate              (which will
be determined in Section 2.6), and in that case, the …rm’s value function changes from WL (!             !)
                                                                                                    qf ; n f

to WL (qf n fqf;jm g ; nf n fnf;jm g) (i.e., qf changes qf n fqf;jm g and nf to nf n fnf;jm g). Finally, the
last term is due to the fact that a low-type …rm switches to high-type at the ‡ow rate ', in which
case it relinquishes its current value function and begets the value function of a high-type …rm,
W (!

The intuition for this value function is very similar to (5) except for the possibility of a radical
innovation. In particular, for each product line m, this high-type …rm has a radical innovation at the
‡ow rate           H   regardless of its innovation strategy. In addition it has a choice between incremental
and radical innovation, represented by the outer maximization. The …rst option here is choosing
incremental innovation for product line m and is thus similar to the …rst line of (5). The second

                                                          14
option is radical innovation, and in this case the trade-o¤ involved in the age of the manager is
di¤erent, since manager age a¤ects the arrival rate of radical innovations as shown in (4). In the case
of a successful radical innovation, the value of the …rm changes to EW !   q [ q0+H       f;n! [ f0g ,
                                                                                                   j        0       f

where the expectation is over a product line drawn uniformly at random upon which the radical
innovation will build.
    The next proposition shows that, as in Klette and Kortum (2004) and Acemoglu et al. (2013),
these value functions can be decomposed into sums of value functions de…ned at the product-line
level.

where EVH (qt ) denotes the expected value of a radical innovation when the aggregate technology
level is qt .

    Proof. Both of these value functions can be derived straightforwardly by conjecturing the
above forms and verifying the conjecture.

2.5      Stationary Equilibrium With              =1

We now characterize the stationary equilibrium of this economy in the case where                                = 1— so that
all current innovations build on current technology, qt (and not on the current productivity of the
existing technology cluster). This assumption considerably simpli…es the analysis, and we return
to the general case where       < 1 below.

                                                     15
Value Functions in Stationary Equilibrium A stationary equilibrium is de…ned as an equilib-
rium in which aggregate output, Yt , grows at a constant rate g, and the distribution of product lines
between high- and low-type …rms and over the prior number of incremental innovations remains
stationary.
   As noted above, …rms decide the age of the manager to hire for each of the product lines they
are operating and whether to engage in a radical or incremental innovation. Let us …rst consider
the value of a product line for a low-type …rm. From Proposition 1, we can focus on the decisions
and the value function of such a …rm at the product line level, and the relevant value function is
given by (7).
   Since some …rms will not hire managers (as M < 1), all …rms not undertaking radical innovations
must be indi¤erent between hiring and not hiring a manager, which implies that the equilibrium
wage for managers, employed by …rms engaged in incremental innovations, satis…es the boundary
condition:
                                                wa;t = qt f (a) :                                         (9)

Substituting the equilibrium wage (9) into (7), we obtain a simpli…ed value function for low-type
…rms as

              rVL (qj ; n)    V_ L (qj ; n) =   qj +    V L qj + qt       n+1
                                                                                ;n + 1     VL (qj ; n)
                                                 VL (qj ; n) + ' [VH (qj ; n)       VL (qj ; n)] :

   Solving this value function gives an explicit characterization of the value function of low-type
…rms as shown in the next proposition.


Proposition 2 Let us assume that the value function for a high-type …rm takes the following form:
                    ~ (n) qt : Then the value function of a product line operated by a low-type …rm,
VH (qj ; n) = Aqj + B
(7) takes the following form
                                          VL (qj ; n) = Aqj + B (n) qt                                   (10)

where
                A            ; [r   g + + + '] B (n) = A            n+1      ~ (n) + B (n + 1) ;
                                                                          + 'B
                     r+
    ~
and B(n) is de…ned in Proposition 3 below.

   Proof. See the Appendix.
   The form of the value function in (10) is intuitive. It depends linearly on current productivity,
qj , since this determines the current ‡ow of pro…ts. It also depends on current economy-wide tech-
nology, qt , since all innovations, including incremental ones, build on this. Finally, it is decreasing

                                                       16
in n (because B(n) is decreasing) since a higher n implies that the next incremental innovation
will increase productivity by less— and incremental innovation is the only type of innovation that
a low-type …rm can undertake.
       We next turn to the value of a product line operated by a high-type …rm, which di¤ers from
(7) because high-type …rms have to decide whether to engage in incremental or radical innovation,
given by (8) above. Because (4) implies that younger managers have comparative advantage in
radical innovation, it follows straightforwardly that there will exist a maximum age a such that
only managers below this age will work in …rms attempting radical innovation. Moreover, the
maximization over the age of the manager in (8) implies that such a …rm must be indi¤erent
between hiring any manager younger than a . This implies:

                                a                                                  a
           qt f (a ) +     Hq       EVH (qt )    wa   ;t   = qt f (a) +       Hq       EVH (qt )   wa;t for all a < a :

Note that the oldest manager hired for radical innovation earns (from expression (9))

                                                      wa     ;t   = qt f (a ) :

Hence                                8
                                     <                     qt f (a)                        for a > a
                          wa;t =                                                                         :                (11)
                                     :                          a
                                         qt f (a) +        H [q       q a ] EVH (qt ) for a         a
This wage schedule highlights that, in general, younger or older managers might be paid more
(this will depend on the f function). Younger managers have a comparative advantage in radical
innovation, but older managers might be more productive in operating …rms.14
       Now substituting for (11) in (8), we obtain a simpli…ed form of the value function of a product
line operated by a high-type …rm as

                                                            qj +VH qj + qt n+1 ; n + 1  VH (qj ; n) ;
         rVH (qj ; n)    V_ H (qj ; n) = max                                    a
                                                                     qj + H q EVH (qt )
                                                  VH (qj ; n) +    H EVH (qt ):


       We next characterize the solution to this value function and also determine the allocation of
managers to di¤erent product lines (and to incremental and radical innovations).

Proposition 3 The value function in (8) takes the following form

                                                                       ~ (n) ;
                                                VH (qj ; n) = Aqj + qt B                                                  (12)
  14
    The evidence in Galenson and Weinberg (1999, 2001), Weinberg and Galenson (2005) and Jones and Weinberg
(2011) is consistent with the possibility that either younger or older creative workers might be more productive.

   Proof. See the Appendix.
   The intuition for this high-type value function is similar to that for Proposition 2, except that
the dependence on the number of prior innovations in the current technology cluster, n, is more
complicated since when n exceeds n , a high-type …rm will switch to radical innovation (and from
that point on n will no longer be relevant). This critical value n is given by (14), which designates
the smallest integer after n0 where n0 equates the value of attempting an additional incremental
innovation to the value of attempting a radical innovation (the notation dne denotes the next integer
after n).
   It is also worth noting that this threshold, n , is constant in the stationary equilibrium. This is
because the value function increases linearly in qt , but the knowledge stock and wages of managers
also increase linearly, and in the stationary equilibrium, these two forces balance out, ensuring that
n is constant while VH increases linearly in qt .
   Given the form of VH , EVH (qt ), the value of a new radical innovation, can be written as
                                                h                       i

                                                    v qt ;

where the last line de…nes v. Then the equilibrium wage schedule simpli…es to:

                                 [f (a) + H (q a q a )v]qt for a a

and is thus also linear in qt .


Equilibrium Characterization The next proposition provides the characterization of the sta-
tionary equilibrium.


                                                             18
Proposition 4 Low-type …rms (those with          =   L)   always hire “old” managers (those with a > a
or b < bt ), pursue incremental innovations and never generate radical innovations.
   High-type …rms (those with     =    H)   pursue incremental innovations on product lines less than
n prior incremental innovations, where n is given by (14), and hire “old” managers (those with
a > a or b < bt ). They pursue radical innovations on product lines with more than n and hire
“young” managers (those with a        a or b    bt ).
   A lower    (corresponding to the society being less permissive to radical innovations) will increase
n (so that a lower fraction of high-type …rms will pursue radical innovation), and will reduce the
wages of young managers (because there is less demand for the knowledge of young managers).

   Proof. This result directly follows from Propositions 2 and 3.


Empirical Implications       Our empirical work is inspired by Proposition 4. As explained above,
radical innovations will be associated with greater indices of our measures of creative innovations
(innovation quality, tail innovations, superstar fraction, and generality). We will …rst investigate
the cross-sectional relationship between manager (CEO) age and creative innovations. In these
cross-sectional regressions, manager age is taken to be a proxy of a corporate culture that is more
open to disruption. Therefore, from Proposition 4, we expect a negative cross-sectional relationship
between manager age and creative innovations. As just stressed, this cross-sectional relationship
does not correspond to the “causal e¤ect”of manager age on creativity of innovations (which would
apply if we varied manager age holding the …rm’s corporate culture constant); in particular, it also
re‡ects the sorting of younger managers to corporate cultures that are open to disruption (and thus
more conducive to creative innovations).
   Our model also has longitudinal implications— that is, implications about how manager age and
creativity of innovations vary over time at the …rm level— which shed further light on the relative
magnitudes of the sorting and the causal e¤ects. To understand these implications, let us consider
the innovation dynamics of …rms implied by Proposition 4.
   Recall that low-type …rms always engage in incremental innovations and never generate radical
innovations. In contrast, high-type …rms may attempt a radical innovation depending on how many
prior incremental innovations they have had on a product line.

     For product line with n < n , a high-type …rm hires an old manager (or keeps its already
     existing old manager), and pursues an incremental innovation strategy. Given the technology
     speci…ed above, however, such a …rm still generates radical innovations at the rate          H.


     For a product line with n        n , a high-type …rm hires a young manager and engages in
     radical innovation. In this case, the average rate of radical innovation across product lines

                                                     19
      with n      n and operated by high-type …rms can be computed using the aforementioned fact
      that the age distribution of managers is given by the exponential distribution, as
                                         Z   a                                                  (g+ )a
                                  1                 a                         H    1        e
                          H   +                  H q dF (a) =        H   +                          a
                                                                                                             :         (16)
                                F (a )   0                                   g+        [1       e       ]

    Now consider a low-type …rm that switches to high-type, and to simplify the discussion, suppose
that it has a unique product line. Then, if this product line has had n < n incremental innovations,
the …rm will continue to pursue an incremental innovation strategy, keeping its old manager.15 In
the process, it will generate radical/creative innovations at the ‡ow rate                          H   as noted above.
When it reaches n = n ; it will hire a young manager, switch to a radical innovation strategy, and
at that point, its rate of radical/creative innovations will increase, on average, from                           H   to the
expression in (16). In contrast, if the product line of the …rm at the time of switching to high-type
has had n      n incremental innovations, it will immediately hire a young manager, pursue a radical
innovation strategy, and have radical innovations at the ‡ow rate (16).
    This discussion implies that when we focus on the relationship between within-…rm changes
in manager age and creative innovations, we expect to …nd two regularities. First, when a …rm
switches from an older to a younger manager, this should be associated with an increase in creative
innovations. Second, …rms that switch from an older to a younger manager should, on average,
experience an increase in creative innovations even before the switch. Namely, before the actual
switch to a younger manager, the increase in creative innovations approximately corresponds to
     H,   whereas following the switch to a younger manager, there will be a further increase in
creative innovations corresponding to the second term in (16). Note, however, that even this
further increase following the switch to a younger manager does not correspond to the causal e¤ect
of manager age on creative innovations for several reasons; …rst, for …rms with n                           n , both events
will be taking place at the same time; second, even for …rms with n < n , the impact following
the switch to a younger manager still contains the sorting e¤ect and also depends on the matching
patterns between managers and …rms as indicated by the presence of the terms representing the age
distribution of managers; and third, strictly speaking to obtain the causal e¤ect, we need to keep
the …rm type and number of prior incremental innovations constant, and just change (exogenously)
manager age— and this is the exercise will will perform in Section 4.4 below.
    Finally, though we will not be able to investigate this directly in our empirical work, the
implications of changes in         are interesting. A lower value of this parameter naturally reduces
radical innovations and, at the same time, decreases the wages of young managers, thus making it
look like the society is discriminating against the young; but in fact this is a consequence of the
 15
    Strictly speaking this is true under an in…nitesimal cost of replacing managers. Otherwise, it could …re its old
manager and hire another old manager, with no impact on our results or discussion here.

2.6      General Equilibrium and the Stationary Distribution of Products

We next characterize the stationary distribution of product lines in this economy in terms of the
types of their owners and also in terms of the prior number of incremental innovations, and then
use these distributions to determine the aggregate growth rate of the economy in the stationary
equilibrium.
       Let us next denote the fraction of product lines occupied by s-type …rms (for s 2 fL; Hg)
with n prior incremental innovations by        s    (these are not functions of time as we are focusing on
                                               n
a stationary equilibrium). Let us also denote the total creative destruction from s-type …rms by
 s.    The stationary distribution of product lines is determined by standard ‡ow equations equating
in‡ows and out‡ows from each state. For high types, these take the form

Consider the …rst line corresponding to n = 0. Out‡ows from this state, products with n = 0
operated by high-type …rms, come from two sources. First, there is creative destruction coming
from low-type …rms, which takes place at the rate             L   per product line (and hence multiplied by
 H ).   Second, the high-type …rm operating this product line has a successful incremental innovation,
 0
which takes place at the rate         (similarly multiplied by        H ).   In‡ows into this state are due to
                                                                      0
creative destruction coming from the high-type …rm, which takes place at the rate               H   (multiplied
by the fraction of all product lines except those that are already in this state, thus 1               H   ), or
                                                                                                       0
due to a low-type …rm operating a product line at n = 0 changing its type to high, which adds the
‡ow rate '     L.   The other lines are explained similarly, except that creative destruction coming from
               0
high-type …rms also generates out‡ows for n > 1, and there is no in‡ow coming from incremental
innovations for product lines with n > n since high-type …rms switch to radical innovation at
n = n .16
       The ‡ow equations for the low-type product lines can be written similarly and have a similar
intuition
                           Outflow                          Inflow
                                H + +'          L     =     (1   L)    L     for   n=0 :
                                                0                0
                            L+ H + +'           L     =       L              for   n>0

  16
    These equations are written under the assumption that n > 0: When n = 0; high-type …rms never undertake
incremental innovations, and thus the ‡ow equations become L H  0 = (1
                                                                         H

                                                       21
The creative destruction rates from low-type and high-type …rms, in turn, can be computed as
                                               Z a                        X1
             L                     H                     a                        H
               = x (1     ) and       =x +M           H q dF (a) +     H          n;
                                                                0                                             n=0

where x is the entry rate, F (a) denotes the stationary distribution of manager age, a is the thresh-
                                                                                         P1      H
old below which managers are hired by …rms to perform radical innovations, and         H    n=0 n is
the rate of radical innovations for high-type …rms which applies regardless of whether they pursue
a radical innovation strategy. Low-type …rms, on the other hand, generate creative destruction
only when they initially enter the economy (since they do not engage in radical innovation). Given
these quantities, the total creative destruction rate of the economy is given as
                                                            L         H
                                                        =       +         :

    To derive the aggregate growth rate, we combine (1) with (2) to obtain
                                                                              1
                                                    L       (1         )
                                          Y =                                       q:
                                                1
    The growth rate of the economy is then equal to the growth of the average quality qt . After a
time interval        t > 0, the average quality is given by
                                                 Xn 1                                 X1
                                                           H              n+1                      L n+1
               qt+    t = qt + qt    t + qt    t           n                      +                n          + o( t);
                                                        n=0                              n=0

where we have used the fact that all radical innovations come from creative destruction, which
takes place at the rate , and o( t) denotes terms that are second order in                                    t. The growth rate
of the economy in the stationary equilibrium can then be computed as
                                     Xn 1              X1
                                               H n+1           L n+1
                        g=     +               n     +         n     :                                                        (17)
                                                n=0                                n=0


2.7    Equilibrium With              <1

In this subsection, we turn to the general case with                          < 1. We will show that the structure of
the equilibrium is similar, except that now the switch to radical innovation for high-type …rms will
depend both on their current productivity and on their prior incremental innovations.
    The value of a product line operated by low- and high-type …rms can now be written, respec-
tively, as:

rVL (qj ; n)     V_ L (qj ; n) = maxa f qj + qt f (a)               wa;t g +          V L qj +      n+1 ; n   +1    VL (qj ; n)
                                     VL (qj ; n) + ' [VH (qj ; n)                 VL (qj ; n)] ;
                                and 8                                                                                                 9
                                    <                                                              VH qj + n+1 ; n + 1                =
                                            qj + maxa qt f (a)                    wa;t +                                          ;
rVH (qj ; n)    V_ H (qj ; n) = max                                                                      VH (qj ; n)
                                    :                                                                  a                              ;
                                                   qj + maxa 0 fqt f (a) +                          H q EVH (t)   wa;t g
                                     VH (qj ; n) +     H EVH (t):


                                                            22
Here note that, with a slight abuse of notation, we wrote EVH (t) instead of EVH (qt ) for the value
of a new radical innovation, since this depends in general not just on average current productivity
in the economy, qt , but also on the distribution of product lines across di¤erent states. All the
same, in the stationary equilibrium it will clearly grow at the same rate as qt , g. Second,               n   is now
a function of both the current productivity of the …rm and the average current productivity in the
economy, qt .
       With an argument similar to that in the previous subsection, the equilibrium wage schedule for
managers will be given by
                                  8
                                  <                f (a) qt                   for a > a
                         wa;t =
                                  :
                                      f (a) qt +   H    qa     qa   EVH (t) for a         a

This enables us to write simpli…ed versions of the value functions as:

                 rVL (qj ; n)   V_ L (qj ; n) =    qj +        VL qj +   n+1 ; n   +1     VL (qj ; n)
                                                       VL (qj ; n) + ' [VH (qj ; n)     VL (qj ; n)]

and

                                                       qj +  VH qj + n+1 ; n + 1  VH (qj ; n) ;
          rVH (qj ; n)   V_ H (qj ; n) = max                               a
                                                                 qj + H q EVH (t)
                                               VH (qj ; n) +    H EVH (t):


Proposition 5 Consider the economy with                  < 1. Then, for a product line with current quality
q operated by a high-type …rm, the manager will be younger and will pursue radical innovation
when the number of prior incremental innovations is greater than or equal to nt (q), where nt (q)
is increasing in q. That is, a high-type …rm is more likely to pursue radical innovation when its
current productivity is lower and the number of its prior innovations in the same cluster is higher.

       Proof. See the Appendix.
       This proposition thus establishes that in this generalized setup (with                 < 1), the main results
from Proposition 4 continue to hold, but in addition we obtain the result that radical innovation is
more likely when a high-type …rm has lower current productivity (conditional on its prior number
of incremental innovations); or conversely, for a given level of productivity, it is more likely when
there has been a greater number of prior incremental innovations. We will investigate this additional
implication in our …rm-level analysis.17
  17
    This result is related to the idea of “disruptive innovations” proposed in Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma
(1997). This result also clari…es that our potential answer to the innovator’s dilemma, consistent both with Arrow’s
replacement e¤ect and the results presented below, is that successful …rms with higher sales have more to fear from
disruptive innovations and tend to retrench and become less open to new ideas, practices and innovations.

3         Data and Variable Construction

In this section, we describe the various datasets we use and our data construction. We also provide
some basic descriptive statistics.

3.1         Data Sources

USPTO Utility Patents Grant Data (PDP)                            The patent grant data are obtained from the
NBER Patent Database Project (PDP) and contain data for all 3,279,509 utility patents granted
between the years 1976-2006 by the United States Patent and Trademark O¢ ce (USPTO). This
dataset contains extensive information on each granted patent, including the unique patent number,
a unique identi…er for the assignee, the nationality of the assignee, the technology class, and back-
ward and forward citations in the sample up to 2006. Following a dynamic assignment procedure,
we link this dataset to the Compustat dataset, which we next describe.18


Compustat North American Fundamentals We draw our main sample from the Compustat
data for publicly traded …rms in North America. This data set contains balance sheet items reported
by the companies annually between 1974 and 2006. It contains 29,378 di¤erent companies, and
390,467 company             year observations. The main variables of interest are net sales, employment,
…rm age (de…ned as time since entry into the Compustat sample), SIC code, R&D expenditures,
total liabilities, net income, and plant property and equipment as a proxy for physical capital.


Executive Compensation Data (Execucomp)                           Standard and Poor’s Execucomp provides in-
formation on the age of the top executives of a company starting from 1992. We use information
on CEO age or the average age of (top) managers of a company to construct proxies for openness
to disruption at the …rm level.19


The Careers and Co-Authorship Networks of U.S. Patent Inventors Extensive informa-
tion on the inventors of patents granted in the United States between years 1975-2008 is obtained
from Lai et. al.’s (2009) dataset. These authors use inventor names and addresses as well as patent
characteristics to generate unique inventor identi…ers upon which we heavily draw. Their dataset
contains 8,031,908 observations at the patent               inventor level, and 2,229,219 unique inventors, and
can be linked to the PDP dataset using the unique patent number assigned by the USPTO.


Cross-Country Data on Manager Age                         We also collected data on the age of the CEOs and
CFOs of the 25 largest listed companies for 37 countries. We selected the top 25 companies,
    18
         Details on the assignment procedure are provided at https://sites.google.com/site/patentdataproject/.
    19
         We drop observations where reported CEO age is less than 26.


                                                            24
when available, according to the Financial Times’FT-500 list, which ranks …rms according to their
market capitalization. We completed the list by using information from transnationale.org when
the FT-500 did not include 25 companies for a country. We then obtained the age of the CEOs
and CFOs from the websites of the companies. Overall, our dataset has on average 20 companies
and 31:6 managers (CEO or CFO) per country.


National Culture Dimensions                   The Dutch social scientist Geert Hofstede devised …ve di¤erent
indices of national culture: power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femi-
ninity, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation. The initial survey was conducted among
IBM employees in 30 countries to understand cross-country di¤erences in corporate culture. This
work has been expanded with additional surveys that have been answered by members of other
professions and expanded to 80 countries (see Hofstede, 2001, and Hofstede et al., 2010).20 We use
the individualism and uncertainty avoidance measures below.
          The individualism measure is de…ned as “a preference for a loosely-knit social framework in
which individuals are expected to take care of themselves and their immediate families only.” A
low individualism score is indicative of a more collectivist society, where social safety networks are
more common and individuals are in‡uenced by collective goals and constraints.
          The uncertainty avoidance measure expresses the degree to which the members of a society seek
to avoid uncertainty and ambiguity. Countries with a higher score are more rigid in terms of belief
and behavior and are more intolerant of unorthodox ideas. On the other end of the spectrum,
societies with a low score are more welcoming to new ideas and value practice above principles.
Both the individualism and the uncertainty avoidance indices are normalized to lie between 0 and
1.


Other Data Sources                We use the average years of schooling in secondary education from the
Barro-Lee dataset as a proxy of the human capital of a country.21 We also use real GDP per capita
numbers and R&D intensity from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators database.
          In our baseline analysis, we focus on a balanced panel of …rms, with complete information on
all variables used in our cross-sectional analysis. To maximize the number of observations in this
balanced panel, we focus on the years between 1995 and 2000, so citation and patents information
in our baseline results come from 1995-2000 (with patents classi…ed according to their year of
application). We then extend our analysis to an unbalanced panel spanning 1992-2004 (we cannot
go earlier than 1992 because our manager age data start at the state, and we cannot go further than

from 1995-2000 in our cross-country analysis.

3.2   Variable Construction

Innovation Quality      Our baseline measure of innovation quality is the number of citations a
patent received as of 2006. We also use the truncation correction weights devised by Hall, Ja¤e,
and Trajtenberg (2001) to correct for systematic citation di¤erences across di¤erent technology
classes and also for the fact that earlier patents will have more years during which they can receive
citations (we also experiment with counting citations during a …ve-year window for each patent).
Based on this variable, an average innovation quality variable is generated at the company      year
and country     year levels. For our cross-country dataset, the country of the assignee is used to
determine the country to which the patent belongs.


Superstar Fraction      A superstar inventor is de…ned as an inventor who surpasses his or her peers
in the quality of patents generated as observed in the sample. A score for each unique inventor
is generated by calculating the average quality of all the patents in which the inventor took part.
All inventors are ranked according to this score, and the top 5% are considered to be superstar
inventors. The superstar fraction of a company or country in a given year is calculated as the
fraction of patents with superstar inventors in that year (if a patent has more than one inventor, it
gets a fractional superstar designation equal to the ratio of superstar inventors to the total number
of inventors of the patent). The country of the inventor is determined according to the country of
the patent assignee.


Tail Innovations The tail innovation index is de…ned as the fraction of patents of a …rm or
country that receive more than a certain number of citations (once again using the truncation
correction weights of Hall, Ja¤e and Trajtenberg, 2001). Namely, let sf t (p) denote the number
of the patents of a …rm (or country) that are above the pth percentile of the year t distribution
according to citations. Then, the tail innovation index is de…ned as

                                                        sf t (p)
                                       Tailf t (p) =               ;
                                                       sf t (0:50)

where p > 0:50. This is of course also equivalent to the ratio of the number of patents by …rm f at
time t with citations above the pth percentile divided by the number of patents by …rm f at time
t with citations above the median (and is not de…ned for …rms that have no patents with citations
above the median). For our baseline measure of tail innovations, we choose p = 0:99, so that our
measure is the fraction of patents of a …rm or country that are at the 99th percentile of citations


                                                  26
divided by the fraction of patents that are at the median of citations. The reason we include
sf t (0:50) in the denominator is that we would like to capture whether, controlling for “average”
innovation output, some companies, innovators or countries have the tendency for generating “tail
innovations” with very high citations.22


Generality and Originality We also use the generality and originality indices devised by Hall,
Ja¤e and Trajtenberg (2001). Let i 2 I denote a technology class and sij 2 [0; 1] denote the share
                                                                                      P
of citations that patent j receives from patents in technology class i (of course with i2I sij = 1).
Then for a patent j with positive citations, we de…ne
                                                                  X
                                            generalityj = 1             s2ij :
                                                                  i2I

This index thus measures the dispersion of the citations received by a patent in terms of the
technology classes of citing patents. Greater dispersion of citations is interpreted as a sign of
greater generality. The originality index is de…ned similarly except that we use the citations it
gives to other patents. Both indices are averaged across all of the patents of a …rm or a country to
obtain our …rm-level and cross-country generality and originality indices. The patent classes used
are the 80 two-digit International Patent Classi…cation (IPC) classes.

3.3      Descriptive Statistics

Panel A of Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for our balanced …rm, unbalanced …rm and cross-
country samples. Since we focus on regressions weighted by the number of patents held by a
company or country, all statistics are weighted by the number of patents. We multiply our indices
for tail innovation, superstar fraction, generality, and R&D intensity by 100.
       The table shows that average manager age is 52:3 in our …rm-level (balanced or unbalanced
Compustat) sample and 56:1 in our cross-country sample, while average CEO age is 55:3 in the
balanced sample and 55:5 in the unbalanced sample. The comparison of our average number
of citations per patent, superstar fraction, tail innovation, and generality indices shows that, as
expected, our Compustat …rms have higher values than the average country.
       Panels B and C present the …rm-level and cross-section country correlations between our main
measures of creativity of innovations, which are quite highly correlated except for the generality
index at the …rm level. Panel D of Table 1 presents the correlation between our three cross-country
indices of openness to disruption. These three indices are also highly correlated.
  22
     If we do not include the correction in the denominator, all of the results reported below continue to hold, and
are in fact stronger. When we turn to patent-level regressions, we will not be able to include such a correction (since
there are no other patents that can be included in the denominator).




                                                          27
4         Firm-Level and Patent-Level Results

Our main empirical results exploit …rm-level variation in manager age across Compustat compa-
nies. Recall that in our theory manager age is in part an indicator of a corporate culture that
is open to disruption (because high-type …rms that have a competitive advantage in radical in-
novation select to hire younger managers). But there is also a causal e¤ect of manager age on
creative innovations since, conditional on being employed by such a …rm, a young manager con-
tributes to radical/creative innovations (because of her more recent knowledge stock). Motivated
by this reasoning, in this section we start with the cross-sectional relationship between …rm-level
measures of creative innovations and manager age (emphasizing throughout that our estimates do
not necessarily correspond to the causal e¤ect of manager age on creative innovations).23 We then
turn to a more direct investigation of the e¤ect of manager age on creative innovations, focusing
on regressions that exploit “within-…rm” variation, and also investigate the timing of increases in
creative innovations at the …rm level and the relationship of this to our structural parameters.

4.1        Baseline Results

Our baseline results are presented in Table 2. Our estimating equation is

                                         yf = mf + X0f          +   i(f )   + "f ;                                  (18)

where yf is one of our measures of creative innovations introduced in the previous section (innovation
quality, superstar fraction, tail innovation, or generality) for …rm f , and mf is our …rm-level measure
of openness to disruption, the average age of company CEOs over our sample window. In addition,
Xf is a vector of controls, in this case, …rm age, log of employment, log of sales, and log of total
number of patents during our time window (we do not have measures of the human capital of the
…rm’s employees).24 Controlling for …rm age is particularly important to distinguish the correlation
of creativity of innovations with manager age from its correlation with …rm age. In addition,                        i(f )

denotes a full set of four-digit main SIC dummies, so that the comparisons are always across …rms
within a fairly narrow industry.25 Finally, "f is the error term.
         Our baseline sample comprises 279 …rms with complete information on CEO and positive patents
between 1995 and 2000 (as well as information on …rm age, sales, and employment). As noted above,
we …rst exploit only cross-sectional information, so our regressions have one observation per …rm,
    23
     Another caveat is that our theoretical results relate manager age at the product-line level to the innovation
strategy and creativity of innovations, while the bulk of our empirical analysis in this section will be at the …rm level
focusing on the age of a …rm’s CEO (or top managers).
  24
     Our log employment and log sales variables in the cross-sectional regressions are computed as averages of annual
log employment and log sales.
  25
     All …rms in our baseline sample are in one of 120 four-digit SIC industries.



                                                           28
and are weighted with the total patent count of the …rm, so that they put less weight on observations
for which our measures of creative innovations are computed from only a few patents. All standard
errors are robust against heteroscedasticity. Di¤erent columns of Table 2 correspond to our four
di¤erent measures of creative innovations.
   Column 1 shows an economically sizable correlation between CEO age and our measure of
innovation quality (average number of citations per patent). The coe¢ cient estimate,          0:278
(standard error = 0:088), is statistically signi…cant at 1% and indicates that companies with a
younger CEO have greater innovation quality. We interpret this pattern as evidence that companies
that are more open to disruption tend to be the ones producing more creative innovations. The
quantitative magnitudes are signi…cant and also plausible. For example, a one-year increase in
CEO age is associated with a 0:278 increase in average citations, which is approximately 1.3% of
the …rm-level weighted mean of our innovation quality variable (20.5).
   The pattern of the covariates is also interesting. Firm age is negatively associated with innova-
tion quality, suggesting that younger …rms are more creative (though this pattern is not as robust
as the impact of CEO age in other speci…cations). Our measures of creative innovations are also
uncorrelated with employment and sales, and are largely uncorrelated with the number of patents
held by the …rm (the exception being a marginally signi…cant relationship for tail innovations). This
con…rms that our measures of creativity of innovations are quite distinct from the total number of
patents.
   Column 2 shows a similar relationship with the superstar fraction ( 0:300, standard error =
0:141). This also suggests that younger CEOs tend to work with higher-quality innovators (a
relationship we directly investigate in Table 9 below). Columns 3 and 4 show even more precisely
estimated (signi…cant at 1% or less) and economically large relationships with our measures of
tail innovations and generality. The implied quantitative magnitudes are a little larger with the
superstar fraction and tail innovation measures (a one-year increase in CEO age is associated with,
respectively, 2.4% and 5.5% increases relative to weighted sample means in these two measures).
   Overall, these results suggest that there is a strong statistical and quantitative relationship
between the age of the CEO of a Compustat company and each one of our four measures of
creative innovations. We next investigate the robustness of these patterns.

4.2   Robustness

Tables 3 and 4 probe the robustness of our …rm-level results in di¤erent dimensions. Table 3
looks at the alternative measures of creative innovations (these are a measure of innovation quality
using average citations per patent computed using only …ve years of citations data, a measure
of superstar inventors using information on the most highly cited patent of the inventor, the tail


                                                 29
innovation index with p = 0:90, and the originality index). The results show that the pattern is
quite similar to those in Table 2, except that the relationship is no longer statistically signi…cant
with the alternative measure of the superstar fraction.
      Table 4 looks at several di¤erent robustness exercises. Panel A replaces the four-digit SIC
dummies with three-digit dummies (a total of 84 in our baseline sample), with e¤ects very similar
to our baseline results.
      Panel B goes in the opposite direction and enriches the set of controls. In particular, this
speci…cation, in addition to the four-digit SIC dummies, includes several other …rm-level controls:
pro…tability (income to sales ratio), debt to sales ratio, and log physical capital of the …rm. The
results are virtually the same as those in Table 2, but a little more precisely estimated. For example,
CEO age is statistically signi…cant at less than 1% with all of our measures of creative innovations,
except for the superstar fraction, for which it is signi…cant at 5%.
      Panel C, in addition, adds R&D intensity (R&D to sales ratio) to the previous speci…cation.26
This is intended to verify that our results cannot be explained by some …rms performing more R&D
than others (here the sample declines to 257 companies). The results are once again very similar
to those in our baseline regressions in Table 2.
      Panel D uses the average age of the top management team rather than CEO age. We prefer CEO
age as our baseline measure because across companies there is considerable variation in the number
of managers for which age data are available, making this measure potentially less comparable
across …rms. Nevertheless, the relationship is very similar to this measure as shown in Panel D.
      Panels E and F reestimate the speci…cations in Table 2 for subsamples of high-tech and low-tech
…rms, where high-tech …rms are those in SIC 35 and 36 (industrial and commercial machinery and
equipment and computer equipment; and electronic and other electrical equipment and compo-
nents), and low-tech …rms are the rest. This is intended to check whether our results are driven
by a subset of …rms and whether they are di¤erential between these two subsamples. The results
are fairly similar in these two subsamples, except for the superstar fraction variable, which shows
a considerably stronger relationship for the low-tech sample.

4.3      Panel Results

We now show that, though naturally much noisier, the correlation between CEO age and creative
innovations is present when we exploit within-…rm variation in the age of the CEO. We will also
document, however, that consistent with our theory, creative innovations start increasing before
there is a decline in CEO age.
      With this objective in mind, in Table 5 we start with our baseline balanced sample, but now we
 26
      To deal with outliers in R&D expenditures, we winsorize this variable at its 99th percentile value.


                                                           30
compute our measures of creativity of innovations at an annual frequency. The covariates we use
are also at an annual frequency and include a full set of year dummies. As a …rst step, in Panel A,
we maintain our key right-hand-side variable, average CEO age over the sample period, which is
thus held constant across years in this panel. In this table, standard errors are robust for arbitrary
heteroscedasticity at the …rm level (thus allowing for arbitrary dependence across the observations
for the same …rm). These speci…cations are directly comparable to those in Table 2, and indeed,
the coe¢ cient estimates and standard errors are very similar (though they are not identical since
the covariates are now time-varying).27
       Panel B extends our sample in two di¤erent ways. First, we include …rms that were left out of
the balanced panel (i.e., …rms for which CEO age or patent information is available in some but
not all years). Second, with the unbalanced panel, we can now consider a longer sample spanning
1992 2004 (we cannot go before 1992 because of lack of data on manager age, and we prefer not to
go beyond 2004, as this would make the citation window too short and thus our measures much less
reliable). The resulting sample has 7111 observations (or 5803 observations with tail innovation,
since we lose …rm-years when no patent is above the median of the citation distribution). Despite
the increase in the number of …rms to 1256 (from 279) and the addition of seven more years of
data, the results are remarkably similar to those in Panel A and to our baseline estimates.
       Panel C allows CEO age to vary across years but also includes …rm …xed e¤ects as well as
year e¤ects (and, of course, in this case, SIC industry dummies and …rm age are dropped). This
e¤ectively means that the CEO age variable is being identi…ed from changes in CEOs.28 Hence,
this is a demanding speci…cation investigating whether in years when a …rm has a younger CEO, it
tends to have more creative innovations, and this motivates our choice of focusing on the 1992 2004
sample for this exercise. In addition to throwing away all of the between-…rm variation, another
challenge to …nding meaningful results in this speci…cation is that patent applications in one year
are often the result of research and product selection from several past years.29 Though these
considerations stack the cards against …nding a signi…cant relationship between CEO age and
creative innovations, the results are generally quite consistent with our cross-sectional estimates
from the balanced panel. All of the coe¢ cient estimates in these within-…rm regressions, except for
generality, have the same sign and are statistically signi…cant as in our baseline results in Table 2.
For innovation quality, the magnitude of the estimate is about 12% larger than the speci…cation
  27
     The number of observations is now lower in columns 3 and 4 because not all …rms have patents with citations
above the median (for tail innovations) or with positive citations (for generality) in all years.
  28
     This speci…cation is related to Bertrand and Schoar’s famous (2003) paper on the e¤ect of managers on corporate
policies though, in contrast to our focus on CEOs, their sample includes chief …nancial and operating o¢ cers as well
as lower-level executives.
  29
     Recall, however, that patents are classi…ed according to their year of application, so we are investigating the
impact of CEO age not on patents granted when the CEO is in charge but on patents applied for when the CEO is
in charge.


                                                         31
without …xed e¤ects in Panel B (e.g.,          0:188 vs.     0:168), whereas for superstar fraction and tail
innovations, it is smaller— about 47% to 73% of the magnitude in Panel B.
       The current CEO/manager in‡uences the contemporaneous innovation strategy, and in our
model, this has an immediate impact on radical innovations. In practice, some of the impact
is likely to be delayed, since research projects, and even patenting, can take several years. We
may therefore expect the impact of the CEO’s human capital, decisions and age to in‡uence the
creativity of innovations over time. We investigate this issue in Panel D by including current CEO
age and lagged CEO age simultaneously. Our results show that, with all of our measures of creative
innovations (except generality), both matter with quantitatively similar magnitudes.
       A related question concerns separating the impact of the current CEO from the persistent
e¤ects of past innovations— in particular, past creativity may spill over into current creativity in
part because patents from the same project may arrive in the course of several years. We investigate
this issue by including the lagged dependent variable on the right-hand side. Though such a model,
with …xed e¤ects and lagged dependent variable, is not consistently estimated by the standard
within estimator when the coe¢ cient on the lagged dependent variable is close to 1, the results in
Panel E show that its coe¢ cient is very far from 1 and the estimates are fairly similar to those in
Panel C.30
       Finally, in Panel F we turn to the more detailed longitudinal implications of our model— that
creativity of innovations should increase, on average, before the …rm switches to a younger manager.
The simplest way of investigating this prediction is by including the lead of CEO age together with
current CEO age (similar to the speci…cation in Panel D, except that lead CEO age replaces lagged
CEO age). The speci…cations reported in Panel F show statistically signi…cant negative e¤ects
of both current and lead CEO age on the creativity of innovations (except with the generality
measure). Interestingly, and perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the magnitudes of the lead and the
contemporaneous e¤ects are quite similar. The signi…cant e¤ect of lead CEO age is prima facie
evidence of the importance of sorting of younger CEOs to …rms that are …rms that are more open
to disruption (more likely to have creative innovations).
       Although the results in Panel F suggest that both the sorting and the causal e¤ects of
CEO/manager age are important for the creativity of innovations, they do not directly trans-
late into an estimate of the impact of CEO/manager age on creative innovations for a given …rm
(because changes in CEO age are associated with changes in …rm type/corporate culture as well
as the …rm’s prior number of incremental innovations). We next turn to an indirect inference
procedure utilizing the structure of our model to obtain an estimate of the size of this causal e¤ect.
  30
    If we estimate these models using Arellano and Bond’s (1991) GMM estimators, the results are similar with
innovation quality and superstar fraction, but weaker with the tail innovation index, partly because we lose about a
quarter of our sample with these GMM models.

4.4     The Causal E¤ect of Manager Age on Creative Innovations

In this subsection, we perform a simple indirect inference exercise in order to shed further light on
the causal e¤ect of manager age on creative innovations. We choose the parameters of the model
presented in Section 2 so that the model quantitatively matches the reduced-form estimates— in
particular, the coe¢ cients of lead and current CEO age for innovation quality. We then use these
implied parameters to compute the implied causal e¤ect of manager age on creative innovations
given these parameters.

                                                  . Because of the sorting of younger managers to …rms
                                     [1 e a ]
that are more open to disruption, we cannot read o¤ this quantity from our reduced-form empirical
exercise. Rather, we need to obtain estimates of the parameters          and   H   (the parameters    and
 H    do not matter separately, and thus in what follows, we will treat        H   as a single parameter).
The reduced-form coe¢ cient estimates are functions of these parameters, but they also depend on
the transitions between high-type and low-type …rms, the distribution of incremental innovations
per product relative to the threshold for radical innovation, n , and the stationary distributions
theoretically characterized above.
     Though structurally estimating all of the underlying parameters of our model would require
more information on …rm transitions and stationary distributions, we can obtain estimates of the
structural parameters that are relevant for the extent of the causal e¤ect of CEO age on creative
innovations from a simple indirect inference exercise. For this exercise, we set the discount rate
to     = 0:02, and normalize the pro…t ‡ow to           = 1 (which is without loss of any generality).
We …t an exponential distribution to the age distribution of managers in our sample to obtain an
estimate of     in the model. We take the entry rate to be x = 5% which corresponds to the entry
rate in our Compustat sample. Finally, we take the parameter             , which determines how rapidly
the productivity of incremental innovations declines from Akcigit and Kerr (2015), who estimate a
similar parameter from the patent citation distribution.
     This leaves the following parameter vector         f ; ';   H;   ; ; g to be determined. Once these
parameter values have also been …xed, optimal innovation decisions and equilibrium stationary
distributions can be computed using the expressions provided in Section 2. We can then generate
simulated …rm histories from which the equivalents of the reduced-form regression coe¢ cients in
Table 5 can be computed. Of particular importance for this exercise are the speci…cations in Panels
C and F of Table 5, where various measures of creative innovations were regressed on current CEO
age (and lead CEO age in Panel F), …rm …xed e¤ects and controls.
     Let us denote the coe¢ cient estimate on current CEO age in column 1, Panel C of Table 5



                                                   33
by     current ,   and the coe¢ cient estimates on current and lead CEO age in column 1, Panel F,
respectively, by       0         and   0
                       current         lead .   In our indirect inference procedure, we will target these three
parameters. Speci…cally, we generate data from the model given a parameter vector                           , and convert
the measure of successful radical innovation in the model, which is a 0-1 variable, into the same
units as our innovation quality variable (by dividing it by its variance and multiplying it with the
variance of innovation quality). We then run the same regression as in Panel C and F of Table 5,
and compare the estimates to the empirical estimates of                            0               0
                                                                       current ,   current   and   lead .
      In addition to these three regression coe¢ cients, our indirect inference procedure targets three
central moments in the data: the average annual growth rate of (real) sales per worker, within-…rm
coe¢ cient of variation of radical innovations, and the fraction of incremental innovations, measured
as fraction of internal patents which mainly build on innovating …rm’s existing lines (as opposed to
innovating on product lines operated by other …rms).31 This implies that we have in total six data
moments and six parameters.
      Finally, we make two additional assumptions in matching the model to data. First, in the
model managers are employed at the product line level, whereas in the data we only observe
managers/CEO at the level of the company (which comprises several product lines). We ignore
this distinction, and treat the data as if it were generated from one product …rms. Second, in
the model, the identity of the manager/CEO is indeterminate as there are no costs of changing
managers, so a …rm could change its manager every instant or at some regular interval even without
changing its innovation strategy. To make the model more comparable to the data, we assume that
a …rm keeps its manager until it needs to switch from an older to a younger manager in order to
change its innovation strategy.
      Table 6 provides the values of the parameters we have selected on the basis of external data
as well as the values of the parameters in the vector               , which are chosen to match the six afore-
mentioned moments. Table 7 shows the match between the values of these moments in the data
and those implied by the model. The model-implied numbers are on the whole very close to the
targeted empirical moments. The most important lesson from Table 7 is that the model is quite
consistent with reduced-form regression results, including the signi…cant and sizable coe¢ cient on
lead CEO age, which is generated by the fact that                  > 0 and is a non-trivial source of creative
innovations.
      The implied pattern is also visible in Figures 1 and 2, which plot the probability of a creative
innovation and the average CEO age as a function of time since switching to high-type. These
…gures show that …rms slowly reduce the average age of their managers after switching to high-
type (if at …rst they are below n , they do not need to change their CEO). Correspondingly, they
 31
      Following Akcigit and Kerr (2015), we de…ne internal patents as those whose majority of citations are self cites.


                                                            34
also slowly increase their probability of creative innovations. Because much of this increase in the
probability of creative innovations takes place before …rms switch to a younger manager, in the
reduced-form regressions it will be captured by lead CEO age.
       It is also useful to gauge whether, at these estimated parameter values, the model performs
well on some other dimensions. One empirical moment we have not used for estimation is the
probability of …rms switching to younger managers. At the estimated parameter values, 6% of all
…rms attempt a radical innovation (these are high-type …rms with n               n ). Consequently, “young”
managers (de…ned as those with a < a in Proposition 4) also make up 6% of the population of
managers, implying that a corresponds to age 43 in our sample of managers/CEOs. Using this
information, we can then compare the annual probability of a …rm switching from an old manager
(with a > a ) to a young manager (with a           a ) in the data and in the model. Reassuringly, these
two numbers are very close to each other, respectively 0.62% and 0.63%.
       Using these parameter estimates, we next compute the “causal e¤ect” of manager age on cre-
ative innovations. There are several ways in which such a causal e¤ect might be de…ned. First,
we could de…ne the causal e¤ect in a fashion analogous to “treatment e¤ect on the treated,” by
considering the loss of creative innovation that …rms that were previously hiring young managers
and pursuing radical innovations would su¤er. Second, one could focus on the “average treatment
e¤ect,”corresponding to the impact of having a younger manager for an average …rm in our sample.
It is intuitive that these two measures of causal e¤ects will be quite di¤erent, since, as just noted,
only 6% of …rms are attempting radical innovations in our stationary distribution.
       For the …rst, we start with the equilibrium stationary distribution and reshu- e managers only
among …rms attempting radical innovation (which are high-types with more than n incremental
innovations and hiring managers younger than a ), and we repeat this for 13 periods. Because such
…rms will continue to attempt radical innovation after the reshu- ing (since the reshu- ing involves
only managers younger than a ), the change in the likelihood of radical innovation of any given …rm
captures the causal e¤ect of a younger (or older) manager on a …rm attempting radical innovation.
We quantify this e¤ect by running the same regression of the likelihood of radical innovation on
the age of manager for this subsample of …rms (corresponding to Panel C) and then comparing it
to the reduced-form relationship between these two variables in the model-generated data,                  0:211
(as reported in Table 7).32 The resulting causal e¤ect is estimated as              0:040. This e¤ect is thus
considerably smaller than the reduced-form regression coe¢ cient of              0:211, though it should not
be directly compared to this number, which applies to the entire sample, while the causal e¤ect of
  0:040 is only for 6% of the entire sample. To obtain a causal e¤ect estimate more comparable to
  32
   We use the regression coe¢ cient obtained from model-generated data rather than the regression coe¢ cient from
Table 5, 0:188, since this will be compared to numbers also obtained from model-generated data.



                                                       35
the reduced-form relationship, we next turn to the average treatment e¤ect.
       For this second exercise, we again start with the stationary distribution and reshu- e managers
randomly for 13 periods. We assume that after the reshu- ing, each …rm will pursue the same inno-
vation strategy.33 We then use the data generated by this thought experiment to run a regression of
the likelihood of a radical innovation on manager age for the entire sample of …rms (including both
low-type …rms and high-type …rms not attempting a radical innovation). This exercise yields an
average causal e¤ect of       0:003, and thus accounts approximately for 1:5% (' 0:003=0:211) of the
relationship between CEO age and creative innovations. The rest of this relationship is explained
by sorting e¤ects— because it is high-type …rms that are hiring younger managers.
       It is intuitive that the …rst estimate of the causal e¤ect is much larger than the second, because
it explicitly focuses on the small subsample of …rms attempting a radical innovation. But even
in this case, especially once we take into account that this causal e¤ect applies only to 6% of the
sample of …rms that are attempting a radical innovation, much of the association between manager
age and creative innovations is accounted for by the sorting of younger managers to …rms that are
more open to disruption.
       Overall, our indirect inference exercise establishes that the model can generate the patterns
we see in the data, and implies that much of the reduced-form relationship between manager age
and creative innovations is due to sorting, but also that there is a small causal e¤ect of younger
managers on creative innovations as well.

4.5      Inventor Age and Creativity of Innovations

We next turn to patent-level regressions to investigate the relationship between the age of inventor—
de…ned as any inventor listed in our patent data— and our various measures of creativity of innova-
tions. Though in our theoretical model there is no distinction between managers and inventors, this
distinction is of course important in practice. One might then expect the role of product-line man-
agers in our model to be played partly by the top management of the …rm and partly by inventors
(or the lead inventor) working on a particular R&D project. CEOs, then, not only decide which
projects the company should focus on but also choose the research team. In this subsection, we
bring in information on the age of inventors in order to investigate the e¤ect of manager/inventor
age on the creativity of innovations once we control for the type of characteristics of the …rm.
  33
    It is possible that some …rms would switch their innovation strategy because they end up with much older or
much younger managers. However, whether this is the case or not would also depend on managerial wages after
reshu- ing, which in turn depends on a variety of auxiliary assumptions on wage determination under “mismatch”.
Our strategy avoids this complication, but estimates a lower bound on this e¤ect, though this lower bound is likely
to be fairly tight since low-type …rms cannot change their innovation strategy and most high-type …rms would be
unlikely to alter their innovation strategy unless there is a very large change in the age of the manager assigned to
them.



                                                         36
       We use Lai et. al.’s (2009) unique inventor identi…ers described above to create a proxy for this
variable. Our proxy is the number of years since the …rst innovation of the inventor, which we will
refer to as “inventor age.”
       Our main regression in this subsection will be at the patent level and take the form

                               yif t = Iif t + mf t + X0if t +     f   +   i   + dt + "if t :                    (19)

Here yif t is one of our measures of the creativity of innovation for (patent) i granted to …rm f
at time t. Our key right-hand-side variable is Iif t , the age of the inventors named in patent i (in
practice, there is often more than one such inventor listed for a patent). In addition, mf t is de…ned
as CEO age at time t and will be included in some regressions, Xif t is a vector of possible controls,
and      f   denotes a full set of …rm …xed e¤ects, so that our speci…cations here exploit di¤erences in
the creativity of innovations of a single …rm as a function of the characteristics of the innovators
involved in the relevant patent. In our core speci…cations, we also control for a set of dummies,
denoted by         i,   related to inventor characteristics as we describe below. All speci…cations also
control for a full set of year e¤ects, denoted by dt , and "if t is the error term.34
       The results from the estimation of (19) are reported in Table 8. In Panel A we focus on a
speci…cation similar to the regressions with …rm …xed e¤ects reported in Table 5. This is useful
for showing that this di¤erent frame still replicates the results showing the impact of CEO age
on creativity of innovations. In particular, Panel A focuses on Compustat …rms for the period
1992         2004 and includes the same set of controls as in Table 5 Panel C (…rm …xed e¤ects, year
…xed e¤ects, log employment, log sales and log patents of the …rm); it does not contain any variables
related to inventor characteristics. As in the rest of this table, these regressions are not weighted
(since they are at the patent level) and the standard errors are robust and clustered at the …rm
level.
       Our results using this speci…cation are similar to those of Panel C of Table 5, though a little
smaller. In column 1, for instance, we see an estimate of              0:119 (standard error = 0:038) compared
to      0:188 in Table 5. We cannot de…ne our measure of the superstar fraction and tail innovations
in these patent-level regressions. We can, however, look at a patent-level measure related to tail
innovations, a dummy for the patent in question being above the pth percentile of the citation
distribution. We report results using this measure for two values, p = 0:99 and p = 0:90, in
columns 2 and 3. Both of these measures are negatively correlated with CEO age, though only
marginally signi…cantly in these speci…cations.35
  34
     A single patent can appear multiple times in our sample if it belongs to multiple …rms, but this is very rare and
applies to less than 0.2% of the patents in our sample.
  35
     For completeness, we also show results with the generality index, even though the results in Table 5 already
indicated that, with …rm …xed e¤ects included, there is no longer a signi…cant relationship between CEO age and


                                                         37
     Panel B goes in the other direction and reports the estimates of a model that controls for
inventor characteristics and looks at the impact of inventor age, without controlling for CEO age,
for the same sample as in Panel A (thus restricting it to …rms with information on CEO age). As
with all of the other models reported in this table, in Panel B we control for a full set of dummies
for the maximum number of patents of any inventor associated with the patent in question has
over our sample period;36 a full set of dummies for the size of the inventor team (i.e., how many
inventors are listed); and a full set of dummies for the three-digit IPC class.37 The inclusion of
this rich set of dummy variables enables us to compare inventors of similar productivity. It thus
approximates a model that includes a full set of inventor dummies.38 The results show that there
is a strong relationship between inventor age and the creativity of innovations. For example, in
column 1, the coe¢ cient estimate on inventor age is              0:234 (standard error = 0:026), about twice
as large as the CEO age estimate in Panel A.
     When we do not control for CEO age, the sample can be extended beyond 1992                           2004. This
is done in Panel C, which expands the sample in two di¤erent ways, …rst by including Compustat
…rms without CEO information, and second by broadening the time period covered to 1985                           2004.
The results are very similar to those in Panel B, indicating that the focus on Compustat …rms with
CEO age information is not responsible for the broad patterns we are documenting.
     Panel D extends the sample further to non-Compustat …rms, which can also be included in our
analysis since we are not using information on CEO age. This increases our sample sixfold (since
most patents are held by non-Compustat …rms). However, in this case, we can no longer include
the employment and sales controls. Despite the addition of almost 1:5 million additional patents
and the lack of our employment and sales controls, the results in this panel are again very similar
to those in previous panels, and suggest that, at least in this instance, our results are not driven
by our focus on the Compustat sample.
     Panel E provides our main results in this subsection. It returns to the Compustat sample over
the period 1992-2002 and adds back the CEO age variable; otherwise, the speci…cation is identical
to that in Panel B. The results show precisely estimated impacts of both CEO age and inventor
age. For example, in column 1 with our innovation quality variable, the coe¢ cient on CEO age
is   0:111 (standard error = 0:038) and that on inventor age is                  0:235 (standard error = 0:027);
the generality index, and this lack of relationship persists for all of the estimates we report in Table 8 (and for this
reason, though we do show them for completeness, we will not discuss them in detail).
  36
     In other words, we include a dummy variable for the assignee/inventor of this patent with the highest number
of total patents having k = 1; 2; :::; 89+ patents (where 89+ corresponds to 89 or more patents for the inventor with
the maximum number of patents).
  37
     This corresponds to 374 separate technology classes and is roughly at the same level of disaggregation as the SIC
dummies we used in the …rm-level analysis in Tables 2-4.
  38
     We cannot include a full set of inventor …xed e¤ects directly because inventor age would not be identi…ed in this
case since we also have a full set of year dummies.



                                                          38
these are very close to the estimates in Panels A and B, respectively. The pattern is similar in the
other columns (except again for generality).
      These results provide further evidence that the relationship between manager/CEO age and the
creativity of innovations in the data re‡ects an important dimension of sorting. In particular, …rms
appear to make several associated changes— in top management and innovation teams— around
the same time they change their portfolio of innovation and their innovation strategy (and perhaps
their “corporate culture”). Re‡ecting this sorting, the estimated magnitudes linking CEO age
to our indices of creative innovations are smaller in Table 8 than those in our baseline …rm-level
regressions. Our next results, reported in Table 9, provide some direct evidence on this by looking
at the relationship between inventor age and CEO age. In particular, we estimate a regression
similar to equation (19) except that now the dependent variable is the average age of the inventors
on the patents granted for that …rm in year t and the key right-hand-side variable is the age of
the CEO, and …rm …xed e¤ects are again controlled for. The …rst column of Table 9 reports a
regression of the average age of inventors on …rm and year …xed e¤ects, log employment, log sales,
log patents, and CEO age, while the second column also adds dummies for inventor team size
and three-digit IPC class as in the speci…cations in Table 8. The results, which show a positive
(though only marginally signi…cant) relationship, suggest that younger CEOs tend to hire younger
inventors, indirectly corroborating the sorting e¤ect emphasized in our theoretical model.39

4.6      Stock of Knowledge, Opportunity Cost and Creativity of Innovations

Finally, Table 10 turns to an investigation of some additional implications of our approach already
highlighted in our theoretical model (in particular, Proposition 5). We noted there that we may
expect openness to disruption to be more important for companies that are technologically more
advanced (as measured by the number of patents), but also that companies that have more to
lose (because of the greater opportunity cost of disruption in terms of other pro…table activities)
may shy away from disruptive creative innovations. The …rm-level data enable us to look at this
issue by including the interaction between CEO age and log total patent count (as a proxy for how
advanced the technology of the company is) and also the interaction between CEO age and log
sales (as a proxy for company revenues that may be risked by disruptive innovations). According
to the theoretical ideas suggested above, we expect the interaction with log total patent count to
be negative, and that with sales to be positive (indicating that average manager age matters more
for the creativity of innovations for companies with a signi…cant number of patents and less for
companies with high sales).
      This is a demanding, as well as crude, test, since neither proxy is perfect, and moreover, log
 39
      Interestingly, this result disappears when we do not control for …rm …xed e¤ects.


                                                          39
sales and log patent counts are positively correlated (the weighted correlation between the two
variables is 0:7 in our sample), thus stacking the cards against …nding an informative set of results.
         Nevertheless, Table 10, which uses the same unbalanced sample with annual observations as in
Table 5 Panel C, provides some evidence that our theoretical expectations are partially borne out.
In all of our speci…cations, the interaction between CEO age and log total patent count is negative
and the interaction with log sales is positive. Moreover, these interactions are statistically signi…cant
except for the log patent interaction for the innovation quality measure.40 These results thus provide
some support for the hypothesis that the stock of knowledge of the company and opportunity cost
e¤ects might be present and might in fact be quite important (at least quantitatively at this
correlational level).


5         Cross-Country Correlations

In this section, we provide evidence that the …rm-level relationship between manager age and cre-
ativity of innovations appears to aggregate up to the national level. In particular, we document
that there is a cross-country relationship between manager age and creativity of innovations. More-
over, at the cross-country level, we can also use other indices potentially proxying for openness to
disruption, which also show similar results, thus partially corroborating our interpretation of the
manager age variables in our …rm-level and cross-country empirical work.
         The interpretation of the cross-country relationships should be somewhat di¤erent than the …rm-
level ones. At the country level, manager age, like our other measures of openness to disruption
presented below, is likely to have its impact on the creativity of innovations not just because of its
association with— and because of its impact on— …rm-level innovation strategies, but also through
economy-wide institutions, attitudes and values of the society. This suggests that the quantitative
magnitudes of the relationships might be somewhat larger at the country level than at the …rm
level.
         Our main cross-country results are presented in Table 11, which reports OLS regressions of the
following form:
                                            yc = Ic + X0c + "c ;                                        (20)

where yc is one of our measures of creative innovations (innovation quality, superstar fraction, tail
innovation, or generality) for country c, Ic denotes one of our measures of openness to disruption
(the individualism index, the uncertainty avoidance index, or average manager age), Xc is a vector
of controls (including average log real GDP per capita of the country, average years of secondary
schooling and log of total patents of the country during this time period), and …nally, "c is an
    40
    As noted above, the main e¤ects are evaluated at the sample mean and are typically close to the estimates
reported in Table 2.


                                                     40
error term.41 The coe¢ cient of interest is            , which will reveal whether there is a cross-country
correlation between our measures of openness to disruption and the creativity of innovations.
       All regressions in Table 11 include one observation per country. As with our …rm-level spec-
i…cations, these regressions are weighted using the total number of patents as weights, which is
again motivated by the fact that countries with more patents are both more important for their
contribution to creative innovations and have much more precisely estimated measures for our key
variables (see Appendix Table A1 for the distribution of total number of patents across countries).
All standard errors continue to be robust against heteroscedasticity.
       Panel A of Table 11 focuses on our measure of manager age (which is available for 37 countries).
The patterns are very similar to those we obtained in the …rm-level analysis, and show a strong
correlation between average manager age and all four of our measures of creative innovations. For
example, in column 1, the estimate of             is    0:484 (standard error = 0.225). We also see that
log GDP per capita and average years of secondary schooling are not signi…cant correlates of the
creativity of innovations, while log patent count is signi…cant and indicates that countries that have
more patents also tend to have more creative innovations. Consistent with the caveat about the
interpretation of the cross-country results, the quantitative magnitudes are somewhat larger than
the …rm-level ones: a one-year change in manager age increases average citations by 0:48 (3:3%
compared to its mean of 14:5), the superstar fraction by 0:96 (14:4% relative to its mean), tail
innovations by 0:23 (11:7% relative to its mean) and generality by 0:28 (1:3% relative to its mean).
These e¤ects are about 2 to 5 times larger than the …rm-level estimates presented above.42
       Panel B is similar to Panel A, except that it uses Hofstede’s individualism index (this increases
the sample from 37 to 50). The results are very similar to those using average manager age, and
the quantitative magnitudes of the correlation between individualism and innovation quality are
again sizable and somewhat larger than those in Panel A.43
       Panel C has exactly the same structure, except that the right-hand-side variable is Hofstede’s
uncertainty avoidance index. The patterns are very similar and generally even more precisely esti-
  41
      An additional covariate that might be useful to control for would be the average educational attainment of
managers in a country. Though this number is available in the World Bank dataset that Gennaioli et al. (2013)
use, there is very little overlap between this developing country sample and ours. We have instead experimented
with controlling for the average education of the managers of the companies we have used for compiling our average
manager age variable. This has no e¤ect on the results reported here and is omitted to save space. The details are
available upon request from the authors.
   42
      If, instead, we look at the quantitative implications of moving from the 75th percentile of the manager age
distribution to the 25th percentile, the magnitudes are more similar to the …rm-level estimates. For example, moving
from the country at the 25th percentile of average manager age in our sample to the 75th percentile (from 51:5 to
54:3) reduces our measure of innovation quality by 9:4% relative to the sample mean (14:5).
   43
      For example, moving from the country at the 25th percentile of individualism in our sample to those at the 75th
percentile (from 0:19 to 0:73) increases our measure of innovation quality by 19% relative to its weighted sample
mean (14:5). Using the same metric for quantitative magnitude for the average manager age gives an increase in
innovation quality by 9:4% relative to the sample mean (14:5).



                                                         41
mated (though, of course, they are now negative, since greater uncertainty avoidance corresponds
to less openness to disruption). The quantitative magnitudes are similar to those in Panel B.44
         Tables 12 and 13 probe the robustness of these cross-country relationships. Table 12 looks at
various alternative measures of creative innovations (which we also investigate at the …rm level).
These are average citations per patent but now constructed using only a …ve-year window (so that
we do not have to rely on the correction factors); an alternative measure of the superstar fraction
of patents but now computed using information on the most highly cited patent to the inventor
(rather than lifetime average citations); the tail innovation index computed with p = 0:90 (instead
of p = 0:99); and the originality index mentioned above. The results in all cases are similar to the
baseline (though weaker and not statistically signi…cant with the alternative measure of superstar
fraction).
         Table 13 , on the other hand, investigates whether these results can be explained by the fact
that R&D intensity (de…ned as total R&D spending divided by GDP at the country level) di¤ers
across countries. Our results largely might be re‡ecting the fact that some countries invest more
in R&D and as a result generate more creative innovations. However, in our sample R&D intensity
is not systematically related to individualism, uncertainty avoidance, or average manager age.
Moreover, Table 13 shows that controlling for variation in R&D intensity does not change the basic
correlations in our sample. The parameter estimates do change in some cases, particularly with
the individualism variable, but the association between our measures of openness to disruption and
creativity of innovations always remains highly signi…cant.45


6         Conclusion

Despite a large theoretical and now a growing empirical literature on innovation, there is relatively
little work on the determinants of the creativity of innovative activity, and in particular, the like-
lihood of innovations and patents that contribute most to knowledge. In this paper, building on
Schumpeter’s ideas, we suggested that openness to new ideas, disruptive innovations and uncon-
ventional practices— which we called openness to disruption, for short— may be a key determinant
of creative innovations, and likewise, resistance to such disruptive behavior may hold back some of
the most creative innovative activities.
    44
     We do not run regressions including multiple indices at the same time, since we believe this type of horse race
would not be particularly informative. Instead, we interpret each of these variables as a proxy for the same underlying
tendency for openness to innovation, new practices and ideas.
  45
     We also experimented with using cross-country di¤erences in demographics to instrument for average manager
age di¤erences. Though these results corroborate the patterns shown here, we do not report them both because
demographics could have a direct e¤ect on the creativity of innovations, invalidating the exclusion restriction of such
a strategy, and because we view the cross-country results as additional evidence rather than as our main empirical
focus.



                                                          42
   We provided a simple model drawing a clear distinction between radical (more creative) innova-
tions and incremental innovations, whereby the former combines ideas from several di¤erent lines of
research and creates more signi…cant advances (and contributions to knowledge). These advances
can be discouraged or even stopped, either through pecuniary or non-pecuniary means, preventing
radical innovations directly or discouraging cross-fertilization of ideas from di¤erent …elds.
   The bulk of our paper provides illustrative cross-country and …rm-level correlations consistent
with the role of openness to disruption. We use several measures to proxy for creative innovations.
These include our proxy for innovation quality, which is the average number of citations per patent;
two indices for creativity of innovations, which are the fraction of superstar innovators and the like-
lihood of a very high number of citations (in particular, tail citations relative to median citations);
and the generality index.
   Our main proxy for openness to disruption is the age of the CEO or top management of the
company (or the average age of the CEO and CFO of the top 25 publicly listed companies in a
country). This variable is motivated based on the idea that only companies or societies open to
such disruption will allow the young to rise up within the hierarchy. This is the only variable we
have available as a proxy for openness to disruption at the …rm level. At the country level, we
augment this variable with the popular indices for individualism and uncertainty avoidance based
on the work by the Dutch social scientist Geert Hofstede.
   Using these proxies, at the …rm, patent and country level, we …nd fairly consistent and robust
correlations between openness to disruption and creative innovations. We also show that these
relationships are generally robust. They do not, however, correspond to the causal e¤ect of CEO
(or manager) age on creative innovations because, as highlighted by our theoretical model, younger
managers tend to be employed by …rms that are more open to disruption and more creative.
A simple indirect inference exercise using the structure of our model suggests that most of the
empirical relationship between CEO age and creative innovations is due to these sorting e¤ects,
and the causal impact of CEO age is quite small.
   Finally, our theoretical model further suggests that the impact of openness to disruption should
be larger for companies that are technologically more advanced (closer to the technology frontier)
and smaller for companies that have a greater opportunity cost of disruptive innovation. The
empirical patterns in our …rm-level data support this prediction.
   We view our paper as a …rst step in the study of the impact of various social and economic
incentives on creative activities and, in particular, on creative innovations. Future work investi-
gating the causal e¤ect of manager age on creative innovations using more systematic structural
estimation techniques is an obvious next step. Further study of various other …rm-level or cross-
country characteristics on the creativity of innovations is also a natural direction. Another fruitful

direction would be to systematically investigate what types of …rms and …rm organizations en-
courage creativity and lead to more creative innovations. This would involve both theoretical and
empirical analyses of the internal organization of …rms and their research strategies and a study of
the interplay between institutional and society-level factors and the internal organization of …rms.

Appendix: Omitted Proofs

Proof of Proposition 2.             We conjecture that the value function for low-type …rms takes the
form in (10) : Substituting this conjecture into (7), we get

                                                              n+1
      r [Aqj + B (n) qt ]   B (n) g qt =      qj + Aqt          + [B (n + 1) qt B (n) qt ]
                                                                     h                                     i
                                                Aqj                            ~ (n) Aqj

Equating the coe¢ cients on qj and qt , we obtain

                                              rAqj = qj         Aqj ;

and
                                                                                             h              i

Solving these equations for A and B (n), while taking B
Proposition 3, completes the proof.

   Proof of Proposition 3. Following the same steps, we conjecture that the value function for
high-type …rms takes the form in (12), and substitute this into (8) to get

Under the hypothetical scenario where the max operator in (21) always picks the …rst term, we
     ~ (n) = B
have B       ^ (n). Collecting terms, we can write

                            ^ (n) = ^ = + A~ n+1 + B
                            B                            ^ (n + 1)
                                    h                i
where = (r g+ + ) and ^ =                        ~
                                   H A (1 + ) + B (0) : From standard dynamic programming

arguments (e.g., Theorem 4.7 in Stokey and Lucas, 1989), B^ (n) is strictly decreasing and limits
       ^
to      : Now note that if n = 1 (meaning that incremental innovations were always optimal),
     r g+
                   ~ (n) = B
then we would have B        ^ (n).
                                               h                  i
   The other option in the max operator, H q a (1 + ) A + B ~ (0)  , does not depend on n and
is strictly positive, which implies that switching to radical innovation for n su¢ ciently high would
                 ^      a          ~
yield B ~ (n) = + H q [(1+ )A+B(0)] >        ^
                         r g+              r g+ . Hence, there must exist n such that …rms with
n < n undertake incremental innovation and switch to radical innovation at n . The expression
for n follows by equating the value of pursuing radical and incremental innovations at n0 and
setting n as the smallest integer greater than n0 .
     Proof of Proposition 5. Recall that
                                                                     VH qn;t +        n+1;t (qn;t ); n + 1       VH (qn;t ; n) ;
(r + )VH (qn;t ; n)    V_ H (qn;t ; n) =      qn;t + max                                        a
                                                                                             H q EVH (t)
                                            +         H EVH (t);

where we have written explicitly       n+1;t (qn;t )   as the incremental improvement in productivity start-
ing from quality qn;t that has been improved n times already and average quality in the economy
is qt (subsumed in the time argument t).
     The threshold number of incremental innovations as a function of current productivity, nt (q)
equivalently de…nes a threshold value of productivity qn;t as a function of the number of incremental
innovations. Clearly this threshold productivity level is de…ned as the value that sets the two terms
in the max operator equal to each other. Thus
                                                                                            a
                                                                                       Hq
                      VH qn;t +    n+1;t (qn;t ); n   +1        VH qn;t ; n =                   EVH (t);                 (22)

and at this value, we also have

               (r + )VH qn;t ; n       V_ H qn;t ; n = qn;t +            Hq
                                                                              a
                                                                                  EVH (t) +         H EVH (t):           (23)

Now we will consider two alternative cases:
     Case 1:
                                           qn+1;t      qn;t +    n+1;t (qn;t ):                                          (24)

This condition implies that if a particular high-type …rm …nds it optimal to switch to radical
innovation today, but instead undertakes a successful incremental innovation (as a deviation o¤-the-
equilibrium path), then subsequently it will still want to immediately switch to radical innovation.

                                                           46
     Under this case, we have

                   (r + )VH qn;t +           n+1;t (qn;t ); n        +1               V_ H qn;t +          n+1;t (qn;t ); n     +1          (25)
                                                               a
               =     qn;t +    n+1;t (qn;t )   +      Hq           EVH (t) +                        H EVH (t):


This follows from the fact that, by de…nition, in this case, at qn;t +                                     n+1;t (qn;t ),     the …rm will want
to switch to radical innovation.
     Now di¤erentiating (22) with respect to time, we have
                                                                                                              a
                                                                                                         Hq
                V_ H qn;t +   n+1;t (qn;t ); n   +1            V_ H qn;t ; n                =                     @EVH (t)=@t
                                                                                                              a
                                                                                                         Hq
                                                                                            =                     gEVH (t);                 (26)

where, in the second line, we have used the fact that in a stationary equilibrium EVH (t) grows at
the rate g. Subtracting (23) from (25) and using (26), we obtain:
                                                                                                                            a
                                                                                                                       Hq
     (r + )[VH qn;t +    n+1;t (qn;t ); n   +1         VH qn;t ; n ] =                          n+1;t (qn;t )     +             gEVH (t):   (27)

Then, combining (22) and (27) we can derive
                                                           r        g+                      a
                                    n+1;t (qn;t )    =                                Hq        EVH (t):                                    (28)

In this case, for all q less than qn;t , it is optimal to switch to radical innovation.
     Now let us de…ne

                                        vt                                  Hq       EVH (t);                                               (29)

which is independent of both q and n. Using (29) equation (28) can be written as

                                                                                 n+1
                                       [ qt + (1               )qn;t ]                  = vt ;                                              (30)

or
                                                         vt =        n+1               qt
                                              qn;t =                                        :                                               (31)
                                                                    1
This equation immediately implies that qn;t is increasing in n or equivalently that nt (q) is increasing
in q.
     We next derive the condition under which (24) indeed applies. For this reason, note that from
(30) written for n + 2 incremental innovations, we have

                                                           vt =          n+2            qt
                                             qn+1;t =                                           :                                           (32)
                                                                        1
Combining equations (31) and (32), we obtain that (24) is satis…ed if

                                                                   n+2
                                              (1       )                    +          1:                                                   (33)

                                                                   47
   Thus whenever (33) holds (and we are in Case 1), we have the desired result that nt (q) is
increasing in q. We next establish that whenever the converse of (33) holds, the same result
applies.
   Case 2:
                                      qn+1;t       n+1;t (qn;t )   < qn;t :                          (34)

This implies that if a high-type …rm is indi¤erent between radical and incremental innovation at
n + 1st prior incremental innovations at time t, then it would have preferred to switch to radical
innovation at nth prior incremental innovations. This condition is clearly the complement of (24).
   In this case, start with qn+1;t , which satis…es (25). Under condition (34), qn;t satis…es (23),
so we again arrive at (22), (28) and (31). But then from (31) qn;t is increasing in n or nt (q) is
increasing in q.
   We next verify that Case 2 applies for the complement of the parameter values for which (33)
holds. Note that the same expressions for qn+1;t as in (32) again applies under Case 2. Thus the
condition for (34) to be satis…ed, with an identical argument, is

                                                     n+2
                                        (1     )           +       > 1;

which is indeed the complement of (33).
   Consequently, regardless of whether (33) or its converse holds, equation (31) applies, and qn;t is
increasing in n (or equivalently, nt (q) is increasing in q). This completes the proof of the proposition.

 Notes: All statistics in this table are weighted by the number of patents (of the country or the firm). Individualism and
uncertainty aversion are Hofstede’s indices of national cultures (and are normalized to lie between 0 and 1), and country
average manager age is the average manager of CEOs and CFOs of up to the 25 largest firms in the country. Innovation
quality is the average number of citations per patent (using the truncation correction weights devised by Hall, Jaffe, and
Trajtenberg, 2001); superstar fraction is the fraction of patents accounted for by superstar researchers (those above the
95th percentile of the citation distribution); tail innovation is the fraction of patents of a country or firm above the 99th
percentile of the citation distribution divided by the fraction of patents above the median of the distribution; and generality
index measures the dispersion of citations received across two-digit IPC technology classes. Log income per capita at the
country level, and log employment, log sales at the firm level are computed as the average of, respectively, annual log
income per capita, log employment and log sale between 1995 and 2000. CEO age is the age of the CEO and average
manager age is the average age of the top management, both from the Execucomp dataset. The balanced firm panel is the
sample of firms from Compustat with complete data on CEO age, employment, sales, and firm age and positive patents in
each year between 1995 and 2000. The unbalanced firm panel is a sample of firms from Compustat with at least one year
of complete data between 1992 and 2002. See text for the definition of other variables and further details.

 Notes: Weighted cross-sectional regressions with total number of patents as weights. The sample is the balanced firm panel
and each observation is the sample average between 1995-2000 as described in the notes to Table 1. The dependent variables
are alternative measures of innovation quality (computed over the next five years), superstar fraction (with superstars
defined according to the best patent), tail innovation (with share of the patents of the firm among all the patents above the
90th percentile of the citation distribution in the numerator), and the originality index (the last three are multiplied by 100
to ease legibility). All regressions control for firm age, log employment, log sales, log total patents, and a full set of dummies
for four-digit SIC industries. See text and notes to Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust standard errors are in parentheses.

Notes: Weighted cross-sectional regressions with total number of patents as weights. The sample is the balanced firm panel
and each of the ratios is the sample average 1995-2000 as described in the notes to Table 1.The dependent variables are
innovation quality, superstar fraction, tail innovation, and generality (the last three are multiplied by 100 to ease legibility).
Each panel is for a different specification. Unless otherwise stated, all regressions control for firm age, log employment,
log sales, log total patents, and four-digit SIC dummies (see text and notes to Table 1 for variable definitions). Robust
standard errors are in parentheses. Panel A controls for three-digit SIC dummies instead of the four-digit dummies. Panel
B adds to the specification of Table 2 profitability (profit over sales), indebtedness (debt over sales) and log physical capital.
Panel C adds to the specification of Panel B R&D intensity (R&D expenditure over sales). Panel D uses average manager
age instead of CEO age. Panels E and F are for the high-tech and low-tech subsamples. High-tech sample includes all
firms with a primary industry classification of SIC 35 (industrial and commercial machinery and equipment and computer
equipment) and 36 (electronic and other electrical equipment and components), while the low-tech sample includes the rest.

 Notes: Weighted firm-level panel regressions with annual observations with number of patents (in that year) as weights. The dependent variables
are innovation quality, superstar fraction, tail innovation, and generality (the last three are multiplied by 100 to ease legibility). Robust standard
errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses. Panel A is for our balanced firm sample 1995-2000, and controls for firm age, log employment,
log sales, log patents, a full set of four-digit SIC dummies, and year dummies (and thus no firm dummies), and the key right-hand side variable is
average CEO age (constant over time). Panel B is identical to Panel A except that the sample is extended to the unbalanced firm panel 1992-2002.
In Panel C, the key right-hand side variable is CEO age (in that year), and the regression also includes a full set of firm fixed effects (and thus
firm age and the four-digit SIC dummies are no longer included). Panel D is identical to Panel C except that it also includes a one year lag of
CEO age as well as current CEO age, and Panel E is identical to Panel C except that it also includes a one year lag of the dependent variable on
the right-hand side. See text and notes to Table 1 for variable definitions.

 Notes: Patent-level panel regressions with annual observations. The dependent variables are innovation quality at the
patent level; a dummy for the patent being above the 99th percentile of the citation distribution; dummy for the patent
being above the 90th percentile of the citation distribution; and generality index at the patent level (the last three are
multiplied by 100 to ease legibility). Robust standard errors clustered at the firm level are in parentheses. Panel A is for
our unbalanced firm sample 1992-2002 and controls for log employment, log sales, log patents, a full set of firm fixed effects,
and application year dummies, and the key right-and side variable is CEO age. Panel B is for our unbalanced firm sample
1992-2002 and controls for log employment, log sales, log patents, application year dummies, a full set of firm fixed effects,
a full set of dummies for inventor team size, a full set of dummies for three-digit IPC technology class dummies, and a
full set of dummies for the total number of patents of the inventor within the team with the highest number of patents,
and the key right-and side variable is average inventor age. Panel C expands the sample of Panel B to 1985-2002 and
also adds Compustat firms without CEO information into the sample. Panel D extends the sample of Panel C to include
non-Compustat firms as well (hence excludes log sales and log employment, and still includes a full set of firm fixed effects).
Panel E is for our unbalanced firm sample 1992-2002 and adds CEO age to the specification of Panel B. See text and notes
to Table 1 for variable definitions.

Notes: Patent-level panel regressions with annual observations for the unbalanced firm sample 1992-2002. The dependent
variable is the average age of inventors. The first column controls for log employment, log sales, log patents, application
year dummies, and a full set of firm fixed effects, and the second column adds to this a full set of team size dummies
and a full set of dummies for three-digit IPC technology class dummies. See text and notes to Table 1 for variable definitions.

 Notes: Weighted cross-country regressions with total number of patents as weights. The dependent variables are alternative
measures of innovation quality (computed over the next five years), superstar fraction (with superstars defined according to the
best patent), tail innovation (with fraction of patents above the 90th percentile of the citation distribution in the numerator), and
the originality index (the last three are multiplied by 100 to ease legibility). Each regression also controls for log income per capita,
average years of secondary schooling, and log total patents. See text and notes to Table 1 for variable definitions. Each country
observation is the sample average between 1995-2000 as described in the text and the notes to Table 1. Robust standard errors are
in parentheses.
