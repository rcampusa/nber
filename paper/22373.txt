                                         ABSTRACT

The minimum wage has increased in multiple states over the past three decades. We examine the
impact of the state minimum wage on infant health. Using data on the universe of births in the US
over 24 years, we find that an increase in the minimum wage is associated with an increase in
birth weight driven by increased gestational length and fetal growth rate. The effect size is
meaningful and plausible. We also find an increase in prenatal care use and a decline in smoking
during pregnancy, which are some channels through which minimum wage can affect infant
health.

1. Introduction

        Changing the minimum wage is one of the most common ways that policymakers use to increase

income among low-skilled persons. It is also one of the most controversial. Recently, there has been

several relatively large increases in minimum wages. Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and

Washington DC all have $15 minimum wage laws on the books. These minimum wage rates are double

the current federal level minimum wage, and other states are contemplating similar increases. In 2014,

President Obama issued an executive order raising the minimum wage of federal contractors to $10.10.

The flurry of recent, legislative activity on the minimum wage and the size of recent minimum wage

increases have renewed, once again, the debate over the value of minimum wage statutes.

        Proponents of increasing the minimum wage suggest that it would increase earnings and reduce

income inequalities. Opponents, however, argue that an increase in the minimum wage will raise

employers’ cost of labor, decrease employment and raise prices. The debate is fueled by the fairly mixed

evidence on the effects of the minimum wage on employment with some studies finding no significant

changes in employment, while others finding a modest decline (Congressional Budget Office 2014).

Findings related to earnings are more consistent and show that minimum wages raise wages for low-

skilled workers.

        Notably, potential effects of the minimum wage on non-labor market outcomes such as health are

not commonly considered in the debate, which is an oversight, as such effects are important for

understanding the full impact of minimum wage policies. Economic theory suggests that an increase in

the minimum wage may improve health among workers through an income effect. However, if a higher

minimum wage reduces employment for some individuals, this can result in an opposite effect for that

group. Effects of the minimum wage on health may be particularly relevant for infants because of the

short, but critical period of gestation that influences infant health. Increases in income around the time of

pregnancy can affect both maternal health, for example, because of better nutrition and less financial

stress, and their babies’ health, for example, because of greater amounts of prenatal care and improved

maternal health. Indeed, there is growing recognition that improving women’s health prior to conception

                                                                                                                3
is key to decreasing rates and disparities in adverse birth outcomes (Atrash et al., 2008; Johnson et al.,

2006). Evidence from other income-enhancing policies including the earned income tax credit (EITC)

indicates a positive effect on infant health among poor mothers. Therefore, understanding how minimum

wage changes affect infant health is essential for understanding not only short-term consequences, but

also potentially long-run impacts on health given the importance of early life status for long-term

wellbeing.

        We provide one of the first studies of the effects of minimum wages on infant health.

Specifically, we evaluate how state-level minimum wages affect birth weight, gestational age, and fetal

growth among births of low-educated women in the US between 1989 and 2012. We also examine two

potential mechanisms, prenatal care and maternal smoking, that plausibly link the minimum wage to birth

outcomes. We use data from birth certificates and a difference-in-differences research design to obtain

estimates of the effect of minimum wages on outcomes that are plausibly interpreted as causal.

        Results from the study indicate that a $1 increase in the minimum wage during the two-years

prior to a birth increases birth weight significantly, but by a very small amount: approximately 4 grams

(0.1 percent) among low-educated mothers. However, this average effect masks heterogeneous effects

between demographic groups. Effect sizes are larger for younger and/or married mothers than for older

and/or unmarried mothers, but all estimates are still quite small relative to the mean. These small

estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on birth weight also imply small effects of a change in

earnings on birth weight. Our minimum wage estimates suggest that a $1000 change in annual earnings in

the two-years prior to birth is associated with an 8.5 gram (0.3 percent) increase in birth weight, which is

smaller than, but in the same general magnitude as estimates reported in a study of the effect of the EITC

on birth weight (Hoynes et al. 2015). Consistent with these beneficial effects of the minimum wage on

birth weight, we also find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage in the two-years prior to birth is

associated with significant, but very small improvements in other measures of infant health; a decline in

low-birth weight, an increase in fetal growth, and a decline in pre-term birth. In terms of mechanisms, we

find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage in the two-years prior to birth is associated with a

                                                                                                               4
significant, but small (2 percent) increase in prenatal care and a small (5 percent) decrease in maternal

smoking.

2. Related Literature

2.a. Effects of Minimum Wages on Employment and Earnings

        The effects of minimum wages on labor market outcomes has been an actively researched topic.

Findings, however, are not uniform. A number of studies find evidence that minimum wages have no

effect on employment (e.g., Addison, Blackburn, & Cotti, 2012; Dube, Lester, & Reich, 2010; Card &

Krueger, 1994). In contrast, others find evidence of a decrease in employment (Neumark, Salas, &

Wascher, 2014; Neumark & Wascher, 1992). The Congressional Budget Office (2014)

(https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995) summarized the literature and concluded that past evidence

suggests that an increase in the minimum wage will reduce employment slightly—an increase in federal

minimum wage to $10.10 from its current level of $7.25 would decrease employment by 0.3 percent.

         While the evidence for effects of minimum wages on employment remains mixed, there is

consistent evidence suggesting that minimum wages increase earnings for workers. 1 Positive effects on

earnings have been reported in several studies for low-educated and low-income individuals and for both

males and females (Belman, Wolfson, & Nawakitphaitoon, 2015). The evidence of a positive effect of

the minimum wage on income is stronger for females for whom the majority of studies find positive

effects on earnings (weekly or hourly). Other research suggests that the increase in earnings among the

lowest wage workers, who are the ones most affected by increasing minimum wage rates may not

necessarily offset the potential decline in work hours or employment status, and that minimum wage

increases may have a net negative effect on average income for this group (Neumark, Schweitzer, &

Wascher, 2004). The CBO (2014) report, however, concluded that an increase in the minimum wage to

$10.10 would substantially increase wages for approximately 20 million workers and this increase in

income would greatly outweigh the loss in earnings associated with decreased employment. 2 Overall, the

evidence on the labor market effects of the minimum wage suggest that minimum wages will raise

income.

2.b. Effects of Minimum Wages on Health

          The literature studying the effects of the minimum wage on health is sparse. Meltzer and Chen

(2011) examined the effect of the minimum wage on body mass index (BMI). They reported a negative

association; increases in the real minimum wage between 1968 and 2007 were associated with a decrease

in BMI. A paper by Horn, Maclean, and Strain (2017) that used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor

Surveillance System (BRFSS) reported mixed evidence. For men, they found that minimum wages were

associated with an increase in self-reported fair/poor health, but a decline in the number of days with poor

mental health. For women, they found a marginally significant decline in number of days in poor mental

health and no other significant effects. McCarrier et al. (2011) also used the BRFSS and found that higher

minimum wages were associated with lower levels of unmet medical needs.

          There is also some international evidence suggesting positive health benefits for workers. A

recent paper by Lenhart (2017a) studied the effects of the introduction of the national minimum wage in

the UK in 1999. Estimates indicated that the minimum wage was associated with improvements in self-

rated health and reported health conditions, with reductions in financial stress and improved financial

well-being implicated as a potential pathway. Exploiting variation in the minimum wage within 24

OECD countries over time and within US states over time, Lenhart (2017b) also reported that higher

minimum wages was associated with improved population health.

          There are two studies that we are aware of that study the association between minimum wages

and infant health. Strully, Rehkopf, and Xuan (2010), which focused on the effects of the EITC on birth

weight, also included the minimum wage in the regression analyses. These authors reported that that a $1

 There is also some evidence that prices will rise, which will reduce real purchasing power: Aaronson (2001);
Basker and Khan (2013); Dube, Naidu, and Reich (2007); MacDonald and Aaronson (2006); MaCurdy (2015);
Powers (2009).

                                                                                                                6
increase in the minimum wage was associated with a 3-gram increase in birth weight and 7% decline in

the odds of smoking. However, these results were not robust with estimates differing by time period (e.g.,

significant effect pre-1988 but not post-1998) and samples (excluding California, Indiana, Louisiana,

Nebraska, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Washington). In addition, the significance of the

estimates is not clear because standard errors were calculated ignoring likely non-independence of

observations within states (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan, 2004). 3

        The second study is by Komro et al. (2016). This study used data from vital statistics aggregated

to the month-state level and a difference-in-differences design to obtain estimates of the effect of the

minimum wage on low-birth weight and neonatal mortality. The sample included all births. Estimates

indicated that a $1 increase in minimum wage was associated with a 0.07 percentage point (7/100th of a

percentage point) decline in low-birth weight.

        As the brief summary of the previous literature has shown, there is relatively little research on the

effects of the minimum wage on health. This is an important gap in knowledge because earnings

increases associated with the minimum wage are comparable to those from other policies that have been

more thoroughly studied. Indeed, studies on the EITC suggest that modest increases in income among

low-income families can improve children’s health. Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2015) reported that a

$1000 increase in net after-tax income, from expansions in the federal EITC, was associated with a 2% to

3% decline in low birth weight. They also find that this positive income effect from the EITC expansion

was associated with an increase in prenatal care use and a decline in maternal smoking, which are

potential mechanisms for the increase in birth weight. The EITC has also been shown to be correlated

with a decline in maternal smoking (Averett & Wang, 2013; Cowan & Tefft, 2012). Strully et al. (2010)

found that living in a state that has its own EITC was related to nearly a 15 gram increase in birth weight

and 5% decline in smoking odds using 1980-2002 natality data. The state EITC has also been linked to

 The study also had other limitations. The regression model included several variables on the causal pathway
between minimum wage and infant health such as unemployment rate and poverty indicators.

improved overall child health rating later in childhood including ages 6 to 14 (Baughman & Duchovny,

2016). Positive effects on maternal health including self-reported health rating as well as biomarkers have

also been reported (Evans & Garthwaite, 2014), providing further evidence for a potential mechanism

through maternal health and health behaviors.

        To summarize, we extend the literature on the effects of the minimum wage on health. We focus

on infant health because of the critical nature of the prenatal period, which is short and easily linked to the

potential income effects of the minimum wage. We use data spanning a 25-year period in which there was

substantial variation in minimum wages. We examine multiple infant health and maternal behavioral

outcomes, consider multiple measures of the minimum wage, and allow for cumulative effects of the

minimum wage effect. Furthermore, while focusing on low-educated mothers who are most likely to be

affected by the minimum wage, we examine several subgroups within this population by age, education,

race, and marital status.

3. Mechanisms Linking Minimum Wage and Infant Health

        Conceptually, an increase in the minimum wage can improve infant health through a positive

income effect on maternal health and health behaviors that can have effects on fetal health. As noted

above, the majority of studies examining earnings report an increase in hourly or weekly wages following

a rise in the minimum wage, with larger effects among women than men (Belman et al., 2015;

Congressional Budget Office, 2014). Greater income from an increase in the minimum wage will increase

consumption and can have positive or negative effects on health, for example by improving nutrition or

increasing consumption of unhealthy goods such as alcohol. Greater income may also increase medical

care such as prenatal care services, particularly among those who are in low-paying jobs, likely to be

affected by the minimum wage and likely to be without health insurance. Finally, increased income may

increase financial security, which may reduce maternal stress, a factor linked to fetal growth (Camacho,

2008). There may be additional effects stemming from these changes, for example, greater financial

security, less stress and improved mental health may reduce health behaviors such as smoking that are

often used to treat stress (Byrne & Mazanov, 2016; Saffer & Dave, 2005).

                                                                                                             8
        On the other hand, the generally positive effects of the minimum wage through increased

earnings among workers may be offset by potential declines in employment. Two studies reported

employment declines when focusing on low-educated women (Pinoli, 2010; Sabia, 2008). If the

minimum wage affects employment, this may also lead to reallocation of time use due to the easing of

time constraints and an increase in non-work/leisure time. Greater availability of time, ceteris paribus,

may lead to an increase in time-intensive activities, including certain health-promoting behaviors such as

preparing healthy meals at home and exercising or obtaining preventive healthcare. However, given the

evidence of an increase in earnings relative to the decline in employment it is reasonable to hypothesize a

net positive income effect on infant health among low-income women.

        An increase in the minimum wage may also reduce reliance on welfare programs such as food

stamps (SNAP). There is evidence of a decline in enrollment and expenditures on the Supplemental

Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with increasing minimum wage rates (Reich & West, 2015).

However, there is no evidence for effects on other welfare program participation such as the Special

Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), Medicaid enrollment, housing

assistance programs, and cash assistance programs including Aid to Families with Dependent Children

(AFDC) and Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) (Sabia & Nguyen, 2015).

        Finally, price effects related to the minimum wage may result in reduced consumption, some of

which may have adverse effects on maternal and infant health such as food consumption, grocery

shopping and housing improvement. However, evidence suggests very modest increases in prices with the

largest effects on restaurants (MaCurdy, 2015).

        Overall, the evidence on the effects of the minimum wage on employment, earnings, participation

in social welfare programs and prices suggest that the minimum wage will have salutary effects on

maternal and infant health. This is because the dominant effect of the minimum wage is to raise incomes

of workers. There are small offsetting effects related to employment loss and higher prices, although

higher prices may reduce consumption of unhealthy goods as well as healthy products. Thus, we expect

that the minimum wage will be positively associated with infant health.

                                                                                                             9
4. Research Design

         Our empirical analysis is motivated by the mechanisms just described linking the minimum wage

to infant health. We estimate a reduced-form model that directly links the state-level minimum wage to

infant health outcomes. The research design is a difference-in-differences approach focusing on the

“intention-to-treat” effect of increasing the minimum wage. For each measure of infant health, we

estimate the following regression specification:

(1)      𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝑠𝑠 + 𝛾𝛾𝑚𝑚 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛤𝛤 + 𝑍𝑍𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝛹𝛹 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

         In equation (1), H denotes a specific measure of infant health (e.g., birth weight) or maternal

behavior (e.g., prenatal care) for a given birth i occurring in state s, month m, and year t. MW is the

average minimum wage two years prior to delivery in the given state and birth month and year. We use a

two-year window prior to birth because the effects of the minimum wage may accumulate and may be

particularly important because of the growing recognition that preconception health of the mother, which

would be influenced by the minimum wage prior to birth, is an important determinant of infant health

(Atrash et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2006). Equation (1) includes time (year θ and month γ) and state fixed

effects (α). The vector X represents individual characteristics of the mother such as age, education, marital

status, and race/ethnicity; and Z represents a vector of time-varying, state-level factors matched to the

birth year. These capture concurrent policy shifts affecting low-educated mothers over the sample period,

which prior studies have linked to maternal behavioral health and/or infant health, most notably

expansions in the state’s earned income tax credit, expansions in Medicaid eligibility, welfare reform, and

cigarette taxes (Baughman, 2012; Corman et al., 2013; Currie & Gruber, 1996; Dave et al., 2008; Dave et

al., 2010; Evans & Garthwaite, 2014; Howell, 2001; Hoynes et al., 2015; Kaestner & Lee, 2005). 4




4
  Expansions of the federal earned EITC were also underway over this period. Specifically, an EITC expansion that
passed in 1993 and became effective in tax year 1995 raised the maximum credit for all qualifying families and
further increased the differential in maximum benefits between families with two or more children relative to those
with only one child. In 2001, the income level at which the EITC began to phase out for couples was further
increased. These federal expansions, along with shifts in the national price level and other trends, are captured by the
year and month (θ and γ) fixed effects

                                                                                                                     10
        In order to control for other time-varying, state-level unobservable variables, we also include the

state-year specific mean of the dependent variable for college-educated, married pregnant women

between the ages of 25-44. These women earn wages that make it likely that they would be unaffected by

minimum wage policies. Note that this does not amount to using college-educated married pregnant

women as a comparison group since we are not constraining the coefficient to be one (as would be the

case in a difference-in-difference-in-differences context). We include this variable to control for time-

varying, state-specific changes in the outcomes proportionally affecting low- and higher-educated

mothers. However, we can assess whether this proportional effect is one-to-one, thereby assessing

whether the higher educated group is a valid control within a difference-in-difference-in-differences

(DDD) specification. Except for a subset of models for prenatal care and prenatal smoking, we generally

reject this restriction, and therefore do not utilize college-educated mothers as a direct comparison group.

        The parameter of interest is δ, which captures the reduced-form effect of the increase in the

state’s effective minimum wage. This effect is identified from the substantial variation in the minimum

wage within states over this period (see Figure 1). As noted, we measure the minimum wage as the

average minimum wage in the two year period prior to delivery. In some analyses, we allow for separate

effects of the minimum wage effective during pregnancy and the minimum wage in the one- or two-year

period prior to conception. We think it appropriate to use a longer window than pregnancy to measure the

minimum wage because an increase in the minimum wage prior to pregnancy may affect maternal

preconception health, as well as allowing families to have more savings and smooth consumption during

pregnancy.

        We estimate equation (1) for all low-educated women and for several demographic groups

defined by age, marital status and education because there may be heterogeneous responses and because

different demographic groups are more or less likely to be affected by the minimum wage. Table 1

provides some evidence as to which demographic groups may be more or less affected by the minimum

wage. In Table 1, we present the average number of what we refer to as “affected hours” for different

demographic groups of low-educated mothers. “Affected hours” are the number of annual hours of work

                                                                                                            11
for a family that will be affected by an increase in the minimum wage. It is intended to measure the

annual change in family income from a $1 increase in the minimum wage and is a reasonable

approximation of exposure to the treatment, which is a change in the minimum wage. To calculate

“affected hours”, we estimate for each demographic subgroup the average annual work hours for families

of that subgroup (e.g. low-educated females aged 18-44 years) including all family members who work

and earn an hourly wage that is 1.25 times the minimum wage. 5 This yields an estimate of the change in

annual family income that is likely from a $1 increase in minimum wage. It assumes no employment

effects, which is reasonable given existing evidence (CBO 2014).

        For the full sample of low-educated women, “affected hours” are 477, which implies that a $1

increase in minimum wage would increase annual family income by $477. We also show two alternative

measures that calculate affected hours using different rules about who is likely to be affected by the

minimum wage: those who earn 1.33 times the minimum wage and those who earn $1 above the

minimum wage. The “affected hours” using these alternatives are similar ($558 and $441, respectively).

Figures in the first row of Table 1, show that there is some heterogeneity in “exposure” but not that much.

Younger women and married women are more likely to be affected by an increase in the minimum wage

than older women and single women. This is because young women earn lower wages than older women

and married women are more likely to have spouses that may be affected. Thus, young married women

have the highest number of “affected hours” and older, single women have the lowest number of

“affected hours”, and the difference between the two groups represents a $380 difference in the change in

annual income from a $1 increase in the minimum wage. We note that we calculated “affected hours” as a

rough approximation to measure exposure to an increase in the minimum wage. Besides this differential

exposure to minimum wage, there may be heterogeneous responses in infant health and behavior

weekly work hours across all family members earning less than 1.25 times the minimum wage. Then, we multiply
the weekly work hours by average annual work weeks from the CPS March files to measure annual “affected
hours”. For deriving average annual work weeks, we include all family members with implied hourly wage (based
on reported annual wage income and annual work hours) less than 1.25 times the minimum wage.

                                                                                                              12
behaviors to income changes across demographic groups so it is not necessarily the case that we expect

effect sizes to align with exposure, as measured by “affected hours”.



5. Data

5.a. Natality Files

          Our data come primarily from information on individual birth records from the Vital Statistics,

Natality Files. Detailed information on all individual births occurring in the 50 states and DC are

submitted by hospitals to state vital registration offices, which is then reported to the National Center for

Health Statistics (NCHS). Information on each birth includes date and place of birth along with the

demographic characteristics of the mother, such as age, race, education, marital status, and parity. We use

data for the years 1989 through 2012 that cover pregnancies from 1988 through 2012. We begin our

analysis in1989 because earlier years did not contain information on certain prenatal behaviors. Given

that changes in the minimum wage affect mostly low-educated workers, the primary sample is limited to

women with a high-school degree or less between the ages of 18 to 44 (at time of pregnancy). This yields

approximately 46 million births for the main analytical sample.

          We measure two categories of infant health: 1) birth weight; and 2) gestation. Birth weight is

measured as a continuous outcome (grams) and alternately as an indicator for low birth weight (infant was

born weighing less than 2,500 grams). Gestational age is measured continuously in weeks, and also as an

indicator for whether the infant was born preterm (gestation < 37 weeks). 6

          In order to assess potential mechanisms linking the minimum wage to infant health, we also study

key measures of prenatal inputs available in the birth certificate data. First, we use two measures of




6
 Prior to 2014, gestational age of a newborn was based on the date of the last normal menses (LNM). Beginning in
2014, there has been a transition to a new standard based on the obstetric estimate due to some concerns that the
LNM measure may have weaker validity due to issues with imperfect maternal recall and other forms of
misinterpretation. Martin, Osterman, Kirmeyer, and Gregory (2015) nevertheless find that the two measures were in
agreement for the 2013 birth certificates. The obstetric estimate was within 1 week of the LNM estimate for a total
of 83.4% of records, and within 2 weeks for 91.4% of all 2013 records.

                                                                                                                13
prenatal smoking: smoking participation and smoking more than 5 cigarettes daily during pregnancy. 7

Birth certificates are generally thought to provide a reasonably reliable source of data on prenatal

smoking status for large observational studies (Nielsen et al., 2014), although underreporting of smoking

status has been suggested for as much as one-fifth of smokers (Tong et al., 2013). While underreporting

can inflate our variance estimates, it is unlikely that it is systematically correlated with the minimum

wage, which would bias our estimates of the effect of the minimum wage. We utilize three measures of

prenatal care: the number of prenatal care visits, an indicator for whether there were fewer than five

prenatal visits over the pregnancy, and the number of months that prenatal care was delayed since the start

of pregnancy. 8

5.b. Minimum Wage

         The effective minimum wage in a state is the higher of the state’s legislated minimum wage or

the federal minimum wage. We obtain these data from the US Department of Labor. 9 Figure 1 shows the

considerable variation in the minimum wage across states and over time. Over our sample period (1988-

2012), the federal minimum wage increased from $3.35 to $7.25. Among states, which had set a

minimum wage that superseded the federal level, the average minimum wage increased from $3.74 to

$7.92. Currently, there are 29 states plus DC with minimum wage rates set higher than the federal

minimum wage of $7.25/hour, compared with 10 states in 1988. For our main analyses, we use the real

($2012) minimum wage, which is the nominal wage deflated by the consumer price index, but we report

results for several other measures in the Appendix and note that estimates are not sensitive to how we

measure the minimum wage. Specifically, in some analyses we use the nominal minimum wage and we

also follow Card (1992) and Clemens (2015) and normalize the minimum wage by the median wage rate




7
  These outcomes are not reported by some states (for instance, CA, IN, NY, SD, OK) over all or part of our sample
period. We exclude births occurring in these states when analyzing these behaviors. Limiting all analyses to those
states with consistent information on smoking does not materially alter our results or conclusions.
8
  We also used other measures of prenatal care, such as first trimester intiation and the Kotelchuck index (estimates
not reported in text). Results using these alternative measures are highly similar to those reported in text, in terms of
relative magnitudes, significance, and direction of effects.

                                                                                                                      14
in the state, and refer to this as the “relative minimum wage”. The motivation underlying this relative

measure is to capture the “bite” of the minimum wage; if the median hourly wage in the state is

substantially higher than the minimum wage, then the minimum wage is less binding, and increases in the

minimum wage may elicit smaller responses on labor outcomes (Lee, 1999). Therefore, we take the ratio

of the nominal minimum wage in the state to the prevailing state-specific median “hourly” wage. The

median wage is estimated from annual earnings and work hours from the March CPS. The larger is this

ratio, the more binding is the effective minimum wage in the state.10

        We match the average minimum wage to the birth records by state and over the two-year period

prior to the year and month of birth. 11 Specifically, we take the average of the real minimum wage across

3 time points: birth month, 12 months before birth, and 24 month before birth. All other time-varying

state variables are matched based on state and year of pregnancy.

5.c. Policy Controls

        In addition to the minimum wage, our regression model includes controls for other state policies

that may affect infant health. We follow the standard in the welfare reform literature (see for instance

Dave, Corman, & Reichman, 2012; Blank, 2002; Kaushal and Kaestner 2001; Schoeni & Blank, 2000)

and include dichotomous indicators for whether a given state in a given year had a statewide waiver in

place that substantially altered the nature of AFDC with respect to time limits, sanctions, or work

requirements. We also include a dichotomous indicator for whether the state had implemented TANF in

time period t. 12 Data on whether states had waivers and when they enacted TANF come from U.S.

Department of Health & Human Services (1997; 1999). We control for state EITC legislation via three

measures: 1) an indicator for whether the state had an EITC program; 2) an indicator for whether this

state’s EITC is refundable, which means that the state will refund the credit if no taxes are owed; and 3)


10
   To address any potential endogeneity concerns from the minimum wage concurrently affecting the median wage
rate in the state, we use the one-year lag of the median wage. In practice, whether we divide by the median wage at
time (t) or time (t-1) does not make much of a difference.
12
  For states which implemented an earlier waiver to their AFDC programs, the AFDC indicator is set to 0 when
these states later implement TANF.

                                                                                                                  15
state EITC as a percentage of federal credit. In the late 1980s through the early 1990s, about one-third to

half of the states which offered a tax credit made it refundable. In 2012, virtually all states’ (20 out of 24)

EITC’s were refundable. We obtain information on states’ EITC programs from Tax Credits for Working

Families, Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, and the National Conference

of State Legislatures. 13 We also control for the Medicaid income eligibility expansions for pregnant

women which occurred during the late-1980s through mid-1990s by including the fraction of women who

would be eligible for Medicaid in a given state during each period. 14

5.d. Sample Description

         Table 2 presents sample means for births occurring in 1989 through 2012 for subgroups defined

by age and marital status. On average, the sample is 26 years old and two-thirds have a high school

degree (one-third less than high school). Approximately half the sample is White, 30% Hispanic, 18%

Black and the remaining of other racial groups. Birth outcomes (birth weight, low birth weight, preterm

birth) are significantly worse among single mothers, particularly older single mothers. The average real

minimum wage over this period was $6.97.

6. Results

6.a. Full Sample of Low-educated Mothers

         Table 3 presents estimates of the effect of minimum wages on infant health and maternal

behaviors. Several measures of infant health are used: birth weight in grams, indicator of low birth weight

(<2500 grams), gestational age in weeks, fetal growth (birth weight divided by gestational age) and pre-

term birth. Three measures of prenatal care are used: number of visits, an indicator for fewer than 5 visits,

and an indicator for first trimester care. Two measures of maternal smoking are used: any prenatal

smoking and an indicator of whether mother smoked more than 5 cigarettes daily. Each cell in Table 3

represents the effect of a $1 increase in the real minimum wage.

         Estimates in Table 3 indicate that a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 4.04

gram (0.1%) increase in birth weight; a 0.09 percentage point (1%) decrease in low-birth weight; and a

0.075 unit (0.1%) increase in fetal growth. All estimates are statistically significant. 15 To provide an idea

of what these effects imply in terms of the expected change in annual income, we use the “affected hours”

calculations in Table 1 to derive the effect of a $1000 increase in annual family income on outcomes. In

Table 1, the “affected hours” for the full sample is 477, or $477 of annual family income. Therefore, we

scale the estimates in Table 3 for the full sample by 2.1 ($1000 divided by $477). After scaling estimates

in this way, results suggest that a $1000 increase in annual family income is associated with an 8.5 gram

(0.2%) increase in birth weight; a 0.2 percentage point (3%) decrease in low-birth weight; and a 0.16

(0.2%) unit increase in fetal growth.

         One way to view these scaled estimates is that they are instrumental variables (IV) estimates of

the effect of a change in income on infant health. This approach assumes that the earnings effect from a

higher minimum wage represents the only causal pathway linking the minimum wage to infant health.

Treatment effects calculated this way should be interpreted with caution because small changes in the

denominator, which in this case is “affected hours”, can lead to large changes in implied IV estimates.

Nonetheless, it is a useful exercise to place our minimum wage effect in context and compare it to effects

derived from another major income transfer program, namely the federal EITC. Hoynes et al. (2015)

examined the effects of expansions in the federal EITC, which also increased income (and employment)

among eligible households, on infant health outcomes. They estimate that the effect of a $1000 increase




15
  Appendix Table A1 reports the coefficients for the full models for birth weight. These estimates generally imply
effects consistent with expectations and prior studies. Birth weight increases with the educational attainment of the
mother, and is higher among mothers who are white (relative to black or other race), Hispanic, and married. An
increase in the state’s EITC generosity is positively associated with infant health. We do not find any evidence that
expanded Medicaid eligibility is significantly associated with increases in mean birth weight; prior studies have been
generally mixed on the effectiveness of these expansions in improving infant health (Currie and Gruber 1996;
Howell 2001; Dave et al. 2008). The coefficient of mean birth weight among higher educated mothers is significant
with confidence intervals that do not include one, suggesting that higher educated mothers would not be a valid
counterfactual within a DDD framework.

                                                                                                                   17
in income induced by the EITC expansions on birth weight was 6.4 grams (0.2%) among low-educated

single mothers. Thus, our estimate of 8.5 grams (0.2%) for low-educated mothers is very similar.

        Higher birth weight may reflect either an improvement in fetal growth and/or an increase in

gestational age (reduction in preterm birth), or both. We show estimates of the effect of the minimum

wage on gestational age (measured in weeks) and preterm birth in Table 3. Estimates indicate that a $1

increase in the minimum wage is associated with an insignificant and very small increase in gestational

age and an insignificant and very small decrease in pre-term birth. Comparing these estimates to those for

birthweight suggest that the main explanation of the increase in birth weight is fetal growth, although the

increase in birth weight is quite small.

        Estimates in Table 3 suggest that the minimum wage is associated with a small improvement in

infant health. While several causal channels may underlie these effects, many of which are not observed

in the data available, we are able to assess whether the improved infant health is consistent with effects on

prenatal care and maternal smoking. Estimates in Table 3 indicate that a $1 increase in the minimum

wage is associated with a significant: 0.17 (2%) increase in prenatal care visits; a 0.0034 (5%) decrease in

probability of having less than 5 prenatal care visits; and a 1 percentage point (1%) increase in the

probability of obtaining care in the first trimester. Estimates also indicate that an increase in the minimum

wage is associated with a reduced likelihood of any prenatal smoking and smoking more than 5 cigarettes

daily. Effect sizes are modest: a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with a 1.4 percentage

point (7%) decline in maternal smoking and a 0.9 percentage point (6%) decline in the probability of

smoking greater than five cigarettes per day.

        Estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on prenatal care and smoking are also consistent

with the estimates from the EITC literature. Hoynes et al. (2015) also finds that the federal EITC

expansion reductions in prenatal smoking and expansions in prenatal care. They find that a $1000

increase in income (associated with the EITC expansion) reduced the likelihood of prenatal smoking by

about one percentage point (4.1% relative to the mean). Our estimates suggest that a $1000 increase in

income (associated with the higher minimum wage) also reduced the probability of smoking during

                                                                                                          18
pregnancy among low-educated mothers by about three percentage points (16%). Averett and Wang

(2013) also find that the income effect induced by the federal EITC expansion reduced maternal

smoking. 16

         Appendix Table 2 presents estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on infant health and

maternal behaviors from several alternative model specifications that differ by whether we include time-

varying, state-specific controls, the mean outcome of college-educated women, and the specifications of

year-by-month fixed effects, year-by-demographic factor fixed effects, and state-by-year fixed effects.

These additional specifications account for potential identification threats related to non-linear year-by-

month trends, differential time trends across demographic groups, and most importantly for our design,

differential time trends between states. Estimates from these alternative models are very similar to those

in Table 3 and provide evidence that the difference-in-differences design seems valid.

6.b. Heterogeneity of Effects Across Demographic Groups

         As suggested in Table 1, there is some differences in “exposure” to a minimum wage increase. In

Table 4, we present estimates for different groups of low-educated mothers stratified by age and marital

status. Estimates in Table 4 reveal a very noticeable pattern: effect sizes are larger for young (ages 18 to

29) and married mothers and the largest for young, married mothers. This pattern of estimates is

consistent with the pattern for “affected hours”—estimates of the effect of the minimum wage are larger

for demographic groups with more “affected hours”. The one exception is for older (ages 30 to 44)

married mothers.

         Effect sizes remain quite small even for the groups with larger and statistically significant

estimates. Among young (18 to 29) mothers, a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with: a

5.41 grams (0.2%) increase in birth weight; a 0.1 percentage point (1%) decrease in probability of having



16
   The implied negative relationship between smoking and income that we and others found suggests that smoking is
an inferior good, which is an issue still debated in the literature (e.g., Kenkel, Schmeiser, & Urban, 2014). However,
as we described earlier there are other causal mechanisms besides income that links minimum wage to infant health
and maternal health behaviors. For example, the increases in prenatal care we observe may decrease maternal
smoking because of greater contact with physicians.

                                                                                                                   19
a low-birth weight infant; and a 0.1 unit (0.1%) increase in fetal growth. For this group, an increase in the

minimum wage is not significantly related to gestational age or pre-term birth. In contrast, estimates in

Table 4 indicate that among older (30 to 44) mothers, an increase in the minimum wage has no

statistically significant or clinically significant effect on infant health. Among married mothers, a $1

increase in the minimum wage is associated with: a 3.82 grams (0.1%) increase in birth weight; a 0.1

percentage point (1%) decrease in probability of having a low-birth weight infant; a 0.05 unit (0.1%)

increase in fetal growth; and a very small (0.014 weeks) increase in gestational age. Finally, as noted

earlier and consistent with the estimates just described, the largest estimates in Table 4 are found for

younger, married mothers, but effect sizes are relatively similar to those discussed.

        In Table 5, we report estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on prenatal care and maternal

smoking. For prenatal care, we find that a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with a small

increase in the number of prenatal care visits and most estimates are statistically significant. There is less

heterogeneity across demographic groups in effect sizes than for birth weight and low-birth weight.

Estimates suggest that a $1 increase in the minimum wage is associated with between a 0.15 (1%) and

0.25 (2%) increase in the number of prenatal care visits. Estimates also indicate that a higher minimum

wage is associated with similarly small improvements in the other two measures of prenatal care. For

maternal smoking, estimates show that a higher minimum wage is associated with less smoking. In this

case too, estimates are relatively similar across demographic groups and are quite small; a $1 increase in

the real minimum wage is associated with approximately a 1.5 percentage point (7%) decrease in

maternal smoking.

6.c. Additional Specifications

        We conducted additional analyses to assess whether alternative measures of the minimum wage

and alternative specifications of the minimum wage yield similar estimates as those reported above. In

Appendix Table 3, we report estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on infant health and maternal

behaviors using the nominal minimum wage and relative minimum wage (minimum wage divided by

median wage). Estimates in Appendix Table 3 are similar to those reported in Table 3. For example, a $1

                                                                                                            20
change in the nominal minimum wage, which represents a 20% increase, is associated with a 5.6 gram

increase in birth weight. In Table 3, estimates indicate almost the exact same result: a 20% increase in the

real minimum wage is associated with a 5.6 gram increase. Other estimates in Appendix Table 3 are also

similar to the analogous estimates in Table 3. In sum, the way the minimum wage is measured does not

affect estimates.

        In Appendix Table 4, we present estimates of the effect of the minimum wage on infant health

and maternal behaviors for models that allow the minimum wage to have different effects prior to and

during pregnancy. We show results for two specifications that differ by whether we measure the

minimum wage during one-year or during two-years prior to pregnancy. Estimates in Appendix table 4

show an interesting pattern. The minimum wage during pregnancy is significantly and positively

associated with birth weight, gestational age, and fetal growth and negatively associated with pre-term

birth. The minimum wage prior to pregnancy has little effect on these outcomes. For these outcomes,

estimates associated with the minimum age during pregnancy are approximately the same as those

reported in Table 3. In the case of low-birth weight, however, the minimum wage during pregnancy and

the minimum wage prior to pregnancy have approximately the same effect. This implies that the estimate

of the effect of the minimum wage in Table 3 reflects a cumulative effect of the minimum wage on low-

birth weight. For prenatal care, the minimum wage during pregnancy is positively and significantly

associated with the number of visits. In contrast, it is the minimum wage prior to pregnancy that is

negatively associated with maternal smoking. While we do not have ready explanations for this pattern of

results, as there are a variety of explanations that are consistent with these findings, the upshot is that it is

not only the contemporaneous minimum wage that can influence infant health, but also the cumulative

and prior minimum wage that can affect maternal health and maternal financial status that can have

lasting effects on infant health.

6.d. Compositional Changes and a Falsification Analysis

        In this section, we address two issues: whether the minimum wage is associated with changes in

the composition of mothers and whether we find any effect of the minimum wage on infant health and

                                                                                                               21
maternal behaviors of college educated women who are arguably unaffected. We examine potential

composition selection by directly estimating whether the minimum wage has affected maternal

characteristics. Specifically, using the individual-level data, we estimate regressions testing

whether the minimum wage affected the probability that a given birth occurs to a mother who is lower vs.

higher educated, married vs. single, white, black or other race, and younger vs. older. We find a slight

increase in the probability (about 2 percentage points) of married mothers and slight decline in probability

(0.4 percentage points) of age 25-29 years with higher minimum wage. The estimates however do not

point to any substantial changes in the composition of births. We continue to find improvements in infant

health even when we stratify based on marital status and/or age (as discussed above).

        The final analysis we discuss is a falsification test. We re-estimated the models underlying Table

3 using a sample of college educated mothers ages 25 to 44. We restricted the sample to those 25 and

older because we required mothers to have a college degree to be included in the sample. This group of

women is largely unaffected by the minimum wage, for example, the “affected hours” for this group is

189 (Table 1), and therefore, we expect to find no association between the minimum wage and infant

health and maternal behaviors. Estimates for this sample of college educated mothers are shown in Table

7. All estimates but one in Table 7 are statistically insignificant and all are very small both relative to the

mean for the sample and relative to estimates in Table 3. Overall, estimates in Table 7 provide evidence to

support the validity of the difference-in-differences research design and are consistent with estimates in

Appendix Table 2 that show that our primary set of estimates is not materially affected by model

specification.

7. Conclusion

        The debate over the merits of a minimum wage and over the level of the minimum wage have

been frequent and ongoing for decades. Most of that debate is focused on the labor market effects of the

minimum wage with employment being the most oft debated outcome. However, the increase in income

associated with the minimum wage, which is widely acknowledged for all but the least skilled persons,



                                                                                                             22
may have benefits in other domains. Here we examined whether the minimum wage affected infant

health.

          Our results suggest a small, significant and beneficial effect of a minimum wage increase on birth

weight and the probability of low-birth weight. Estimates suggest that an increase in the minimum wage

that causes a $1000 increase in annual household income is associated with a 8.5 gram (0.3% relative to

the mean) increase in birth weight and 0.2 percentage point (2.5%) decrease in low birth weight. We

found similar effect sizes for other demographic groups with slightly larger effects observed for younger

and married mothers. Results also identified two potential pathways that are consistent with the beneficial

effect of the minimum wage on infant health: greater prenatal care and reduced maternal smoking. Again,

the effect of the minimum wage on these health behaviors is relatively small, but significant. For

example, an increase in the minimum wage that causes a $1000 increase in income increased the number

of prenatal care visits by 3%.

          Our findings are broadly consistent with estimates of the effect of the EITC on infant health,

which is another policy that affects incomes of low-wage workers. Thus, there is a growing body of

evidence that labor market policies that enhance wages can affect wellbeing in broader ways than often

considered. These “other” effects of the minimum wage should enter the debate over its merits.

Notes: “Affected hours” represents the average annual work hours that will likely be affected by an increase in the minimum wage in each group.
These hours were calculated using the CPS Earner Study data based on the following steps. First, we identified all census families including at least
one low- educated female aged 18-44 years. Second, for each of these census families, we identified all family members (paid on an hourly basis or
not) whose reported or estimated hourly wage was less than 1.25 times the state minimum wage in a given year (or alternatively less than
1.33*minimum wage; or less than minimum wage plus $1). Third, we derived a family-level weekly affected hours by summing the weekly work
hours across all those family members identified in the prior step (0 week hours assigned for other family members). Fourth, we averaged family-
level affected weekly work hours across families and multiplied that average by average annual work weeks which estimated from the CPS March
Supplement data (following to the first and second step for weekly hours). For each demographic subgroup, a family was selected if there was at
least one female with these demographic characteristics.

Notes: Estimates from OLS regressions are reported in column 1. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary
correlation in the errors across observations within each state, and reported in parentheses in column 2. Each
estimate in column 1 represents the effect of a $1 increase in the real minimum wage in 2012 dollars averaged over
2 years prior to birth. Regression models include state, year, and month of birth fixed effects. Models also include
the following individual-specific covariates: dummy variable indicators for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and
educational attainment; and the following state-specific covariates: employment-to-population ratio,
unemployment rate, mean wage rate for males, mean wage rate for females, indicator for state EITC, indicator for
refundable state EITC, state EITC as a % of federal EITC, indicator for AFDC waiver, indicator for TANF, fraction
of pregnant women eligible for Medicaid, and the mean outcome rate among married college-educated mothers
ages 25-39. Sample sizes range from 41.42 million to 43.94 million observations. Asterisks denote statistical
significance as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤ 0.05

Notes: Coefficients from OLS models are reported. Each cell represents the effect of a $1 increase in the real minimum wage in 2012 dollars (based on an average of real minimum wage at
birth, one year before birth, and two years before birth). Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation in the errors across observations within each state, and reported in parentheses.
The models control for the state, year, and month of birth fixed effects. Models also include the following individual-specific covariates: indicators for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and
educational attainment; and the following state-specific covariates: employment-to-population ratio, unemployment rate, mean wage rate for males, mean wage rate for females, indicator for
state EITC, indicator for refundable state EITC, state EITC as a % of federal EITC, indicator for AFDC waiver, indicator for TANF, fraction of pregnant women eligible for Medicaid, and the
mean outcome rate among married college-educated mothers ages 25-39. Sample sizes range from 2.81 million to 33.26 million observations. Asterisks denote statistical significance as

Notes: Estimates from OLS regressions are reported in each cell with standard errors in parentheses. Standard
errors are adjusted for arbitrary correlation in the errors across observations within each state. Each estimate
represents the effect of a $1 increase in the real minimum wage in 2012 dollars averaged over 2 years prior to
birth. Sample sizes range from 41.42 million to 43.94 million observations. Asterisks denote statistical
significance as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; ** 0.01 < p-value ≤ 0.05; * 0.05 < p-value ≤ 0.10.

Notes: Estimates from OLS regressions are reported in column 1. Standard errors are adjusted for arbitrary
correlation in the errors across observations within each state, and reported in parentheses. Regression models
include state, year, and month of birth fixed effects. Models also include the following individual-specific
covariates: dummy variable indicators for age, race, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment; and the
following state-specific covariates: employment-to-population ratio, unemployment rate, mean wage rate for males,
mean wage rate for females, indicator for state EITC, indicator for refundable state EITC, state EITC as a % of
federal EITC, indicator for AFDC waiver, indicator for TANF, fraction of pregnant women eligible for Medicaid,
and the mean outcome rate among married college-educated mothers ages 25-39. Sample sizes range from 41.42
million to 43.94 million observations. Asterisks denote statistical significance as follows: *** p-value ≤ 0.01; **
