                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the equilibrium effects of college financial aid policies building an overlapping
generations life cycle model with education, labor supply, and saving decisions. Cognitive and
non-cognitive skills of children depend on parental education and skills, and affect education and
labor market outcomes. Education is funded by parental transfers that supplement grants, loans
and student labor supply. Crowding out of parental transfers by government programs is sizable
and cannot be ignored. The current system of federal aid improves long-run welfare by 6%. More
generous ability-tested grants would increase welfare and dominate both an expansion of student
loans and a labor tax cut.

1        Introduction

Investment in human capital is a key source of aggregate productivity growth and a powerful ve-
hicle for social mobility. However, imperfections in insurance and credit markets can distort skill
investment choices and lead to less than socially optimal educational attainment. Motivated by these
considerations, governments promote the acquisition of education through a variety of interventions.
Financial aid for college students is a pillar of education policy in many countries. For example, in
2012 the US Federal government spent 150 billion dollars on loans and grants for college students.1
Given their magnitude and scope, it is important to quantify the effects of policies intended to advance
college attainment and understand the way they interact with private financing of education.
        In this paper we build a life-cycle, heterogeneous-agent model with incomplete insurance and
credit markets of the type popularized by Rı́os-Rull (1995) and Huggett (1996), featuring inter-
generational links in the tradition of Laitner (1992) and set in an overlapping generations context.
Throughout their life cycles parents make savings and labor supply decisions and, when their children
are old enough, they make financial transfers to them. These transfers depend on the policy environ-
ment, such as the availability of financial aid, and are motivated by both altruism and a paternalistic
preference for children’s education. Cognitive and non-cognitive skills, transmitted across genera-
tions, determine the non-pecuniary cost of education for students and productivity once entering the
labor market. Government grants and loans, private loans, as well as labor supply during college com-
plement parental resources as means of funding the financial cost of college education. Workers of
different gender and education are imperfect substitutes in production. The government redistributes
through a progressive tax system.
        With this rich structure in hand, we study the impact of financial aid policies on college attainment,
welfare, and the aggregate economy. Central to our analysis are the role of liquidity constraints and
uninsurable income risk, policy-induced crowding out of private sources of funding, heterogeneity
and selection, and general equilibrium feedbacks.

       Since Becker (1964), the potential importance of liquidity constraints on education attainment
is well understood. The extent to which credit market imperfections can distort college attendance
depends on the capacity and willingness of parents to fund education for their children, the availability
of government-sponsored grants and loans, and the earnings potential of students.2 Gale and Scholz
(1994) show that inter vivos transfers (IVTs) for education are sizable.3 However, studies using data
from the 1980s and 1990s concluded that family income played a small role in college-attendance
decisions, after controlling for child ability and several family background characteristics (Cameron
and Heckman, 1998; Keane and Wolpin, 2001; Carneiro and Heckman, 2002; Cameron and Taber,
2004). More recently, though, Belley and Lochner (2007) found that parental financial resources
matter significantly for college attendance in the 2000s. In turn, Heckman and Mosso (2014) argue
that much of the family income effect estimated in the 2000s results from low ability children, while
high ability children were already in school.4
       Earnings risk is pervasive and only partially insurable.5 It can affect individual decisions as well
as the impact of policy, including the relative benefit of grants versus loans.6 Thus, we model earnings
as a gender specific stochastic Roy model with a separate process for each education group and depen-
dent on ability. We explicitly account for alternative channels of consumption insurance, including
spousal labor supply as in Blundell et al. (2016b) and intra-family transfers.
       In the model we allow for heterogeneity in both the returns to education and the psychic costs of
schooling, which depend on both cognitive and non-cognitive ability.7 Modeling psychic costs is nec-
   2
       Garriga and Keightley (2015) show that omitting the labor supply margin of college students may lead to large
overestimates in the effects of tuition subsidies.
    3
      Winter (2014) also argues that ignoring parental transfers may lead to wrong inference about the extent of credit con-
straints. Keane and Wolpin (2001) and Johnson (2013) estimate parental IVTs as a function of observable characteristics
from the NLSY79. Brown et al. (2012) show that while parental contributions are assumed and expected in financial aid
packages, they are not legally enforceable nor universally given, implying substantial heterogeneity in access to resources
for students with observationally similar families.
    4
      Carneiro et al. (2011) show that returns to college are in fact negative for low ability children.

    6
      See for example Johnson (2013). As originally emphasized by Levhari and Weiss (1974), college education is a multi-
period investment requiring an ex-ante commitment of resources and time. Uncertainty in its return is a key determinant
of education decisions. Hence, students may be unwilling to finance college using loans when risk about their future
earnings and ability to repay is high.
    7
      The first studies linking human capital investment to life cycle earnings (Mincer, 1958; Becker, 1964; Ben-Porath,

                                                        2
essary because pecuniary returns can only account for part of the observed college attendance patterns
by ability (see Cunha et al., 2005; Heckman et al., 2006a). From a policy perspective, accounting for
such heterogeneity allows a meaningful examination of the importance of targeted interventions. The
way cognitive and non-cognitive skills are transmitted across generations, as well as their effects on
education choices and returns, are estimated from data. In particular, because parental education af-
fects child skills in the model, thus making them endogenous, expanding schooling for the current
generation reduces the cost of human capital accumulation for future generations, an original insight
of T.W. Schultz.8
    To complete our understanding of how government policy can affect educational attainment and
wages we follow Heckman et al. (1998b,c), Lee (2005) and Lee and Wolpin (2006), amongst others,
and set the model in a general equilibrium context, which allows wages to adapt to changes in the sup-
ply and composition of educated workers.9 In our model the aggregate production function depends
on inputs from three types of education and allows for imperfect substitutability between males and
females of the same skill.
    Finally, to shed light on the welfare effects of education policy, we build on Benabou (2002) and
develop a decomposition of welfare gains into aggregate productivity improvements, lower inequality
in initial conditions, and reduced consumption uncertainty.
    Our data is drawn from various US sources, including the Current Population Survey (CPS), the
Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY, 79 and
97), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF),
and the National Accounts. The model is estimated in stages. We first estimate the wage processes,
for each education group and gender, as well as the intergenerational transmission of ability and the
1967) sidestepped the important issue of self-selection into education, as described in the seminal contributions of Rosen
(1977) and Willis and Rosen (1979).
    8
      The dependence of child cognitive and noncognitive skills on parental education in part reflects how investments
in child development vary with parental education (Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Cunha et al., 2010). This provides an
important channel for the intergenerational impact of education policy.
    9
      For a similar approach, see also the work of Bohacek and Kapicka (2012), Krueger and Ludwig (2016), Johnson and
Keane (2013), and Garriga and Keightley (2015).

aggregate production function. Then, having set few parameters based on the literature, we use the
method of moments to estimate the rest of the model’s parameters. The US federal system of grants
and loans is represented in detail, allowing for the existing amount of means testing, to ensure that we
capture the main sources of public funding for education and the way they are targeted in practice.
       We establish that the model fits the data along a number of crucial dimensions that are not targeted
in estimation. For example, cross-sectional life-cycle profiles of the mean and dispersion of hours
worked, earnings, consumption, and wealth are consistent with their empirical counterparts. We are
careful to match numerous statistics about student borrowing, including their average cumulative
loans upon graduation.10 The intergenerational income-rank mobility implied by our model is within
the range estimated by Chetty et al. (2014), and correlation of income between parents and children is
close to the value documented by Solon (1999) for the US. Our modeling choices for federal financial
aid imply marginal effects of parental wealth on college attainment, controlling for child’s ability,
that are similar to those estimated by Belley and Lochner (2007) from the NLSY97. The role of
paternalism is key in explaining these facts. Moreover, when we use the model to simulate an artificial
randomized experiment in which a (treated) group of high-school graduates receives an additional
$1,000 in yearly tuition grants and another (control) group does not, the simulated treatment effect
on college attainment is consistent with the outcomes of quasi-randomized policy shifts surveyed by
Kane (2003), and Deming and Dynarski (1995).
       We conduct a number of different policy experiments, in which we change the size and nature
(general/need-based/merit-based) of the federal grant program and government-sponsored loan limits.
We find that the crowding out of the private (parental) source of funds is a very important feature and
attenuates the effects of policy: every additional dollar of government grants crowds out 25-50 cents
of parental IVTs on average, and a $1,000 reduction in tuition fees lowers the annual earnings of
college students by roughly $100 on average. The amount of crowding out varies across the wealth
distribution, with transfers from poorer parents being more sensitive to policy changes. Overall,
  10
       Lochner and Monje-Naranjo (2011) stress that models may imply too little borrowing relative to data.



                                                        4
however, the current level of federal aid (grants and loans) is welfare improving and accounts for
over 4% of GDP, with the grants and loans being of roughly equal importance. Our estimated model
also implies non-trivial welfare and efficiency gains from further expansions of grant programs. An
additional $1,000 of grants per year for every student (which increases grant spending by roughly
50%) leads to a long-run increase in GDP of close to 1%. While some of this gain derives from
increased college attainment, a substantial part also arises from stronger sorting into college based
on ability, which is efficient in the model. An ability-tested grant expansion is significantly more
effective than a general expansion. One source of this result is the complementarity between parental
education and ability in the production of children’s skills. Finally, consistent with the literature,
the general-equilibrium responses of wages, together with crowding out, imply that the aggregate
long-run effects are less than half the immediate response.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the model and defines equi-
librium. Section 3 describes estimation. Section 4 explores the empirical implications of the model
by assessing its behavior along several key dimensions not explicitly targeted in the parameterization.
Section 5 presents all the policy experiments and offers a general discussion of the main findings.
Section 6 concludes. An Online Appendix contains additional details on the parametrization and on
the results of the policy experiments, as well as a sensitivity analysis.



2     Model

2.1    Overview

Men and women in the model start making choices at age 16. At that point cognitive and noncog-
nitive skills are drawn from a distribution that depends on parental education and skills. Moreover,
parents make financial transfers to their children with which they start them out in life. These inter
vivos transfers (IVT) are in part unconditional (driven by altruism) and in part conditional on children
attending college (driven by paternalism). The IVTs and the ability transmission drive intergener-

                                                5
ational mobility. Given these transmitted endowments of financial resources and abilities, children
make their sequential education choices which can be one of three: less than high school, high school
or college. During college students can finance education by borrowing from private markets, through
government grants and loans, and also by working part time. Once education is completed individuals
marry, drawing a spouse from a distribution that reflects the educational sorting in the data. Over the
lifecycle they make consumption/savings and labor supply decisions and they exogenously have two
children of the same gender. After their children have become independent decision makers, they
continue with the standard lifecycle decisions and eventually retire off their savings and a government
provided pension, living to a maximum age of 100.
   There is a set of overlapping generations at any point in time. Workers of different skills, gen-
der and education combine to produce a consumption good, based on a production function where
workers of different genders and education are imperfect substitutes for each other; skills enhance the
efficiency units of labor supplied. We assume a closed economy in which capital is endogenously
determined by the savings of households. Interest rate and wages clear the capital and labor markets.
The government uses taxation to fund educational programs (grants and loans), pensions, and other
(residual) expenditures.
   We begin by describing the model’s demographic structure, preferences, production technology,
financial markets, and government policies. Next, we outline the life cycle of agents and define
a competitive equilibrium. We abstract from aggregate shocks, and thus describe the economy in
steady state. For this reason, to lighten notation, we omit time subscripts whenever possible. When
discussing the choice of parameter values requires no detour, we do it as we present the model. This
subset of parameter values is summarized in the tables in the Appendix. The rest of the parameteriza-
tion is outlined in Section 3.




                                               6
2.2       Preliminaries

Time is discrete, indexed by t and continues forever. There is no aggregate uncertainty. A period in
the model corresponds to two years. The economy is populated by a continuum of individuals, equally
many males and females. Gender is indexed by g ∈ {m, f } and age by j ∈ {0, 1, ..., J}. At each date
a new cohort of measure one of each gender enters the economy. The first period of life in the model
(j = 0) corresponds to age 16 and the last one (j = J) to age 100. Individuals survive from age j to
j + 1 with probability ζj (strictly less than 1 only after retirement) whose values are taken from the
US Life Tables for the year 2000. Since cohort size and survival probabilities are time-invariant, the
model’s age distribution is stationary.
       The life cycle of individuals comprises four stages: education from age j = 0 to a maximum of
age j CL , marital matching at age j CL +1, work until age j RET −1, and retirement from age j RET to J.
In the first stage the decision unit is the individual. In the last two, the decision unit is the household,
i.e. a husband and wife pair.


Preferences. The consumption and leisure of an individual with gender g ∈ {m, f } at age j are
denoted by cgj and `gj , respectively. We will minimize/suppress subscripts wherever possible in the
following discussion to improve readability. Individuals have gender and age specific preferences
over consumption c and leisure `

                                                                               g
                                                          c1−γ        `1−νj
                                             ugj (c, `) =      + ϑgj         .                        (2.1)
                                                          1−γ        1 − νjg

Some of the preference parameters above are pre-set, based on existing literature: the coefficient of
relative risk aversion γ is set to 1.5.11 For males, ν m and ϑm do not depend on age; ν m is set so that the
(average) Frisch elasticity of labor supply is 1/3, while ϑm is estimated.12 For women each of these
parameters takes two values: one for when they have no children in the household – the same values
  11
       See Attanasio and Weber (1995).
  12
       See Meghir and Phillips (2009) for estimates of Frisch elasticities for men.


                                                          7
they take for men – and one for when they do (ages 30-45). The Frisch elasticity for women with
children is 2/3, following Blundell et al. (2016a). As for males ϑfj are estimated and take two values
depending on whether women have children or not (which here just depends on age).13 The discount
factor β, common across individuals, is a key determinant of wealth accumulation. To inform the
estimation of this parameter, we therefore target an aggregate capital-output ratio of 3.5 annually, as
in the US economy, and obtain an annualized value of β = 0.951.
       We assume full ex-ante commitment within the marriage. Married couples have household pref-
erences
                         uj (cm , cf , `m , `f ) = umj (cm , `m ) + uf j (cf , `f ) + v m + v f                 (2.2)

where v g denotes transfers of utility between spouses (with v m + v f = 0) that allow the initial
commitment to be fulfilled ex-post.14
       We follow Voena (2015) by modeling economies of scale in consumption as dependent on the
                                                                                                                   1
sharing of resources. That is, total expenditure to consume cm and cf is c = [(cm )ρ̃ + (cf )ρ̃ ] ρ̃ .
The optimal allocation of consumption within the marriage requires cm = cf . Hence we have that
          1
c = 2 ρ̃ cg , where ρ̃ = 1.4, as estimated by Voena (2015), implies sizable economies of scale for
couples.


Production.      All final goods are produced by a representative firm using aggregate physical capital
K and an aggregate human capital input H according to the production technology Y = F (K, H),
where F is Cobb-Douglas. We exogenously set the capital share of output α to 0.33 and the annual
capital depreciation rate δ to 0.06.
       We follow Katz and Murphy (1992) and Heckman et al. (1998a) in modelling aggregate labor
input H as a constant elasticity of substitution aggregator of six types of labor inputs, H e,g , indexed
  13
      The key moments that identify the weight on non-market time ϑfj and ϑm are the average hours worked. For men and
childless women this is 35% of their time endowment. When children are present, women work 40% less than men (as in
the CPS 2000 data).
   14
      This specification is consistent with the transferable utility model described in Weiss (1997), pp.89-90.

Both ρ and χ are in (−∞, 1]. Each labor market is assumed to be competitive. The estimation of
the elasticities of substitution and the CES weight parameters sg,e , based on data from the Current
Population Survey (CPS) for 1968-2001, is done separately and prior to the main model estimation.
It takes into account that individuals have different skills that affect the number of efficiency units of
labor that they supply. This is discussed in Section 3.


Financial Markets.      Markets are incomplete. Agents trade claims to physical capital and risk-free
bonds, but cannot buy state-contingent insurance against individual risk. All financial contracts are
transacted by competitive intermediaries (banks). Claims to capital and bond holdings pay the same
return in equilibrium because of no-arbitrage. Households with positive savings receive from banks
an equilibrium interest rate which equals r. Banks lend the funds to other households with borrowing
needs at the rate r− = r + ι, where the wedge ι > 0 is the cost of overseeing the loan per unit of
consumption intermediated. The wedge ι is an important determinant of the proportion of households
who have negative net worth. In the 2001 SCF data this proportion is 6.8%, which we target in
estimation. Our estimate of the unsecured borrowing wedge is ι = 0.064 annually.
   Individuals face debt limits that vary over the life-cycle. High-school students, young (i.e. before
marriage) workers, and retired households cannot borrow. Credit access for the college students is
explained in detail below. Working-age married households are subject to borrowing constraints ae .
The value of ae is set to −$85, 000 if the most educated spouse is a college graduate, −$25, 000 if


                                                9
the most educated spouse is a high school graduate, and −$15, 000 if both spouses have attained
less than high school. These exogenously specified parameters values are informed by self-reported
limits on unsecured credit by family type from the SCF. 15 All retired households can buy annuities at
actuarially fair rates, which allows us to abstract from bequests.16


Government.         The government levies flat taxes τw = 0.27, τk = 0.40 and τc = 0.05 on labor
income, asset income and consumption, respectively (see Domeij and Heathcote, 2004; McDaniel,
2014).17 The government refunds a lump-sum amount of tax revenue ψ to each individual. The
value of ψ largely determines the progressivity of the tax system (how average tax rates vary with
income). We measure progressivity by the ratio of the variance of disposable income to the variance
of pre-government income, which is about 0.61 in national data (see Heathcote et al., 2010). This
progressivity statistic is important for identification of ψ and thus we include it as a targeted moment
in estimation. The government also runs a public pension system which pays an education specific
benefit pe to retirees. The pension replacement rate is exogenously specified as 33% of average
earnings within each respective education group (Mitchell and Phillips, 2006). Once the education
and pension systems have been financed, excess tax revenues are spent on non-valued government
consumption G.


2.3     Life cycle

The life cycle of an individual consists of four phases – education, marital matching, work, and
retirement – which we now describe.
  15
      The lifetime natural borrowing limit (households cannot retire with debt) may be more restrictive for some house-
holds, particularly those approaching retirement.
   16
      As explained, one reason financial markets are incomplete is that there are no state-contingent insurance markets for
(i) individual labor-income risk. As it will be clear from the description of the rest of the model, there are also missing
markets to insure (ii) the risk of being born with disadvantaged initial conditions (e.g. poor, uneducated, or low-ability
parents), (iii) the shocks affecting the psychic cost of education, and (iv) adverse outcomes at the marital matching stage.
   17
      The tax τk is levied only on positive capital income. We use τk throughout with the convention that if a < 0 then
τk = 0.




                                                       10
2.3.1    Education

The education stage lasts three periods and includes two decisions. At the onset of the first period of
adult life (j = 0) individuals choose whether to finish high school or enter the labor market. In the
second period those who completed high school decide whether to attend college, which lasts for two
periods if chosen. Since there is no uncertainty during college, in our model college students do not
drop out.18
    As analyzed by Cunha et al. (2005) and Heckman et al. (2006a), psychic costs –reflecting pre-
paredness or taste for education– are an important component of schooling decisions. In our model
an individual’s utility cost κeg of attaining education level e depends on gender, standardized cognitive
skills θcog , standardized non-cognitive skills θnon (with the pair summarized by the vector θ), and
an idiosyncratic preference shock κ . This shock is common to high school and college (but with a
different loading) and drawn from a standard normal distribution. Specifically, we assume the linear
relationship


                 κeg (θ, κ ) = ς0e + ς1e 1{g=f } + ς2e log(θnon )/σnon + ς3e log(θcog )/σcog + ς4e κ                 (2.5)


where (σnon , σcog ) are the standard deviations of the distributions of the two components of ability.
The education specific coefficients (ς1e , ς2e , ς3e , ς4e ) are included in our main estimation and discussed in
Section 3.
    These education decisions involve comparison of lifetime values under the different scenarios. In
what follows, let the value of continuing in school for an individual with gender g and age j be Vgj∗
and the value of entering the workforce with education e be Vgje .
   18
      Individuals can therefore enter the labor force either at age j = 0 as with less than high school attainment, or at age
j = 1 as high-school graduates, or at age j = 3 as college graduates. To avoid further complexity, we abstract from
modeling the college drop-out decision. The vast majority of dropouts occur in the freshman year, and dropout rates are
far higher for part-time than full-time students. Thus, for the most part, very little commitment has been made among the
vast majority of those who choose not to complete college, and the absence of outlays of time and money by dropouts in
our model of high school graduates is likely to be of little substance. When relating to the data we count only those who
complete college as having attended.



                                                        11
       When individuals start out making choices they know their own cognitive and noncognitive ability
θ, and the random component of psychic cost κ of continuing education. They also know the amount
of transfers parents will make. Denote the unconditional transfer by â0 and the component of the
transfer conditional on attending college by âCL . Finally, they know their eligibility status for college
financial aid in the form of grants g and loans b, denoted by the index q ∈ {1, 2, 3}, which as we
explain later depends on parental income and wealth. Let this starting set of initial conditions be
  ∗
x0 = (θ, κ , â, âCL , q). It is also useful to summarize the set of initial conditions for an individual
who decides to stop schooling and enter the labor force as x0 = (θ, a0 = â, z0 ), where a0 is the initial
level of wealth, and z0 is the initial productivity draw which is unknown at the time of the decision.
       At the time of this first decision, the value of an individual can be therefore written as


                       Vg0 (x∗0 ) = max Vg0∗ (x∗0 ) − κHS
                                                                       LH        
                                                       g  (θ, κ ), E0  V g0 (x 0 )                                  (2.6)


where E0 is the expectation operator over the initial productivity draw.19 In all our policy counterfac-
tuals of Section 5, welfare calculations are based on this initial value function Vg0 .
       Individuals who choose to enter the labor force at age j = 0 with e = LH (or at age j = 1 with
e = HS) solve the follow problem:


                       Vgje (xj ) =
                                                                           e            
                                          max          ug (cj , `j ) + βEj Vg,j+1 (xj+1 )                            (2.7)
                                        cj ,`j ,aj+1

                                        s.t.

             (1 + τc )cj + aj+1 = (1 − τw ) wg,e εg,e
                                                  j (θ, zj ) (1 − `j ) + ψ + [1 + r (1 − τk )] aj

                           aj+1 ≥ 0,           cj ≥ 0,         `j ∈ [0, 1]

                           zj+1 ∼ Γzg,e (zj+1 | zj ) .


where Ej is the expectation operator conditional on the information set at age j, xj = (θ, aj , zj ),
  19
     Note that, the state vector for those who continue into high school (HS) is the same as the initial one because no new
information is revealed to them at that point, which explains the use x∗0 on the right hand side of equation (2.6).

and wg,e is the gender and education specific price for a unit of human capital. The gender, age and
education specific function εg,e
                             j relates ability θ and idiosyncratic productivity shock zj to productive

efficiency per unit of labor supplied. The exact dependence of εg,e

                           e
of the productivity shock Γgz are described in detail in Section 3.
       The value of completing high-school as seen from age j = 0 is defined by




            Vg0∗ (x∗0 ) = max ug (c0 , 1 − t̄) + β max Vg1∗ (x∗1 ) − κCL
                                                                                      HS        
                                                                      g  (θ, κ ), E0  V g1 (x 1 )     (2.8)
                              c0 ,a1

                              s.t.

                   a1 = [1 + r (1 − τk )] â0 − c0 (1 + τc ) + ψ

                   a1 ≥ 0,             c0 ≥ 0.


High-school students can neither borrow nor work. They study for a fraction t = 0.25 of their time
endowment, and consume the rest as leisure. If they decide to continue to college, their state vector
gets updated to x∗1 = (θ, a1 + âCL , q), since they receive the conditional transfer from their parents.
       College lasts for two (two-year, j = 1 and j = 2) periods. Thus, the values of being in college in
the initial and final period are, respectively


                                        Vg1∗ (x∗1 ) = max              ug (c1 , `1 ) + βVg2∗ (x∗2 )    (2.9)

and
                                  Vg2∗ (x∗2 ) = max ug (c2 , `2 ) + βE3 Vg3CL (x3 )
                                                                                   
                                                                                                      (2.10)
                                                 c2 ,`2 ,a3 ,b3


where x∗2 = (θ, a2 , b2 , q) and the expectation operator in the second value function captures the un-
certainty with respect to the initial productivity draw of college graduates.20 These two maximization
problems are subject to a number of constraints. First, the non-negativity of consumption c ≥ 0.
  20
       The state vector x3 is described in detail in Section 2.3.2.


                                                                  13
Second, the time allocation constraint `j ∈ [0, 1 − t̄]: labor supply in college is flexible, but the time
endowment available for work is reduced by t̄ units to reflect the time required for learning. Working
students supply high-school equivalent labor.21,22
       We now turn to college students’ budget constraints, which also illustrates how government pro-
grams affect schooling choices. All students have access to unsubsidized student loans up to a value b.
Unsubsidized loans cumulate interest at rate ru both during and after college. Students with financial
need, measured by their parents’ resources (q = 1), have access to subsidized loans up to a limit bs .
Interest on subsidized loans is forgiven during college. Those with wealthy parents (q = 3) have
access to private loans at the rate rp . Because rp < ru , and because the credit limit on private loans ap
allows them to fully fund college through private credit, students with q = 3 who choose to borrow
always select this option.23 Federal grants g are awarded by the government through a formula that
makes them a function of both parental wealth and student abilities. Hence, we allow grants to be
both need-based and merit-based. To simplify notation, we refer to φ (q, θ) as tuition fees φ net of
grants g (q, θ). Next, we state the college students’ budget constraints.
       A student with wealthy parents (q = 3) has the option to borrow privately and faces the following
  21
        For simplicity their labor productivity, εg,HS
                                                   j     in the budget constraint below is allowed to depend only on gender,
age j and ability θ. Implicitly, we are assuming every college student has idiosyncratic productivity value equal to the
population mean (z = 0). Moreover, in our model we do not allow for potential disruptions to schooling effort associated
with working while in college. See Garriga and Keightley (2015) for a model where time devoted to work competes with
time needed to cumulate credits in college.
    22
       Our model generates average hours worked by students approximately equal to 15 hours per week. In comparison,
Garriga and Keightley (2015) report 20 hours per week worked by students on average. In addition to this, our model
fits reasonably well the extensive margin too. For example, in the NCES Baccalaureate and Beyond data for graduating
seniors 2007-8, 19% of students reported not working and in our model 14% of students choose not to work.
    23
       Implicitly, interest rates on private education loans depend on credit scores. See Ionescu and Simpson (2016). As a
result, poor families with low credit scores face high borrowing rates on private education loans. Implicitly, we assume
that these rates are so high that poor families choose not to use the private market to finance their children’s education.

    We parameterize tuition costs, grants and student loans using data published by the NCES for the
year 2000 (source: Student Financing of Undergraduate Education: 1999-2000, Statistical Analysis
Report). In Appendix A we provide a detailed description of the federal system of financial aid to



                                                   15
college students (as in the year 2000) that we aim to reproduce in estimation.
       Some of these parameters can be set externally, because they have an exact counterpart in the data
(see Table 6.1). We define the cost of college as tuition fees plus the cost of books and other academic
material net of institutional and private grants, and we compute an average across all full-time, full-
year dependent students enrolled in private not-for-profit and public 4-year colleges in the year 2000.
We obtain an average annual cost φ of $6,700. Federal and state grants g are means-tested, with
children of low (q = 1), middle (q = 2) and high (q = 3) wealth parents receiving $2,820, $668 and
$143 per year, respectively. Thus, net annual tuition φ(q, θ) is $6,700 minus the applicable federal
grant, depending on q.
       Cumulative borrowing limits for federal loans to (dependent) students were $23,000 in year 2000,
of which a maximum $17,250 could be subsidized if the student qualified. We use these values to set b
and bs and we specify ap so that cumulative private and federal borrowing limits are equal. Moreover,
in 2000 the interest rate on federal student loans was prime (r− in our model) plus 2.6%, in addition
to initiation fees that are on average 0.5%. Thus we set ru = r− + ιu , where ιu = 0.031 annually.
       The rest of the parameters are internally estimated. In 2000, to qualify for a subsidized loan (status
q = 1) a child’s family must pass two tests. The first is a potential income test, which stipulates that
the higher earning parent would earn less than a full-time equivalent of $55,000.24 The second test is
a parental wealth test based on a threshold which is included as a parameter in our main estimation. A
higher wealth threshold, also internally estimated, determines eligibility for unsubsidized loans (status
q = 2). Students of type q = 3 with parental wealth above this second threshold borrow privately at
the rate rp = r− + ιp , where ιp is to be estimated as well. We include three moments in estimation that
are especially informative about these three parameters: (i) federal student loans were taken out by
62.1% of graduating seniors, (ii) subsidized federal loans were taken out by 41.9% of such students,
and (iii) 13.4% of students did not use any form of government aid. We estimate the two eligibility
thresholds to be approximately $124,000 and $168,000 and the private student loan annual interest
  24
       The NCES data indicate that very few subsidized loans are given to children from families with high incomes.



                                                        16
premium to be 0.029.
       To simplify the computation we assume that at the end of college all student debt (private and
federal loans) is refinanced into a single private bond that carries the interest rate r− . Define ã3 to
be the student net asset position based on assets a3 (possibly negative for those borrowing from the
private sector), federal student loans b3 and the qualification indicator q. For those students who
graduate with debt, ã3 is computed as the present value of all future payments that must be made
on student loans, depending on the amount borrowed and applicable interest rates, discounted at rate
r− . When making this calculation we assume that fixed payments would have been made for 10
periods following graduation. This approach provides a close approximation to a setting where fixed
installments are required for a given number of periods, but households can use unsecured debt to
make these payments if necessary.25 Appendix A illustrates this conversion scheme in more detail.
Because of this simplification, at the end of period j = 3, college graduates enter the marital matching
stage with x3 = (θ, ã3 , z3 ).


2.3.2     Marital Matching

Matching takes place at the same age (at the end of period j = 3) for everyone. Although men and
women are heterogeneous in several dimensions upon entering the matching stage (education, ability,
wealth, and productivity) we assume that (i) probabilistic matching between men and women is based
only on education and that (ii) everyone marries. Matching rates in the model are based on observed
CPS data, for which educational pairing frequencies are provided in Table 2.1. The heavy weight on
the diagonal is a manifestation of the pronounced assortative matching.
       Our policy experiments modify the shares of men and women in each education group which
requires us to take a stand on how these changes affect the conditional matching probabilities. Our
approach is to represent the observed matching matrix of Table 2.1 with an assortative component and
a random component, like in Fernández and Rogerson (2001): with some probability, the individual

    Without this debt consolidation, the state space of married couples would have two additional state variables (student

is assigned to a partner of the same education level (or the closest level, if not enough partners of that
education group are available in the marriage market) and with the complementary probability she
draws randomly from the pool of available men. In counterfactual, we keep this probability constant
and thus we maintain the same degree of assortative matching. Appendix B.2 explains this approach
in detail.
    We assume that the value of marriage is shared equally with full commitment ex-ante and that
there is no possibility of divorce.26 Full commitment implies that the wealth levels of the two spouses
after marriage get combined into a household wealth level. Appendix B contains more details on the
calculation of value functions at this stage.


2.3.3   Working-Age Families

In this stage, each family solves a standard life-cycle problem akin to the one in equation (2.7). The
key difference is that the choice variables include consumption and labor supply of both members
of the household. The structure of the shocks is the same, with uncertainty over efficiency units of
human capital for both husband and wife, as specified before. Total household expenditures allow for
economies of scale, as specified in Section 2.2. The couple’s value function Wj (xj ), together with
the relevant budget constraint, is shown in Appendix C.
  26
     There are no singles in the model. Consequently there is no well defined outside option to marriage. If there was
an alternative to marriage, then the sharing rule would be defined as a share of surplus computed based on outside
options. This would add the complexity of a heterogeneous and possibly age-varying Pareto weight in the case of limited
commitment, i.e. two additional state variables for the couple.


                                                     18
   The household problem becomes slightly different when the children (a pair) are born because
parents know the gender of children right away, which adds a state variable from j = (age) on.
Parents do not know exactly what a child’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills will turn out to be yet,
but they can forecast them based on parental skills and education. Abilities and education preferences
(the random component of the psychic shock) of a child are revealed to their parents at the stage when
inter vivos transfers to the children are chosen. The household problem in the period of the inter vivos
transfers is described in more detail in Section 2.4 below.


2.3.4   Retirement

After inter vivos transfers have been made and children have left home, parents continue working
until retirement age j RET − 1. Once retired, they solve a simplified problem with labor supply fixed at
zero. Their income is augmented by social security payments, which depend on the level of education.
Retirees may die at age j with probability equal to the empirical mortality rates (US Life Tables,
2000). We assume perfect annuity markets during retirement, thus the return to saving is increased
in line with the mortality rate for the relevant age because the assets of expiring households are
redistributed within cohorts. We show the problem of retired households in Appendix C.


2.4     Intergenerational Linkages

The two crucial mechanisms for intergenerational linkages in our model are (i) the transmission of
skills and (ii) inter-vivos transfers, both from parents to children.


Transmission of Abilities. We view skills as being formed during childhood and crystalized by age
16, the starting point for choices. Given the available data we assume that cognitive and noncognitive
skills are drawn from a joint distribution that depends on the mother’s own cognition and her educa-
tion. The dependence on mother’s education endogenizes the intergenerational transmission of skills
and reflects the dependence of investments in children on educational attainment of parents, which


                                                19
is consistent with the literature: Cunha and Heckman (2008) and Cunha et al. (2010) estimate that
parental background and child investments have a strong effect on the development of child skills,
while Carneiro et al. (2013) find that both maternal education and AFQT test scores are important
determinants of child ability.
       In counterfactual simulations we assume that the relationship of skills with parental education,
conditional on parental cognitive skills, can be taken as causal; hence as the parents change their
education choices as a result of policy, they affect child skills based on our estimated relationship.27


Intervivos Transfers.           Individuals start their life with some wealth and funding for their education,
which is the result of parental transfers. To reduce the computational burden, we posit that each
family has two identical children. Hence, the family makes the same transfers to each of them. The
unconditional transfers â0 are paid to the child immediately, whereas the college-conditional transfers
âCL are committed to a trust account when the child is 16, and then paid to the child upon entering
college at 18.
       Utility from children and the resulting transfers, arises from both altruism and paternalism. In
what follows, we denote variables for the child with the ˆ symbol. The altruistic weight parents put
on their child’s expected lifetime utility is ωĝ . Beyond altruism, parents may enjoy a utility gain ξ if
their child goes to college, reflecting paternalistic preferences. This is an important feature which may
explain why, in the data, lower ability children of wealthier parents attend college. It is also relevant
for the extent to which private transfers are (or are not) crowded out by government programs. The
additional value that parents obtain from their children at the age where the latter start making their
own choices is therefore given by


                                                ωĝ Vg0 (x∗0 ) + ξ · I{ê=CL} ,                                   (2.14)


where I{ê=CL} indicates whether the child attends college. At the time of the transfer, parents know
  27
       Details on estimation of these transition matrices using the the CNLSY79 data are reported in Section 3.


                                                         20
both the abilities of the child (θ̂) and her random shock to education preferences (κ̂ ), which are
included in the child’s state variables x∗0 . We allow altruism to depend on gender because we observe
gender differences in inter vivos transfers; however, we restrict paternalism to be the same across
genders because we do not observe gender differences in the influence of parental wealth on education.
   Transfers are determined by augmenting the parent’s value function by the value defined in equa-
tion (2.14) and maximizing with respect to the conditional and unconditional transfers, subject to the
constraint that these amounts cannot be negative. The cost of the transfer to the parent is the reduc-
tion in their wealth. Gains from transfers accrue to the parents for two reasons. First, the children’s
       ∗
value Vg0 (x0 ) is increasing in (â0 , âCL ) and parents are altruistic. Second, a large enough conditional
transfer âCL can induce the child to choose to attend college, and since parents are paternalistic they
experience an extra utility gain ξ from this choice. Because of the fixed nature of the utility gain,
this paternalistic motive is stronger for wealthy parents whose marginal utility from consumption is
low. Thus to identify the parameters linking generations through altruism and paternalism we will use
data on inter-vivos transfers as well as data on educational attainment by parental wealth and child
ability. In particular the rate of college attendance for lower ability children is driven exclusively
by parental wealth, and this feature helps distinguish pure altruism from paternalistic preferences for
college attendance.
   The formal structure of the dynamic problem of the family in the period of the inter vivos transfers
is presented in Appendix C and details of the estimation of altruism and paternalism parameters are
contained in Section 3.


2.5    Equilibrium

We solve for the stationary equilibrium of our economy numerically. In equilibrium, individuals
maximize their expected lifetime utility by choosing their education level, federal loans as college
students, consumption and saving, labor supply, and inter-vivos transfers to their children. Firms
maximize profits by choosing capital and labor inputs. Prices clear all markets. The government

                                                 21
budget constraint is balanced period by period. Stationarity implies that the cross-sectional allocations
for any given cohort of age j are invariant over time. A detailed definition of the stationary equilibrium
and its numerical computation is presented in Appendix C.



3         Estimation Results

There are three sets of parameters in the model: those that we fix externally based on the literature,
such as the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption and labor supply (see Table 6.1 for
a complete list); those that are estimated separately, namely the production function, the wage process
and the intergenerational transmission of abilities; and those that are estimated within the equilibrium
model using the method of moments, conditional on the two previous sets. This last group includes
parameters determining the psychic costs of education, some preference parameters (including the
discount factor, altruism and paternalism) and several others, listed in Table 6.2.
         In what follows, we discuss in more detail the estimation strategy and results for the second set of
parameters and for the psychic costs, altruism and paternalism parameters.


3.1         Aggregate Production Function

Recall our aggregate technology specification in equations (2.3) and (2.4). Under the assumption that
all labor markets are competitive, we estimate the technology parameters and test the iso-elasticity as-
sumptions using CPS data on wage bills and hours worked for the different gender-education groups
for the years 1968-2001. Details of our estimation and tests, including robustness checks using dif-
ferent instruments and specifications, are presented in Appendix D.
         In the numerical analysis we set the elasticity of substitution between education aggregates to
3.3 (i.e. ρ = 0.7). This is within the range of our estimates and in line with values reported in
the literature.28 Our specification of technology also allows for imperfect substitutability of male
    28
         Many estimates in the literature are based on a coarser two-type skilled/unskilled classification for labor, with no


                                                          22
and female efficiency units.29 We use a baseline value of χ = 0.45 in the numerical simulations,
corresponding to an ‘education-conditional’ elasticity of roughly 1.8 between men and women, a
number within our range of estimates. The values of the gender/education CES weights sg,e are
reported in appendix D.30
    This specification of aggregate technology, together with the equilibrium selection mechanism
of the model, yields college and high school wage premia that are consistent with the data. Apply-
ing the estimation approach of Goldin and Katz (2007) to data simulated from our model, the log
college/high-school wage differential is estimated to be 0.58, and the HS graduate - less than HS
log wage differential is 0.37. These values are close to the estimates presented in Goldin and Katz
(2007, Table A8.1) for the year 2000 which place the college premium between 0.58 and 0.61, and the
high-school premium between 0.26 and 0.37. When we examine gender gaps, recent work by Goldin
(2014) indicates that median full-time earnings of women (in the year 2000) were roughly 74% those
of men, and our model generates a corresponding figure of 73%.


3.2     Wage Process and the Impact of Ability on Earnings

The wage process is an important ingredient of the model as it determines the career profile as well
as the amount of uninsurable uncertainty faced by individuals. We allow individual wage dynamics
to depend on age, gender, education and abilities. Heckman et al. (2006b) document that the effects
of cognitive skills on earnings are 4-5 times larger than those of non-cognitive skills. In light of this
gender differences. Katz and Murphy (1992) estimate the elasticity of substitution to be 1.41; Heckman et al. (1998a)
report a favorite estimate of 1.44. Card and Lemieux (2001) obtain an elasticity of substitution between college and high
school workers of about 2.5; however, their estimated elasticity, when accounting for imperfect substitutability across age
groups, ranges between 4 and 6. Finally, using a nested specification with three human capital types Goldin and Katz
(2007) suggest a preferred elasticity between college and non-college workers of 1.64.
   29
      Existing evidence suggests that equally-skilled individuals of different gender are not perfect substitutes, see for
example Johnson and Keane (2007).
   30
      Our production function specification does not display capital-skill complementarity. Krusell et al. (2000) find evi-
dence of complementarity between equipment capital (but not structure) and college educated workers. Given the richness
of the household side of the model, we chose to maintain the production side relatively stylized and opted for one type of
capital. In our policy experiments the aggregate capital stock changes very little (policy changes only affect the saving be-
havior of the wealth-poor, who account for a small share of aggregate wealth). Therefore, the additional effect of changes
in capital on the college premium would be fairly small with capital-skill complementarity.

This heterogeneity in returns to schooling will in part drive differences in education choices between
men and women and across ability groups.
   We estimate wage processes correcting for selection into work, which provided significant adjust-
ments for women but not for men. In Appendix E we discuss aspects of the estimation and report the
resulting deterministic age profile for each education group, which is by now standard: the higher the
level of education, the steeper the increases of wages with earnings.
   The estimates of the ability gradient and the stochastic process of the shocks are reported in Tables
3.1 and 3.2 respectively. The ability gradient for wages increases with education, implying a strong
complementarity between the two. It is also the case that the returns to ability increase by more for

to being a random walk for all but females with less than high school. Notably, even for given ability,
the variance of initial productivity draws increases with education for women, and even more so for
men. This uncertainty is particularly difficult to insure against, since at young ages individuals tend
to be wealth-poor.


3.3    Intergenerational Transmission of Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Skills

To measure the transmission of cognitive and non-cognitive skills between generations, we use data
from the ‘Children of the NLSY79’ survey, which provides test scores of cognitive skills and edu-
cation for mothers, as well as cognitive and non-cognitive skills for children. We approximate non-
cognitive skills using the first principal component factor among five measures from the behavioral
problems index (antisocial, anxiety, headstrong, hyperactive and peer conflicts). Children’s cognitive
skills are measured as the first principal components among PIAT math, reading recognition and read-
ing comprehension scores. Mothers’ cognitive skills are approximated by AFQT scores. Mothers are

also classified into three education attainment levels.
    We begin by grouping individuals into terciles of each skill variable (separately mother and chil-
dren). The discretization of skills and the level of detail we choose is designed to make the compu-
tational problem tractable. Having discretized skill levels in this way, we characterize each mother
by an education/cognitive achievement pair, and each child by a cognitive/non-cognitive achievement
pair. In this way we are able to estimate a 9 × 9 transition matrix Γθ of empirical frequencies, link-
ing mothers’ education and cognitive skills to the cognitive and non-cognitive achievement of their
children. The entire transition matrix is reported in online appendix Table F.1. In Table 3.3 we sum-
marize the full transition matrix by reporting the distribution of child cognitive outcomes conditional
on maternal cognition tercile and education. A mother’s education and cognition are both important
for her child’s cognitive skills. These results confirm the presence of a strong relationship between
maternal inputs and child skills as documented in papers already cited above.

3.4       The Method of Moments Estimation

Table 6.1 in the appendix lists parameters that we set in advance. Given these parameters, as well
as the production function, income processes and transition matrices for intergenerational transmis-
sion of cognitive and non-cognitive skills that we have just discussed, we estimate the remaining
parameters by minimizing an unweighted quadratic distance criterion between data moments and cor-
responding moments implied by the model. The moments implied by the model can be computed
explicitly without simulation, exploiting the fact that we discretize the state space. We then use the
Efficient Global Optimization algorithm (Jones et al., 1998), which is derivative free, saving com-
putational time in practice. In what follows we discuss results on psychic costs of education and
intergenerational linkages in preferences.
    Table 6.2 shows the remaining estimated parameters with corresponding standard errors (com-
puted with pre-set and pre-estimated parameters taken as given), and Tables 6.3-6.6 show the fit of
the model with respect to the distribution of educational attainment by parental wealth and cognitive
skills.


3.5       Psychic Cost of Education

Schooling is determined by the discrete choice problems in equations (2.6) and (2.8). Variability in
educational attainment by cognitive and non cognitive skills, for which we have measures, helps iden-
tify ς2e and ς3e . The expression for the psychic costs of education also includes the parameter ς4e , which
defines the variance of unobserved shocks to the costs of education. This raises an identification ques-
tion: normally in a discrete choice model this scale parameter would not be identified, which would
mean that the psychic costs of schooling would be identified up to scale only. Here, however, the
choice between education levels depends on the expected value implied by each educational option.
These value functions have a scale that is entirely determined by the flow of leisure and consump-

Table 3.4: Parameters of the psychic cost functions. When coefficients are negative it means that increasing
the corresponding variable reduces the psychic costs of education. Reported marginal effects are changes
in the proportion attending the respective education level (high school or college) as a result of increasing the
corresponding right hand side variable by one standard deviation in the psychic costs function, for that education
level only, and keeping everything else the same. For the case of “Female” the marginal effect corresponds to
changing male preferences to be identical to females. Asymptotic standard errors are in parentheses.


tion.31 In other words, once we specify a preference class and assign values to its parameters, value
functions are completely determined, including their scale. Moreover, these values enter the educa-
tion choice with a unit coefficient and thus determine the scale of the psychic costs in the same util
units in which the values themselves are defined (see equations 2.6 and 2.8).32
       The parameters of the psychic costs of education are presented in Table 3.4. In interpreting these
values note that all right hand side variables are standardized to have unit variance and mean zero.
       Being a woman increases the cost of high school but has no significant effect on college psychic
costs, although the point estimate is negative. Non cognitive and cognitive skills reduce costs of
education. Cognitive skills have a particularly important effect in reducing costs of college.
       In Table 3.5 we present the value of psychic costs for High School graduates and College gradu-

ates. These are the total realized costs for completing the respective level of education born by those
making this choice. These numbers are thus lower than the corresponding population ones because of
self-selection. As already discussed the psychic costs include an observable and an unobservable com-
ponent. The explained variance (R2 ) for high school graduates is 60.5% of the total, while for college
graduates it is 37.3%. Thus while measurable cognitive and non-cognitive skills play an important
role, there is a large part of the psychic costs of education that remains unexplained, particularly for
college, as also found by Eisenhauer et al. (2015) amongst others.


3.6     Altruism, Paternalism and Inter Vivos Transfers

The NLSY97 provides information on family transfers received by young individuals. In particular, it
asks respondents about any gifts in the form of cash (not including loans) from parents. Appendix G
describes the sample we construct and the methodology we use to measure early inter vivos transfers,
and it reports basic facts about parental gifts to young individuals, as recorded in the NLSY97. Since
we model early inter vivos transfers as one-off gifts from parents to children occurring before college
age, we restrict attention to the cumulative transfer between age 16 and 22. In our calculations we
also include imputed rents for students living in their parents’ home.33
    In the data we observe male children receiving somewhat larger transfers than female children.
  33
     We find that the co-residence component makes up a large fraction of the total inter vivos transfers, as also emphasized
by Johnson (2011).




                                                        29
The average transfer gifted to a male child is just above $33,000, while the average transfer gifted to
a female child is around $29,000.
       Paternalistic preferences for college, beyond pure altruism, may motivate wealth transfers. To
help identify the effect of paternalism, we use information about the relative college attainment rate
of children from wealthy and high income families relative to poorer families for different ability
levels of the children. College attainment in the NLSY97 is strongly and positively correlated with
reported parental income and net worth. For example, children whose parents are in the fourth quartile
of the wealth distribution are nearly three times as likely to become college graduates as those whose
parents are in the first quartile. More importantly, low ability children from wealthy families are much
more likely to attend college than similar children from less wealthy families. This difference helps
identify paternalistic preference. Among the estimation moments we include the fractions of college
graduates and those with less than High School within each parental wealth quartile and parental
income quartile.
       The resulting estimated altruism parameters are ωm̂ = 0.518 (s.e. = 0.107) for males and ωfˆ =
0.470 (s.e. = 0.076) for females, showing a small preference for boys which translates into some
gender differences in inter vivos transfers across counterfactual policy experiments.34
       The paternalism parameter is estimated to be ξ = 0.28 (s.e. = 0.04), which corresponds to
a parental willingness to pay for college attendance of the child of $21,500 on average or 3.7% of
average lifecycle consumption. The economic importance of this parameter can be seen in the fact
that in our model about 30% of college graduates receive conditional transfers from their parents.
Among students receiving conditional transfers, 2/3 have parents in the top quartile of net worth and
the remaining 1/3 have parents in the third quartile of net worth. Without the paternalistic preference
for college, the model would not be able to explain the extent to which college attainment rates
among children of wealthy parents exceed those among children of poorer parents, particularly for
lower ability children.
  34
      Imposing an equal parameter for altruism between genders would, however, fail to fully close the $4,000 gap in
transfers estimated in the data, suggesting that this difference has more to do with heterogeneity in market returns.

4     Implications of the Model

We examine the behavior of the model along six dimensions. First, we analyze the implied lifecycle
profiles for hours worked, earnings, consumption, and wealth. None of these moments are explicitly
targeted in the parameterization (only those for wages are). Second, we study the determinants of
parental transfers to children. Third, we measure the degree of intergenerational persistence of ed-
ucational attainment and income in the model (also, not targeted). Fourth, we examine the role of
parental wealth in determining educational achievement. Fifth, we reinforce the empirical plausibility
of the model by simulating an artificial randomized experiment where a (treatment) group of high-
school graduates receives a college tuition subsidy and a (control) group does not. This last simulation
shows that the elasticity of college attainment with respect to tuition in our model is comparable to es-
timates from the empirical literature on schooling. Finally, we assess the role of assortative matching
in determining the return to education and other aggregate equilibrium outcomes. In Appendix H we
show that the model also provides reasonably good out-of-sample predictions on college attendance
rates and wage premia when extrapolated to the year 2010.


4.1    Life-Cycle Profiles

Figure 4.1 plots averages and dispersion of log earnings, log consumption, and wealth over the life
cycle for our three education groups. It also reports log hours worked separately by gender.
    Average hours worked by men follow a canonical hump-shape over the life-cycle, which is a
reflection of the hump-shape in the exogenous age-productivity profiles. There is considerable dis-
persion in the early career hours of men, followed by a steady rise from the early 30’s to retirement.
Women’s hours worked exhibit, as expected, changes due to the presence of children in the household.
Average female hours fall as preferences for non-market time increase during child raising years. The
dispersion of hours also increases during this period as female labor supply elasticities are larger with
children.

       The rise in average earnings over the life cycle is more pronounced for more educated households
and the changes in the variance of log earnings between ages 25 and 60 are quantitatively consistent
                                                                                 35
with empirical evidence –for an example, see Guvenen (2009, Figure 4).
       A comparison between consumption and earnings paths (both their mean and dispersion) reveals
that consumption smoothing through borrowing and saving is quite effective after the schooling phase.
During working life the variance of log consumption grows 0.1 log points for college grads and a bit
less for households with less educated heads. These changes compare to a rise twice as large in the
variance of households’ log earnings. During retirement, the combination of annuity markets and
interest rate above the discount rate implies a linear upward sloping consumption pattern and constant
dispersion in logs.
       Wealth accumulation features the typical hump-shaped pattern. In the model, the drop in house-
hold wealth at age 48 arises as a consequence of the inter vivos transfer to children. The drop is much
larger for the highly educated families, whose children are the most likely to attend college. Young
college students and college graduates decumulate their wealth and borrow to enroll in college and to
smooth consumption in their first years of working life.


4.2       Determination of Inter Vivos Transfers

Several forces shape parental decisions on how much to transfer to their children. The first purpose is
narrowing the gap between parent’s and child’s lifetime utilities, and the extent to which parents want
to close this gap depends on the degree of altruism (ωĝ ). This motive (intergenerational smoothing)
is strongest for low ability and low earning-potential children, especially those with rich parents.
Paternalism, as explained, pushes in this same direction. The second purpose is that of alleviating
the financial constraints of children in the event they choose to go to college. This second motive
(college education financing) is strongest for high ability children whose return to attending college
is the highest.
  35
       Households are categorized by the highest education within a household.

ically with parental wealth at the age of the transfer (age 48). For some poor families (about 15% in
our model) the marginal cost of transferring to the children is too high in terms of their own foregone
consumption, and they make no transfer.36 Finally, this plot also shows that, for given wealth, highly
educated parents save more for the IVT, as they expect their children to be on average of a high ability
type as well, therefore with large gains from college education. The right panel of Figure 4.2 shows
that transfers tend to be increasing in the ability of the child (holding the parents’ abilities constant)
because greater financial resources are needed to pay for education.


4.3       Intergenerational Persistence of Education and Income

The model generates a realistic intergenerational correlation of college attainment. In the model
50.0% of those whose mother is a college graduate, and 47.4% of those whose father is a college
graduate, become college graduates themselves. Furthermore, 52.1% of those for whom both parents
are college graduates become college graduates themselves. Although these statistics are not targeted
in the estimation, we do well in replicating patterns observed in data. For example, in the NLSY79
  36
     Indeed, in many cases parents would be better off with a negative transfer (i.e., receiving a transfer from their child)
as they expect their child to earn more, eventually.

47.2% of children whose mother is a college graduate also attain a college degree, while 55.3% of
those for whom both parents are college graduates attain a college degree.
   The model is able to replicate these high degrees of persistence in part because it includes cog-
nitive and non-cognitive skills and paternalism. The skills are important both directly and indirectly.
Directly because parental cognitive skills in part determine the children’s cognitive skills, which in
turn drive college attendance and wages. Indirectly because parental education leads to the improve-
ment of child skills, which in turn reduces the psychic costs of college for children of educated parents.
Paternalism increases the tendency for rich parents to ‘send’ their child to college, further increasing
persistence.
   We also evaluate model performance in terms of intergenerational income persistence. Chetty
et al. (2014) use IRS tax data to study the relationship between the mean child income rank and
parents’ income rank for cohorts of children born between 1971-1986, and estimate a linear regression
slope between 0.25 and 0.35 for male children, depending on the birth year. We repeat this exercise on
our simulated data, with the same definition of pre-tax household income averaged over ages 31-46
for both children and parents, and find a slope of 0.33, thus within the above range. Furthermore,
as can be seen in Figure 4.3, we find that a child’s expected income rank is well approximated by a
linear function of their parent’s rank in our model, just as Chetty et al. (2014) find in IRS data. Note

however, that below the 20th percentile of income we observe a steeper slope of about 1.0.
   The more traditional intergenerational log-log earnings correlation in our simulated sample is
0.34. Jantti et al. (2006) estimate this elasticity for the US at 0.36, and similar values are found by
Solon (1999).


4.4                                           Parental Wealth and Educational Achievement

In this section we examine the relative roles of family background and cognitive ability in the deter-
mination of education outcomes.
   First, we analyze the correlation between cognition, wealth and income across households to make
sure that in our model parental skills and parental resources are distributed as in the data. Zagorsky

                                                                                                                                                                 36
(2007) uses the 2004 module of the NLSY79 to estimate a correlation between income (net worth)
and AFQT test scores of 0.30 (0.16, respectively) in a sample of individuals aged 40 and 47. In our
benchmark simulation, the correlation between income (wealth) and cognitive ability θcog for the same
age range is similarly 0.30 (0.24, respectively).
    Next, we plot a bar graph that displays college graduation rates by child’s ability tercile and by
parental net worth quartile in the model. The top panel of Figure 4.4 shows a positive gradient in both
dimensions, a feature that is very similar to the findings of Belley and Lochner (2007).
    A striking feature of this plot is the large role played by parental wealth at every ability level. Even
amongst higher ability children, parental wealth plays an important role with 40% college attendance
for those whose parents are in the lowest quartile of wealth, increasing to 70% attendance for top
wealth quartile. Among the lowest ability children almost none attend college unless their parents are
from the highest wealth quartile. Paternalism plays a key role in generating this pattern in the model:
wealthy parents induce children with lower ability to attend college.37
    The importance of paternalism becomes especially evident in the lower panels of Figure 4.4,
where we plot the financial returns (the left panel) and the total returns –financial returns net of the
monetized value of the psychic cost— for those graduating, by parental wealth and child ability.
    The financial returns are computed by calculating the proportion of consumption that would have
to be given to individuals who graduate from college in the model if they, instead, had not enrolled in
college in order to make them indifferent between the two choices. Specifically, the financial return
is the number ϕ that solves the following equation:

     X Z                                                              X Z

                                              ; x∗1       dµg,∗                       Ez [Vg1HS (1 + ϕ)cHS , lHS ; x∗1 , z ]dµg,∗
                                                                                                                         
                           c        ,l                      1     =                                                           1 .   (4.1)

The left-hand side is simply the expected value of a college degree for all those who optimally choose
   37
      Indeed among the lowest ability group all college graduates receive conditional transfers that compensate them for
this loss. In the middle ability group 50% of those from the two lower wealth groups receive such transfers and 60% of
the two higher groups. Finally among the highest ability group 20%-30% receive conditional transfers with the wealthier
group transferring more, conditional on attendance, as we would expect.


                                                                         37
to attend. The right-hand side is the counterfactual expected value if the same set of individuals
(distributed accordingly to µg,∗
                             1 , the distribution of college students at j = 1) had started working as

HS graduates instead of going to college. Note that on the right-hand side we also need to integrate
over initial productivity. The sequences ce and le are the state contingent life-cycle consumption and
leisure plans of such individuals as college and high-school educated workers. Conditional inter-vivos
transfers are given to individuals also in the counterfactual, thus they do not affect the calculation
of returns. Financial returns to college thus capture (i) the additional consumption associated to
the college wage premium; (ii) the consumption-equivalent value of being more likely to meet a
college- educated partner on the marriage market, and (iii) the additional consumption-equivalent
value (through altruism and paternalism) of being a college-educated parent, and thus having children
with better skills and better economic outcomes. To compute total returns (as opposed to simple
financial ones) we subtract κCL
                             g (θ, κ ), the additional psychic costs incurred due to college attendance,

from the college value function inside the integral on the left hand side. Thus total returns also
incorporate the consumption-equivalent value of the psychic cost.
       The financial returns are always positive and increasing by ability, ranging between 5% in the
lowest ability group to 10% in the highest ability one.38 What is striking, however, is that the total
returns are negative for those in the lowest ability group once psychic costs are taken into account.
Those from this group who attend college only do so because of the conditional parental transfers due
to paternalism.


4.5       Tuition Elasticity of College Attainment

The simulated response of aggregate college attainment to a small change in tuition fees is also similar
to responses measured in actual data. To measure this response in our model we perform a partial
equilibrium simulation in which we reduce tuition fees by $1,000 per year just before a single cohort
  38
       The effect of parental wealth on these returns reflects different selection into college.




                                                           38
of children make their education decisions.39 The aggregate graduation rate of this cohort increases
by 3.95 percentage points.
       This response is consistent with existing empirical evidence. Kane (2003) and Deming and Dy-
narski (1995) provide a synopsis of the empirical estimates from similar quasi-natural experiments in
which a discrete change in aid policy affects one group of individuals but not others, and conclude
that enrollment into college by high-school graduates benefitting from an additional tuition grant of
$1,000 rises between 3 and 5 percentage points.40 Other studies use cross-state variation in tuition
costs to estimate that enrollment would rise by 4 to 6 percentage points per $1,000 reduction in tuition
costs (Cameron and Heckman, 1998; Kane, 1994).


4.6       Marriage Market

The marriage market plays an important role in our model. The education of the partner has an
impact on the human capital of children both directly (through the mother) and indirectly through
wealth. Thus, the amount of marital sorting affects the intergenerational transmission of ability and
of wealth. To illustrate the practical importance of these features we conduct two extreme counter-
factual simulations in which (a) we impose random matching and (b) we impose perfectly assortative
matching.41
       The results in Table 4.1 confirm that the structure of the marriage market plays a significant role
for economic outcomes. Moving from current levels of assortativeness to random matching would
imply declines in welfare, output and educational attainment, particularly for women. Moving to
perfect sorting has opposite but smaller effects, because the baseline economy is quite assortative in
the first place.
  39
      This is the P.E. version of out $1,000 grant expansion counterfactual, reported in section 5.3.
  40
      Among the policy changes surveyed in these studies, the closest to our simulated experiment are the Georgia Hope
Scholarship program, the Social Security Student Benefit program, the Washington DC Tuition Assistance Grant program,
the Cal Grant program, and other similar examples of discontinuities in fellowship eligibility at individual institutions.
   41
      We can do this by manipulating the matrix governing assortativeness as explained in Section 2.3.2.

5         Policy Experiments

In this section we conduct two sets of policy experiments. The first is aimed at assessing the role of
the existing federal financial aid system —loans and grants— while the second examines the effects
of marginal expansions in financial aid.42
         Our main focus will be on the long run responses, which allow parental transfers and factor prices
to change as well as budget balancing fiscal adjustments to take place. All these components are
important because they can mitigate the effects of policy. At the same time, the long run equilibrium
also allows for changes in the distribution of ability, through the impact of education on cognitive and
non-cognitive skills, which may in turn reinforce policies that encourage education.
         We present our results in two steps. The first step, which we call ‘partial equilibrium (PE) short-
run’, computes changes in outcomes of interest for the first affected cohort, holding prices and fiscal
variables constant. The policy announcement is made just before parents choose their inter vivos
transfer, hence this experiment incorporates only the short-run behavioral response of parents (e.g.
transfers) and children (e.g. labor supply in college) to the policy. We then consider an experiment
we call ‘general equilibrium (GE) long-run, in which we compute the long run steady-state with new
market clearing prices and the new stationary distribution of individuals across education, wealth, and
ability. Government expenditures G are held constant in this experiment, thus in this latter experiment
    42
    In all policy experiments we assume that college fees do not change and financial markets do not offer new or modified
loan products.



                                                      40
adjustments of marginal labor income tax rates are required to balance the government’s budget. Note
that in such an economy with liquidity constraints and uninsurable idiosyncratic risk it is not obvious
whether expanding (cutting) federal aid programs will require a higher (lower) tax rate on labor. For
example, broadening these programs can be self-financing through a wider tax base, particularly with
imperfectly substitutable human capital aggregates (see Findeisen and Sachs, 2015, for a discussion
of these issues).
   A key aspect of the results from our GE experiments is the analysis of welfare changes induced by
the policy reform. We express these changes as a percentage of lifetime consumption for a newborn
economic agent (an individual at age j = 0) behind the veil of ignorance with respect to her initial
conditions (wealth and ability). To understand what drives the total welfare effect, we decompose
it into three separate components: (i) a “level” effect on average consumption; (ii) an “uncertainty”
effect due to changes in the volatility of individual consumption paths; and (iii) an “inequality” effect
due to changes in the distribution of initial conditions. In Appendix I we provide a derivation of this
welfare decomposition that builds on Benabou (2002).


5.1    Value of Existing Federal Aid Programs

In this section we explore how equilibrium outcomes would change in the model if federal aid pro-
grams were entirely removed from our benchmark representing the US economy. Key results are
shown in Table 5.1. A variety of additional results are reported in Appendix J. Moreover, in Appendix
K we assess the robustness of the grant and loan removal experiments under fixed interest rates (an
open economy model), and for different values of the elasticity between human capital aggregates.


Removing Tuition Grants.       Removing tuition grants induces a noticeable reduction in college at-
tainment in the long-run. The loss of college students is partly mitigated by equilibrium price adjust-
ments. As shown in the top panel (A) of Table 5.1, attainment in the short-run PE scenario would be
roughly 7.5 percentage points lower. In GE this scarcity effect puts upward pressure on the college

premium which, in turn, induces a compensating rise in college graduation rates. The final long-run
GE drop in college attainment is almost 3 percentage points, still a sizable magnitude.
       This drop in attainment comes about with significant alterations in the composition of the college
student body. Skill quality is lower and family wealth becomes more important for college selection,
as some able children from poorer families no longer find it feasible and/or optimal to attend college:
college attainment in the lowest wealth tercile drops about three times as much as it does in the entire
population.
       Students are forced to gather additional resources through an increase in their labor supply while
in college: in the long-run student labor supply grows by 0.6%. However, most of the adjustment
occurs through parental transfers. In PE, families increase transfers to their college bound children by
about $2,500 on average; however, in the long-run parental transfers only increase by $685 relative to
the benchmark because parental incomes and wealth fall.43
       Wealth-poor (q = 1) families are the most affected by removal of grants, and they are only able
to compensate for a fraction of this loss: Table J.6 shows that in the long-run such families increase
transfers to college-bound children by about $3,250 total, whereas the students’ grants have been cut
by $2,800 per year (i.e. $11,200 total). In turn, students from wealthy backgrounds increase their
college participation relative to the baseline: these students are in a position to take advantage of high
returns to education. The most evident consequence of this decline in quality and quantity of college
students is in terms of productive efficiency of the economy: output falls by 2 percent permanently.
       One notable aspect of the results in panel (A) of Table 5.1 is the differential effect of the policy
change on men and women: in GE the drop in female college attainment is about 25% larger than
that for men. Gender-bias in altruism partly accounts for the differences between men and women,
as women rely on grants more than men due to the smaller transfers they receive from parents. We
also observe that, while college attainment falls more for women, the gender wage-gap among college
graduates marginally widens. This follows from the fact that our estimates of labor shares imply that
  43
    Note that we control for changes in the distribution of college student characteristics when calculating parental transfer
changes.

                                                        43
sm,CL > sf,CL in the production function (2.4). Thus, even though the fall in quality-adjusted female
college labor input is larger than for its male counterpart, the positive impact on its marginal product
is smaller.
       The total ex-ante welfare loss in consumption equivalent units is sizable, at 2.8 percent. The
welfare losses due to a lower average level of consumption and more unequal initial conditions are
−2.4% and −1.7% respectively (see appendix Table J.5). As explained, in this economy average
productivity suffers from lower schooling levels and worse sorting of children by ability. Inequality
in initial conditions deteriorates for two reasons. One is that grants provide a substantial source of
insurance “behind the veil of ignorance” against lower than average draws on parental characteristics.
The second is the change in relative prices: the rise in the college premium redistributes against
low-income low-ability individuals who do not enroll in college.
       However, there is an offsetting positive welfare effect (+1.3%) due to a reduction in average
volatility of consumption in the population. This counteracting force arises because, as seen in Table
3.2, the wage processes of non-college workers (now more numerous) display less uncertainty than
those of college educated workers.44 This is particularly evident for the initial variance of the produc-
tivity shock, which is the most difficult component to insure because it affects young workers with
low savings or in debt.


Removing Federal Loans.                When federal loans are removed, college attainment drops by 9.5 per-
centage points in PE (see bottom panel of Table 5.1). This strong response suggests that, in spite of
the large crowding-in of inter vivos transfers (which increase by $6,000 on average), in the short run
many families are unable or unwilling to make up for the elimination of the loans available to college
students, and so their children are no longer able to finance education.
       In GE, the overall drop in the college graduation rate is much smaller (3 percentage points) because
of the factor price adjustments, but also because of the substantial increase in family savings: faced

       Table 3.2 also shows that the persistence of the shocks is higher for college-graduates, making self-insurance harder.

with the harmful removal of a large source of college financing, families devote more resources to
saving for college despite being, on average, poorer in the new equilibrium (aggregate income falls
by 2%). Given the large size of the federal loans program those families who cannot count on private
credit (types q = 1, 2) are compelled to save much more to send their children to college. Table J.3
shows that inter vivos transfers in households whose children enroll in college increase by $5,200 for
q = 1 families and by $10,500 for q = 2 families, compared to a reduction of $23,000 in borrowing
capacity. This behavior represents a crowding in of roughly 24 percent for the wealth-poor and 46
percent for middle-class households relative to the size of the loans program.
   There is, again, a significant worsening of selection on ability and on family wealth, which is even
more substantial than that occurring after removing grants, suggesting that many highly skilled people
rely on existing federal loans to finance college. The change in college attainment of children in the
bottom tercile of the wealth distribution is large, from 20 percent to less than 8 percent. The welfare
losses are slightly larger and, as for the grant removal, are associated to the level and inequality effects.
(Table J.2).


Removing both Federal Grants and Loans.               Removing the entire existing structure of financial
aid results in qualitative patterns that are similar to what we find after removing either grants or loans.
However, cumulative effects are larger. Table J.7 in the Appendix shows that college attainment in the
long run drops by 5 percentage points and it becomes much less sensitive to ability and much more
sensitive to parental wealth. College attendance in the top terciles of cognitive and non-cognitive abil-
ity drops significantly more than when removing grants or loans alone. Moreover, college attainment
among children from the bottom tercile of parental wealth drops precipitously: it falls from 20% in
the benchmark to less than 1%. The poorest parents cannot afford to replace lost financial aid, and
children who persist in education even without financial aid are those who received relatively large
transfers in the benchmark. To understand how student labor supply and parental transfers react in
this experiment it is important to remember that this new equilibrium selects heavily against college


                                                 45
attendance for those from poor families. Thus for example, average student labor supply actually falls
because wealthy students do not need to work in college to finance their studies.
       Aggregate output falls by 4.1% and ex-ante welfare drops by 5.8%. Notably, the average labor
income tax increases by 1.9 percentage points: the same amount of expenditures G must be financed
through a smaller tax base. Appendix tables J.7 through J.9 document these findings in more detail.


The role of the intergenerational transmission of skills.                    Reinforcing patterns to these policies
emerge through the intergenerational transmission of skills. The child skills depend on the maternal
levels of skills and her education. Thus when grants and loans are removed, the cognitive and non-
cognitive factors for future generations decline (see Table J.8). Both affect educational attainment,
and the cognitive factor also has a direct impact on wages.
       To quantify what this decline means, we compute the resulting effect on average wages, using as
weights the proportions attending each education level at baseline.45 We find that when both types of
financial aid policies are suppressed the overall skill loss amounts to a 0.46% decline in wages.
       This decline is then compounded by the resulting fall in education levels leading to a reduction
in the returns to skills.46 Thus the decline in skill is an important channel for the overall reduction in
output (and welfare) resulting from eliminating these student aid policies.
       Part of the return to investing in college for children is that the grandchildren will tend to have
higher abilities (which is internalized by the current generation to an extent driven by the amount
of altruism). This is one of the reasons selection into education by parental wealth increases in the
long-run after financial aid programs are removed.


Small Open Economy.             Our sensitivity analysis in Appendix K shows that, when these same exper-
iments are run under the assumption of a fixed interest rate (i.e., a small open economy), the results
  45
      More precisely, we calculate a counterfactual average wage in a way that holds the proportion of each ability type
attending each education level constant at baseline, but varies the proportion of each ability type according to the counter-
factual ability distribution.
   46
      Remember the returns to skill are lower for wages corresponding to lower education levels.



                                                        46
are qualitatively similar. However, both welfare and GDP losses are smaller. The reason is that in
the closed economy the fall in household saving (and thus of the capital-labor ratio) is reflected in a
reduction in average wages. In the small open economy version, this effect is moderated by the fact
that capital flows from the rest of the world and keeps domestic wages from falling too much.


5.2       Expansion of Loans Program: An Upper Bound

Expansions of the federal loan program are potentially valuable if many individuals in the economy
are initially constrained in their choice of education. To assess the severity of institutional borrowing
limits, we study how allocations and choices would change in an ‘unconstrained’ economy. Namely,
we compute the long-run equilibrium of an economy where there is no ad-hoc credit constraint with
the exception of the ‘natural borrowing limit’ implying that all liabilities must be extinguished upon
retirement (Hai and Heckman, 2017, see for example). All borrowing is done through private markets
at the prevailing equilibrium rate r− . The aim of this exercise is to compute an upper bound for the
gains that a Federal unsubsidized student loan program can achieve, if expanded over and above its
current configuration.47
       Table 5.2 shows that, in the long-run equilibrium of the unconstrained economy, college attain-
ment is about two percentage points higher. Sorting on ability improves somewhat, especially for
children from poor households who suffer from scarce family resources and low transfers in the
benchmark. Conditional on going to college, the financing mix of education changes: private debt
replaces parental transfers and earnings from part-time work of college students.
       In this ‘unconstrained economy’ aggregate output grows by 1.7%, a rise attributable to higher
levels of education and more efficient sorting into education by ability. Aggregate welfare rises sub-
stantially, by 4.2%. The gain due to level effects is 1.7%, welfare improvements due to equalization of
initial endowments are worth 1.5% of consumption annually, while an improvement in consumption
smoothing induces a welfare gain of nearly 1%.
  47
       To focus on the role of credit, we maintain tuition subsidies at their benchmark values.

  Table 5.2: Counterfactual economy with loose private credit limits and without any federal student loan programs.


   These results suggest that there is only a small fraction of children (approximately 2%) whose
education decisions are affected by credit constraints. However, these children tend to be high ability,
and for that reason the long-run impact of credit frictions in the economy is non-trivial. Since our
calculation is an upper bound, we conclude that the gains from an expansion of the federal loan
program would be rather limited. Detailed results for this experiment are reported in Appendix Tables
J.10-J.12.


5.3    Expansion of the Grants Program

Next, we turn our attention to how expansion of the existing federal grants program would affect
equilibrium outcomes. We consider three possible ways to expand the current system of tuition sub-
sidies. The first approach is to simply increase by $1,000 per year the amount by which every college
graduate’s education is subsidized. Any additional net costs from this expansion must be paid for and
we choose to adjust labor income tax rates to this end.
   Our second approach strengthens the progressivity of the existing federal grants program by in-
creasing grants proportionally. The result of this means-tested expansion is that poorer (q = 1)


                                                    48
students benefit the most and richer (q = 3) students the least in terms of the absolute amounts of the
subsidy. The proportional increase we implement is 53%, chosen so that the immediate (PE) cost to
the government equals that of the general $1,000 per year expansion.
       Finally, we implement an ability tested grant expansion, where increased funding is proportional to
cognitive skills. Here grants are increased above their benchmark values according to a linear function
of cognitive skills, of the form 1.72 × θcog . This expansion provides a median ability child with an
extra $860 per year in grants, and one in the top tercile with an additional $1,100 per year. Once
again, the short-run fiscal costs of this policy reform are the same as in the general grant expansion.
Table 5.3 summarizes the results of these three experiments.
       Qualitatively, all three experiments feature the same pattern: the college graduation rate increases
in the long run. Sorting on ability rises and sorting on wealth falls. Overall, the larger and better stock
of college graduates produces improvements in equilibrium output and welfare. Grants crowd-out
inter vivos transfers and student labor supply. For each additional dollar of grants, transfers fall, on
average, by 25-50 cents and student earnings (from their labor supply while in college) by 10 cents.
Both of these crowding-out effects mitigate the effect of the policy.
       All grant expansions result in welfare gains: +1.4% for means-tested, +1.7% for a general expan-
sion, and +1.9% for ability tested. These welfare gains are accompanied by different levels of growth
in average skills and output, with the biggest gain (+0.2% for skills and +1.2% for GDP) associated
with the ability-tested grant expansion. This program is better at targeting those with high ability who
would otherwise not attend college, hence generating the largest efficiency and welfare gains.
       One important source of these gains is that mothers’ skills and education interact positively in
the production of the next generation’s skills. Individuals do not fully internalize the impact of their
education decisions on the skills of future generations because of imperfect altruism. The reforms that
encourage more high ability individuals to opt for college, like ability-tested grants, partly correct for
this distortion between private returns and intergenerational social returns.48 Detailed results for these

5.4     Optimal Marginal Expansions of Student Aid

Solving for the optimal public policy is very complex. Here we explore a simpler approach: we
consider how best to spend a windfall of 1% of residual government expenditure (G) among four
specific alternatives: (i) an ability-tested grant expansion, (ii) an expansion of the existing means-
tested grants program, (iii) extending student loans subsidization, and (iv) cutting the labor income
tax rate.
    In the long run equilibrium this windfall allows ability-tested grants to increase by the proportional
transfer rule 3.6 × θcog . This amounts to an extra $2,300 per year among the top 1/3 of the ability
distribution. Alternatively, for the means tested case we can increase grants by 210% above their
benchmark amounts. For the case of increased loan subsidization we assume the government forego
interests on all loans during college years. Additionally, the small amount of government funds that
remain after this change are used to forgive 3% of the principal students owe at graduation. We
compare these student aid policies to a tax cut, where taxes are reduced by 0.7% of aggregate labor
income, and therefore the marginal tax rate is cut from 0.27 to 0.263.
    As seen in Table 5.4, these simulations suggest that ability tested grants improve welfare the most



                                                      51
by better targeting those who are best suited to attend college, in terms of ability. Second best are
means tested grants, that also allow some of those with low wealth parents and high ability to attend.
However, this type of grant is not as effective at targeting the right group and distorts prices in such
a way that some lower ability individuals increase attendance too. The next best alternative are tax
cuts: they reduce labor market distortions and realign the returns to education closer to the marginal
product. However, they are not nearly as effective as expanding grants. Finally, the expansion of
subsidized loans is the least effective approach to improving welfare in this economy, in line with the
results from our unconstrained economy.


5.5    Discussion

The design of education finance programs is an issue at the top of the policy and research agenda. How
valuable is the existing system of tuition grants and student loans? How large are the potential gains
from expanding these programs further? And, to what extent these policy interventions crowd out
the private provision of resources devoted to financing education costs? In this section, we addressed
these key questions.
   A clear-cut conclusion of our policy experiments is that the existing student aid program, includ-
ing grants and subsidized loans, is welfare improving. This welfare gain accrues because our model,
carefully crafted to mimic the US economy, features several departures from social efficiency. First,
the private cost of education exceeds the social one because of liquidity constraints which, in partic-
ular, prevent some high-ability students from enrolling in college. Federal aid realigns private and
social cost. Our quantitative analysis, however, shows that this market failure is not especially sig-
nificant. Second, the private return to education is below its social counterpart for three reasons: (i)
uninsurable income uncertainty makes education a risky investment; (ii) distortionary progressive tax-
ation reduces the gain from investing; (iii) imperfect parental altruism means that individuals do not
fully internalize that as educated parents they raise children with better skills. Tuition grants increase
the private financial return to college, thus shrinking the gap with social returns. Finally, market in-

                                               52
completeness is a source of pecuniary externalities. By increasing the quantity and quality of college
graduates, these policies reduce the college premium and redistribute towards the more needy house-
holds. Key, for this channel, is the imperfect substitutability of men and women and of workers of
three different education levels in production — a feature emphasized before us by Heckman et al.
(1998b,c), Lee (2005), Lee and Wolpin (2006) and Johnson and Keane (2013), for example.
   Another important result of our policy counterfactuals is that there is room for an expansion of
federal aid, but this room varies substantially across types of intervention. We find that a windfall
government expenditure is best spent expanding grants for college students rather than on increasing
loan limits. The reason is that, as explained above, liquidity constraints are not widely binding for the
marginal population, whereas grants are effective at increasing the return to college. Amongst grants,
those targeted to high ability children are superior to simply means-tested ones because they are better
at inducing into college those children for whom the gains are largest.
   In line with this discussion, our welfare decomposition identifies two main sources of welfare
changes from policy reforms that increase college attainment and improve sorting by making atten-
dance depend more on skills and less on parental wealth: (i) improvements in aggregate output due to
a higher stock of human capital; (ii) reduced inequality in initial conditions due to a redistribution of
income occurring through a shrinking relative price of college-educated labor.
   Finally, we have highlighted two key margins of adjustment that are not typically considered in
the traditional policy evaluation literature. The first channel is the adjustment of funding by parents
through inter vivos transfers, which is a sizable source of support during college in the data. The sec-
ond channel is students’ labor supply. Our experiments show that both margins are quite elastic with
respect to policy interventions and, as such, mitigate their effects. We find that an additional dollar
in grants provided by the government crowds out, on average, 35 cents of private parental transfers
in the long-run equilibrium. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity in crowding-out effects.
More generous grants displace transfers in different proportions depending on family resources, with
the transfers made by wealthy families being generally crowded out the most. Also student labor


                                               53
supply is sensitive to policy. Across experiments, an extra dollar in grants crowds out 10 cents in
labor earnings by students in college. Accounting for the existing patchwork of policies, adjustments
in these alternative means of privately funding education replace/displace around 45 cents of every
dollar subtracted/added to federal grants. This result suggests that policy evaluations that omit these
joint adjustment margins might be misleading.
   Our model is rich and realistic in many dimensions. At the same time, its computational complex-
ity forced us to abstract from a number of additional aspects that might influence policy evaluation.
   We modeled the endogeneity of the distribution of abilities by assuming that a child’s ability
depends on parental education and skills in a mechanical way. A parallel line of research (e.g., Caucutt
and Lochner, 2012; Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Cunha et al., 2010; Heckman and Mosso, 2014)
stresses the importance of complementarities between college-age policies and interventions during
critical phases of child development. Explicitly modeling sequential human capital investments at
different stages of a child’s life would flesh out the extent to which early interventions may improve
the effectiveness of tertiary education policies and how this affects intergenerational transmission.
   Another interesting generalization would account for heterogeneity in college types (e.g. Fu, 2014)
allowing for the endogenous determination of returns based on demand and supply of different college
types, thereby recognizing that more able and richer students are, in equilibrium, matched with better
colleges. This complementarity may strengthen the role of financial aid policies that improve sorting.
Similarly, the role that choice of college major has is an important but relatively under researched area
(see for example, Altonji et al., 2012).
   Recent work (see Ionescu and Simpson, 2016; Lochner and Monje-Naranjo, 2011) has emphasized
the expansion of private provision of student credit. Nesting endogenous borrowing constraints within
an equilibrium framework, similar to the one developed in this paper, would allow for explicit co-
determination of all credit and skill prices. Such a model, while significantly more complex, could
answer interesting questions about how the price of borrowing in private markets would endogenously
respond to education policy reforms.


                                               54
    In all our counterfactual policy experiments we kept the configuration of all other fiscal policies
unchanged, although we did compare the relative merits of expanding student aid to reducing taxes
on labor. As emphasized by Krueger and Ludwig (2016), there is a certain degree of substitutability
between progressive taxation and education subsidies: both policies induce some redistribution, the
former through fiscal instruments, the latter through relative prices of different types of labor. An
implication of this observation to bear in mind when interpreting our findings is therefore that they
are conditional on the prevailing degree of progressivity of the tax/transfer system, but major tax
reforms could significantly affect the landscape of effective education policies. However, locally, we
show that student aid is more effective at improving overall welfare than tax cuts.
    Finally, an important issue we do not consider here are transitional effects. Many of these policies
may have upfront costs for longer term benefits to future generations, as we move from one steady
state to another. As Krueger and Ludwig (2016) show, the costs during the transition costs may change
our view about the merits of policy and certainly raises the issue of how a policy should be introduced
and financed. For example, long term government debt, with the costs falling on future generations,
may be a better way of financing the transition, instead of taxes falling on the current ones. However,
our model has little to say about these issues and this would have to be left to future research.



6    Conclusions

The capacity of people to optimally invest in education is crucial for economic prosperity and social
mobility, and is an important determinant of the income distribution (see Becker and Tomes, 1979;
Loury, 1981). In the presence of insurance and credit market imperfections that prevent those individ-
uals with the highest returns to education from investing in schooling, education policies can improve
allocations and welfare.
    In this paper, we have assessed the role played by the existing system of government financial aid
to college. For this purpose, we have specified and estimated a general-equilibrium life-cycle model of


                                               55
the US economy that features: (i) intergenerational linkages through altruism and paternalism which
determine the extent to which parent are willing to finance their children education; (ii) intergenera-
tional transmission of abilities that is affected by parental education and is, consequently, endogenous;
(iii) non-pecuniary psychic costs of education that depend on cognitive and non-cognitive abilities;
(iv) liquidity constraints that limit access to credit; (v) idiosyncratic uninsurable earnings risk that
makes education an investment with an uncertain outcome; (vi) various means of financing the pe-
cuniary cost of education —over and above what is offered by the government— such as parental
transfers, private borrowing, and labor supply in college; (vii) imperfect substitution between gender
and education groups in production, which leads to redistributive implications of education policies
through relative prices.
   We use microeconomic data from various sources to estimate the structural parameters of the
model. The model fits the data well, including responses to actual policies that we do not target in
the estimation. It also provides valuable insights on the intergenerational transmission of income and
education.
   Through the lenses of our model, our bottom line is that the current configuration of federal loans
and grant programs has substantial value in terms of both output and welfare. Our results indicate that
further expansions of grant programs would be welfare improving. Amongst the alternative policies
we consider, the best way of expanding student aid is via ability tested grants. Part of the efficacy of
this form of grants is that parental ability and education interact positively in the production of skills
of the next generation.

A     Cost of College Attendance, Grants, and Loans
To calculate the price of college attendance and the extent of government aid to higher education
financing through grants we focus on the sample of full-time full year (FTFY) students enrolled in
public and private not-for-profit 4-year post-secondary institutions. This group of students is the
closest counterpart to students in the model. All our statistics refer to the year 2000 and nominal
amounts are in 2000 dollars. According to the “Student Financing of Undergraduate Education: 1999-
2000” (SFUE, thereafter), a report published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES),
65% of these students were enrolled in public colleges and 35% were enrolled in private not-for-profit
colleges (Table 1.10).

Cost of college: The cost of college attendance has three components: (i) tuition and fees, (ii) non-
tuition expenses that would only be incurred by a college-student, and (iii) institutional and private
grants which reduce the cost to families. The publication “Trends in College Pricing, 2000” published
by the College Board, reports that average tuition and fees in public institutions in 2000-2001 were
$3,510 in public institutions and $16,332 in private ones. We add non-tuition expenses, which includes
books and other supplies, amounting to $704 and $730, respectively, in the two types of colleges. We
also add an additional $500 to account for any commuting or room and board expenses that would not
be incurred by a worker. Average tuition and non-tuition expenses (before grants) amount to $9,210.
According to the SFUE, average tuition and fees did not differ by income level of the family in public
institutions. In private institutions (where only 1/4 of students are enrolled), average fees were only
roughly 20% lower for families whose income was between $20,000-40,000 compared to fees faced
by families whose income exceeded $100,000 (Table 2.2-B).
    Institutional and private grants are effectively a way to reduce the cost of attendance. Roughly
half of these grants are based on pure merit and half are based on need. This fact, together with
the negative empirical correlation between family need and students’ merit, explains why both the
fraction of students receiving grants and their amount is not strongly correlated with family income,
as reported in Table A1 which is based on the SFUE, Table 1.2-G.
    To arrive at our estimate of average net tuition ($6,710) we subtract average private and institu-
tional grants from average tuition expenses.
Federal and state grants: Based on the “Guide to U.S. Department of Education Programs” (GDEP
thereafter) published by the US Department of Education, we identify three main federal grant pro-

grams. The Federal Pell Grant Program is the largest single source of grants to undergraduates. It
provides need-based grants to individuals to access post-secondary education. It is especially targeted
to the lowest-income students. In 2000 it provided $7.3 billion to 3.8 million students, with a max-
imum grant of $3,125. The Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant has a more modest
endowment (approximately 15 times smaller). These are grants which supplement the amount re-
ceived through Pell up to a maximum of $2,100. Smart Grants are awarded to needy student who are
enrolled in certain technical fields and maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 in the first year – and
so they’re partly merit based. The program is approximately as big as the Supplemental Opportunity
grant program. State funding is very diverse, but most of the funds available are concentrated in 10
“high-aid” states. Only a very small fraction of state grant awards are merit-based (less that 18%).
The fraction of students receiving federal and state grants and their average amount by family income
levels (from Table 1.2-G of the SFUE) is summarized in Table A2.
   We use the average amount for these three income levels, and the joint distribution of income and
wealth in the model, to calibrate the dependence of the transfers function g (q, θ) on assets (through
the state variable q). In the baseline experiment, we do not allow g to depend on θ. However in one
of our policy experiments we consider the introduction of merit-based grants.
Federal loans: While grants are administered by both federal government and states, loans are almost
entirely administered by the federal government (less than 1% of the total loan volume is state-based).
The largest federal loan program in the US is the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The total
volume of loans available in 2000 through this program was around $40 billion, extended to around
10 million students. The program includes two main types of loans to students, Subsidized and
Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. A third form of loan offered by the Federal Family Education Loan
Program are Parent PLUS loans. These are loans made to the parents on behalf of a child to help
pay for tuition by covering up to the cost of attendance less other aid. Eligibility for the PLUS
Loan depends on a credit check and interest rates are similar to those in the private sector. Since

do not model them explicitly (Johnson, 2010, makes the same modelling choice). The other major
source of financial aid for undergraduates, beyond the Federal Family Education Loan Program,
is the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program. This is, in essence, an alternative source of
funding for Stafford loans whose total size is roughly half of that available through the Federal Family
Education Loan Program. Finally, the Federal Perkins Loan Program provides low-interest loans to
help needy students to finance undergraduate education whose conditions are similar to those of the
subsidized Stafford loans. Its total funding is small though, roughly 3% of Stafford loans. Because of
their nature, we aggregate these loans with subsidized Stafford loans in our calculations. In light of
this discussion, in calibrating the features of the Federal loan program, we focus on (subsidized and
unsubsidized) Stafford loans only.
   Subsidized Stafford Loans are loans to students who meet a financial needs test (based on family
income and assets), with the interest paid by the government on behalf of borrowers while the student
is in school. Interest payments after school are subsidized. In 2000, the total cumulative borrowing
limit for subsidized loans over the four years of college was $17,125.
   Unsubsidized Stafford Loans are loans available to students who either do not meet a financial
needs test or do qualify, but need to supplement their subsidized loans. The interest on the unsub-
sidized Stafford loan cumulates when in school, it is added to the principal, and the student starts
repaying her debt after graduation. In 2000, the cumulative unsubsidized Stafford loans limit over the
four years of college was $23,000. For those students who do qualify for subsidized loans, $23,000
is the total limit of their Stafford loan (i.e. subsidized plus unsubsidized loans). Therefore we fix
the total cumulative (subsidized and unsubsidized) Stafford debt limit bs +bu to $23,000. Repayment
plans for Stafford loans typically impose fixed monthly amount for a loan term of up to 10 years. But
extended repayment periods can be obtained.
    According to the SFUE, among graduating seniors in the year 2000, 62.1% of students had (subsi-
dized or unsubsidized) federal loans (Table 1.3-A). Furthermore, 84.1% of federal loans were at least
partly subsidized, implying that 52.5% of students would have subsidized loans (Table 1.6-A).

   Private loans: The report “Private Loans and Choice in Financing Higher Education” published

                                               70
by the Institute for Higher Education Policy (2003) contains useful information on private borrowing
with the purpose of funding post-secondary education. Available estimates suggest that private loans
at that time composed only 12 percent of the total volume of Federal loans (page 9). For many student
borrowers, a poor credit rating often is the largest barrier to obtaining a private loan. Less than 1% of
private loan products were credit-blind, or available without a credit check (page 15). However, for
those who qualify, interest rates on private loans are often more advantageous of those on Stafford
Loans (Figure 2.2). In 2000, 8.3% of graduating seniors received private (non-federal) loans (Student
Financing of Undergraduate Education: 1999-2000, NCES, Table 1.4A).
    Conversion of student loans into private bonds: In the model, we assume that student loans can
be converted to private bonds at graduation. However, because higher interest rates apply to student
loans, the principal is inflated up the point that the converted debt equals the net present value of
student loans liabilities. Because of the fixed payment nature of student loans we can simply apply
annuity formulas to derive the conversion factor. For example, for a federal loan:

                                              ru          1 − (1 + r− )−10
                            factor =                    ×                  ,
                                       1 − (1 + ru )−10          r−

where a 10-period (20 years) repayment schedule has been assumed. Thus, the equivalent private debt
will be the outstanding student loan principal multiplied by the ‘factor’. That is, ã3 = factor × b̃3 for
federal loans. The same formula with rp in place of ru applies for private student loans.



B     Marital Matching

B.1    From Values of Singles to Values of Households
The ex-post value of the match between a male m and a female f (a household, or family) is:


                                 W3 (ef , em , θ f , θ m , ãf3 + ãm    f    m
                                                                    3 , z3 , z3 )                    (B1)


a value that summarizes the present discounted utility that this household will generate. Note that,
because of the full commitment assumption, individual assets —recalculated after the refinancing of
education loans, hence the ‘tilde’— are combined within the households.
   Individuals entering the matching stage value their prospects as the expectation over potential out-
                                                           

                                

    B.2      Counterfactual Marriage Matching
    In what follows we draw from Fernández and Rogerson (2001). Let gm be the distribution of male
    education and gf be the distribution of female education. These are both triples with measures of
    lh, hs and cl individuals. For example, in the data we have gm = (.139, .567, .294) and gf =
    (.136, .584, .280). These gender-specific education p.d.f. are the marginals of the joint distribution
    of husband/wife education pairs. Denote the joint distribution by Q. Let Qdata be the observed joint
    distribution:                                                 
                                                         .107 .027 .002
                                                                       
                                               Qdata   = .030 .498 .056 .
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                                       
                                                          .002 .042 .236

        In our counterfactuals we can always get the marginals from the education decision rules, but the
    joint distribution is determined by the model only at the matching stage. However, in counterfactuals,
    we cannot use the estimated probabilities because they may not be consistent with the new equilibrium
    education distribution. Thus, we need a strategy to determine marriage matching in counterfactuals.
        Two examples of possible joint distributions are what we will label ‘assortative’ and ‘non-assortative’
    joint distributions. The non-assortative joint distribution, denoted QN , is such that the education at-
    tainments of spouses are independent. This is easy to construct as it is the out product of the marginals:


                                                        QN = gf0 · gm .

                                                          72
For example, for the observed marginals we have:

                                                                 

                                         Qdata   = .081 .331 .172 .
                                                                 
                                          N
                                                                 
                                                                 
                                                    .039 .159 .082


   The ‘assortative’ matrix is defined as a joint distribution in which (i) the measure of exact spousal
education matches is maximized, and then (ii) among the residual mass of agents the measure matched
one attainment level away is maximized, and finally (iii) any remaining residual mass of agents is
matched two attainment levels away. For example, for the data education distributions (shown above)
the assortative joint distribution is:

                                                                 
                                                   .136 0      0 
                                                                 
                                         Qdata   = .003 .567 .014 .
                                                                 
                                          A
                                                                 
                                                                 
                                                      0    0 .280


    Next, note that for a given parameter υ ∈ (0, 1) we can construct yet another candidate joint
distribution by mixing the assortative and non-assortative distributions. Let Qυ (υ) = υQA + (1 −
υ)QN be such a mixture. We can estimate the degree of assortativeness in matching by estimating υ
as υ̂ = arg min ||Qdata − Qdata
                           υ    (υ)||, where || · || is the Euclidean Norm and Qdata
                                                                                υ    (υ) = υQdata
                                                                                             A    + (1 −

   N . Doing this exercise yields υ̂ = 0.265, and the associated Qυ    (υ) is:

                                                                     

                                    Qdata    = .0237 .5045 .0558 .

                                     υ

                                                                
                                                .0103 .0421 .2276


Comparing Qdata and Qdata
                     υ    shows that the fit is very good.
    For our counterfactuals we now take υ as given, which we interpret as holding the assortativeness
of matching constant. For any pair of counterfactual marginal education distributions we can construct
QN and QA , and then recover Q using the estimate υ̂ = 0.265.

where xj = (ef , em , θ f , θ m , aj , zjf , zjm ) until the the age when the children are born (j = 8, corre-
sponding to 30-32) and their gender revealed, after which xj includes also this additional state until
the inter vivos stage. The main differences between this decision problem and that in equation (2.7)
are that (i) two sources of labor supply are available to the family, and (ii) the economies of scale in
consumption are present. With a slight abuse of notation we have used r for both the interest rate on
saving and the one on borrowing (r = r− + ι in the main text). Finally, recall that uj includes the
utility transfers between spouses that implement the equal sharing rule but, because these transfers
are separable in preferences, they do not affect optimal choices.


C.2     Inter Vivos Transfers
In section 2.4 we described the decision problem of a household in the period when parents choose
transfers to their children. Formally, in the period of the inter vivos transfer, parents solve the follow-

where xj ivt = (xj ; ĝ, θ̂, κ̂ ) is the state space at the inter vivos giving stage, and x0 = (θ̂, κ̂ , â, q̂) is
the state vector for the child at the start of life before the first decision between continuing high-school
or entering the labor force. w{q=1} is the full time equivalent parental earnings threshold below which
a child can qualify for subsidized federal loans. Note that the conditional transfer is divided by the
one period gross interest rate because it earns interests for a period before being paid out to children
attending college.

C.4    Stationary Recursive Competitive Equilibrium
Recall that x∗j ∈ Sjg,∗ denotes the state vector for an individual still in school at age j. Similarly
xj ∈ Sjg,e denotes the age-specific state vector of an individual (single or married) of gender g and
completed education e that has entered the labor force and is working. As clear from the household
problems described above, the state vector for a married individual includes also state variables of the
spouse and, in certain periods, state variables of the children. Let µg,∗     g,e

C.5    Computation of Stationary Equilibrium
This section describes the solution method for our long-run GE economy. The usual nested fixed point
approach is extended in order to accommodate the novel features of our model. That is, the essence
of our approach is to (i) guess a set of prices and taxes, (ii) compute decision rules (given prices
and taxes), (iii) compute the stationary measures implied by the decisions and exogenous stochastic
processes, and finally (iv) verify whether those are the stationary equilibrium prices and taxes. To
accommodate endogenous inter vivos transfers we must also begin with guesses of value functions
of age zero agents. To accommodate matching in the marriage market, we must also begin with an
initial guess of the distribution of education levels among men and women.
   Specifically, we execute the following steps:

  1. Make an initial guess for the wage vector, w, the real interest rate, r, and the age zero value
     functions in school V0∗ and in work V0LH . Also make and initial guess for the joint conditional
      distribution of married household characteristics given the characteristics of unmarried age j =
      3 individuals, and label this guess Pmatch . In the policy experiments, an initial guess for the
      labor tax rate is also required.

  2. Solve the household dynamic programming problems described in the main text at the prices
      w and r. This is a finite horizon problem easily solved by backward induction using Euler
      equation methods. At the age of inter vivos transfers, the initial guesses of V0∗ and V0LH are used.
                                                                                            0
      Continuing to solve recursively back to age j = 0, updated guesses V0∗ , V0LH are attained.
                                                                               
                                                                                        0
      Iterate on the life-cycle problem until V0∗ and V0LH converge to V0∗ , V0LH , respectively. In
                                                                           

      solving the problem of age j = 3 individuals the distribution Pmatch is used to calculate the

                                               79
       expected continuation value. The solution yields optimal decision rules for education, take-up
       of student loans, consumption, leisure, private saving/borrowing, and inter vivos transfers.

    3. Compute the probability measures µ of households over the state-space. Begin with a guess of
       the initial density of age j = 0 individuals {µg,∗
                                                      0 }. Given this guess, use the transition function
       generated by the decision rules of individuals and the exogenous processes to compute up to
       {µg,∗          g,∗
          3 }. Use {µ3 } in combination with the exogenous matching probabilites Q
                                                                                       g,e
                                                                                           to compute

       step 5. (We find using an average of Pmatch and Pmatch is useful in updating here.)

    5. Compute the remaining probability measures for j > 4, and then use them to compute aggregate
       quantities. If marginal products w0 and r0 differ from initial guesses w and r, update these
       guesses and go back to step 1. Also check if the government budget constraint is satisfied, and
       in the case of a policy experiment update the guess of the labor tax rate accordingly. If prices
       have converged and the government budget constraint is satisfied, and equilibrium has been
       computed.

Once the fixed point has been attained, simulated data from the economy can be used to compute the
various moments of interest.



D      Aggregate Technology Parameters
For the estimation of the aggregate technology parameters we use data from the Current Population
Survey (CPS) for 1968-2001 (see Heckman et al., 1998a). The sample includes the adult universe (i.e.,
the population of marriageable age, with all individuals aged 15 and over unless they have missing
or zero earnings, or missing educational attainment information)49 . We compute total wage bills in
  49
    Since earnings data are top-coded in the CPS, we extrapolate the average of the top-coded values by using a tail
approximation based on a Pareto distribution. ? provides evidence that this method closely approximates the average of

                                                     80
billions of dollars for the three education groups, as well as for their subsets by gender. Dividing the
relevant wage bill by the (normalized) marginal product of human capital estimated from PSID data
(see discussion in Appendix E below), we obtain point estimates of total efficiency-weighted labor
supply (human capital aggregates) by education, gender and year. Because of the well documented
relative demand shifts over the period considered, we let share parameters vary over time. For example
set = exp(se0 + g e t), where t denotes calendar year and g e captures the growth rate in each human
capital share of type e. Shares are normalized to sum to one at every t.
   We proceed sequentially. First, we estimate the parameters governing gender aggregation within
education groups. Then, we use these estimates to derive education-specific stocks and estimate the
parameters governing education aggregation.
    Gender-specific parameters. For each given education group, we use variation in the gender-
specific wage bills ($tf,e ) over time to estimate the elasticity between labor input from different gen-
ders. Taking first-order conditions, and the log of both sides, we arrive at:
                                               !                   !                     !

an equation that holds for all education groups e. Recall that χ ∈ (−∞, 1].
   Under the null hypothesis that the elasticity parameter χ does not vary across education groups,
we have three independent equations which can be jointly estimated and, then, used to test the iso-
elasticity assumption. We estimate a specification based on time differences of the equation (D1)
above. This specification identifies the elasticity from changes over time in the ratios of wage bills
and of human capital stocks of each education-gender group.
   We control for endogeneity of these human capital stocks by using various sets of instruments.
First, we use instruments based on different sets of lags of human capital aggregates. Next, we verify
robustness of the results using, either as a replacement or in addition, instruments corresponding to
the stock of men and women with a given education in a given year. The total number of people with
a given education level, whether working or not, is a slow moving stock and therefore independent
of the autocorrelated component in the right hand side variables. The estimation procedure is based
on a stacking method which allows one to test for differences in the elasticity of substitution across
different types of labor (like in a Chow test). The results are reported in Table D.1. Panel (A) reports
point estimates of the substitutability parameter, panel (B) reports different tests of the iso-elasticity
hypothesis, which cannot be rejected.

   The estimated ‘education-conditional’ elasticity of substitution between gender-specific aggre-
gates ranges between 1.2 and 1.9. In numerical simulations, the gender weights for different education
groups are set to the values estimated for the year 1999. Female shares are, respectively, sf,LH = 0.34,
sf,HS = 0.40 and sf,CL = 0.38.
    Education-specific parameters. After aggregating gender-specific stocks of human capital using
equation (2.4), a similar procedure can be applied to estimate the elasticity of substitution between
the three education-specific human capital aggregates. From aggregator (2.3) and the equilibrium
condition in the labor market, we derive expressions for the wage bills $te . For education groups HS
and CL, for example, we write,

                                       $tCL                   sCL                     HtCL

                             log                  = log                 + ρ log                       (D2)

   We estimate the elasticity of substitution among labor inputs using the empirical counterparts of
pair-wise ratios like the one in equation (D2). Also in this case we estimate a specification based on
first-differences of equation (D2). We control for possible endogeneity of human capital inputs in the
production function through an IV approach. We experiment with different sets of instruments. First,
we use lagged regressors (lags up to 5 periods back are included in the first step, depending on the
specification). Alternatively, and as a robustness check, we also instrument using the total number
of people in each education group in a given year, including those people not working. This latter
instrument, being a stock, is independent of the serial correlation properties of the technology shock.
   Table D.2 reports results for the estimation of the ρ elasticity parameters. Panel (A) reports results
obtained by using, as instruments, lags of human capital or education ‘headcounts’ or both. Panel (B)
reports tests of the null hypothesis of iso-elasticity for the different specifications (more specifications
and tests are available from the authors: results are fairly robust.) Overall, all specifications give
rather similar results and we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that the aggregate technology
is iso-elastic at the 5% level of significance. The restricted model with a unique ρ improves the
efficiency of the estimator, which is particularly valuable since we are using a relatively short time
series (approximately 30 observations).
   The estimated value for ρ ranges between 0.68 and 0.98. In the simulations we use ρ = 0.7.
This corresponds to an elasticity of substitution of 3.3, which is within the range of our estimates and
consistent with values discussed in the literature. The estimated values for the education weights used
in the simulations are sLH = 0.16, sHS = 0.38, sCL = 0.46, which are those for the year 1999.

E        Individual Productivity Dynamics
Wage-age profiles from the PSID: The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a longitudinal
survey of the US population. We use data for the waves from 1968 to 2011 (referring to calendar
years 1967 to 2010). Since 1997 the PSID has become biannual. We follow closely the sampling
criteria of ? but consider both heads and spouses in the SRC sample, which was originally nationally
representative, so we use no sample weights in the calculations. By selecting both heads and spouses
we are able to separately estimate all relevant parameters separately for men and women.50 After
excluding the SEO sample, and observations with no reported gender or marital status, our sample of
heads and spouses includes 5,044 individuals (2,350 men and 2,694 women). We keep only people
with 8 or more (possibly non continuous) individual-year observations, and we eliminate individuals
with outliers in earnings growth, defined as changes in log-earnings larger than 4 or less than -2,
which reduces the sample to 3,748 individuals (1,684 men and 2,064 women).
       The wage variable we use for our calculations is the hourly earnings (total labor income divided
by total hours worked) for the head of the household expressed in 1992 dollars by deflating nominal
wages through the CPI-U for all urban consumers.51 Information on the highest grade completed is
used to allocate individuals to three education groups: high school drop-outs, high school graduates,
and college graduates.
   Quadratic age polynomials are separately estimated for men and women, by education group.
We only use observations between ages 22 and 65. We don’t use self-employment observations and
include dummies for year and state. For women we also control for marital status and we use a
Heckman-selection estimator to correct for observation bias in employment: more specifically, we
construct Inverse Mills ratios by estimating a participation equation which exploits variation in un-
earned family income, net of transfers, to identify transitions into and out of market employment.52
In Table E.1 we present the point estimates for different education groups.
Price of labor inputs from PSID: Once we filter out age effects from hourly wages for all educa-
tion/gender groups, we construct first-differences in logs. This also filters out ability, since it enters
linearly in the log-wage equation. Performing this estimation in first differences is needed because the
average ability by education and gender group is not constant over time due to composition changes
  50
      In the PSID the head of the household is generally a male whenever there is a cohabiting male/female couple. How-
ever if the husband or boyfriend is incapacitated and unable to fulfill the functions of Head, then the FU will have a female
Head. We identify 642 such cases in which the married head of household is a female.
   51
      The earnings variable includes the labor part of both farm and business income, wages, bonuses, overtime, commis-
sions, professional practice and others.
   52
      The unearned income instruments appear to do a good job of identifying selection into employment, being highly
significant in all first stage regressions. The Inverse Mills ratios all have the expected sign (results available from the
authors).

within the group. Therefore, we can easily estimate through time dummies the time series of price
growth in each education/gender group, i.e., the term ∆ log wtg,e . Given a normalization one can
recover spot prices year by year.53
Wage-ability gradient from NLSY: Ability is approximated by the AFQT89. We use the NLSY79 to
estimate the effect of ability on wages. To overcome the problem that the NLSY provides observations
only for workers between age 14 and 45, we use wage data from the PSID 1968-2011 to estimate
age polynomials for different education groups. After the age profiles have been used to filter out
age effects from the log wage observations in the NLSY79 –and assuming, as in the model, that
any residual unobserved error term is uncorrelated with θcog – we can identify the loading factors by
running simple regressions. Separately for each gender and education group e ∈ {LH, HS, CL} we
estimate an OLS regression of log individual wages on time dummies and on log AFQT89 scores
(as a proxy for θcog ) in order to recover λg,e (see equation 3.1). We use specifications with time
dummies to control for time variation in market wages, but estimates are almost identical to those
obtained without time dummies. We also include dummies to control for marital status and number
of children.54 For hourly wages, we use the wage variable corresponding to the hourly rate of pay on
  53
     We use a normalization based on the relative hourly wages observed in our PSID sample in 1989. First we compute
average wages by education group for 1989, and next we correct for ability composition using information from the
NLSY79 (AFQT test scores distribution together with their education-specific gradient on wages). We choose 1989
because people from the NLSY79 are between age 23 and 31, which means most of them are already working. Additional
details on the normalization and the ability adjustment are available upon request.
  54
     To check robustness we run specifications based on wages which are not purged of the estimated PSID age-effects:
again, results based on these measures are similar to those obtained for the age-free wages reported below.

the current or most recent job (the so-called CPS job), available only from 1979 to 1994. We start
with the 11,878 individuals for which we have AFQT89 scores. We drop individuals for which we
cannot observe the highest grade completed, which brings the sample to 11,844 individuals. Next, we
drop observations for which the wage is missing, ending up with 11,222 individuals. We drop those
observations with annual work hours missing or larger than 5,840: this reduces the sample to 11,207
individuals. Dropping individuals who report (at least once) hourly wages above $400 or below $1
further reduces the sample to 10,625. We also eliminate individuals who report log wage increases
larger than 4 or smaller than -2, which leaves 10,433 workers in the sample. When we split this
sample in 6 gender/education groups, we get the following: for HS drop-outs sample sizes are 1,280
individual men and 932 women (respectively, 10,303 and 5,337 person/year observations); for HS
graduates our samples are 3,280 individual males and 3,425 individual females (respectively, 31,431
and 31,090 person/year observations); and for college graduates there are 731 individual men and
785 individual women (respectively, 6,629 and 7,441 person/year observations).55 Table 3.1 reports
estimates of the ability gradient by education group, and for the pooled sample. All standard errors
are corrected for individual clustering. The NLSY contains two additional measures of wages: (i) a
variable corresponding to the hourly rate of pay in the first reported job, available only from 1979 to
2002; (ii) a hourly wage rate obtained dividing total earnings by total hours worked in the previous
calendar year. The latter variable can be constructed for each wave between 1979 and 2002. The
earnings’ measure includes wages, salary, commissions or tips from all jobs, before deductions for
taxes. The ability gradient estimated from our preferred wage measure is close to the estimated
ability gradients estimated using these two alternative definitions of hourly wages. Differences are
statistically insignificant and confirm the robustness of the estimated reduced-form ability gradients.

Estimation of error component model for wage residuals: The final step is estimating the param-
eters of the persistent-transitory shocks model for wage residuals. Wage residuals are obtained from
NLSY data purging from individual log wages time dummies, the age component and the ability
component, calculated as explained above.
   For estimation, we use a Minimum Distance Estimator originally developed by ??. In a nutshell,
as moments we use the covariances of wage residuals at various lags for different age groups. Table
3.2 reports the estimates of these parameters obtained for the 15-year period between 1979 and 1993.56
  55
     We use all workers including NLSY79 over-samples in our estimation to maximize the number of observations: a
dummy is introduced to control for possible hourly wage differences of workers from the over-samples. Over-sample
dummies are mostly not significant. Even when significant they are very small.

panel data sets, as we do, selection bias attributable to persistent shocks becomes less severe. The
issue of selection bias ensuing from persistent shocks is related to the so-called “incidental parameters
problem” discussed in ?. The severity of the incidental parameters problem becomes smaller as the
number of panel observation for each given individual in a sample increases.



F     Abilities Distribution and Transmission
To measure the transmission of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities between generations, we use data
from the ‘Children of the NLSY79’ survey, which provides test scores of cognitive skills and eduction
for mothers, as well as cognitive and non-cognitive skills for children. We approximate non-cognitive
skills using the first principal component factor among five measures from the behavioral problems
index (antisocial, anxiety, headstrong, hyperactive and peer conflicts). Children’s cognitive skills
are measured as the first principal components among PIAT math, reading recognition and reading
comprehension scores. Mothers’ cognitive skills are approximated by AFQT scores. Mothers are also
classified into three education attainment levels.
    We focus on scores of children who are 14 years old. Pooling data across all available waves of the
CNLSY79 we have 5899 mother-child pairs at that age. To smooth the data we fit an ordered probit
and use the predicted values as estimates of the transition matrix cell probabilities. The dependent
variable in this ordered probit has nine possible categories generated by three cognitive and three
non-cognitive skill groups. The explanatory variables are mother’s cognition dummies, mother’s
education dummies, and a full set of interactions between them. Table F.1 reports the full transition
matrix generated by this exercise.

G       Inter-vivos Transfers
Our source of information on inter-vivos transfers (i.e., gifts from parents to their children) is the
NLSY97. We mostly use measures from the ‘Income’ subsection of the survey, complemented with
information from the College Experience section.57
    Transfers measured in the Income section refer to all income transferred from parents or guardians
to youth that are neither loans nor regular allowance. This information is elicited through a series of
questions, which also assess whether the individual lives with both, one or none of their parents.
Our measure of inter-vivos transfers uses the inter vivos transfer variable from youth who live with
both parents, when it is available. When the youth reports not living with both parents we sum
the inter-vivos transfers from both living mother/mother figure and father/father figure.58 If any of
these values are missing (e.g. mother’s transfer) then we include only the non-missing value (in this
example, father’s transfer). Observations which have missing values for all three possibilities to report
inter-vivos transfers are dropped from the sample: there are 370 individuals with no usable record of
transfers, and they are excluded from the sample.59
  57
      The College Experience section has information about parental transfers earmarked for financial aid while attending a
post-secondary academic institution. These transfers are not fully consistent with the information in the ‘Income’ section,
contain many skips and, most importantly, they do not cover all transfers. For this reason we only use limited information
from this section and make sure to include it so as to minimize reports’ error.
   58
      Those individuals who do not live with a mother/mother figure or a father/father figure, and whose biological mother
and father are not alive, are not asked questions on transfers.
   59
      Further investigation reveals that these individuals also exhibit missing values for various other variables, and infor-
mation about them appears incomplete.

Table G.1: Yearly inter-vivos transfers by gender and educational attainments, and by current college enrollment
status of the child. Amounts are expressed in year 2000 dollars and include allowances.


       For youth living at home we also compute the implicit transfer corresponding to the value of rent,
which is based on the estimated average rent paid by independent youth of the same age.
   We use waves from 1997 to 2003.60 This gives us an initial sample of 12,686 youths who were
between age 12 and 16 in 1997. Only respondents that are part of the cross-sectional (representative)
sample are kept, which leaves 6,748 individuals. We compute the cumulative transfers received be-
tween ages 16 and 22. When we drop observations for youth below age 16 in 1997, and 13 cases of
obvious mis-reporting, we obtain a final sample of 6,346 youth and a total number of observations
equal to 21,136. In this final sample, approximately 75% of youth report living in households with
at least one (biological or adoptive) parent as guardian.61 In the final sample from the Income sec-
tion, one third of observations (32.4%) report positive cash transfers elicited from the relevant survey
questions, meaning 67.6% reported not receiving any such transfers. However, when imputed rent is
included, 75.1% of observations have positive transfers. The value of imputed rent varies from age to
age with a minimum of $4,966 per year for kids aged 16 and a maximum of $6,615 for 22 year old
youth.
    In the College Experience section questions about financial help from parents are asked for each
term in College and refer to transfers specifically provided for school.62 The sampling restrictions are
the same as the ones used for the Income section. Parental aid variables are categorized by year for
  60
      Data for 2004 are dropped as there are no comparable inter-vivos amounts available after that year.
  61
      In principle, observations should be weighted when tabulating population characteristics. However, as suggested
by the BLS, the use of weights is inappropriate in samples generated after dropping observations reporting item non-
responses. Nonetheless we also experiment using the BLS custom weighting engine to construct specific weights for our
sample, with results changing only marginally. In what follows we use only results from the un-weighted sample.
   62
      After one term has been reported, the respondent is asked if the information for the next term has changed from the
previous term, and if it has not, the information is not recollected.

each respondent, and then summed up to generate an average variable for each year between 1997
and 2003. Given the way questions were designed and asked, the transfers recorded in the College
section should be a subset of the transfers recorded in the Income section. However in a large number
of cases, especially for students enrolled in 4-year Colleges, the transfer measures in the College
section are larger than those in the Income section. Following some correspondence with the BLS,
we concluded that transfer measures from the College section are generally less reliable than those
in the Income section. However, it is also possible that respondents included parental payments of
tuition fees in the College section transfer (for instance, if the parents paid tuition fees directly and
respondents chose not to report such amounts in the Income section).
       To calculate inter-vivos transfers, we chose to use both sources of data. More specifically, we use
completed schooling by survey year 2009 to classify individuals within three groups: (1) those who
have completed a 4-year college degree, and those who are currently enrolled in, or have completed,
a graduate degree; (2) those who have completed a high school degree, but are not in group (1); (3)
those who have not completed a high school degree.
       Table G.1 summarizes the average yearly transfer received by girls and boys with different edu-
cation achievement (as of survey year 2009); in the case of College graduates we distinguish between
transfers received while in College and transfers received in other years. For the years of College
attendance we approximate the total inter-vivos transfer as the maximum between transfers recorded
in the Income section and transfers recorded in the College Experience section.63
   Using the gender-specific average transfers in Table G.1 we compute the total amount received by
youth with less than a College degree over a 7 year period by simply multiplying estimated yearly
transfers and allowances by seven (note that all amounts are expressed in year 2000 dollars). In the
case of College graduates we compute the total transfer received over 7 years by summing up the
average amount received while in College multiplied by four (which is the College duration in the
model) and the amount received while out of College multiplied by three.
       Looking separately at transfers by gender of the child, this procedure results in a total transfer of
$29,096 for women and $33,164 for men. These figures are used to target transfers-by-gender in the
benchmark economy. Transfers reported in Table G.1 include allowances.




  63
    An alternative way to approximate transfers during College years is to sum the measures from the two sections, rather
than taking the higher one. This results in very similar average yearly transfers.

               (*) Due to lack of comparable estimates for 2010, the College-HS premium is based on
                estimates by ? for 2005. An alternative estimate by ?,
                based on a different education grouping, suggests a college-HS premium of about
                0.66 log points in 2010.
               (**) The gender gap is measured as in Goldin (2014). It corresponds to the ratio of median
                earnings of full-time women to full-time men. We set 2/3 of the equivalent of 40 hours
                as the full-time threshold (0.225 of the model time endowment).

H      Extrapolating the Model: 2000 vs 2010
To assess the ‘out of sample’ performance of the model, we have extrapolated its equilibrium implica-
tions to a different time period. In particular, we have set the following parameters to those prevailing
in the year 2010: (i) share parameters of different human capital in production; (ii) tuition costs and
value of other education expenditures; (iii) credit limits for both subsidized and unsubsidized college
loans.64 Then, keeping all other parameters unchanged, we have computed a new equilibrium alloca-
tion to verify how well the model would approximate observed enrollment rates and education/gender
premia in 2010. Results, presented in Table H.1, suggest that the model does a very reasonable job in
approximating equilibrium outcomes ten years out of sample.




  64
     Based on information from the National Centre for Education Statistics, the specific changes are: (i) adjustment of
the production technology shares to sLH = .15, sHS = .36, sCL = .49, sm,LH = .65, sm,HS = .59, sm,CL = .59; (ii)
tuition growth of roughly $1, 100 per year between 2000 and 2010 (in year 2000 dollars); (iii) debt limits’ expansion to
$19, 000 for subsidized and $31, 000 for unsubsidized/private loans (expressed in year 2010 dollars, equivalent to 15,447
and 25,203 in year 2000 dollars).

I    Welfare Decomposition
To ease notation, in this section it is convenient to augment our state vector with gender, i.e. we let
x∗0 be the initial individual state be (g, θ, κ , â, q). In line with this slight change of notation, we let
µ∗0 be its stationary equilibrium distribution, and V0 (c, l; x∗0 ) be the expected lifetime utility of an
individual with initial states x∗0 upon becoming adult, i.e. at the time of its first decision, the Less
than High School decision at age j = 0. This value, defined in equation (2.6), takes into account all
uncertainty in future adult life with respect to marital matching, income shocks (recall that survival
risk is perfectly insured through annuities) and abilities of children. The arguments (c, l) are meant to
capture that this value is inclusive of all future utility coming from the random sequences of individual
consumption and leisure before and after marriage, and consumption and leisure of the offsprings at
the time of the inter vivos transfer (because of altruism). Finally, let the superscripts ‘pre’ and ‘post’
denote the pre-reform and post-reform economies, respectively.
    The total ex-ante welfare gain from the policy reform (ϕtot ), expressed as a leisure-compensated
consumption equivalent variation, is
                Z                                                         Z
                        V0 (c   post
                                       ,l   post
                                                   ; x∗0 ) dµ∗,post
                                                             0        =          V0 ((1 + ϕtot ) cpre , lpre ; x∗0 ) dµ∗,pre
                                                                                                                       0     .   (I1)
                  S0∗                                                      S0∗


    Benabou (2002) has proved that this total welfare change of the policy reform, conceptually, can
be broken down into three components: (i) a level effect of the reform on the level of average con-
sumption, (ii) an uncertainty effect on the volatility of the agents’ consumption paths that affects
welfare because of risk aversion and incomplete markets, and (iii) an inequality effect on the equilib-
rium distribution of initial conditions µ0 . As shown in ?, if the utility function is homothetic in its
arguments, this decomposition is additive. Our utility function does not satisfy this property though,
and thus we have to define one of the three components residually.
   We start from the computation of the level effect and denote by V0 (C pre , Lpre ) the value function
in the pre-reform economy, where each realization of these sequences is replaced by the average
consumption and average leisure in the population. Then, the leisure-compensated consumption level
differential effect ϕlev between the two economies pre and post reform (pre, post) can be defined as:


                                       V0 (C post , Lpost ) = V0 ((1 + ϕlev ) C pre , Lpre ) .                                   (I2)


Note that in these values there is no heterogeneity left, meaning that V0 with arguments (C, L) is the
same independently of initial conditions, and there is no uncertainty left because the consumption


                                                                      93
and leisure sequences are constant forever and for everyone (individuals, their spouses, and their
offsprings). We label ϕlev , the level effect of the policy reform.
   Next, we compute certainty equivalent consumption for each type x∗0 , i.e., we replace the random
sequence c with a constant vector c̄ for each x∗0 such that:


                                          V0 (c̄ (x∗0 ) , l; x∗0 ) = V0 (c, l; x∗0 ) .                                 (I3)


This certainty equivalent calculation compensates for consumption uncertainty in individual income
and income of the spouse, through risk in marital matching.65 Next, we calculate the average certainty
equivalent consumption in the population in economy j ∈ {pre, post}:
                                                         Z
                                                    j
                                                 C̄ =            c̄ (x∗0 ) dµ∗,j
                                                                             0
                                                           S0∗


And we compute the average welfare cost of uncertainty in our economy as:


                                       V0 C̄ j , Lj = V0 (1 − punc ) C j , Lj .
                                                                            


We do it for both economies j ∈ {pre, post}, and calculate the welfare gain from reduced uncertainty,
or the uncertainty effect, of the policy reform as:

                                                             1 − ppost
                                                                  unc
                                                 ϕunc =                − 1.                                            (I4)
                                                             1 − ppre
                                                                  unc


   In order to obtain an additive decomposition, we then define residually the welfare gain from
reduced inequality as:
                                              1 + ϕtot
                                ϕ̃ine =                         − 1.
                                        (1 + ϕlev ) (1 + ϕunc )
We also performed an independent check that this residual component is close to its exact counterpart
ϕine as follows. Define the cost of inequality in initial conditions in economy j as:
                            Z
                                   V0 c̄ (x∗0 ) , Lj ; x∗0 dµj,∗              1 − pjine C̄ j , Lj .
                                                                                               
                                                             0 = V0                                                    (I5)
                             S0∗

  65
     We follow ? and, in the left hand side of (I3) we do not allow individuals to re-optimize their leisure in the counter-
factual where we replace their random sequence of consumption with the certainty equivalent value. We have verified that
our calculations are robust to this choice.


                                                         94
Note that here we are using the certainty equivalent in the left-hand side of (I5) and therefore the
concavity of V0 captures only the reduction in value due to dispersion in x∗0 not to uncertainty in the
consumption sequences. We do this calculation in both the pre and post reform economy, and define
the exact welfare gain of reduced inequality as:

                                                   1 − ppost

Table K.1: This table illustrates the sensitivity of our main results to the assumption that interest rates are exogenously
set (as in a small open economy). (*) The “average crowding in/out” figure corresponds to the average % change in IVTs
to children who go to college in both the benchmark and experiment. For the IVTs “+” refers to crowding in and “-” to
crowding out.


K      Sensitivity Analysis

K.1      Sensitivity of Policy Outcomes to Closed Economy Assumption
One possible concern about our results may relate to the endogenous determination of interest rates.
The general equilibrium adjustments might be different if the price of credit was exogenously given.
To check the robustness of our results we therefore consider a ‘small open economy’ alternative: the
annual interest rate is exogenously set at the benchmark equilibrium rate 3.43%. We compute the
outcomes of the grant and loan removal policies in this alternative equilibrium where only human
capital prices and tax rates adjust. The results, reported in Table K.1, show that aggregate effects
are reduced. For example, when government student loans are removed, GDP falls by 0.58% in
the long-run, rather than by 1.98% as we find for a closed economy. The mechanics of this GDP
reduction are slightly different. Within an open economy, drops in college enrollment are less severe
while changes in ability composition of college graduates are more severe. Thus, the stock of college
educated human capital falls by comparable amounts, but for rather different reasons. Differences in
the crowding out of parental transfers offer an insight into why this happens: in the open economy
parents boost their transfers to college-going kids by much more when government aid is removed,
which is an indication that selection into college due to parental wealth has become more important.
In such open economy scenario the interest rate cannot fall, whereas in the closed economy case it
falls by nearly 20 basis points. Any significant downward adjustment in the returns to assets implies

Table K.2: This table illustrates the sensitivity of our main results to variation in the estimated value of ρ. In the
benchmark economy we have an elasticity of 3.3, corresponding to ρ = 0.7. (*) The “average crowding out” figure
corresponds to the average % change in IVTs to children who go to college in both the benchmark and experiment.


a fall in the incomes of wealth rich families who provide relatively larger inter vivos transfers to their
children.66
    When returns to holding wealth do not adjust downward, low ability children from relatively richer
families displace high ability children from poorer families to a larger extent than would occur in a
closed economy.


K.2     Sensitivity of Policy Outcomes to ρ
When examining the effects of education policies, it is interesting to gauge how sensitive equilibrium
outcomes are to alternative values of the production parameter ρ, which dictates the elasticity of
substitution between H e aggregates. In Table K.2 we report results for a sensitivity analysis in which
we consider different values of ρ and we compare education policy outcomes to those obtained under
the benchmark parametrization (that is, ρ = .7). As expected, changes in college attainment rates
are larger when the elasticity of substitution is lower. Moreover, even when considering a fairly high
elasticity (equal to five), one can still detect sizable GE effects on GDP, ability composition and inter
vivos transfers.

    The inter vivos crowding in/out statistics refer to the selected sample who go to college in both benchmark and
experiment. Unconditional changes in IVTs are smaller.
