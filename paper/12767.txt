                                               ABSTRACT

Previous empirical studies of information cascades use either naturally occurring data or laboratory
experiments with student subjects. We combine attractive elements from each of these lines of research
by observing market professionals from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in a controlled environment.
As a baseline, we compare their behavior to student choices in similar treatments. We further examine
whether, and to what extent, cascade formation is influenced by both private signal strength and the
quality of previous public signals, as well as decision heuristics that differ from Bayesian rationality.
Analysis of over 1,500 individual decisions suggests that CBOT professionals are better able to discern
the quality of public signals than their student counterparts. This leads to much different cascade formation.
Further, while the behavior of students is consistent with the notion that losses loom larger than gains,
market professionals are unaffected by the domain of earnings. These results are important in both
a positive and normative sense.

In economic and financial environments in which decision makers have imperfect

information about the true state of the world, it can be rational to ignore one’s own

private information and make decisions based upon what are believed to be more

informative public signals. In particular, if decisions are made sequentially and earlier

decisions are public information, “information cascades” can result. Information cascades

arise when individuals rationally choose identical actions despite having different private

information.1 Cascades may arise in myriad settings, including technology adoption,

medical treatment, and environmental hazard response. Arguably, however, the most

well-known herds or cascades occur in financial markets, where bubbles and crashes may

be examples of such behavior.2

       Since the private information of cascade followers is not revealed, information

cascades can be suboptimal.      Moreover, because the small amount of information

revealed early in a sequence has a large impact on social welfare, cascades can be fragile,

with abrupt shifts or reversals in direction when new information becomes available

(Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992, 1998; hereafter BHW), Gale (1996),

Goeree et al. (2004)). Indeed, some argue that the volatility induced by herding behavior

can increase the fragility of financial markets and destabilize the broader market system

(Eichengreen et al. (1998), Bikhchandani and Sharma (2000), Chari and Kehoe (2004)).

       Previous empirical approaches that examine cascade behavior can be divided into

two classes; regression-based tests that use naturally occurring data and laboratory

experiments that use data gathered from student subjects. In a review of the extant

regression-based results for herding in financial markets, Bikhchandani and Sharma

(2000) note the difficulty of controlling for underlying fundamentals, and argue that as a




                                                                                         1
result of this difficulty there is often “a lack of a direct link between the theoretical

discussion of herding behavior and the empirical specifications used to test for herding.”3

The laboratory environment, in contrast, allows one to control for public and private

information and thus to make explicit tests of theoretical predictions more easily. Yet an

important debate exists about the relevance of experimental findings from student

subjects for understanding phenomena in the field. For example, professional behavior in

the field might differ from student behavior in laboratory experiments due to training or

regulatory considerations, which may affect the development of decision heuristics, as

well as the overall naturalness of the experimental environment (see, for example,

Harrison and List (2004)). Locke and Mann (2005) argue that financial market research

that ignores the effect of professional expertise is likely to be received passively because

“ordinary” individuals, as opposed to professional traders, are too far removed from the

price discovery process. Bikhchandani and Sharma (2000, p. 13) also argue that “to

examine herd behavior, one needs to find a group of participants that trade actively and

act similarly.”

       We find these arguments compelling and therefore combine the most attractive

aspects of these two classes of empirical research, that is, we observe professionals in a

controlled environment, and extend the literature in several new directions. First, we

compare the behavior of market professionals from the floor of the Chicago Board of

Trade (CBOT) with that of college students in an experimental setting in which the

underlying rationality of herd behavior can be identified.        Second, given the vast

normative implications of work that has established the importance of the domain of

earnings for decision making under risk (Kahneman and Tversky (1979), Shefrin and




                                                                                          2
Statman (1985), Odean (1998)), we examine the behavior of each group in the gain and

loss domain. We further examine whether, and to what extent, cascade formation is

influenced by both private signal strength and the quality of previous public signals, as

well as decision heuristics that differ from Bayesian rationality. Finally, within the group

of market professionals, we examine the extent to which differences in cascade formation

are associated with individual characteristics such as whether the participant is a day

trader.

          Empirical findings gained from an examination of more than 1,500 individual

decisions lend some interesting insights into cascade behavior. A key finding is that

market professionals tend to make use of their private signal to a greater degree and base

their decisions on the quality of the public signal to a greater extent, than do students. As

a result, the professionals are involved in weakly fewer overall cascades and significantly

fewer reverse cascades (cascades that lead to inferior outcomes). This result is novel to

the literature and has important implications for financial markets.4 Further, while the

behavior of students is consistent with the notion that losses loom larger than gains,

market professionals are unaffected by the domain of earnings. This finding is consistent

with Locke and Mann (2005), Genesove and Mayer (2001), and List (2003, 2004), who

find, in varying environments, that market experience is associated with a decline in

deviations from classical assumptions.

          Note that we observe behavioral differences not only across subject pools, but

also within the market professional group. For example, Bayesian play is correlated with

market experience and day traders are much more likely to join an informational cascade




                                                                                           3
than are non-day traders. Finally, we present data on the prevalence of non-Bayesian

decision heuristics, an area in which the two subject pools demonstrate similarities.

       The remainder of the study is crafted as follows. Section II outlines the basic

theory and experimental design. Section III presents our empirical results. Section IV

considers implications of our results for financial markets and briefly discusses the use of

professionals in experimental practice more broadly. Section V concludes.

                          I. Theory and Experimental Design

       Imitative behavior associated with herding has often been viewed as the product

of irrational decision-making (Keynes (1936); Shleifer and Summers (1990); Hirshleifer

(2001)). Alternatively, models such as Banerjee (1992), BHW (1992), and Welch (1992)

consider the conditions under which it is rational to join a cascade. The model we

present below, and the experimental environment we implement, is consistent with the

work of this second set of authors in that it is predicated on Bayesian updating of beliefs,

given private signals and a history of observable actions.5 The empirical investigation of

the cascade phenomenon raises interesting questions beyond whether agents update

information in a manner that is consistent with Bayes’ rule.6 Since the formation of

informational cascades is a social phenomenon, individual behavior may depend on how

agents view the rationality of others. Accordingly, we examine how our two subject

pools respond to uncertainty about the quality of information that arises due to potential

deviations from Bayesian rationality by others. We adopt two approaches. First, we use

a model in which the null hypothesis is that Bayesian rationality is universally applied

and is common knowledge. Second, we estimate a quantal response equilibrium (QRE)

model that assumes decision error (McKelvey and Palfrey (1998), Goeree et al. (2004a).




                                                                                          4
A. Theoretical Model and Predictions

        Consider an environment in which there are two possible underlying states of

nature Ω = {A, B} , with the true state denoted by ω ∈ Ω . Each of a set of I = {1,2,.., n}

agents receives an independent private signal, si ∈ {a, b} , that is informative in the sense

that   Pr( A | a) > Pr( B | a)   and   Pr( A | b) < Pr( B | b) .   Signal precision, given by

Pr( s = ω | ω ) , is identical for all agents. After receiving their signal, each agent chooses

either A or B with their choice, ci . If ci = ω , individual i receives a reward normalized to

one. , If ci ≠ ω , individual i receives zero. Each individual receives their signal in an

exogenously determined choice order. Along with their private signal si , each agent

observes the history of choices, H i = {c1 ,..., ci −1 } . The prior probability of an underlying

state, given by Pr(ω = A) = p and Pr(ω = B) = 1 − p , is common knowledge. If all

individuals update beliefs according to Bayes’ rule and this updating is common

knowledge, the posterior probability Pr(ω | H i , si ) is easily derived. We demonstrate the

formation of an information cascade in this setting via a simple example, parameterized

with the probabilities from one of our experimental treatments.

        Let Pr(ω = A) = Pr(ω = B) = p = 1 / 2 be the prior probability, with the precision

of the symmetric signal given by Pr(a | A) = Pr(b | B) = 2 / 3 , with complementary

probabilities Pr(b | A) = Pr(a | B) = 1 / 3 . Suppose that s1 = a . Bayes’ rule implies that

                                                  Pr(a | A) Pr( A)           2
                  Pr(ω = A | s1 = a) =                                      = .              (1)
                                         Pr(a | A) Pr( A) + Pr(a | B) Pr( B) 3




                                                                                               5
An expected utility maximizer would therefore predict A as the state of nature since

expected profits for announcing A, π A , exceed those for announcing B, π B .7 If the

second subject also receives an a signal, updating according to Bayes’ rule yields

                                                        Pr(a | A) 2       4
               Pr(ω = A | H 2 = A, s 2 = a ) =                           = .               (2)
                                                 Pr(a | A) + Pr(a | B)
                                                          2            2
                                                                          5

That is, two consecutive identical announcements yield a posterior probability of 0.80 in

favor of the indicated urn.8 As a result, the third decision maker should “follow the herd”

and choose ω = A regardless of her signal, as can be seen by examining the posterior in

which an opposing b signal is the private draw of the third player after two consecutive A

announcements:

                                                       Pr(a | A) 2 Pr(b | A)          2
         Pr(ω = A | H 3 = A, A, s3 = b) =                                            = .   (3)
                                            Pr(a | A) Pr(b | A) + Pr(a | B) Pr(b | B) 3
                                                     2                       2




         We classify a decision of this type—consistent with Bayesian rationality, but

inconsistent with one’s own private signal—as a cascade decision. In this example, the

decision maker in the third position reveals nothing about their private information and

thus the positive externality associated with learning from other’s choices is blocked by a

cascade. The analysis implies that, with this parameterization, public announcements are

uninformative whenever the number of public signals of one type exceeds the other by

two or more. As a result, if a cascade has not started, two consecutive low probability

draws can result in a reverse cascade whereby everyone rationally herds on the incorrect

state.

B. Experimental Design

         Anderson and Holt (1997) present a seminal experimental investigation of

cascade formation using a subject pool of undergraduates. To ensure comparability of


                                                                                            6
our results to the extant literature, we use experimental protocols that are closely related

to those of their work.9 The parameterization in the example above is consistent with

their symmetric treatment (Pr(a | A) = Pr(b | B) ). The experimental sessions we conduct

comprise 15 rounds of the basic game for a group of either five or six players whose

choice order in each round — either first, second, third, …., sixth ― is determined by a

random draw.

       A round begins with the experimental monitor selecting the state of nature with a

roll of a die that is unobserved by the subjects. Subjects gain information about the state

by drawing a single ball out of an unmarked bag into which the contents of the selected

urn have been transferred. The draw is made while the subject is isolated from the other

players. The monitor is informed of the choice of the state, and announces it publicly.

After all subjects have made their choices, the true state is revealed.

       To provide exogenous variation in the informational content of the private signal

across treatments, we use two urn types. In the symmetric treatment, Urn A contains two

type-a balls and one type-b ball, while Urn B contains two type-b balls and one type-a

ball. To create the asymmetric treatment, we add four a balls to both urns, yielding 6 (5)

a signals and 1 (2) b signal in the A (B) state. This modification results in a significant

dilution of the strength of an a signal, the relative weakness of which can be observed in

Table I, which provides posterior probabilities for all possible signal histories for both the

symmetric and asymmetric urn types. As an example, the two-thirds probability that

arises after a single a draw in the symmetric treatment arises after four consecutive a

draws in the asymmetric setting.     One consequence of the change in signal strength is




                                                                                            7
that in the asymmetric treatment, a cascade on the B state should take place after one b

signal even with either one or two a signals in the game’s history.

       The difference in signal strength across urn types allows us to investigate the

relationship between Bayesian updating and a choice heuristic based on a counting rule.

In the symmetric treatment, the optimal decision is always consistent with choosing the

state with the most informative signals. In the asymmetric case, four sequences violate

this counting rule in that it is optimal to choose B even when there are fewer b signals;

these noncounting rule sequences are (a, b) ∈ {(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2)} , as indicated by

bold type in Table I. Thus, the asymmetric treatment allows us to gain insights into the

extent to which decisions are better characterized as following a counting heuristic rather

than Bayesian updating.

       To provide exogenous variation in the earnings domain, we randomly place

subjects in either a gain or a loss treatment for all 15 rounds.         The treatment is

implemented so that in gain (loss) space a correct (incorrect) inference about the

underlying state results in positive (negative) earnings of $1 for students and $4 for

market professionals.10 An incorrect (correct) choice in gain (loss) space results in no

earnings.   To generate similar monetary outcomes across treatments, in the loss

treatments, students and market professionals are, endowed with $6.25 and $25.00,

respectively.11 We believe that this is the first study to vary the gain/loss domain in

cascade games.

       Experimental subjects in a particular session consist entirely of one of the two

subject types, students or market professionals. The experimental sessions with market

professionals are conducted at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the student data




                                                                                          8
are gathered from undergraduates at the University of Maryland in College Park. The

CBOT (student) subject pool includes 55 (54) subjects recruited from the floor of CBOT

(the university). The resulting experimental design is a 2x2x2 factorial across urn type

(symmetric (S) or asymmetric (A)), domain type (gains (G) or losses (L)), and subject

type (college undergraduates (C) or market professionals (M)).        Each experimental

session consists of a group of either five or six participants making decisions within the

same treatment type over 15 rounds. Table II summarizes our experimental sessions.

                               II. Experimental Results

       Table III, Panel A presents descriptive statistics from the experiment. We report

the rate of Bayesian decision making and the rate of cascade formation, with a Bayesian

decision defined assuming common knowledge of Bayesian rationality (no decision

error). Pooled, the 20 experimental sessions yield a total of 1,647 decisions, 1,284 (78%)

of which are consistent with a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.12 Cascade decisions (i.e.,

Bayesian decisions inconsistent with the private signal) occur in 15% of the choices. Of

these, just under one-quarter (55 out of 245) are “reverse” cascades, resulting in the

wrong inference about the underlying state.

       Perhaps more revealing than the aggregate number of cascades is the proportion

of cascade decisions made when the opportunity arises. Recall that a cascade decision is

possible only when the private draw is inconsistent with the probability weight derived

from the choice history and one’s own private signal. In our data, cascade formation is

possible in 441 of the decisions, representing 27% of the total; cascades are realized in

245 (56%) of these cases. These results are presented in the potential and realized

cascades columns of Table III, Panel A.




                                                                                        9
       Table III, Panel A also reports statistics disaggregated by subject and treatment

type. In aggregate, 81% (75%) of the students’ (market professionals’) decisions are

consistent with Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Decisions of individual subjects range from

38% to 100% Bayesian (these results are not shown to conserve space), and of the 14

subjects perfectly consistent with Bayesian rationality, 10 were students.13 In situations

in which Bayesian behavior requires that one ignore private information, fewer agents are

Bayesian: The final column of Table III, Panel A shows that 61% (49%) of students

(market professionals) ignore their signal when doing so leads to a cascade.

Interestingly, rates of cascade formation and Bayesian decision making are lower in the

asymmetric treatments for both subject pools.

       The final set of descriptive statistics is presented in Table III, Panel B, which

displays results from the asymmetric treatments first pooled and then parsed by subject

pool and sequence type, where the type is either a counting rule or a noncounting rule

sequence.14 Table III, Panel B demonstrates that both Bayesian decision making and

cascade formation decline when the rules are not reinforcing:         The proportion of

Bayesian decisions by students (market professionals) declines from 76% (76%) to 49%

(42%), and the rate at which cascades obtain declines from 58 percent (55%) to 39%

(26%). These results suggest that the noncounting rule sequences pose a challenge for

both subject pools.15

       To permit more formal inference, we apply a variety of parametric and non-

parametric statistical techniques and group our results into five categories. Three of the

categories compare students and market professionals to consider differences in (1)

Bayesian decision making, (2) cascade formation, and (3) behavior across the gain/loss




                                                                                       10
domain. A fourth category concentrates on data from market professionals by making

use of additional demographic data collected during the experiment. The fifth category

considers the exogenous alteration of signal strength through the use of the symmetric

and asymmetric urns. Our analysis leads to the following insight:

            RESULT 1: Market professionals are less Bayesian than students. Despite
            this behavioral discrepancy, earnings are not significantly different across
            subject pools.

To provide evidence of this result we employ both unconditional and conditional

statistical tests. When using unconditional tests, we account for the data dependencies

within an experimental session by using session-level aggregates to yield the most

conservative statistical tests. Our unconditional test used to support Result 1 is a non-

parametric Mann-Whitney U test, which indicates that the rate of Bayesian decision

making differs across subject pools at a level of significance of p = 0.052.16

        To complement this analysis, we employ conditional tests that recognize the panel

nature of our data; in particular, we use a random effects probit specification of the form

                            Bayeit = β`Xit + eit,     eit ~N[0,1],                       (4)

where Bayeit equals unity if agent i is a Bayesian in round t under the assumption of no

decision error by preceding players, and zero otherwise, and Xit includes treatment effects

(gain, sym, and trader) and other variables predicted to influence play (order_x, diff, and

heurist).     The treatment variables are as defined above: gain equals one (zero) for

sessions in the domain of gains (losses), sym equals one (zero) for the symmetric

(asymmetric) sessions, and trader equals one (zero) for the market professionals

(students).




                                                                                          11
       The remaining variables are defined as follows. The categorical variable order_x

(x=2,..,6) indicates the positional order in which the individual choice is made. The

posterior probability is incorporated in the variable diff, which is calculated as

Pr (ω = A | H , s ) − 0.5 and measures the accrued public and private information at the

disposal of each decision maker; note that diff, therefore, varies from zero to one-half,

increasing with evidence of the underlying state.17 The variable heurist is equal to one

(zero) for noncounting rule (counting rule) sequences. In a perfect Bayesian equilibrium,

the coefficients of these latter two variables should not differ from zero.

       We specify eit = uit + αi, where the two components are independent and normally

distributed with mean zero: Var(eit) = σu2 + σα2. We estimate equation (1) using the

maximum likelihood approach derived in Butler and Moffitt (1982). Estimation of this

model is amenable to Hermite integration. To estimate the model, we use a 12 point

quadrature and the method of Berndt et al. (1974) to compute the covariance matrix.

       Empirical results are reported in Table IV, which presents the marginal effects

associated with a change in each of the regressors computed at the overall sample

means.18 Concerning subject pool effects, results from both a likelihood ratio test and the

trader dummy variable in the pooled regression model (Panel 4a) support the non-

parametric finding that market professionals are less Bayesian than students.19 The

estimated marginal effect in the pooled model suggests that traders are 6% less likely to

be Bayesian, and this effect is significant at the p < 0.05 level.

       Despite the noisier environment (fewer professionals are Bayesian), market

professionals and students choose the correct underlying state at similar rates. Indeed,

using a Mann-Whitney U-test, we find that we cannot reject the homogenous null that



                                                                                        12
success rates are similar at conventional levels (p= 0.29), leading to the result that

earnings are similar across the subject pools. To dig a level deeper into this finding, we

estimate a model similar in spirit to equation (1), but make the dependent variable win be

dichotomous and equal to unity (zero) if the individual chooses correctly (incorrectly).

We also include an additional independent variable, round, to identify learning during the

course of the session; round is a time trend and increases from 1 to 15 within a session.20

       The empirical results summarized in Table V support the nonparametric finding

concerning earnings and provide more formal evidence of the second half of Result 1. In

particular, the trader variable in Table V, Panel 5a is not significantly different from zero

at conventional levels (p = 0.27). This result suggests that traders and students choose

the correct urn at similar rates. The two groups differ in their temporal play, however, as

evidenced by the significant (insignificant) and positive marginal effect of round for the

traders (students), consistent with learning effects among traders.

       Besides providing empirical support for Result 1, the models in Tables IV and V

reveal some of the important effects of the other independent variables. For example, the

diff and heurist coefficient estimates in the pooled model of Table IV indicate that a

marginal change in the posterior probability has a large positive effect (66%), while

decisions in the counting rule sequences are 23% less likely to be Bayesian than those in

which counting and Bayesian posterior imply the same result. Similar insights arise

when we split the sample by subject type, as summarized in Panels 4b and 4c of Table

IV. In addition, the effect of diff is statistically significant for both subject pools in the

Table V win models.




                                                                                           13
       Interestingly, urn symmetry, as captured by the sym dummy variable, is not

significant for the market professionals in either model, implying that, for the traders, the

difference across urn types is captured by the counting rule distinction. In contrast, the

urn difference has a significant influence on students, who are much more likely to be

Bayesians in the symmetric treatment (see Table IV, Panel 4b).

       A final important difference across subject pools is that the order_x variables

indicate a decline in Bayesian behavior among market professionals who choose in the

third through fifth positions. The magnitude of the effect is rather large, having from

one-third to two-thirds of the effect of the counting rule sequences as represented in the

heurist variable (Table IV, Panel 4c). In contrast, the students show no such effect. The

behavior reflected in this finding is consistent with the idea that the market professionals

recognize that no new additional information is added by choices once a herd has been

formed.

       Given the significance of the diff and heurist variables, we explore the individual

data further in a QRE model, which examines the degree to which incentives affect error

rates in decision making. Following Anderson and Holt (1997), we focus on data from

our symmetric sessions and make use of the QRE model developed by McKelvey and

Palfrey (1995, 1998); (see also Goeree et al. (2004), Goeree, Holt, and Palfrey (2005)).

The QRE model assumes that the probability of choosing an urn is increasing in its

expected value. Given the positive and significant coefficient on the diff variable in

Table IV, the usefulness of such a model for both the students and market professionals

appears evident. For parsimony, we reserve detailed discussion of the QRE model for the

Appendix, However, we briefly describe the results below.




                                                                                          14
         Table A1 in the Appendix reports estimates of the lambda parameter in the QRE

model.    The lambda parameter indicates the extent to which noise affects decision

outcomes; as λ → ∞ , the choice converges to the Bayesian outcome; as λ → 0 , the

decisions become purely random. Significant differences in lambda across the subject

pools are observed at choice orders one, two, and five as reflected in the p-values in

column “p” of Table A1. Particularly notable is the difference at choice order two, where

the students exhibit few errors. The differences in noise in the first two choice orders

lead to quite different behaviors in choice order three, despite the fact that estimates of

the lambda parameter are indistinguishable.

         The lambda estimates imply that the two subject pools have similar deviations

from Bayesian rationality at choice order three. Thus, the market professionals’ tendency

to rely on their own signal due to errors in earlier rounds is as rational as the students’

decision to ignore theirs and join the cascade. Table A2 clarifies the meaning of this

result by examining in detail the impact of the noisy decision process on revealed public

information and choice probabilities for the first three rounds of play. For comparison,

we present the posteriors and choice probabilities assuming a perfect Bayesian

equilibrium, as well as the actual individual decisions.

         Consider the posterior probability for choice order three in Table A2, the first

choice at which a cascade may form in the symmetric treatment, when the signal history

is AAb (or BBa). In this case, the posterior probability of urn A has dropped from 0.67

for the most likely urn to 0.51 (0.59) for the market professionals (students). Thus, while

ignoring one’s private information is optimal for both groups, the noise in prior decisions

dilutes the strength of the signals, with the market professionals facing essentially a




                                                                                        15
random choice. The probability that urn A is chosen is 0.54 (0.83) for the market

professionals (students). The differences across the sequences in choice order three

highlights the fact that noise in the decision-making process dilutes the value of the

public signal.

       Despite the evidence from the QRE estimation of the noisier environment for the

market professionals we find that the two groups do not differ significantly in their

earnings,. Further exploration into this observation leads to the following two results:

         RESULT 2a: In aggregate, the rate of cascade formation is not significantly
         different for students and market professionals; however market professionals
         enter into fewer reverse cascades in the asymmetric treatments.

         RESULT 2b: Market professionals are better able to discern the quality of
         the signal associated with other players’ announcements than are students.

Evidence in favor of Results 2a and 2b follows from both nonparametric and parametric

statistical tests. Even though the rate at which cascades are realized is roughly 60% for

the students and only 50% for the market professionals (see Table III, Panel A), using a

Mann-Whitney test the homogeneous null cannot be rejected at conventional levels

(Mann-Whitney p=0.33).

       While the rate of cascade formation indicates that there is only weak evidence that

students enter into a greater number of cascades than do professionals, there are

significant differences across subject pools in the rate of cascade formation in the

asymmetric urn treatment. Table III, Panel A reveals that in the asymmetric treatment

only 12% (8 of 66) of the cascades entered by market professionals are reverse cascades.

This is roughly half of the rate observed for students (25 of 99), a difference that is

statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level using a Mann-Whitney test.




                                                                                           16
       To complement these nonparametric insights, we estimate models similar to

equation (1), but set the dependent variable equal to one when a cascade is formed and

zero otherwise. To conserve space, we do not formally tabulate these results since they

reinforce the nonparametric insights gained above. We find that in the model that pools

the symmetric and asymmetric data cascade formation is similar across the students and

market professionals. When we focus, instead, on reverse cascades and use only the data

from the asymmetric urn treatments, we find that students enter significantly more

reverse cascades than do professionals.

       These results cannot be explained by our model of decision making based on

posterior probabilities derived from signals and actions. We therefore investigate the

hypothesis that market professionals use auxiliary information that the students ignore in

order to avoid reverse cascades. To do so, we augment the cascade formation model

discussed above by considering whether subjects use information specific to individuals

selecting prior to them in the current round.

       Specifically, we construct two variables that each provides an indication of the

Bayesian decision making of subjects who preceded each player in a particular round:

othb_max (othb_min) measures the extent of previous Bayesian decisions by the most

(least) Bayesian players. For example, for player i whose choice order is x in round t, we

calculate othb_min as

                                 ⎡ t −1                          ⎤
                                 ⎢ ∑ baye jt                     ⎥
               othb_min it = min ⎢ t =1
                        x
                                                ∀ j : x jt < xit ⎥ .                  (5)
                                 ⎢ t −1                          ⎥
                                 ⎢⎣                              ⎥⎦

In this case, the proportion of Bayesian decisions for the individual with the lowest

proportion among all j agents preceding the current decision maker is used as the


                                                                                       17
independent variable, although the empirical results are robust to other specifications

including replacing the min operator with the mean or max. In the case of othb_max, we

simply replace “min” with “max” in equation (5). Note that these variables are calculated

for each t (round of the game) so that they include only those decisions that have already

occurred. The variables diff, heurist, and gain are also included, and are defined as in the

previous models.

       Empirical results are presented in Table VI. Since the results across models yield

similar insights concerning the nature of interpreting signals, we focus on the othb_min

results. Although othb_min is insignificant in the pooled specification in Panel 6a, this

result masks a difference in how the two subject pools respond to the announcements of

others. Results in Table VI, Panel 6c suggest that cascade formation for the market

professionals is significantly and substantially associated with the quality of the others’

signals. The marginal effect of a higher minimum in the preceding players’ share of

Bayesian decisions is 47%, which is the largest of the variables that are statistically

significant and is an indication of the impact of the inferred signal quality on the

willingness to make a decision that relies on others. This variable is significant and

negative in the student sample (Panel 6b).

       Using othb_max in the regression yields an insignificant effect for the students,

while the market professionals again respond positively, with a marginal effect of 57%

(detailed results omitted).21 We therefore conclude that the market professionals make

better use of available public information, incorporating evidence on others’ rationality in

their decision making in a way that is payoff relevant.22 Note also that, in contrast with




                                                                                         18
what we found with respect to all decisions (Table IV), the diff variable is not significant

for either group when we restrict our attention to the subset on cascade formation.

       One may wonder whether the result on signal quality is due to market

professionals having a greater level of previous interaction with one another than

students, or, alternatively, whether there is evidence of learning in the experiment. To

explore this issue, we again examine changes in behavioral patterns during an

experimental session. The evidence is consistent with the view that market professionals

learn over these 15 rounds. Comparing behavior from the first and last three rounds of a

session, we find that market professionals: a) significantly reduce the rate at which they

join reverse cascades (from 13% to 2%), and b) increase the rate at which they join

cascades with good outcomes (from 24% to 46%).               Both results are statistically

significant in probit specifications that include the cascade type as the dependent variable

and the temporal variable along with the control variables as independent variables (full

results omitted to conserve space). By contrast, there are no significant changes in the

rate of cascade formation for either type of cascade for the student subjects.

       Our final insight concerning the comparison between students and professionals

concerns the domain of earnings of the game:

       RESULT 3: Bayesian behavior of the student population is affected by whether
earnings are in the gain or loss domain, while market professionals are unaffected.

Summary evidence in favor of this result can be found in Table III, Panel A, where we

observe that professionals exhibit a similar degree of Bayesian decision making across

the gain and loss domains (roughly 75%), whereas for students Bayesian play increases in

the loss domain. For example, considering the asymmetric treatments, we find that a

Mann-Whitney test indicates that college students are less Bayesian in the gain treatment



                                                                                         19
than in the loss treatment, while market professionals are unaffected by the domain of

earnings (students: p < 0.08; traders: p = 0.61).23

       Empirical estimates in Table IV provide additional evidence of this result. In the

pooled data (Panel 4a), the dummy variable gain is not significant at conventional levels,

and it remains insignificant for the market professionals’ specification (Panel 4c). For the

students, however, the parameter estimate is both significant (p=0.028) and negative,

indicating a 6% increase in Bayesian behavior in the loss domain.            This result is

consistent with the notion that, for the student population, losses loom larger than gains.

This result is consonant with results in List (2003, 2004), who explore loss aversion in a

much different environment. Nevertheless, consistent with the notion that repetition

might attenuate such anomalies (see, for example, Knez et al. (1985); Coursey et al.

(1987)), analysis of the data from the student sessions provides some evidence that the

effect of the domain is mitigated via repetition.

       While Results 1-3 highlight differences between the professional and student

subjects, we also find important differences within the group of market professionals that

are relevant for understanding their decision processes. We supplement our data with a

survey implemented at the end of the experimental session. Upon exploring these data

more closely, we find:

       RESULT 4: Behavioral differences exist within the professional subject pool.

Evidence of this result can be obtained by augmenting equation (1) using the additional

demographic data collected from the CBOT floor personnel after the experiment. We

focus on data collected from a group of 28 of the 55 traders who reported information on

intensity (the average number of contracts traded per day), gender (one for female, zero




                                                                                         20
otherwise), yrs (years of experience), income, and overnight, (a dichotomous variable that

equals one if the trader takes overnight positions and zero otherwise). Panel A. of Table

VII reports on the Bayesian decision making and Panel B reports on the cascade

formation for these traders.

       Concerning Bayesian decision making, we find that diff is not significantly

different from zero. Indifference to the magnitude of the posterior, for the Bayesian

models, does not occur elsewhere in our study, and as we discuss previously is consistent

with Bayesian rationality and inconsistent with theories of decision error. Variables that

are significant include heurist, intensity, and overnight. As with the previous results

reported in Table IV, heurist has a strong negative effect (-39.1%). Trading intensity

increases Bayesian behavior slightly (0.4%) and overnight trade has a significantly

negative impact on the rate of Bayesian decision making (-17.8%). The probit estimates

in Panel B reveal that day traders are much more likely to join an informational cascade,

as are traders with lower trading intensity, with marginal effects of -80% on overnight

and -2.9% on intensity.

       For those making consequential trading decisions, the link between trading

intensity and Bayesian rationality is consistent with the empirical results of Locke and

Mann (2005), Genovese and Mayer (2001), and List (2003, 2004), who find similar

results in diverse settings that include financial, housing, and memorabilia markets. We

believe that the result on trading style is novel, and we offer some thoughts on its

implications in the discussion section below.

       Results 1-4 highlight differences in cascade formation and Bayesian decision

making across subject types, and include the exogenous alteration of signal strength due




                                                                                       21
to urn type through the heurist variable. Our final result looks more closely at the impact

of signal strength:

      RESULT 5: Deviations from Bayesian norms are greatest when the counting rule
and Bayesian updating make different predictions.

Our probit specifications reveal that when counting and Bayesian rationality yield

different predictions, both market professionals and students are less Bayesian. Table

VIII presents all of the observed signal patterns for the asymmetric treatment. Those in

which the counting rule and Bayesian posteriors yield different predictions are in bold

type. Statistical tests confirm what a visual scan of the data suggests: Bayesian behavior

is significantly reduced in the noncounting rule sequences.24             In fact, the four

noncounting rule sequences have lower rates of Bayesian decision making than any of the

other sequences, despite the fact that others have smaller diff values.

       Figure 1 illustrates this insight by presenting the proportion of Bayesian decisions

for all observed histories of play as a function of the posterior probability. The non-

counting rule sequences (square entries) are uniformly lower than the other choice

histories, represented as black diamonds. Compiling the results from Figure 1, we find

that Bayesian behavior occurs at a rate of 44% in the non-counting rule choice histories

and at a rate of 81% in the remaining choice histories in the asymmetric treatments.

There is an important difference in the rate of Bayesian behavior in noncounting rule

sequences that depends on whether one’s decision involves choosing to join a cascade.

The difference is best explained by considering whether individuals rely on their private

signal. Restricting attention to noncounting rule sequences, we find that individuals are

Bayesian in 31% of the cases when the decision involves choosing to enter a cascade.

Therefore, 69% follow their own signal. By contrast 74% of decisions are Bayesian



                                                                                         22
when there is no potential cascade and the decision is consistent with one’s private

information (see Table IX). Thus, when the signal history requires that Bayesian agents

ignore their own signal, agents generally fail to do so. As a result, the failure of cascade

decisions implies that 69% rely on their own information – a result statistically

indistinguishable from the 74% who rely on their own signal when doing so is optimal.

We conclude that for the noncounting rule sequences, a Bayesian perspective provides a

less accurate description of decision making than the simple rule of using private

information.

                                       III. Discussion

       Our cascade game data yield interesting evidence of heterogeneity both across the

two subject pools and within the market professional group.            Simple measures of

performance indicate that the students outperform the market professionals. Controlling

for learning about signal quality, however, makes clear that the market professionals use

a more sophisticated decision process, more finely parsing the quality of public

information and relying on their own signal more frequently.            Within the market

professional group, trading style has a strong effect on behavior, with those taking

overnight positions entering cascades much less frequently.

       We view these results as having potentially interesting implications for financial

markets, although care must be taken with the interpretation, in part because of the fixed

payoff that subjects received in our experiment.25          However, fixed prices are not

irrelevant in financial markets as variability in order size means that prices need not

change with each transaction. Thus, it is reasonable to study cascade decisions occurring

at a constant price as well as those that lead to a change in price.




                                                                                         23
       We believe it is plausible that the heterogeneity among traders regarding cascade

formation may be related to differences in their trading practices, including those around

fixed prices. Local floor traders who do not take overnight positions typically specialize

as market makers and are more likely to face situations in which herding, including

herding at a constant price, is part of their trading practice. This type of herding may

occur, for example, when several floor traders each take a portion of a large institutional

order. Manaster and Mann (1999) provide evidence that market makers are willing to

give up their advantage in executions, narrowing or eliminating the bid-ask spread, when

they have an informational advantage over the outside order. If information is dispersed

among traders heterogeneously, the situation is similar to the cascade environment we

study here. A crucial difference is that timing and transaction size in the market is

endogenous, and ultimately, of course, prices do change.26

       Avery and Zemsky (1998) introduce flexible pricing into the BHW model and

find that for cascades to form, the value uncertainty, which we implement in our

experimental protocol, needs to be accompanied by event uncertainty (the possibility of a

change in asset value) and composition uncertainty (which implies that the distribution of

trader types is not common knowledge). Our results on the discernment of the quality of

public announcements suggest that experienced professionals are better able to estimate

the composition of the distribution of trader types, and so may act to mitigate price

bubbles and crashes.27 Clearly, while additional research regarding the impact of trader

specialization is warranted, our findings highlight the benefits of controlled

experimentation with nonstudent subject pools.




                                                                                        24
       We believe that our findings may also shed light on other types of cascade

behavior. Consider Welch’s (1992) interesting model of initial public offerings (IPOs),

for example, which addresses cascade formation at a fixed price due to regulatory

requirements for IPOs. Welch finds that issuing firms have an interest in pricing to

generate an informational cascade in order to increase the probability of a successful

offering. Our results that emphasize the potential for cascade fragility arising from

variation in the ability to interpret signal quality may be important in this context. One

possible implication is that when underpricing of offerings is optimal in the Welch

model, heterogeneity in signal strength and interpretation might play an instrumental role

since reverse cascades in which no investment occurs will be fragile. The welfare

implications, however, are not immediately obvious given that the resulting cascades are

of shorter duration. Further, the importance of the effect may differ across firms or

industries depending on the economies of scale of the investment and thus the need to

have full or only partial subscription (Welch (1992), p. 709).

       Both the differences due to specialization and the heterogeneity in signal quality

and processing abilities suggest fruitful directions for future research. How the

specialized skills of market participants interact in price discovery could be explored in

experiments that move towards a full market setting, but in which liquidity and

informational conditions are varied in a controlled manner.       A natural part of this

research program would be to extend the current environment to study the impact of

heterogeneity on the IPO model of Welch (1992).          In a recent study that provides

evidence from asset market experiments with student subjects Dufwenberg, Lundqvist,

and Moore (2005) find that mixed experience levels can reduce the incidence of bubbles




                                                                                       25
and crashes. Heterogeneous subject pools that include professionals would shed crucial

light on this issue, and help to identify the mechanisms underlying cascade formation and

fragility in settings that mix fixed and variable prices.

                               IV. Concluding Comments

       In this study, we introduce market professionals from the CBOT floor to a

controlled experimental environment. Making use of information cascades games, we

report several insights. While student subjects more closely follow Bayes’ rule, they do

not perform significantly better than the market professionals along the important

dimension of earnings. This puzzle is explained by the fact that professionals are more

sophisticated in their use of public information, as manifested over the course of the

decision process: Market professionals are less Bayesian when making decisions later in

the choice order in a cascade game, consistent with recognizing that the quality of initial

announcements is variable, altering the payoffs of joining cascades.

       While market professionals learn over the course of an experimental session to

account for the quality of others’ decisions, student subjects fail to do so. A further

insight is that market professionals are consistent in behavior over the gain and loss

domains, while in aggregate, students behavior is consistent with the notion of loss

aversion. Perhaps most provocatively for the operation of markets, we find an important

heterogeneity among the market professionals that depends on their trading style. In

summary, our data reveal that the decisions of market professionals are consistent with

behaviors that may mitigate informational externalities in market settings, and thus

reduce the severity of price bubbles due to informational cascades.




                                                                                        26
       Besides revealing both positive and normative insights, our work also offers a

methodological contribution. For example, it highlights the potential for experiments

with students and professionals to be complementary inputs to research when field data is

suggestive but inconclusive. Indeed, in transferring the insights gained in the laboratory

with student subjects to the field, a necessary first step is to explore how market

professionals behave in strategically similar situations. In this spirit, we focus on the

representativeness of the sampled population to lend insights into which empirical results

are similar across subject pools. A related issue concerns the representativeness of the

environment, which also merits serious consideration. For example, before we can begin

to make reasonable arguments that behavior observed in the lab is a good indicator of

behavior in the field, we must explore whether the other dimensions of the laboratory

environment might cause differences in behavior, including the abstract task, the stakes,

the good, and the institution. While our research represents a necessary first step in the

discovery process, we hope that future efforts will explore more fully other potentially

important dimensions of the controlled laboratory experiment.

Appendix: QRE Estimation Results

        Results in Table IV lead us to investigate a modification of the quantal response

equilibrium (QRE) developed by McKelvey and Palfrey (1995, 1998). By accounting for

the noise associated with the probabilistic choice rule, the QRE yields alternative

measures of the public belief. Our approach invokes a rational expectations assumption

for the error distribution. There is mixed evidence for this assumption (see Goeree et al.

(2004b) and Kubler and Weizsacker (2004a, 2004b)), but several alternative

specifications yield similar insights (these results are available upon request).

        Let the probability of choosing urn A be given by

                                     (                          )       (
         pr (ci = A | H i , si ) = pr π iA + ε iA > π iB + ε iB = pr ε i > 1 − 2π iA ,      )
where π iA = pr ( A | H i , si ) * $W = $W − π iB , and ε i = ε iA − ε iB . For comparability across

subject pools we normalize so that $W = 1 for both subject pools. If the errors have an

extreme value distribution, then the conditional probability of the urn choice is given by

the logistic distribution yielding

                                                                    1
                           pr (ci = A | H i , si ) =
                                                               ( (           (
                                                       1 + exp λi 1 − 2π iA λ1...i −1   ))) .
The lambda parameter indicates the extent to which noise affects decision outcomes. As

λ → ∞ , the choice converges to the Bayesian outcome; as λ → 0 , the decisions become

purely random. Note that the posterior probability that the urn is A, π iA , is a function of

the lambda estimates from previous choice orders, with (λ1...i −1 ) representing the vector

of previous estimates.

        In our estimation, we follow Anderson and Holt (1997) and focus on the

symmetric data. The QRE results using these data are displayed in Tables X and XI. Our



                                                                                                 35
results emphasize the fact that not only the numbers of each signal, but also the order in

which they are revealed have an important impact on behavior. For example, note the

posterior probability for order choice three in Table X, the first choice where a cascade

may form in the symmetric treatment, when the signal history is AAb (or BBa) (since the

AAb and BBa are symmetric, Table X reports the results from these sequences as one

choice history (AAb); all other symmetric choice sequences are treated similarly). In this

case the posterior probability of urn A has dropped from 0.67 for the most likely urn to

0.51 (0.59) for the market professionals (students). Thus, while ignoring one’s private

information is optimal for both groups, the noise in prior decisions dilutes the strength of

the signals, with the market professionals facing essentially a random choice with the

probability that urn A is chosen being        0.539 (0.833) for the market professionals

(students). In comparison the ABa sequence, which has an identical posterior probability

when there is no noise, the posterior 0.64 (0.65) for market professionals (students), and

the optimal decision is made uniformly by both subject pools. This difference across the

sequences in choice order three highlights the fact that noise in the decision making

process dilutes the value of the public signal.

Panel A (B) shows that Market Professionals (Students) are exposed to either the Symmetric or Asymmetric urn and play the game in
either the gain or the loss domain. The symmetric urn consists of three balls — two a and one b in Urn A, and one b and two a in Urn B.
The Asymmetric urn consists of seven balls — six a and one b in Urn A, and five a and two b in Urn B. The number of decisions is a
function of the number of players, the number of games, and the number of rounds in each game.

The Bayesian column represents the total number of decisions (and proportion) that were consistent with a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.
Cascade decisions (those which are Bayesian but private information ignored) and reverse cascades (same as cascades but the wrong
inference of the underlying state takes place) occupy the next two columns. The potential cascades category represents the proportion
(and number) of cascades that could have occurred when it was possible to make one, and the realized cascades category represents the
proportion of those potential cascades that were actually realized. “n” = number of decisions. Treatment codes are S = symmetric, A =
asymmetric, G = gain, L = loss, C = college student, M = market professional.

The dichotomous dependent variable in all three probit models (pooled, student, and market professional) is coded one for a decision consistent
with the Bayesian posterior and zero otherwise. Independent variables include diff, which is prob (urn = A) − .5 , where the prob (urn = A) is
the posterior probability arising from the combination of public and private information at the disposal of each decision maker. The variables
gain, sym, and trader (in the case of the pooled model) are dichotomous and distinguish the treatments. Heurist is a dummy variable equal to one
for the non-counting rule sequences and zero for all others. order_x (where x=2,..6) is a categorical variable indicating where in the round of play
the decision was made. The Wald statistic tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero.

The dichotomous dependent variable in all three probit models (pooled, student, and market professional) is coded one for a decision that correctly
predicts the underlying state and zero otherwise. Independent variables include diff, which is prob (urn = A) − .5 , where the prob (urn = A) is
the posterior probability arising from the combination of public and private information at the disposal of each decision maker. The variables
gain, sym, and trader (in the case of the pooled model) are dichotomous and distinguish the treatments. Heurist is a dummy variable equal to one
for the non-counting rule sequences and zero for all others. Round represents a time trend that increases from 1 to 16 with each completed play of
the cascade game. Order_x (where x=2,..6) is a categorical variable indicating where in the round of play the decision was made. The Wald
statistic tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients are zero.

The dichotomous dependent variable in all three probit models (pooled, student, and market professional) is coded one for a cascade decision
and zero otherwise. Independent variables include diff, which is prob (urn = A) − .5 , where the prob (urn = A) is the posterior probability
arising from the combination of public and private information at the disposal of each decision maker. The variables gain and trader (in the case
of the pooled model) are dichotomous and distinguish the treatment/subject type. Othb_min is the proportion of Bayesian decisions by the
individual with the lowest proportion among all preceding the decision maker. The othb_min is calculated in each round of the game to include
only those decisions that have already occurred. Heurist is a dummy variable equal to one for the non-counting rule sequences and zero for all
others. Order_x is a categorical variable indicating where in the round of play the decision was made. Note: Because the othbys variable is not
applicable for those in the first round or first in choice order in subsequent rounds (they do not observe others’ decisions in the current round),
these observations are excluded. This results in the exclusion of 25 of the 441 potential cascades. The order_2 dummy variable is also excluded
and choice order two serves as the baseline to which others are compared. The Wald statistic tests the null hypothesis that all coefficients are
zero.

The dichotomous dependent variable in panel a. is coded one for a decision consistent with the Bayesian posterior and zero otherwise. For
panel b. cascade formation is indicated by a one and cascade failure by a zero. Independent variables include diff, which is
 prob (urn = A) − .5 , where the prob (urn = A) is the posterior probability arising from the combination of public and private
information at the disposal of each decision maker. The variables gain and sym are dichotomous and distinguish the treatments. Heurist is
a dummy variable equal to one for the non-counting rule sequences and zero for all others. Order_x (where x=2,..6) is a categorical
variable indicating where in the round of play the decision was made. Intensity reflects the level of trading intensity among participants,
measured as the number of contracts traded per day. Gender is 1 for female and zero for male. Experience (years) and income (dollars) and
overnight (one for holding overnight positions, zero for daytrader) are additional control variables.

The number of A and B signals are given in the first row and first column, respectively. The pairs of numbers within an (a,b) pair represent the
Bayesian posterior (upper number) and the proportion of Bayesian decisions (lower number and in italics). Those in bold type are the counting
heuristic sequences. Thus (2,1) has a posterior probability of 42% that the urn is A (diff=0.08). Forty-six percent made the Bayesian decision in this
case. By contrast the (2,0) sequence (in which diff=0.09) has a posterior probability of 0.59, and 87% of those decisions were Bayesian.

The proportion of Bayesian decisions both when a cascade is possible and when one is not for both counting rule
and non-counting rule sequences in the asymmetric treatments are provided in the table. When there is no
potential cascade the proportion of Bayesian decisions (.74) is the proportion in which one follows the private
signal. When there is a potential cascade (1-.31=.69) is the proportion of decisions that follow the private signal.

Calculations are for the first three choices of the symmetric gain treatment for market professionals (M) and college students (C), with the
choice probability and the posterior probability adjusted for decision error. For comparison, the probabilities assuming a perfect Bayesian
equilibrium (Bayes) and the actual decisions are also presented. Due to the symmetry of the treatment, the history and signal combination
also represents its complement. For example the row reporting history and signal “ABa” also includes the “BAb” sequences.




                                                                    48
1
    Herding is a more general phenomenon than an informational cascade though both result in

behavioral conformity. The homogeneity of a herd may arise through other than informational

means such as payoff externalities, preferences for conformity, or sanctions. A comprehensive

taxonomy of herd behavior is developed by Hirshleifer and Teoh (2003) and Smith and Sorenson

(2000). Devenow and Welch (1996) and Bikhchandani and Sharma (2000) also discuss

alternative sources of herd behavior and review the extant literature.
2
    It has been argued, also, that information cascades can explain a large variety of social

behaviors such as fashion, customs, and rapid changes in political organization. Anderson

(1994), Banerjee (1992), Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992, 1998), and Welch (1992)

discuss a variety of interesting examples. A number of historical anecdotes can be found in

MacKay (1980) and Garber (2000).
3
    Fama (1998) discusses the interpretation of empirical results as evidence of irrational behavior.
4
    Combined with the insights gained from the models of Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998),

Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrhamanyam (2001), and from Hirshleifer (2001), our results indicate

that the ability of the strength and weight of the evidence to have a differential impact on asset

pricing is a potentially powerful phenomenon.
5
    As we discus below, our experimental environment makes use of a binary signal, binary state,

and fixed payoff regardless of the history of announcements. Avery and Zemsky (1998), Lee

(1998), Chari and Kehoe (2004), and Cipriani and Guarino (2005a) explore more general settings

in which variable pricing reduces but does not eliminate the potential for information cascades.

Chamley (2004) provides a comprehensive review of rational herding models.
6
    The ability of humans to reason in a Bayesian manner seems to depend on how information is

presented. Studies that present base rates as percentages often show that we are poor “intuitive

statisticians” (Tversky and Kahneman (1974)).            Decisions tend to be more consistent with

Bayesian rationality when individuals experience probability distributions through repeated

exposure (see Gigerenzer and Murray (1987)). Our experiment is consistent with protocols that

have been shown to give Bayesian decision making its best chance.

                                          $W
7
    In the gain treatments, π A − π B =      after an initial a signal, where $W is the win amount.
                                           3

Treatments over gains and losses yield identical predictions (i.e., expected losses are minimized

by picking the most probable urn).
8
    A second A announcement could arise in this setting if the second subject receives a b signal.

We consider an announcement of A given the history Ab to be inconsistent with Bayesian

rationality, although alternative interpretations are possible. Since the posterior probability is 0.5

in this case, a tie-breaking rule must be invoked. We follow Anderson and Holt (1997) in

assuming that individuals who are indifferent announce their own signal. This is sensible if

individuals recognize the possibility of decision error in previous announcements. Alternative

tie-breaking rules include random choice as in BHW (1992) and a “nonconfident” rule in which

one ignores one’s own information (Koessler and Zieglemeyer (2000)). In our treatments the

Anderson and Holt rule is followed 81% of the time, with most of the deviations occurring in the

early rounds of play.
9
    Our experimental instructions are available upon request. Note that Anderson and Holt (1997)

find that cascades form in roughly 70 percent of the rounds in which they are possible.




                                                    50
Deviations from Bayesian cascade formation occur most often when a simple counting rule gives

a different indication of the underlying state. Extensions to the experimental literature introduce

relevant complications to the cascade process that include costly information, endogenous

sequencing of choice order, collective decision making, expanded signal spaces, and payoff

externalities (Celen and Kariv (2004, 2005), Cipriani and Guarino (2005b); Drehmann,

Oechssler, and Roider (2005), Huck and Oechssler (2000), Hung and Plott (2001), Kubler and

Weizsacker (2004), Noth and Weber (2003), Sgroi (2003), Willinger and Ziegelmeyer (1998)).
10
     CBOT officials suggest that designing a 30-minute game with an expected average payout of

approximately $30 is more than a reasonable approximation of an average trader’s earnings for

an equivalent amount of time on the floor. In our experiments the median earnings for the market

professionals are slightly in excess of this amount and therefore likely to be salient.
11
     To ensure that subjects depart with positive money balances we have both subject pools

participate in other unrelated games during the experimental session.
12
     In the discussion that follows we use the term “Bayesian decision” to mean that the decision is

consistent with the predictions of perfect Bayesian equilibrium.
13
     Thirteen of the 14 who are perfectly consistent with Bayesian rationality are in the symmetric

urn treatment. One market professional is perfectly Bayesian in the asymmetric setting.
14
     We will see below that there are differences between the symmetric and asymmetric

treatments even after controlling for the counting rule sequences. As a result, we do not pool the

symmetric results in this table.




                                                  51
15
     Anderson and Holt (1997) find that the rate of Bayesian behavior in the noncounting rule

sequences is 50%, comparable to our student population rate of 49% and close to the pooled rate

of 44%.
16
     There are 10 session-level observations for each subject pool as summarized in Table II.
17
     The posterior, and thus the diff variable, remains constant once a cascade has formed, unless a

decision breaking the cascade is observed.
18
     The alternative approach of computing the marginal effects for each observation and taking the

means yields very similar results. Results are also robust to the inclusion of a time trend for

round or time dummies (categorical time dummy variables for each round of play). We discuss

our evidence of learning further, below.
19
      A Chow test rejects the null hypothesis of no differences across the subject pools at the p<

0.01 level.
20
     We test several specifications of the model of Bayesian decision making for learning and find

no such effect.
21
     We estimated six models that included variables designed to measure the quality of previous

agent’s decision-making on cascade formation. In addition to the three that used other Bayes

variables (othb_min, othb_max, and othb_mean) we considered whether individuals who had

previously revealed their private signal were followed when cascades were possible. These

other_reveal models also tested the min, max, and mean operators. In all six cases market

professionals followed those with higher levels of reliability into cascades. Among the students,

in five of six cases there was no significant effect of signal quality, with othb_min the sole

exception as reported in Table VI, Panel 6b.

     Support for the significant differences between subject pools found in the parametric results is

also found in nonparametric (Mann-Whitney) tests.
23
     Due to the small number of sessions at the individual treatment level, p-values for the Mann-

Whitney test are reported for observations aggregated at the individual participant level.
24
     We use a Wilcoxon matched pairs test with the variable of interest equal to the proportion of

Bayesian decisions aggregated at the session level. The diff variable for the counting rule

sequences is in the range from 0.0 to 0.2, and all other sequences with diff variables in this range

are included for the paired comparison. Using data from the 12 asymmetric sessions we find that

the counting rule sequences reflect less Bayesian decision making despite roughly equivalent diff

scores at p<.01.
25
     There is a long and important debate on the relevance of cascade models for financial markets

(Vives (1996)). Avery and Zemsky (1998) show that the introduction of variable prices to the

BHW model can eliminate informational cascades (herding in their terminology) under certain

conditions. Lee (1998), Chari and Kehoe (2004) and Cipriani and Guarino (2005a) demonstrate

the potential for informational cascades in the variable price setting by introducing transaction

costs, endogenous timing, and preference heterogeneity.
26
     One mechanism through which cascades might arise is, in the jargon of the trading floor, when

local traders “lean on” large orders by trying to enter the market on the same side and at the same

price. Locals who trade alongside an institutional order accumulate a position knowing that they

can transact with the institution and avoid a loss. The decision process associated with deciding

to trade with the institution has the character of a fixed price cascade. In the context of option

markets Berkman (1996) discusses how market makers supply liquidity in the presence of large




                                                  53
fixed price orders. Chamley and Gale (1994) introduce endogenous timing in a cascade model

that predicts the least informed would trade later, and potentially face adverse prices.
27
     Drehmann, Oechssler, and Roider (2005) test experimentally a version of the Avery and

Zemsky (1998) model that omits event and composition uncertainty and find behavior fairly

consistent with its predictions, though subject to decision error and contrarian behavior.

The proportion of Bayesian decisions for every realized posterior probability is presented as a

data point. The choice histories in which the counting rule and Bayesian posterior yield

different predictions are presented as dark squares. All other sequences are presented as black

diamonds. Note that the sequences in which Bayesian behavior and the counting rule
