1         Introduction
The traditional economic paradigm assumes that individuals are “rational,” meaning they
make optimal decisions based on the information available to them. In the field of asset-
pricing, the implications derived from this view, described in papers by Grossman and
Stiglitz (1980) and others, are that prices reflect all available information, so that op-
portunities to earn extraordinary returns arise only from private information. According
to this view, investors without special information, no matter how savvy they may be,
cannot improve on the performance of index portfolios.1
        The recent behavioral finance literature oﬀers an alternative paradigm in which indi-
viduals make systematic mistakes in the way that they process information. In this paper,
we consider one of these biases, that of overconfidence. There are a number of reasons
why we concentrate on this particular bias: first, it is perhaps the best established of
these biases. Second, we view it as a bias that is likely to manifest itself in the sort of
analysis that is necessary in security valuation. Finally, we argue that overconfidence is a
trait that is likely to arise through evolutionary selection. We believe this last argument is
extremely important. Behavioral biases that distort decisions with no oﬀsetting benefits
are likely to be eliminated by natural selection. Hence, we should be considerably more
skeptical about the existence of biases that cannot be explained in this way.
        Although many economists are sympathetic to the view that behavioral biases play
a role in economic decisions, they generally believe that irrational investors have only a
minor eﬀect on prices. The standard argument is that, in competing to take advantage
of the profit opportunities created by the trades of irrational investors, rational investors
will push prices to a level where the profit opportunities virtually disappear. Thus, in the
end, prices will be determined in the market “as if” all investors are rational.
        However, there is now considerable evidence at odds with this “as if” hypothesis.
Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) summarize this evidence and argue that,
    1
    Roberts (1967) and Fama (1970) lay out the definitions of weak, semi-strong, and strong-form eﬃ-
ciency. There is considerable evidence that is at odds with the strong-form eﬃcient markets hypothesis
that investors with private information cannot make extraordinary profits. When we refer to traditional
market-eﬃciency, we mean semi-strong form eﬃciency.


                                                  1
taken as a whole, the data is more consistent with an overconfidence model than a standard
rational model. The empirical evidence presented in this paper provides still more evidence
inconsistent with the “as if” proposition. In particular, we find that a portfolio strategy
suggested by the overconfidence theory consistently realized excess returns in the 1963
to 1997 period. This long-short (zero cost) portfolio strategy, which is based on market
capitalization, momentum, and book-to-market ratios, has a Sharpe ratio that is more
than three times as high as that of the market and realizes positive returns in virtually
every year.
       The returns from this strategy cannot be explained by traditional measures of risk;
indeed, the betas of the strategies are negative. Also the returns cannot be explained
by the popular Fama and French (1993) three-factor model.2 Moreover, they cannot be
explained by less traditional risk factors that measure the degree to which these portfolios
contribute to the tracking error of portfolio managers who are evaluated relative to a value-
weighted index like the S&P 500. In addition, we argue that it is unlikely that the strong
performance of these strategies were spuriously uncovered as a result of the data mining
eﬀorts of the hundreds of academics and practitioners who have analyzed this data.
       Although this evidence indicates that overconfident investors systematically influence
market prices, it does not necessarily imply that the past 30 years oﬀered easy profit
opportunities to quantitative investors who were not inflicted with behavioral biases. As
we will later argue, anticipating and exploiting apparent profit opportunities would have
required an implausible level of knowledge about the rationality and trading strategies of
other investors. In reality, most investors will have incomplete knowledge of the tastes,
strategies, and cognitive limitations of other investors and, like academics, can only im-
perfectly infer these from the past pattern of returns.
       To account for the fact that investors must learn about pricing anomalies from his-
torical prices we introduce a somewhat weaker concept of market eﬃciency that we call
   2
    While we do not wish to rule out the possiblity that some model with full rationality might explain the
returns of this strategy, we note that, given the high Sharpe-ratio of the portfolio, such a model would
require investors with very peculiar preferences, based on the arguments of Hansen and Jagannathan
(1991).



                                                    2
adaptive-eﬃciency. In a market that is adaptive-eﬃcient, pricing anomalies may be ob-
served in historical data. However, if investors do indeed learn from the past price history,
these anomalies will not persist for too long. To test for adaptive eﬃciency we examine
the return pattern of a meta-strategy that mechanically picks strategies based on the
performance in the previous 10 years. As we show, this meta-strategy has continued to
earn consistent profits, rejecting our notion of adaptive-eﬃciency.



2     Behavioral Finance
The psychology literature describes a myriad of behavioral biases that can potentially
explain almost any pricing anomaly one might imagine. However, we think the most
prominent anomalies can be explained by overconfidence, which is consistent with anec-
dotal evidence as well as experimental evidence.
    In this section, we summarize the experimental evidence on overconfidence and then
discuss why individuals are likely to have evolved in ways that make them overconfi-
dent. In our view, presenting an evolutionary rationale for overconfidence is extremely
important. We would expect a trait like overconfidence to be eliminated through natural
selection if it simply resulted in irrational decisions. However, since overconfidence en-
hances genetic survival in other ways, it makes the experimental evidence demonstrating
overconfidence that much more convincing.
    This section also explains why the previously mentioned book-to-market and momen-
tum eﬀects might arise because of overconfidence and suggests a more refined trading
strategy that might better exploit this overconfidence bias. This refinement is based on
the idea that the momentum eﬀect is likely to be more important for growth stocks than
value stocks, which is the motivation for the empirical analysis in Section 3.


2.1    Overconfidence

Many economists would agree that their notion of rationality should not be taken too
literally. First, this notion implicitly assumes that individuals have an unlimited ability

                                             3
to both observe and process information. In reality, of course, individuals have limited
processing ability, and hence use vague, ad hoc rules to translate the information they
receive into estimates of cash flows and firm valuations.3 For example, investors can’t
really incorporate the news about the antitrust proceedings against Microsoft into concrete
views about the future competitiveness of the industry and how this in turn will aﬀect
Microsoft’s future cash flows. Instead, they must do much of their analysis based on
“hunches” or “feelings,” which can easily be influenced by behavioral biases.
       One of the most strongly documented behavioral biases is overconfidence. In their
summary of the microfoundations of behavioral finance, DeBondt and Thaler (1995) state
that “perhaps the most robust finding in the psychology of judgment is that people are
overconfident.” Psychologists, physicians and nurses, engineers, attorneys, negotiators,
entrepreneurs, managers, investment bankers, and market professionals such as security
analysts and economic forecasters all exhibit overconfidence.4 Moreover, some evidence
suggests that experts tend to be more overconfident than relatively inexperienced indi-
viduals (Griﬃn and Tversky (1992)).
       Experimental evidence also suggests that the degree to which individuals are over-
confident depends on the situation. Overconfidence is generally stronger for more diﬀuse
tasks for which feedback is slow (e.g., making diagnoses of illnesses), as opposed to more
mechanical tasks (e.g., solving arithmetic problems) which provide immediate and con-
clusive outcome feedback, such as weather forecasting or horse-racing handicapping, (see,
e.g., Einhorn (1980)).
       While there are clearly disadvantages associated with overconfidence, there are oﬀ-
setting benefits that suggest that, overall, overconfidence might increase the chances of
individuals passing on their genes. The evolutionary theories suggest that those individu-
als who appear to be the strongest and the smartest, i.e. are more likely to attract mates
and reproduce.5
   3
      This is closely related to some of the ideas of Herbert A. Simon. See, for example, Simon (1982).
   4
      See Odean (1998b) for a good summary of empirical research on overconfidence.
    5
      In the biology literature, Trivers (1985, 1991) provides arguments along these lines. In the economics
literature, Waldman (1994) and Hirshleifer (1999) shows how overconfidence among males can be an
evolutionarily stable strategy.


                                                     4
       For similar reasons, appearing to be confident might enhance shorter-term economic
survival. Even in the money management business where results are easy to measure and
reward, we expect that holding past investment performance equal, portfolio managers
who appear more confident will more successfully attract clients. The ability to act
as though one is smart and strong is therefore a survival tendency, which provides a
comparative advantage to individuals with inflated opinions of themselves.6,7
       An important ingredient in this theory is that individuals can better fool others about
their abilities if they can first fool themselves. In other words, self-confident individuals
will appear to be more competent than individuals who are insecure about their own
abilities. As a result, individuals who successfully filter information in ways that add
to their self-confidence may, in theory, be more successful than individuals who always
interpret information rationally.


2.2       Rational Behavior

Before we discuss how overconfidence biases decision making, it is useful to first describe
what economists mean by rational decision making. When a rational investor values a
stock, like Microsoft, he or she must combine information from a number of diﬀerent
sources. They must, for example, combine new information with existing information,
and information they collect on their own with information provided by others, like a
firm’s management and accountants. Rational investors combine these diﬀerent sources
of information using what is known as Bayes’ rule, which specifies that the weights placed
on the diﬀerent pieces of information should be proportional to their respective precisions.
   6
     Of course, there is a cost associated with having an opinion of oneself that is too inflated, which
suggests that there is an optimal level of overconfidence. Hirshleifer (1999) presents an equilibrium
model that formalizes the tradeoﬀ between the benefits and costs of overconfidence.
   7
     Another argument as to why overconfident traders will not influence prices is that their irrationality
will cause them to lose money to rationals, and without much wealth they will not have much influence
on market prices. However, agents who are more confident may trade more aggressively and accumulate
wealth more quickly (De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1991)). Also, attribution bias might
lead successful traders to be more overconfident (Gervais and Odean (1998)). Finally, feedback will be
very noisy; informed agents make money because they have valuable information — they lose money
because they trade too aggressively. As long as they are not too overconfident they will still make money
(Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998).



                                                    5
       Of course, an investor’s ability to process information is limited. As a result, in-
vestors will probably use ad-hoc rules to combine their diﬀerent sources of information,
and will therefore undoubtedly make “mistakes” in this process. However, these ad-hoc
rules should on average provide a good approximation to Bayesian analysis if there is no
systematic bias in the way that investors make mistakes. In contrast, as we discuss in
the next section, an overconfident investor makes systematic mistakes that bias the values
they place on stocks.


2.3       How Overconfidence Biases Decisions

Overconfidence has both a direct and an indirect eﬀect on how individuals process infor-
mation. The direct eﬀect, discussed in Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998),
is simply that individuals place too much weight on information they collect themselves
since they tend to overestimate the precision of that information. This direct overconfi-
dence eﬀect can explain the book-to-market eﬀect, since overconfident investors tend to
underweight information provided by accountants.8 However, as shown in Daniel, Hirsh-
leifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), the direct eﬀect of overconfidence cannot explain the
momentum eﬀect.
       The indirect eﬀect of overconfidence arises because individuals filter information and
bias their behavior in ways that allow them to maintain their confidence. Psychologists
have developed theories of what they call cognitive dissonance, attribution bias and con-
servatism bias to describe this type of behavior. In summary, they tend to ignore, or
at least underweight, information that one way or another lowers their self-esteem. For
example, investors may be reluctant to sell their losers since this requires that they in
some sense admit to making a mistake (see Odean (1998a)), which could lead to a loss
in confidence which would have other deleterious consequences. For similar reasons, in-
vestors may systematically overweight information that tends to support earlier decisions
and to filter out information that suggests that earlier decisions were a mistake.
   8
     Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) show that this argument also provides an explanation
for evidence that suggests that investors underreact to corporate disclosures and decisions



                                                  6
       Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) and Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny
(1998) discuss how these kinds of biases can explain the momentum eﬀect. Interestingly,
these models illustrate how overconfidence can generate both overreaction and underreac-
tion and how both can be consistent with the momentum eﬀect that we observe.9 Specif-
ically, Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) describe a conservatism bias that results in
investors overweighting their prior beliefs and thereby underreacting to new information.10
In Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998) investors first estimate an investment’s
value and then estimate the precision of their valuation. Because of attribution bias,
they overweight information that confirms their original estimate, and underweight in-
formation inconsistent with their views for some time. As a result, their estimate of the
precision of their valuation increases over time, leading to momentum as a sort of “delayed
overreaction.”11
       Overconfidence is not likely to equally bias the pricing of all securities. As we men-
tioned in the last subsection, experimental evidence suggests that overconfidence is likely
to influence the judgment of investors relatively more when they are analyzing relatively
vague, subjective information. The subjectivity of the information used to value invest-
ments is likely to vary cross-sectionally. Consider, for example, a firm such as a REIT
with stable existing operations and few growth options. The information used to value
such a firm is likely to be fairly concrete, and thus the pricing bias resulting from investor
overconfidence should be minimal. In contrast, to value a firm like Amazon.com or Mi-
crosoft, whose values are likely to be much more dependent on future growth options and
   9
     Hong and Stein (1999) develop a diﬀerent model in which the interaction of bounded-rationality
agents (“newswatchers” and “momentum traders”) and slow diﬀusion of information generates initial
underreaction and subsequent overreaction.
  10
     Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998) also discuss experimental evidence of what is known as a repre-
sentativeness bias, which they argue can exist when investors observe larger amounts of new information.
For example, if a value firm experiences three consecutive earnings increases, investors may overreact, re-
classifying the former value firm as a growth firm. In other words, because of conservatism bias, investors
overreact to the initial earnings increase, but because of their representativeness bias, they overreact to
later earnings increases. We can explain conservatism bias within the context of evolutionary theories of
overconfidence; however, we are unaware of how representativeness bias can be fit within this framework.
  11
     An interesting behavioral study demonstrating biases consistent with this phenomenon is Lord, Ross,
and Lepper (1979), who find that individuals’ views become more polarized as they process more (unbi-
ased) information.



                                                    7
intangible assets, one relies on much more subjective information. For these type of firms
the overconfidence-related mispricing eﬀects should be stronger
       To develop a portfolio strategy based on this hypothesis, we need some proxy for the
concreteness of the information used in performing a valuation. One measure of this will
be the fraction of a firm’s value which is in growth options, and as a measure of this we
can use a firm’s book-to-market ratio. To the extent that lower book-to-market firms have
more growth options, they should exhibit stronger overconfidence eﬀects. In particular,
this means that momentum eﬀects should be stronger for growth stocks.12 This is the
motivation for the empirical work that follows.



3        Empirical Evidence
As we discussed in the previous section, if overconfidence aﬀects stock prices, then we
expect to observe a relation between stock returns and both the book-to-market ratio and
momentum. Although, previous research has documented that stock returns are indeed
related to these characteristics, we will be considering this evidence in more detail in this
section.
       We start our analysis by examining the performance of 125 size, book-to-market and
momentum sorted portfolios. Our construction of these portfolios is close to that of
Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997), with some diﬀerences; details are given
in the Appendix. In summary, to form these 125 portfolios we group the universe of listed
common stocks from the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ into three quintile groupings based
on market capitalization, book-to-market ratio and prior-year return.13 The 5x5x5 sorting
  12
     Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1999) also note that their overconfidence theory predicts
that BM ratios should better forecast risk-adjusted returns among firms that are hard to value (e.g., R&D-
intensive firms comprised largely of intangible assets); A low book/market ratio is itself an indicator of
high intangible assets, but can also be low for other reasons such as a risk premium or market misvaluation.
Thus, conditioning on other intangible measures provides a test of how intangible measures aﬀect the
misvaluation-induced relation between fundamental-price ratios and future returns. So far as we know,
this is an as-yet untested implication.
  13
     The common stocks in our portfolios must also meet certain data requirements, discussed in the
appendix. Also we exclude negative book-equity firms




                                                     8
of the portfolios gives a total of 125 passive portfolios.14 To minimize transaction costs,
each of these portfolios is value-weighted, and the portfolios are rebalanced once per year.
    Table 1, Panel A presents the average returns of 25 size/book-to-market sorted portfo-
lios over the 1963:07-1997:12 period. These 25 portfolios are formed by equally weighting
the five corresponding size-sorted portfolios. So, for example, the upper-left return in
this panel is the average return of a portfolio which equally weights the low book-to-
market/low momentum portfolios constructed for the five size quintiles.
    The evidence in this panel indicates that there is an independent book-to-market and
momentum eﬀect.15 Consistent with the predictions of the overconfidence model, the
momentum eﬀect is much stronger for low book-to-market stocks.16 Panel B of Table
1 examines similar strategies that exclude the largest and smallest quintile stocks. The
largest stocks are presumably the most eﬃciently priced, so any behavioral eﬀects might
become more apparent when these stocks are excluded from the sample. The rationale
for excluding the smallest stocks is that these have the least reliable prices, are the least
liquid, and are likely to be the most diﬃcult to short.
    Panels C and D of Table 1 show the average diﬀerence in the returns of the vari-
ous BM/momentum portfolios and the return of the CRSP value-weighted index (which
tracks the S&P 500 closely). These panels reveal that the high-BM/high-momentum port-
folio dramatically outperforms the value-weighted index, and the low-BM/low-momentum
portfolio underperforms the value-weighted index by a similar amount.
  14
     We use NYSE-based breakpoints to determine the size quintile breakpoints, and we value-weight the
stocks within each of the 125 passive portfolios to avoid biases in computed returns from rebalancing and
to avoid placing too much weight on extremely small stocks.
  15
     Other studies have investigated the interaction of the momentum eﬀect and other characteristics:
Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996) look at price momentum and earnings momentum; Hong, Lim,
and Stein (1999) look at analyst coverage and momentum, and Lee and Swaminathan (1999) investigate
momentum and trading volume.
  16
     These results are also consistent with those previously presented by Asness (1997) in this Journal.
However, there are some diﬀerences between our table and his Table 4. Specifically, his low-momentum,
low-book-to-market (LL) portfolio has a considerably lower return that our corresponding portfolio. The
reason for this is that in picking out the set of stocks with the lowest book-to-market and past return,
one also selects a set of very low market value securities. Since our portfolios are first sorted on size, our
average LL firm is considerably larger, and the return of our LL portfolio is not as low.

              3.1     The time-series behavior of the HH-LL portfolio

              This section provides an in depth analysis of the returns of the long-short strategy
              which buys the High-BM, High-momentum (HH) portfolio, and sell the Low-BM, Low-
              momentum (LL) portfolio. The mean returns and t-statistics for these HH-LL portfolios
              are given in the lower right corners of Panels A and B. In Figure 1 we plot the annual
              returns to the HH-LL strategy.
                   The performance of this portfolio is striking. It generated profits in 31 out of the 34
              years in our sample period and realized an average profit of 1.04%/month (and 12.64%/year).
              A t-statistic testing whether this value is diﬀerent from zero is 5.66. Based on the t-
              statistic, the one-tailed p-value testing whether the average return of this portfolio is
              greater than zero is 1 − (1.4 × 10−8 ). Moreover, the (monthly) CAPM beta of this portfo-
              lio is -0.258 (α =1.17%/month, with a t = 6.62); thus the portfolio even provides insurance
              against market fluctuations.

3.2    Data Mining

Over the past 20 years, financial economists and investors have spent considerable time
searching for investment strategies that yield abnormal returns. With so much searching,
it is likely, purely by chance, that someone will uncover what looks to be incredible oppor-
tunities. Thus, apparent profit opportunities, uncovered in this way, must be interpreted
skeptically, and the statistical tests of significance for the profitability of the strategies
must be corrected for the data mining bias.
   There are several ways of addressing the data-mining question. Perhaps the most
robust is to examine how the strategies perform in a sample that is independent of the
sample in which the strategies were originally investigated. This has been done extensively
for size, book to market, and momentum strategies, but has not been done for strategies
that combine the three characteristics as we do here. Fama and French (1998) show that
the book to market eﬀect is strong internationally, and Davis, Fama, and French (1999)
show that the book-to-market eﬀect is even stronger in the 1929-63 period than in the
post-1963 period originally studied. Rouwenhorst (1998) shows that the momentum eﬀect
is present in European stock markets, and Jegadeesh and Titman (1999) show that the
eﬀect is equally as strong in the 1990s as in the pre-1990 period originally studied.
   We will take a somewhat diﬀerent approach and address the data-mining question
by adjusting the significance levels of the test statistics to account for the amount of
searching that was done to uncover the strategy. To do this we apply the Bonferroni
inequality which states that the the p-value which accounts for the fact that we have
searched over N strategies is no greater than N × p∗ , where p∗ , is the p-value obtained
from a t-statistic on the significance of the return without correcting for the searching.
   Based on the Bonferroni inequality, and the p-value cited earlier, we can say that
even if researchers considered over one million separate strategies, an upper bound on the
p-value for the best strategy would be 1.4 × 10−2 , or 1.4%, meaning that, if the mean
return of all strategies were truly zero, even after searching over one million of them, the
probability of getting a t-statistic this high would be still be very low.
   However, the p-value for the t-statistic assumes that returns are normally distributed.

                                             12
It is possible that this statistic is biased because the return distribution is ”fat-tailed.”
Hence, we also used a bootstrap method to construct a p-value for this test. To implement
the bootstrap, for each iteration we redraw 414 monthly returns (the length of our original
time series) from the set of monthly HH-LL portfolio returns, with replacement. Assuming
that the empirical distribution represents the true distribution of returns, and assuming
that returns are serially uncorrelated, the fraction of the iterations that are less than zero
gives us likelihood that we would ever see an average return over 414 months which was
less than zero. We found that with 100,000 bootstrap iterations, the total return of the
bootstrapped portfolio was never less than or equal to zero, and in less than 1% of the
iterations was the average returns less than 0.5%/month.
       As one additional robustness check, we also perform a block-bootstrap of the returns
(see Hall (1985)). While standard bootstrap methods are valid only for independent data,
block bootstrap methods allow for serial correlation up to a certain number of lags. We
performed block bootstraps with block lengths of 12, 24, 36, and 48 months with nearly
identical results.17


3.3       Could Mutual Funds Have Enhanced their Performance?

The previous subsections suggest that the returns of the HH-LL portfolio is negatively
correlated with the CRSP value-weighted index, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis
that the returns represent compensation for covariation with the market portfolio. How-
ever, it is possible that institutions hold portfolios that are exposed to an element of risk
that is not captured by the CRSP value-weighted index, and that the HH-LL portfolio
exacerbates the institutions’ exposure to that risk.
       To explore this possibility we examine the returns of mutual funds, which we think
are representative of other institutions. Our analysis demonstrates that the return stan-
dard deviation of these portfolios would not have increased appreciably if they had tilted
  17
    We again found that in none of the 100,000 iterations was the total return of the bootstrapped
portfolio was less than or equal to zero, and in less than 1% of the iterations was the average returns less
than 0.5%/month.




                                                    13
their portfolios towards the HH-LL portfolio. Indeed, a tilt towards the HH-LL portfolio
would have substantially increased the Sharpe-ratios of the mutual funds.18 Moreover,
the addition of the HH-LL portfolio would have allowed the mutual funds to increase the
expected returns of their portfolios without increasing their tracking error relative to the
value-weighted index.
       We first examine the marginal eﬀect of adding a small amount of the HH-LL portfolio
to two composite mutual fund portfolios which include all growth and all income mutual
funds that are available on the CRSP mutual fund data base compiled by Carhart (1997).
By regressing the return of our HH-LL portfolio on the mutual fund returns net of the
risk-free rate, we are able to discern whether the mutual funds could have achieved higher
Sharpe ratios by tilting their portfolios towards our strategy. If we find that the alphas
from this regression are positive, then the funds could have increased their Sharpe ratios
by tilting towards the HH-LL portfolio.19
       We also consider the fact that maximizing Sharpe ratios may not have been the primary
objective of these funds. Rather, the relevant risk of the funds may instead be tracking
error, i.e., the risk of underperforming the benchmark. To address this issue, we run a
similar regression, except now, the independent variable is the mutual fund return minus
the CRSP value-weighted index return.20
       The results of these tests are reported in Table 2. Panel A presents a standard CAPM-
like regression. The R2 s indicate that both sets of mutual-fund returns are well diversified,
and the intercepts (αs) indicate that, on average, their performance is close to what is
predicted by the CAPM. The results in Panel B indicate that the Sharpe ratio of the
average mutual fund could have been greatly enhanced by adding the HH-LL portfolio.
  18
     These tests are equivalent to tests of whether the average growth or income mutual fund is mean-
variance eﬃcient. The reported improvements in their Sharpe ratios ignore the possibility that mutual
funds may not wish to hold mean-variance eﬃcient portfolios.
  19
     The alpha will be zero for all portfolios if the mutual-fund is a mean-variance-eﬃcient portfolio. If
the mutual-fund is not mean-variance-eﬃcient, then its Sharpe ratio can be increased through tilting
towards positive alpha assets and away from negative alpha assets.
  20
     We are assuming that these fund managers believe that they will maximize the ratio of expected
return to standard deviation or tracking error by holding growth or income portfolio. These tests would
need to be altered if one wanted to examine funds that wish to maximize the Sharpe-ratio conditional on
holding stocks in a particular asset class.

This table presents the results of a number of regressions of aggregate mutual fund and zero-cost ar-
bitrage portfolio returns. Each row gives the results of a diﬀerent regression. For each regression, the
column headed LHS gives the dependent (Left-Hand Side) variable, and the column headed RHS gives
the independent (Right-Hand Side) variable. RIN denotes the aggregate income-fund return, RGR the
aggregate growth-fund return, RV W the return on the CRSP value-weighted index of all US common
stocks, and Rf the risk-free return over the month (from Ibbotson). α is the regression intercept term, β
the regression coeﬃcient, and R2 the regression R2 (in percent). All return series are monthly in percent
per month, over the period 1963:07-1997:12. t-statistics are in parentheses.

Moreover, Panel C of Table 2 indicates that the average fund could have enhanced its
return without increasing its tracking error. The t-statistics on all of the intercepts in
Panels B and C are highly significant.
    The regression results presented in Table 2 show that by adding a small amount of the
HH-LL portfolio, mutual funds could have increased their Sharpe ratios. In Table 3, we
show exactly how much the Sharpe-ratios of the average growth mutual fund would have
improved had they tilted their portfolios toward the HH-LL portfolio by various amounts.
This table shows that, with suﬃcient tilting toward the HH-LL portfolio, the ex-post
Sharpe ratio would have tripled. In addition, the ratio of the return premium relative to

We calculate the return for a portfolio which consists of a $1 investment in the average growth mutual
fund from the CRSP mutual fund database, a $x investment in the HH portfolio, where x is the number
given in column 1 of the Table, and an oﬀsetting $x short position in the LL portfolio.
This table presents a number of risk and return measures for this portfolio: the average portfolio return
(r̄); the annualized -return standard deviation (σ(r−rf )); the tracking error or standard deviation of the
portfolio return net of the VW market return (σ(r − rm )); the Sharpe-ratio (r−rf /σ(r − rf )); and the
ratio of return in excess of the market to the tracking error (r−rm /σ(r−rm )), all in annualized form. All
results are for the period 1963:07-1997:12.

the market tracking error would have increased about eight times.21 For comparison, the
Sharpe-ratio of the VW index over this period was 0.406. Of course, achieving the largest
Sharpe-ratio in the table would probably have required short positions in a number of
the securities in the LL portfolio, and hence was probably not feasible for most mutual
funds. However, Table 3 shows that even relatively minor tilting would have produced
impressive Sharpe-ratio increases.



4        Is The Stock Market Adaptive-Eﬃcient?
The results in the previous section indicate that with the benefit of perfect hindsight a
mutual fund investor could have earned significantly higher returns with little apparent
additional risk by employing the HH-LL strategy. Based on this we have asserted that the
evidence is inconsistent with our traditional view of eﬃcient markets. Of course in reality,
investors did not have the benefit of perfect hindsight, so we are somewhat premature in
concluding that rational investors should have been able to earn abnormal returns.
       In this section we ask whether a rational investor, without the benefit of perfect hind-
sight, would have been able to profit from the behavioral biases of his or her less rational
counterparts. One could argue that with a suﬃcient understanding of investor overcon-
fidence and its eﬀect on asset prices, an investor could have determined that investing
in a portfolio that resembled our HH-LL portfolio would generate abnormal returns.22
However, as we argued earlier, this is probably not realistic. To have the knowledge to
implement such a strategy would have required information about the amount of money
being managed by overconfident investors as well as the investment strategies of other
rational investors. It is more realistic to assume that to benefit from the overconfidence
of other investors, a rational investor would first need to learn about the tastes and ra-
  21
     Table 3 reports results only for the average growth portfolio. The Sharpe ratio of the average income
portfolio is 0.405; The maximized SR in combination with the HH-LL is 1.178, which occurs with $1.55
investment in the HH portfolio per dollar invested in the mutual-fund holdings.
  22
     There should be considerable variation in the ability of investors to carry out this sort of reasoning.
We would expect that some investors would be able to learn about investor irrationality and mispricing
sooner than others, and would be able to earn rents as a result.



                                                    17
tionality of other investors by observing the historical pattern of stock returns.
       To address these issues we consider the investment behavior of a hypothetical investor
with the sophistication and data that would be required to examine the historical pattern
of stock returns. We assume that the investor starts his trades in 1974. We use 1974 for the
starting date of this analysis partly for COMPUSTAT data availability reasons. However,
we also picked this starting date because an investor could actually have undertaken the
type of analysis we perform at this time, while 10 years earlier such an analysis would
have been extremely costly.23


4.1       A Rational Response to an Irrational World

We assume that our hypothetical investor would have tilted his portfolio towards strategies
that performed well over the previous 10 years. By doing so, he or she would benefit
from the strategy if the excess returns persisted. If the investor had aggressively tilted
toward such a strategy, then his or her profits would be quite large if the profits indeed
persisted. However, if the investor investor, without the benefits of hindsight, had tilted
very cautiously towards the strategy, then his realized profits would be fairly modest even
if the strategy earned very large abnormal returns.
       Unfortunately, we do not have a good metric for determining how much a rational
  23
     Prior to the mid-1960s, no one had the powerful computers, asset return data, or the analytical
finance tools necessary to evaluate the risk and returns of diversified characteristic-sorted portfolios like
those we analyze here. It was only in 1952 that Markowitz (1952) gave precise definitions to return and
risk, and spelled out how to think about the tradeoﬀ between them. Only in the 1960’s did the CRSP
stock data become widely available. Merton (1987) makes a similar point, noting that:

         To avoid inadvertent positing of a ‘Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court,’ empirical
         studies ... should take care to account for the evolution of institutions and information
         technologies during the sample period. It is, for example, common in tests of the weak-form
         of the Eﬃcient Markets Hypothesis to assume that real-world investors at the time of their
         portfolio decisions had access to the complete prior history of all stock returns. When,
         however, investors’ decisions were made, the price data may not have been in reasonably-
         accessible form and the computational technology necessary to analyze all these data may
         not even have been invented. In such cases, the classification of all prior price data as part
         of the publicly available information set may introduce an important bias against the null
         hypothesis.




                                                      18
investor, in the presence of a large number of irrational investors, should tilt his portfolio
towards strategies that performed well in the past. If the returns that the investor had
observed were drawn from a stationary distribution, it would be relatively straightforward
to calculate optimal portfolio weights.24 However, stationarity is not likely to be a good
assumption in a market that consists of both irrational investors and rational investors
that learn from past price movements. At the same time our hypothetical investor is
discovering these return patterns, other rational investors are likely to be doing the same
thing. If all of the rational investors attempt to exploit investment opportunities observed
from historical data, they may push prices to a level where the investment opportunities
disappear.
       The above discussion implies that determining how much one should tilt towards the
higher performing strategies is not at all trivial. An investor would want to have some kind
of theory of ineﬃcient markets to help him understand the extent to which the irrational
behavior causing the pricing errors is likely to persist. He would also need to have some
idea of the extent to which other rational investors uncover these same pricing anomalies
and then alter their portfolios to exploit them.25 An investor who believed that he was the
only one doing this sort of analysis would strongly tilt his portfolio towards the strategies
that performed well in the past. However, an investor who believed that ineﬃciencies
are almost immediately corrected by other active investors might choose not to tilt at all
towards the better performing strategies.26 Ironically, if most rational investors believe
that the market is very eﬃcient, they will not exploit the strategies and the pricing
anomaly is likely to persist. Alternatively, if the rational investors underestimate the
  24
     See, for example, Kandel and Stambaugh (1996) and Barberis (1999).
  25
     We are, of course, assuming here that investors can not perform firm by firm fundamental analysis to
determine whether other rational investors have pushed prices to the level where the profit opportunities
to have been eliminated. We are implicitly assuming that some of the overconfident investors have
special information about fundamentals that are not available to our rational investor who is strictly a
quantitative analyst.
  26
     For example, in a recent article in the Journal of Portfolio Management, Merton Miller (1999) states:
“If you find some mechanical rule that seems to earn above-normal returns — and with thousands of
researchers spinning through the mountains of tapes of past data, anomalies, like the currently fashionable
’momentum eﬀects,’ are bound to keep turning up — and imitators will enter and compete away those
above-normal returns exactly as in any other setting in economics. Above-normal profits, wherever they
are found, inevitably carry with them the seeds of their own decay.” (p. 99)

number and aggressiveness of other rational investors, they may as a group tilt too much
towards these strategies causing the anomaly to be reversed.


4.2       The Profits From an Adaptive Strategy

While it is diﬃcult to determine the optimal portfolio composition in this setting, we can
examine the success of a purely empirically-based portfolio strategy that, in each year
between 1974 and 1997, mechanically exploits the return anomalies observed in the prior
ten years. As our starting point we assume that the investor observes the returns of the 125
characteristic-sorted portfolios described in Section 3 and forms a zero cost portfolio based
on the characteristic-sorted returns observed over the prior ten years. Specifically, in each
month, the portfolio consists of a combination of the 125 characteristic-sorted portfolios
with weights that are proportional to their returns over the prior ten years. Implicitly,
we are assuming that the past returns provide information about future returns and that
we have no information about the covariance structure of returns.27
       If the stock market is eﬃcient in the traditional sense, then this strategy should not be
profitable. However, as we just mentioned, inferring behavioral biases from past returns
and determining the extent to which they are likely to persist is not a trivial task, so
we do not necessarily expect to observe zero initial profits from a strategy of this type.
However, in a market that we call ‘adaptive-eﬃcient,’ rational investors can learn and
trade based on information inferred from the past price history. If there exist a suﬃcient
number of these rational investors, the excess returns from mechanical strategies of this
type should quickly dissipate.
       The results in Table 4 appear to be inconsistent with this notion of adaptive eﬃcientcy.
Specifically, the profits from the adaptive strategy are quite large and show no sign of
dissipating over time. Indeed, the performance continues into the 1990’s, subsequent to
the publication of academic papers on both the momentum and book-to-market eﬀects.
  27
    Lehmann (1990) and Lo and MacKinlay (1990) previously examined this type of strategy. Again, we
are not saying that a rational investor would implement such a strategy, only that a relatively agnostic
investor would tend to tilt his or her portfolio towards this strategy.

The first three columns of Table 4 report the returns of this strategy implemented over
the 1974 to 1997 period. We report the returns both to the overall long-short strategy
(“L-S”), as well as the returns of the long side of the strategy net of the return on the
CRSP value-weighted index (“L-VW”), and the return to the short side of the strategy,
net of the CRSP VW return (“S-VW”). The last three columns report the returns of a
similar strategy that excludes stocks with capitalizations that place them in the smallest
and largest size quintiles.
    Our evidence indicates that an investor would have benefited from tilting his or her
portfolio towards either portfolio. Both are profitable in almost every year, have high
Sharpe ratios (0.932 and 0.876), and, like the HH-LL strategy, have negative CAPM βs.
In unreported regressions we show that if mutual funds had tilted their portfolios towards
this strategy, they could have increased their average rates of return without increasing
their variance or their tracking error.



5     Conclusion
The traditional notion of eﬃcient markets described in the academic finance literature is
quite strong and probably unrealistic. Essentially, the theory implies that an investor in
the 1960s and 1970s, with access to the sophisticated computers and data bases that we
now have, would not have been able to use his better technology to earn above average
returns. The theory states that market prices are set ‘as if’ investors have access to, and
can costlessly process, all available information.
    The evidence in this paper rejects this notion of eﬃcient markets in favor of an alter-
native theory which suggests that asset prices are influenced by investor overconfidence.
Portfolio strategies that might be suggested by the overconfidence theory realize extremely
high and persistent abnormal returns. The paper also discusses a somewhat weaker, and
somewhat murkier definition of eﬃciency that we call adaptive-eﬃciency. The definition
recognizes the behavioral biases of most market participants, but also assumes that there
exist other investors who can detect and profit from these behavioral biases by examining


                                             22
past price trends. Because these investors are likely to be risk averse and have limited
capital, they are not likely to immediately eliminate the pricing biases generated by their
less rational counterparts.28 However, if a significant number of investors are rational in
this sense, then the profits from their strategies should quickly dissipate.
      To assess the extent to which the market is adaptive-eﬃcient we examine a strat-
egy that mechanically purchases (or shorts) stocks with characteristics that did well (or
poorly) over the previous 10 years. We examine this strategy in the post 1974 period,
when the technology and data required to implement the strategy was clearly available. If
rational investors can learn from past price patterns, then the profits from such a strategy
should be relatively modest and should diminish over time. Our evidence indicates that
this is not the case. The strategy generates substantial profits over a long time period
and continues to generate substantial profits through the 1990s.
      There are, of course, a number of caveats that must be considered before one rejects
our weaker view of market eﬃciency. The most important caveat is that our tests were
limited to the analysis of only three characteristics, size, book-to-market and momentum.
Perhaps, by basing our tests on characteristics that we knew to be associated with returns,
we have biased our tests towards rejecting market eﬃciency. While this is probably true,
this critique does not really apply to the evidence in the 1990s, since our knowledge of
these trading strategies, if not this particular strategy, came from research on data prior
to 1990.
      However, if this paper had been written in 1980, our prime focus might have been on
the small-firm eﬀect and we might have presented an algorithm that endogenously selected
small stocks based on the prior returns of this asset class. Of course, we now know that
a small firm strategy has done poorly during the past 15 years. Perhaps this is evidence
that, after suﬃcient time and publicity, investors do learn from past price patterns, and
that the anomalies presented in this paper will not continue into the next millennium.
