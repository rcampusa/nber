                                   ABSTRACT


    This paper tests hypotheses regarding the parameters in investors'

asset demand functions. Most important is the hypothesis that federal bonds

are closer substitutes for equity than for money; it is associated with

the hypothesis of "portfolio crowding out" by federal borrowing.

     Previous regression studies of asset demand functions have not been able

to obtain precise and plausible estimates for the parameters, without the imposi-

tion of prior beliefs. The present paper uses a MLE technique that dominates

regression in that it makes full use of the constraint that the parameters are

not determined arbitrarily, but rather are determined by mean—variance optimiza-

tion on the part of the investor. The technique also dominates, on the other

hand, previous estimates of the optimal portfolio from ex post return data, in

that expected returns are not assumed to be constant over time, or to change

slowly, but rather are allowed to fluctuate freely. Thus the framework is

consistent with questions such as the effects of asudden increase in federal debt

on the expected returns of the various assets.

     Some hypotheses are tested where the answer seems clear in advance, such

as a negative effect of the supply of money on the expected rate of return on

equities. There the results of the t1E technique are much more plausible than

the regression results. In the case of greatest controversy, a point estimate

shows portfolio crowding in, not portfolio crowding out.

1. INTRODUCTION

     A number of questions regarding the behavior of portfolio—holders in

financial markets have recently moved to center stage in the national policy-

making arena. These are questions that have a long history of study but that

never have been answered satisfactorily. Chief among them is the question

whether federal government debt drives up the rate of return on capital and thus

crowds out private investment in plant and equipment. (The effect is known as

"portfolio crowding out" to distinguish it from the "transactions crowding

out" effect of government spending itself that is familiar from the textbooks.)

The framework in which to examine the question is well—established, but the

crucial parameters elude successful estimation: how close a substitute is

government debt for corporate capital in investors portfolios? This question,

and many others, depend on the parameters in investors' asset demand functions.

     One obvious way to attempt to estimate the parameters in the asset—demand

functions is simply to regress actual portfolios shares held by investors

against some measure of expected returns by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or

by some simultaneous equation method.'   Alternatively the returns could be

regressed against the actual portfolio shares to estimate the system of asset—

demand functions in Inverted form.2 In this form the system can be thought of

as a market equilibrium condition; it tells what the expected returns on the

assets must be for given supplies of them to be willingly held. For example,

consider the hypothesis that two particular assets are perfect substitutes,

that the asset demands are infinitely sensitive to the relative expected rate

of return on those assets. The hypothesis is more testable when the asset—

demand functions are estimated in inverted form. It says that supplies of
                                                                            3




the various assets have no effect on the expected relative return of the

two assets.   (In the matrix B1 below, the relevant row Consists of zeros).

     The OLS approach is tried out below. The problem with it is that the

estimates tend to be imprecise. Many of the parameter estimates are highly

implausible, and we cannot have much confidence in tests of portfolio

crowding out. It would be desirable to bring more information to bear

on the parameters in the asset—demand functions.

     The theory of portfolio optimization constitutes such additional informa-

tion. If investors maximize expected utility, then the parameters in their

asset—demand functions are not determined arbitrarily, but rather are related

to the degree of variability of ex post returns and to the degree of risk—

aversion. Under certain assumptions made in this paper (one—period maximiza-

tion of expected utility, constant relative risk—aversion, and normally

distributed returns) the relationship is extremely simple: the coefficient

matrix, in its inverted form, is proportional to the variance—covariance matrix

of returns. Then the proposition that two assets are close substitutes becomes

the hypothesis that the covariance of their returns is high, and that they have

similar covariances with third assets.3

     This train of thought is a common one in the literature. Roley (1982, '. 646)

sums up the woeful status of the regression studies: 'Despite the theoretical

plausibility of significant relative asset supply effects on security yields,

virtually all empirical research has been unsuccessful in isolating these

effects." The responses in the literature, attempts to bring to bear the

additional information contained in the theory of portfolio optimization, fall

into two distinct categories. The first group maintains the framework of

regressions of asset quantities and rates of return, but uses the Theil—

Goldberger mixed—estimation technique to bring in a priori beliefs like gross

substitutability among the assets. Examples are Smith and Brainard (1976),
                                                                          /4




Backus, Brainard, Smith and Tobin (1980), and Backus and Purvis (l980).
One problem with this approach is that it does not use all the information con-

tained in the portfolio optimization theory. But in another sense, it uses

too much information: the assumption of gross substitutability among all

assets is a strict one that is not particularly likely to be borne out by the

true variance—covariance matrix, as Blanchard and Plantes (1977) have argued.

     The second category of studies make no use of time—series data on asset

quantities, and instead compute the optimal portfolio from data on ex post

rates of return. The difficult question is how to measure expected rates of

return. The most conmion method is to assume expected returns constant over

the sample period; then they can be estimated by the sample means, and the

variance—covariance matrix can be estimated by the second moments around the

means. Examples are Roley (1979) and Nordhaus and Durlauf (1982). The problem

here is that the assumption that expected returns are constant is inconsistent

with the seemingly—evident fact that nominal interest rates, expected inflation,

real interest rates, expected returns on equity, etc., are observed to vary over

time. At best, expected returns have been allowed to change in an ad hoc

manner, by estimating the expected return from a distributed lag or ARIMA

process   of actual returns, or from a rolling regression of returns against

lagged values of an arbitrarily chosen set of variables. For example in a

study with similar aims to this one, Bodie, Kane and McDonald (1983) estimate

the expected real return on Treasury bills by an AR(1 )   and similar methods. Such

an approach allows expected returns to change, but only slowly from one period

to the next. Thus it is still inconsistent with the framework of the macro-

economic questions we are asking, such as the effect of an increase in the supply

of government debt on the various expected rates of return.
                                                                              )

        This   paper estimates the parameters in the asset—demand function and tests

hypotheses about them, using a technique that imposes the optimization hypothesis.

The essence of this technique is the recognition that the variance—covariance

matrix of returns is precisely the variance—covariance matrix of the error term

in the system of equations, and that the parameters should be estimated subject

to this contraint. The technique dominates the regression studies in that it

uses all the information in the optimization hypothesis, and it dominates the

optimal portfolio studies in that it allows expected returns to vary freely over

time.


2. HYPOTHESES ON THE ASSET—D1AND FUNCTIONS

        In   this section we present the specification of the asset—demand functions,

and discuss in greater detail various hypotheses regarding their parameters.

        We specify asset demands as a linear function of expected returns:


                                      = A
                                            + B(Er+i)                               (1)

                                              (1) tangible assets, i.e. real estate
are   allocated to each of five assets:

and consumer durables; (2) long—term federal debt; (3) long—term state and

local debt; (4) long—term corporate debt; and (5) equities.        There is a sixth

asset that we omit as redundant given that the six shares must sum to one. It

is:     (6) deposits, which are an amalgamation of a monetary aggregate (basically

M3) and short—term corporate and government securities. We aggregate the short—

term assets together partly because they all have nominal returns known        to   the

investor with certainty (assuming away default risk), which implies that their

only risk comes from a coumion source, inflation;              they should in theory

be perfect substitutes with respect to risk. We choose a maturity of one year

or less as the definition of short—term, not just because that is the accounting
                                                                       6




definition of short—term, but also because our data on portfolios held by U.S.

of the expected real returns on the five assets, each measured relative to

the expected real return on the numeraire asset, deposits. A is a vector

of five constants. B is a five—by—five matrix of coefficients that describes

the responsiveness of asset demands to expected returns. Equation (1) is general in

eorm, in that we have not said what determines the parameters in A and B

But it is restricted somewhat in that we have assumed that wealth enters

homogeneously, and that th equation is linear in expected returns. Later we

will show that equation (1) is precisely the correct form for asset—demand

functions to take, with specific values for A and B ,    if investors maximize
a function of the mean and variance of their real wealth. We have excluded any

transactions demand for assets, and any tax effects, though both could in

theory be subsumed in the rates of return if they could be properly measured.

    We will be working with the system of asset demands, equation (1), in

inverted form.5


                            Er+i = — B1A + B1 x .                            (2)

We assume that the financial markets are always in equilibrium: expected

rates of return are whatever they have to be for asset supplies to be willingly
                  6
held by investors We will be examining two sorts of hypotheses.

    One sort of hypothesis is that two or more particular assets are perfect

substitutes for each other. Perhaps the most interesting such hypothesis is

that long—term bonds are perfect substitutes for short—term bills and deposits.
                                                                         7




This proposition would follow from the "expectations hvnothesis" of the

term structure of interest rates, which says that the long—term interest rate

should    equal the average of the present and expected future short terni

interest rates. It would be contradicted by the observation that often

in recent years long—term interest rates have been high relative to what

expected future short—term rates seem likely to be, The most obvious

explanation that has been given is that holders of long—term debt require

a risk premium to compensate them for the risk of capital loss, and that

this risk premium has been forced up in recent years. The often—alleged

culprit is         the increase in the supply of long—term federal debt.

     Since we have chosethe short—term asset for the numerire, the hypothesis

is that all the elements of row i and column i are zero, where i = 2          for

federal bonds, i    3 for state and local bonds, and i = 4     for corporate

bonds. This says that the demand for long—term bonds is infinitely sensitive

to their rate of return relative to short—term bills, and so arbitrage eliminates

any fluctuation. In all our econometrics we will leave the vector of constant

terms,         ix equation (2), unconstrained. Thus the null hypothesis of

perfect substitutability allows for an asset to pay a differential expected

rate of return, as long as it is fixed.   (This is by analogy with consumer

theory, in which two goods are perfect substitutes if their relative price is

fixed, whether or not it is fixed at un±ty.) In the case of the term structure

of interest rates, the hypothesis of perfect substitutability thus interpreted

does not rule out the Keynes—Hicks hypothesis of "normal backwardation,"

according to which longer—term interest rates pay a fixed liquidity premium

above expected short—term rates, as compensation to the holder for possible
                                                                     8




capital losses. The alternative hypothesis that we are testing for is that

there is a variable risk premium on long—term bonds, one that is forced up when

the quantity of bonds supplied to the market goes up. Thus the test follows

in the tradition of such papers as De Leeuw (1965), Modigliani and Sutch (1966,

(1967), and Masson (1978).

     The other sort of hypothesis we will be testing, besides perfect substitu-

tability, concerns the derivatives of particular expected rates of return with

regard to particular asset supplies. Presumably the expected rate of return on

an asset, say federal bonds, has a positive derivative with respect to the

supply of that asset. An increase in the federal debt raises the expected

return that must be paid to investors to induce them to hold it. But the

effect on the expected returns on alternative assets is not clear a priori.

     Here the most interesting question is whether an increase in federal debt

drives up the required rate of return on private capital. The "portfolio crowd-

ing out" literature of Blinder and Solow (1973) and Tobin and Buiter (1976)

assumed in the tradition of Keynes that all forms of long—term debt and capital

were perfect substitutes, so that a ceteris paribus increase in federal debt

necessarily raised the required rate of return on capital. Those papers traced

out over time the "general equilibrium" effects of cumulating government debt;

the issue was whether the contractionary effects were outweighed by other

expansionary effects. As Tobin (1961), Benjamin Friedman (1978), and Roley

(1979) argue, if we relax the unrealistic assumption that bonds are perfect

substitutes for real capital, then an increase in the supply of bonds will not

necessarily drive up the required rate of return on capital to begin with. It

depends on the degree of substitutability. If bonds are relatively close sub-

stitutes for capital (the limiting case being that of Blinder—Solow and
                                                                        9




Tobin—Buiter), then an increase in the supply of bonds will indeed drive up the

required return on capital. But if bonds are relatively close substitutes for

money, then it will drive down the required return on capital, as if it were

an increase in the supply of money. Friedman calls this possibility 'portfolio

crowding—in."
     To consider effects on the expected rate of return of equity, we pick out

the relevant equation from the system of five equations represented by (2):


  Er+1c5 + b5i(T/W)+b52(F/W) + b53(S/W) + b54(C/W)+b55(K/W)                    (3)




where          c5 is the last element of

          b51—b55 is the last row of B

                T is the supply of tangible assets,

                F is the supply of federal bonds

                S is the supply of state and local bonds

                C is the supply of corporate bonds,

                K is the supply of equity,

                W iswealth, T+F+S+C+K+D ,and
                D is the supply of short—term bills and deposits.


        The effect of an increase in F without a change in the other variables

in equation (3) is given by b52/W .        Since we are holding wealth constant,

the increase in F must come at the expense of the omitted asset, deposits

D .     Thus the experiment we are considering has precisely the interpretation

of an open—market sale of bonds by the central bank. Since we have aggregated

together money and short—term Treasury securities, the experiment can also be

interpreted as a shift in the term—structure composition of the national debt,
                                                                     10




as in studies of debt management policy by Roiph (1957), Tobin (1963), Friedman

(1978), and Roley (1979, 1982). While one might think that a decrease in

the money supply would necessarily have the contractionary effects associated

with an increase in Er+1 , Tobin points out that a shift from short—term

Treasury securities to long—term Treasury securities will have no effect if the

two are perfect substitutes, and Roiph argues that the effect could actually be

expansionary. To test whether such an operation raises the expected relative

return on equity Er+1 , we would test whether b52 is significantly
greater than zero.

       The effect of an increase in W without a change in the other variables

in equation (3) is given by


           K
      3E r
               =
                   [ b51(T/W)_b52(F/W)_b53(S/W)t_b54(C/W)t_bss(K/W).t]Wt       (4)




Since we are holding the other asset supplies constant, the increase in wealth

must come in the form of an increase in deposits D .    Thus equation (4) has

precisely the interpretation of the effect of a uhelicopter_dropu of money (or

of the comparative statics effect of amoney—financed government deficit). To

test whether it has the negative effect on Er+1 that one would expect, we

test whether _b5x is significantly less than zero, where b5 is the last

row of B1
       The main event is portfolio crowding out: the effect of an increase in

F ,    including the wealth effect on Er÷i .

       K
      r
               [_b5i(T/W)+
                                                                           .   (5)
                                                                     11




Notice that equation (5) is the sum of the effect of open—market substitution

of bonds for money, b52/W ,    plus   the effect of an increase in money, the

wealth effect of equation (4). An expression greater than zero represents

portfolio crowding—out; an expression less than zero represents portfolio

crowding in. The condition is stated in vector form in Appendix 3 (as are the

other hypotheses to be examined).

     The rate of return on equity cannot be identified perfectly with the

cost of capital relevant to a firm's decision to undertake investment in

plant and equipment.7 Perhaps if we had data on the asset holdings of the

aggregated private sector, including real capital held by the corporate sector,

we could use the profit rate as an unambiguous measure of the return on real

capital. But it seems desirable to avoid such an extreme degree of aggregation,

and to work with the holdings of the household sector alone. We will look at the

effect on the rate of return on equity because that is what is held by households. We

will also look at the effect of an increase in federal bonds F on the expected

rate of return on corporate bonds Eri . Since corporate bonds are an

alternative to equity as a way of financing investment by firms, this effect is

also relevant to the question of portfolio crowding—out. Note however that our

goal here is nothing more than to examine the effect of the supply of government

debt on the expected relative rates of return that various assets must pay to

private investors. To answer the more ambitious question of whether an increase

in debt has an expansionary or contractionary effect on real activity, we would

need to know not just the asset—holding preferences of households, but also those

of firms, pension funds, banks and other financial intermediaries, not to mention

what we would need to know about saving behavior, goods markets and the supply

side. The term "portfolio crowding out" is here used merely as shorthand for

certain partial derivatives.
                                                                       12




3.   ESTINATION OF THE ASSET—DEMAND FUNCTIONS, WITH AND WITHOUT THE CONSTRAINTS

     OF MEAN-VARIANCE OPTINIZATION

     The frequent   stumbling—block to the estimation of asset—demand functions

like equation (1), or the inverted form (2), is the measurement of expected

returns, which are not directly observable. As discussed in the Introduction,

we do not want to measure expected returns by the sample average or by an ad

hoc ARIMA function of lagged returns, because this would not allow them to

fluctuate freely. But the way we have set up equation (2), all that is

necessary is to assume that expectations are rational: expectational errors

are random, where ltrandomtt means uncorrelated with the information set

available at time t .     Then actual ex post returns are given by:


                      r+i =   Er+i ÷ t+1     (Ect÷1tI) = 0     .
                                                                             (5)


Substituting (2) into (5) we get:


                                 = —B1A
                                        + B1Xt + t+1                         (6)




This system of equations can be estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

because the lefthand—side variable is now observable and the error term, by the

assumption of rational expectations, is uncorrelated with the righthand—side

variables x
      The system was estimated on yearly observations from 1954 to 1980. The

data are described in Appendix 4. The OLS results are reported in Table 1.

As previous studies have found, e.g. Smith and Brainard (1976) and Friedman

(1978, p. 638), simple OLS estimation of such a system does not yield very

satisfactory results. The implausibility of some of the estimates in Table 1

will become clearer when we turn to our hypothesis-testing in the next sections,

But for the moment, two anomalies stand out. First, many of the coefficients

that we might a priori expect to be positive appear negative. While some are

not statistically significant, three are: the coefficient of federal bonds in

the equation for the return on state and local bonds, and the coefficients of

federal bonds and state and local bonds in the equation for the return on

corporate bonds. It seems a priori that the three bonds should be substitutes.

Second, even when the coefficients are of the sign we would expect a priori, and

even when they are statistically significant, the magnitudes are implausibly

high. For example, it appears to take a 30.39 per cent increase (3039 basis

points!) in the expected rate of return on corporate bonds to induce investors

to accept an increase in their holdings of corporate debt equal to 1 per cent

of their portfolios (at the expense of money). It is small wonder that

previous authors have considered it necessary to adopt techniques that combine

the data with their a priori beliefs.

     The innovation of this paper is that it estimates the parameters of the

asset—demand system, equation (1), using the constraints that come from the

hypothesis that investors choose their portfolios so as to maximize a function

of the mean and variance of their real wealth. This hypothesis has a distin-

guished history, consisting notably of the Tobin—Markowitz model (e.g. Tobin

(1958)) and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Much of the large

literature on CAPM is devoted to testing the model, and the results are often

not favorable.9 However this approach remains the most attractive way of

bringing more structure to bear on simple asset—demand functions. Appendix
                                                              10

assumptions:

     (A4) constant relative risk—aversion.

The optimal portfolio turns out to be equation (1), with


                                    B =   [pc2]                                  (7)



where p is the constant of relative risk—aversion and 2 is the 5 X 5

variance—covariance matrix of returns, conditional on information available
             12
at time t

     A   simple way to estimate the system that would be in keeping with the

traditional CAPM   literature   is as follows. First, expected returns Er÷i

are assumed constant over time, and are estimated from the averages of ex post

returns realized during the sample period. Second, the variance—covariance

matrix Q is assumed constant over time, and is estimated from the squared

deviations of realized returns around those constant expected values. The

problem with assuming expected returns constant has already been pointed out:

it is inconsistent with the framework of changes in asset supplies and conse-

quent changes in expected returns in which we are interested.       The solution is

to recognize that the variance—covariance matrix    Q   is precisely the variance—

covariance matrix of the expectational error, the              term in equation (2),

and that the equation should be estimated subject to that constraint:


                           = —B1A +        + Et+1 2 =   ECE'    .                (8)


Imposing a constraint between the coefficient matrix and the error variance—

covariance matrix is unusual in econometrics. It requires nonlinear Maximum

Likelihood Estimation (NLE). Appendix 2 shows the log likelihood function and
                                                                                15




its first derivatives, and briefly describes the program used to find the

parameter estimates that maximize it.

     Table 2 reports the MLE results for the parameters in equation (8). The

estimates are far more plausible than those in Table 1. The expected returns

on the three assets that one would a priori expect to be the closest substitutes,

the three bonds, indeed turn out to depend positively on each others' asset

supplies.13 Furthermore, the magnitudes are far more reasonable. For example,

it now appears to take a .404 per cent increase (40.4 basis points) in the

expected rate of return on corporate bonds to induce investors to accept an

increase in their holdings of corporate debt equal to 1 per cent of their

portfolios.

     Although we have set up our hypothesis—testing on the matrix in inverted

form B      pS   ,   the pre—inverted form B =
                             .

                                                 (pc2)        is of interest because it

represents    investors' original asset—demand functions. Table 3 inverts the

5x5 matrix from Table 2. Two assets are defined to be substitutes if their

off—diagonal entry is negative. For example a 1.00 per cent increase (100

basis points) in the expected return on corporate bonds raises the investor's

demand for corporate bonds by .205 per cent of his portfolio and lowers his

demand for the substitutes, the other four long—term assets. However several

pairs of assets are complements. For example the increase in the expected

return on corporate bonds raises the demand for deposits, as one can tell by

adding the five coefficients. Thus the assumption of gross substitutability

among all assets, imposed a priori by some previous studies, does not appear

to be borne out.

     The one parameter in Tables 2 and 3 that is not at all reasonable is the

coefficient of relative risk—aversion p . The point estimate is 110.31 ,             but   this

number is normally considered to be far lower. Given a priori beliefs about

the coefficient of relative risk—aversion, it makes sense to impose them in

order to get the most efficient estimates of the other parameters.    The

literature appears to have settled roughly on 2.0 as a value for the coeffi-

         (See, for example, the evidence in Friend and Bltnne (1975).)   Table 4
cient.

reports the results of using the MLE technique to impose not only the constraint

of mean—variance optimization, but also the further constraint p = 2     .    The

magnitude of the coefficients is smaller than those in Table 2, reflecting the

smaller p .    But their relative values, which are all that matters for the portfo-

lio crowding—oi-it tests-,are very similar. The theme of this paper is the

imposition of a priori constraints to obtain more efficient estimates; accord-

ingly we use the estimates from Table 4 in the tests that follow.


4. RESULTS OF TESTS OF PERFECT SUBSTITUTABILITY

     We nowperfom Wald tests on hypotheses of the type discussed
above. The results are reported in Table 5. In this section we discuss the

tests of perfect substitutability, applied to the unconstrained parameter

estimates of B1 in Table 1. (The perfect substitutability hypotheses cannot

be properly nested within the MLE framework of mean—variance optimization

because they will imply zero or identical rows in the variance—covariance

matrix, which is on the edge of the parameter space.) Each hypothesis consists

of a number q (between 1 and 25) of linear constraints on the 25 estimated

parameters. The test—statistic is distributed asymptotically        with q degrees

of freedom.    Appendix 3 contains the algebraic details of the test—statistics.
                                                                            17




               HYPOTHESIS   1:     ALL.ASSETS ARE PERFECT SUBSTITUTES.

     We start with the hypothesis that all coefficients are zero: asset

supplies have no effect on expected returns. We would certainly expect to

reject the null hypothesis. The test—statistic can be thought of as a

generalized F test of the significance of the entire system. As expected,

Table 5 shows that we easily reject Hypothesis 1.




        HYPOTHESIS 2: THE THREE KINDS OF BONDS ARE PERFECT SUBSTITUTES

     In looking at only six      assets,   we have presumed a high degree of aggrega-

tion to begin with. Perhaps a still higher degree of aggregation is possible.

Of course state and local bonds are exempt from income taxes, and federal

bonds have a lower probability of default than corporate bonds or state and

local bonds. But these advantages could conceivably be worth a fixed premium

In the expected rate of return, as opposed to the variable premium that occurs

when investors wish to balance their portfolios among the different assets.

     Table 5 shows that we again reject the hypothesis. Our finding is


the same as that of Fair and Malkiel (1971), that federal bonds are not perfect

substitutes for other bonds. We can also reject the. hypothesis that the three

bonds are perfect substitutes for equity (test statistic not reported), which

is not surprising given Hypothesis 2. This confirms the argument of Tobin

(1961) and Friedman (1978) that the traditional Keynesian aggregation is mis-

leading, and that portfolio crowding out is not a foregone conclusion.
                                                                           18



          HYPOTHESIS 3: CORPORATE BONDS ARE PERFECT SUBSTITUTES FOR

                               STATE AND LOCAL BONDS.

     This is an attempt to see whether         degree of aggregation beyond six

assets is possible. Corporate bonds and state and local bonds seem the most

likely pair to be close substitutes because their interest rates are highly

correlated, and they share an element of default risk. But we reject this

hypothesis as well.




           HYPOTHESIS 4: SHORT—TERN DEPOSITS ARE PERFECT SUBSTITUTES

              FOR LONG—TERN BONDS.

     We have been examining aggregation across issuer. Here we move to aggregation

across the term structure; we are testing the expectations hypothesis of the

term structure of interest rates. Each F statistic reported in Table 1 tests the

hvDothesis that the five coefficients in its row are zero, i.e. that the asset

is a perfect substitute for deposits. We reject the hypothesis for each of the

three long—term bonds —   federal,   state and local, and corporate —   considered

individually. As indicated in Table 5, we also reject the hypothesis that the

three bonds jointly are perfect substitutes for deposits. This is an important

finding, given the absence of significant effects on the term structure in OLS

studies like Modigliani and Sutch (1966, 1967).



5. RESULTS OF TESTS OF PORTFOLIO CROWDING OUT

     We now turn to the tests of hypotheses regarding "portfolio crowding out,"

or the derivatives of expected rates of return with respect to asset supplies.

     In each case, after testing the hypothesis on the unconstrained

estimates, we then test it on B1 oQ, the parameter estimates of Table 4 that

are constrained to come from mean—variance optimization by the investor. Since

the niatrix is symmetric, there are in effect only 15 estimated parameters (not

counting the intercept terms). Each hypothesis consists of a single linear
                                                 2
constraint, and the test—statistic is again x
                                                                         19




         HYPOTHESIS 5: THE SUPPLY OF EQUITIES HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT

                 ON THE EXPECTED RELATIVE RETURN ON EQUITIES.

     This is a fairly unexceptionable proposition. We would expect an increase

in any of the asset supplies to drive up the own rate of return, in order to

induce investors to hold the increased supply willingly. Indeed the diagonal

terms of the matrix estimated by NLE are positive by construction. But we

begin our testing of the derivatives or "crowding out" effects with this

example in order to get some idea of the power of our tests. In other words,

if we cannot find a significant effect here, then the practical usefulness

of the technique is in some doubt.

     Recall that the wealth effect of an increase in any asset supply depends

not only on the coefficients but also on the x , the shares of the portfolio

already allocated to the various assets. As shown in Appendix 3, the constraints

tested take the form that a linear combination R of the coefficients          is

zero, where the weights in R come from the elements of x     .     Since the x

vary over time, the test—statistic will vary somewhat over time.    Table 6 prints

out the portfolio—share data. There is a pronounced upward trend in the share

allocated to tangible assets (real estate and consumer durables), and there are

corresponding downward trends in the other assets. In the case of each deriva-

tive, to ensure that our results are not sensitive to the point in time that we

pick, we will try the test once using portfolio shares at the beginning of

the sample period, x54 , and once using shares at the end of the sample period,

       It is of course the second test that is more relevant for any possible

policy prescriptions in the 1980's.

     Under the unconstrained OLS estimates, the point estimate of the own—

effect for equities is indeed seen to be positive, in 1954 as well as 1980.

However the test statistic is not significant, not even at the 75 per cent

level should one choose to go that low. Under the constrained MLE estimates,

on the other hand, the positive effect is highly significant in either year.

We accept Hypothesis 5, i.e. we reject a zero effect. This case appears to be

a good illustration of the benefit gained by using the extra information

embodied in the constraint of mean—variance optimization.


          HYPOTHESIS 6:   THE SUPPLY OF DEPOSITS HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT

                  ON THE EXPECTED RELATIVE RETURN ON EQUITIES.

     As a matter of economics, this proposition is of interest because it says

that an increase in the money supply has a stimulating effect, to the extent

that business fixed investment responds to the required rate of return on

capital. As a technical matter, the derivative with respect to deposits is

of interest because they are the numeraire asset. The total effect of an

increase in, say, federal bonds (considered in the next hypothesis), is given

by a wealth or "Helicopter drop" effect, represented by the derivative considered

here, plus a substitution or "Open Market Operations" effect, represented by the

single relevant element of   B1
     Under the unconstrained OLS estimates the test—statistic is extremely low

in significance. The derivative even changes sign during the sample period.

Under the constrained MLE estimates the derivative is negative, as hypothesized,

and is highly significant. This finding holds in 1954 as well as 1980. Again

we see the benefit of using the information in the constraint of mean—variance

optimization.


       HYPOTHESIS 7: THE SUPPLY OF FEDERAL BONDS HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT

                  ON THE EXPECTED RELATIVE RETURN ON EQUITIES.

     This is the derivative that is most easily associated with the controversy

surrounding recent government deficits and the possibility of portfolio crowd-

ing Out. The unconstrained OLS estimates show positive effects but they are
                                                                          22




not significant at the 95 or 90 per cent levels.   In this case the constrained

                                                           of the effect are nega-
MLE   estimates are quite different. The point estimates
tive, indicating, not portfolio crowding Out, but portfolio crowding in. This

finding may appear surprising, but it is consistent with the fact that equities

are not substitutes, but complements for government bonds in our estimates. To
                                                     [pQ]1 reported in Table 3.
see this one must look at the preinverted form B

The demand for government bonds is seen to be a positive function of the expected

return on equities. The complementaritY of these two assets in turn follows

from the fact that the rate of return on government bonds has a much lower

correlation with the rate of return on equities than with the rates of return

on most of the other assets. After all, why should investors treat long—term

obligations of the government so very differently from short—term obligations

(money and Treasury bills), which we found in Hypothesis 6 to have a negative

effect?

       The effect is not significantly less than zero at the 95 or 90 per cent

levels.    So we should probably describe the finding as a failure to reject the

absence of any effect, leaving prominent the possibility of insufficient power In

the test. On the other hand, if one wanted to describe it more aggressively as a

rejection of portfolio crowding out, one could draw some slight support from the

fact that the effect is significantly negative at the 75 per cent level, as of

1954. Perhaps it would be best to describe the finding by arguing that evidently

we are not far from the borderline case in which we can ignore any portfolio

effects of debt—financed government deficits on the axpected return to capital.



        HYPOTHESIS 8: THE SUPPLY OF FEDERAL BONDS HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT

                ON THE EXPECTED RELATIVE RETURN ON FEDERAL BONDS

       As with Hypothesis 5, a positive own—derivative might seem assured a priori.
                                                                         23




But it is worth recalling at this juncture the Ricardo—Barro proposition that

government debt has no effects because there are implied future tax liabilities

that offset it)4 It is not a true "outside asset." (The same would be true

of the debt of state and local governments, but perhaps more so because it Is

clearer that they have to pay off their debt eventually. Corporate debt is

different because, with a given real capital stock, every dollar of corporate

debt reduces the equity of the firm by one dollar.) The proposition is

usually evaluated in an intergenerational or interteinporal framework.

One could try to address it in the present one—period framework.

Under the assumption of rational expectations, any irrelevant variable that is

thrown in to equation (6), so long as it is known at time t   and so is uncor—
related with the expectational error, should show up with a zero coefficient.

This is true of lagged expectational errors, any VAR process, the forecasts of any

model, the outstanding quantity of IOU's between citizens, and the outstanding

number of bottle caps produced. According to the Ricardo—Barro proposition, it

is also true of the outstanding value of the national debt. If the debt showed

up with significant non—zero coefficients, that would constitute a rejection

of the hypothesis. This is not to say that the proposition puts any restric-

tions on the 2 matrix. Even assuming government bonds are not true outside

assets, if their return is for whatever reason correlated with the return on

those that are true outside assets, then they will have to pay a risk premium

like the others. To make an analogy, if one makes a private bet on the outcome

of a football game one can in theory expect to get fair odds, but if one makes

a private bet on the fate of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, one cannot in

theory expect to get fair odds because the risk is not diversifiable. Only if

the risk in federal bonds is completely diversifiable will they pay no risk

premium (i.e. their expected return will be the same as the return on a risk—free

asset, if there is one, say Treasury bills in the absence of inflation risk).
                                                                     24




But even if they pay a risk premium, under the null hypothesis it would not

be affected by the supply of government bonds.

     We cannot test the Ricardo—Barro proposition properly from our estimation

results because federal bonds F appears in equation (6) not just as an extra,

potentially irrelevant, "thrown—in" variable, but also as a component of

total wealth W in the denominator of each of the portfolio shares. Its rate

of return also appears as an equation of its own. To test the proposition

properly we might exclude F from the list of assets. (One could think of it

as adding a seventh asset representing the present discounted value of house-

holds' future tax liabilities, in theory equal to the negative of F) .    Then
we could add F as an additional variable in each of the four remaining equa-

tions; the null hypothesis would be zero coefficients. But under the alternative

hypothesis that government bonds are in reality outside assets, such equations

would not be properly specified.

     In any case, in the six—asset model the derivative. of ErF' with respect

to F appears of the wrong sign and insignificant when estimated by uncon-

strained OLS, a symptom of the negative value estimated f or bFF in Table 1.

It is positive as hypothesized but insignificant, except at the 75% level,

when estimated by constrained NLE. One cannot claim much evidence on the

Ricardo—Barro proposition from these results.


        HYPOTHESIS 9: THE SUPPLY OF FEDERAL BONDS HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT

              ON THE EXPECTED RELATIVE RETURN ON CORPORATE BONDS

     Since much business fixed investment is financed by the issue of corporate

debt rather than equity, this proposition may be as relevant to the crowding

out issue as Hypothesis 7. When we use the unconstrained OLS estimates we
                                                                   25




get an (insignificant) apparent negative effect, attributable to the estimated

negative value for bCF .   When we impose the optimization constraint the MIE

estimate becomes positive as we would expect: federal bonds and corporate

bonds are substitutes because their returns are highly correlated. However we

cannot reject the hypothesis of a zero effect.


6. CONCLUSION

    This paper has introduced a MLE technique to obtain the most efficient

estimates of the parameters in investors' asset demand functions of the port-

folio—balance type. The technique itself may be as important as the specific

results obtained. It dominates previous OLS attempts to relate asset supplies

to rates of return because it brings more information to bear on the question:

the information that the parameters are not determined arbitrarily but rather

depend on the variances and covariances of real returns, assuming investors

optimize with respect to the mean and variance of real wealth. The technique

dominates previous estimates of the optimal portfolio in that it allows

expected returns to vary freely, rather than assuming them measurable by a

constant sample mean or by a slowly—moving ARIMA process.

     It might be objected that the assumption of constant expected returns

(first moments) is no worse than the assumption of constant variances and

covariances (second moments) which is maintained in this paper. It is certainly

true that parameters like the variances in our asset demand functions can

change over time. This is the essence of the famous "Lucas critique." One

could split up the sample period to see if the parameters shifted, for example

when the Federal Reserve Board switched from a policy of targetting the interest

rate to a policy of targetting the money supply. One could even allow the

variances to change gradually over time as in Rob Engel's "ARCH" model. But
                                                                     26




this paper is written under the supposition that fluctuations in expected

returns are more of a problem than fluctuations in variances. After all, the

former are the variables in the asset demand functions, and the latter are

the parameters. If we did not think that the expected returns varied more

than the parameters, we would not call them "variables,tt Allowing expected

returns to vary was first priority. Allowing the parameters to vary is a

subject for future research.

     Some specific results of interest have been obtained. In general, there

is little justification for aggregation beyond what has already gone into the

six assets used here, i.e. the assets are not perfect substitutes for each other.

Indeed some pairs of assets are not substitutes at all, but rather are complements.

A particularly important finding is a rejection of perfect substitutability

between long—term bonds and short—term bills. Evidently long—term bonds pay an

expected return that differs from the expected short—term returns by a risk—

premium. Nor is the premium constant, as in the theory of "normal backwarda—

tion" in its simplest form. It is indeed possible that recent debt—financed

federal deficits, or the fear of future debt—financed deficits, have driven

up long—term interest rates)5

     The benefits of using the NLE   technique   are seen from the

test results for the portfolio crowding out hypotheses. In the cases where

the sign of the effect seemed clear a priori, Hypotheses 5, 6, 8 and 9, the

results of the MLE technique is mUch more in conformity than the results of

OLS. In the one case in which the sign is a subject of controversy (Hypothesis

7, the effect of government debt on the required expected relative return on

equity), the NLE technique changes the point estimate from crowding out to
                                                                 27




crowding in. While the degree of portfolio crowding—in is not significantly

different from zero, a 95 per cent confidence interval would exclude all but a

small degree of crowding out (relative to some of the other effects). Federal

debt and equities are not close substitutes in investors portfolios because

their returns are not highly correlated.

1.   The simultaneous equation method has been used by B. Friedman (1977),

     Roley (1982), and Masson (1978), among others.

2. Examples of regressions in inverted form are Fair and Malkiel (1971)

     and Modigliani and Stitch (1966, 1967).

3. Note that this is not the same as the stronger proposition that the ex

     post returns on the two assets are always the same. Their ex post

     returns can have independent components, as long as these components are

     uncorrelated with the returns on the market portfolio. If the individual

     asset is a small proportion of the market portfolio, e.g. an individual

     equity or bond, then that component of its return that is uncorrelated

     with the returns on other assets is diversifiable and will have no effect

     on demand for the asset.

4. Brainard and Tobin (1968) impose a priori values on the parameters outright.

     All these papers run simulations on the chosen parameter values to see the

     effects of changes in government debt, etc. They also emphasize a low

     degree of aggregation: separate asset—demand functions are estimated for

     households, banks, etc.

This is just equation (2) with B1 constrained to be p2         ,   as claimed by

equation (37) in the text. Combining with the rational expectations assumption

(3) is another way to get equation (8), the equation estimated in the text.

(There is also a constraint imposed on the intercept term A .        But it is not
convenient to impose this constraint in the econometrics. Nor do we need it,

since the constraint on the coefficient matrix already gives us 25 overldenti—

fying restrictions.)
      For economic intuition, we can invert (A2) to solve for the portfolio

shares, the form analogous to (1):


                          -.21
                                 Cov(r1, r1) + (pc2)'Er÷i .                        (A3)


The asset demands consist of two parts. The first term represents the

"minimum—variance" portfolio, which the investor will hold if he is extremely

risk—averse (p =    ).    For example, suppose he views deposits as a safe

asset, which requires that the inflation rate is nonstochastic. Then his

minimum—variance portfolio is entirely in deposits: the 5 entries in

x are all zero because the Coy in (A3) is zero. The second term represents

the "speculative" portfolio. A higher expected return on a given asset induces

investors to hold more of that asset than is in the minimum—variance portfolio,

to an extent limited only by the degree of risk—aversion and the uncertainty

of the return.

The unconstrained MLE is simply the OLS estimates that we looked at

in Table 1.

     For the constrained MLE, we substitute p12 for                      B     .    12   now appears

in the likelihood function in two ways. To maximize, we differentiate.                            The

derivatives with respect to the coefficient of risk—aversion and the inter-

cept term are easy:

     The derivative with respect to the elements of the variance—covariance

matrix is trickier. We use the two facts (from Theil (1971, pp. 31—32),

equations (6—14) and (6—8), respectively):
                                                                                      39

where
          t+1'3         =
                            x    .     This much would be true for the derivatives with

respect    to         matrix     "IL"        The   fact that 2 is synnnetric, and so contains
only 15 independent parameters, means that all off—diagonal elements must be
doubled.        See the appendix to Frankel and Engel (1982). An equivalent approach

is to work in terms of the 15 parameters in the Choleski factorization of 2

the lower triangular S , such that S'S                               .    (This   approach can be worthwhile

if the NLE program is reluctant to converge when asked to work in terms of

  •   Note that ?/S =                2S .)

      Setting     the derivatives equal to zero gives first order conditions that

characterize the MLE. However, due to nonlinearity they cannot be solved

explicitly for the estimates of p ,                    c   ,   and       ? .   The Berndt, Hall, Hall

and Hausman (1974) algorithm uses the first derivatives to find the maximum

of the likelihood function in non—linear models. For our problem, we modified

a program written by Paul Ruud, based on this algorithm.                                As initial values

for Q in the iteration, we used the simple variance—covariance matrix of the

relative rates of return.

                   Appendix 3:   Constructing the Test—Statistics


       In this appendix we show the algebra of constructing the test—statistics

relevant for the various hypotheses. We do the unconstrained OLS parameters

first, and then the parameters that are constrained by MLE to be mean—variance

optimizing.

       Define      to be the parameters of B1 , estimated unconstrained in

Table 1, expressed as a vector of 25 elements:


          =
              [bTTbTFbTSbTCbTK bFTbFFbFSbFCbFK bSTbSFbSsbSCbSK bCTbCFbCSbCCbCK

              bKTbbKsbKCb]

Each of the hypotheses can be expressed as a set of linear constraints on
the   parameter vector:


                                      R=0
When we want to test the hypothesis that a particular subset of the assets

are perfect substitutes, and one of those assets happens to be the numeraire

asset, deposits D , the constraints are that each of the relevant elements is

zero. For example, to test Hypothesis 1, that all assets are perfect substi-

tutes,          is the 25X25 identity matrix. To test Hypothesis 4, that

deposits are perfect substitutes for all three bonds together,

R4 has 21 rows, each consisting only of a single non—zero element: a "one" in,

respectively, columns 2—4, 6—20, and 2—24.

      When we want to test the hypothesis that a subset of assets are perfect

substitutes not including the numeraire asset, the constraints are that the

relevant pairs of parameters are equal. To test Hypothesis 3, that corporate

bonds are perfect substitutes for state and local bonds, the constraints are

represented as follows:

To test Hypothesis 2, that the three bonds are perfect substitutes, the

constraints are represented as follows:


                                             R3

     When we want to test whether the derivative of an expected relative return

with respect to an asset supply is positive or negative, there is a single

constraint on the parameters. The derivatives are given by R              .   Three effects

on the expected relative return on equity are given first; they are the deriva-

tives, respectively, with respect to equity (hypothesized positive), deposits

(hypothesized negative), and federal bonds (hypothesized positive if there is

portfolio—crowding out).

Lastly we do the effects of the supply of federal bonds on the expected relative

return of, respectively, federal bonds and corporate bonds.

                                                                       K

     We turn now to the representation of the last five hypotheses when imposed on

parameters that have been estimated by MLE subject to the constraint of mean—

variance optimization. The only difference to the R matrices is that because

2 is symmetric, there are fewer free parameters involved. We define E to

be the parameters of Q , estimated in Table 4, expressed as a vector of 15

elements:

The parameter estimates are exactly half of those in Table 4 because B' =

and p=2.          We   will express the hypotheses as RE= 0 ; the equation is exactly

equivalent   to   R[pE] = 0        (for any non—zero p)

The "crowding out" constraints are represented as follows:

     In the unconstrained OLS case, to test a hypothesis R = 0              we compute a Wald

test—statistic T that is asymptotically distributed                 with q degrees of
freedom, where q       is the number of rows in R


                             T =   (Re)'   [(R)](R)
                               =

where V( )   is   an estimated variance—covariance matrix. (Note that when q =1 ,in

Hypotheses 5 through 9, the           statistic is simply the square of a t—statistic.

Although the rejection criterion is the same, we maintain the                 formulation

for congruence with the other tests.)          The equation—by—equation OLS can be

thought of as a single "stacked" OLS regression where the righthand—side

variables are repeated five times: X                   x where 15 is the 5 by 5
                                               15

identity matrix, x is the T by 5 matrix representing the time series observa-

tions of     ,   and     is the Kronecker product. In a GLS regression the

variance—covariance matrix is given by


                             V(s) =    [X' (2 IT)X1

2 is here simply the variance—covariance matrix of the residuals across the

five equations. (Recall that we are assuming that the variances and covariances

are constant over time, and that there is no serial correlation, the latter an

implication of the rational expectations assumption.) Q has not yet taken on

the double significance that it does under MLE. With identical righthand—side

variables, this simplifies, as shown by Henri Theil, Principles of Econometrics,

1971 (John Wiley: N.Y.), p. 308—310:

The two components of the matrix V() are printed out below. The diagonal

elements are the squares of the standard errors reported under the parameter

estimates in Table 1 (but for the fact that the TILE variances divide by T

observations while the OLS variances divide by T—6 observations).

     In the constrained LE case, the      test—statistic is defined similarly:

The variance—covariance matrix V(E) of the parameter estimates cannot be

estimated directly as in the OLS case. It is, rather, the inverse of the

information matrix, which consists of expected values of the second—order

derivatives of the log—likelihood function.

                                      DATA



     The main source for data on supplies of nine assets held by house-

holds was the Federal Reserve Board's Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy

(October 1981) Table 702. This source was used in place of the Fed's Flow of

Funds Accounts, Assets and Liabilities Outstanding, to which it is closely

related, because only the Balance Sheets include data for tangible assets,

i.e. real estate and consumer durables (see page iii of the Flow of Funds

for an explanation). The variables used in the econometrics are shares of

wealth, the supply of the asset in question divided by the sum of all nine

asset supplies.

     The asset supplies were taken from the Balance Sheets as follows. Real

estate is line 1 (total tangible assets) minus line 7 (consumer durables))
                              2 Open market paper is line 25. Short—term U.S.
Consumer durables is line •

government securities are line 20 [not available before 1951]. Deposits is

the sum of lines 13, checkable deposits and currency, 14, small time and

savings deposits, 15, money market fund shares, and 16, large time deposits.

Long—term federal debt is line 18 (U.S. government securities) minus line 20.

State and local debt is line 23. Private bonds are line 24 (corporate and

foreign bonds) plus line 26 (mortgages held).3 Finally, equities are

line 27 (corporate equities) plus line 32 (noncorporate business equity).

     For three of the asset supplies——long—term federal debt, state and local

bonds, and private bonds——the numbers represent book value and must be multi-

plied by some measure of current market prices to get the correct measure of

market value. The very large decline in prices of bonds over the postwar

period make this correction a crucial one. (Equities and tangible assets

are already measured at market value, while capital gains and losses are
                                                                      47




irrelevant for the three short—term assets.) Measures of the current market

bond prices are reported by Standard and Poor's Trade and Security Statistics

Security Price Index Record (1982): page 235 for U.S. government bond prices,

233 for municipal bond prices, and 231 for high grade corporate bond prices.

Standard and Poor's computes the price indexes from yield data, assuming a

3% coupon with 15 years to maturity f or the federal bonds and a 4% coupon

with 20 years to maturity for the other two.5

     Among the rates of return (all in level form   for   this paper) the two most

problematical are those on real estate and durables, taken here as the percentage

change in price indices reported in the Economic Report of the President 1982:

the home purchase component of the CPI (p. 292) and the durable goods personal

consumption expenditure component of the GNP deflator (p. 236). There exist

better measures of house prices, and unpublished estimates of imputed service

returns on housing and durables, but they are not available for the entire

sample period. When the two tangibles are aggregated, we use real estate

appreciation as the return.

     The short—term assets are straight—forward. The rate of return on open

market paper is the interest rate on conmiercial paper from the Federal Reserve

Board: Bankin and Monetary Statistics 1941—197Q, table 12.5, Annual

tical Digest 1970—79, table 22A, and ASD 1980, table 25A. The rate of return

on short—term government securities is the treasury bill rate:      9—12 month

issues (certificates of indebtedness and selected note and bond issues; the

1—year bill market yield rate is not available before 1960) from BMS 1941—1970,

and the 1—year bill secondary market from ASD 1970—1979, table 22A, and

ASD 1980, table 25A. The rate of return on deposits is the rate on 90—day

bankers' acceptances from BMS 1941—1970, table 12.5, ASD 1970—1979, table 22A,
                                                                     48




 and ASD 1980, table 25A. Alternatives such as the return on money market funds

might be theoretically preferable but are not available for the early part of

the sample period. Note that in aggregating non—interest paying money together

with interest—paying accounts, we are assuming that the former performs an

implicit liquidity service that brings its return up to the explicit return

of the latter. When the three short—term assets are aggregated, we use the

Treasury bill rate as the return.

     Each of the long—term assets entails a yield plus capital gains. For

each of the three kinds of bonds, capital gains are percentage change in the

same bond prices from Standard and Poor's Trade and Securities Statistics that

were discussed above. The yields are from the same source: respectively, the

median yield to maturity of a number of government bonds restricted to those

issues with more than ten years to maturity, p. 234, an arithmetic average of

the yield to maturity of fifteen high grade municipal bonds, p. 232, and an

average of the AAA Industrial and Utility bonds, p. 219.   (The yields are also

available from the Fed sources: BNS 1941—1970, table 12.12, ASD 1970—1979,

table 22A and ASD 1980, table 25A.) For equities, capital gains are percentage

change in Stanford and Poor's index of coxon stock prices from EMS 1941—1970,

table 12.16, ASD 1970—1979, table 22A, and ASD 1980, table 26A. To capital

gains we add the dividend price ratio on coon stock, from BMS 1941—1970,

table 12.19, ASD 1970—79, table 22A, and ASD 1980, table 25A.

     The foregoing are all nominal returns. To convert to real returns when

computing percentage returns on levels, we use the percentage change in the

CPI, from the Economic Report of the President 1982. To be precise we divide

one plus the nominal return by one plus the inflation rate. Subtracting the
                                                                  49




inflation rate from the nominal return would give approximately the same

answer, and when we computed real returns relative to the numeraire asset the

two inflation rates would conveniently drop out, but this answer would differ

from the correct one by a convexity term.


     Absent from the calculations is any allowance for differences in tax

treatment. In particular, the returns on state and local bonds, and to some

extent on tangibles, are here understated relative to the other assets because

they are tax—free. The unconstrained constant term that we allow for in

the econometrics should capture most of this effect (and any other constant

omitted factors such as the service return from tangibles, as well). But it

would be desirable to compute after—tax real returns instead.
                                                                     50




1. An alternative here is to subtract lines 38 and 39, mortgages owed by

   households, viewing them as a liability that is institutionally tied to

   the real estate asset. One cannot explain otherwise households' decision

   to hold on net a negative quantity of mortgages on risk—return considera-

   tions, as the mortgage rate is higher than that on other bonds.

2. An alternative here is to subtract lines 40 and 41, consumer credit,

   viewing it as a liability that is tied to the durables asset, for the

   same reason as in the previous footnote.

3. An alternative here is to add in also lines 30 (life insurance reserves),

   31 (pension fund reserves) and 34 (miscellaneous assets). These cannot

   be treated as separate assets because their rates of return are not

   available, but it is desirable to have all forms of wealth included

   somewhere, and they fit into the category of private bonds better than

   anywhere else.

4. An alternative here is to subtract the difference of lines 44 and 33,

   representing net security credit, viewing it as a liability that is

   tied to the equity asset.

5. These same bond prices were reported in the Federal Reserve Board's

   Banking and Monetary Statistics 1941—1970. They have been discontinued

   apparently because the Capital Markets Section at the Federal Reserve

   Board feels that dispersion in the aoupon rate and shifts in the term

   structure make the aggregation of all long—term bonds no longer possible.
