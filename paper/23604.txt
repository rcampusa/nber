Age of Marriage, Weather Shocks, and the Direction of Marriage Payments

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper studies how aggregate economic conditions affect marriage markets in developing
countries where marriage is regulated by traditional customary norms. We examine how local
economic shocks influence the timing of marriage, and particularly child marriage, in Sub-
Saharan Africa and in India, where substantial monetary or in-kind transfers occur with marriage:
bride price across Sub-Saharan Africa and dowry in India. In a simple equilibrium model of the
marriage market in which parents choose when their children marry, income shocks affect the age
of marriage because marriage payments are a source of consumption smoothing, particularly for a
woman's family. As predicted by our model, we show that droughts, which reduce annual crop
yields by 10 to 15%, have opposite effects on the marriage behavior of a sample of 400,000
women in the two regions: in Sub-Saharan Africa, they increase the annual hazard into child
marriage by 3%, while in India droughts reduce such a hazard by 4%. Changes in the age of
marriage due to droughts are associated with changes in fertility, especially in Sub-Saharan
Africa, and with declines in observed marriage payments. Our results indicate that the age of
marriage responds to short-term changes in aggregate economic conditions and that traditional
norms determine this response. This suggests that, in order to design successful policies to
combat child marriage and improve investments in daughters' human capital, it is crucial to
understand the economic role of traditional cultural norms.

   Marriage markets are an important determinant of human capital investments, risk-sharing
opportunities and fertility outcomes (Tertilt, 2005; Field and Ambrus, 2008; Chiappori, Dias,
and Meghir, forthcoming). Across countries and over time, different trends in marriage behavior,
and especially in the age of marriage, are associated with vastly different economic opportunities
for women and with different demographic outcomes. Yet, limited empirical research has ex-
amined whether aggregate economic forces influence marriage decisions and marriage markets,
particularly in developing countries, where marriage is often regulated by traditional customary
norms. Our paper shows that aggregate shocks have sizable effects on the marriage behavior of
women living in developing countries, with significant demographic consequences, and that the
cultural norms regulating marriage play a crucial role in explaining this response, in line with
a simple economic model. Hence, in order to understand how marriage markets work and how
they interact with economic variables, it is crucial to study the cultural norms that regulate
marriage.
   In particular, we investigate the economic determinants of the timing of marriage for women
and focus especially on child marriage (defined as marriage before the age of 18), a widespread
and dramatic phenomenon among women in the developing world, that has been linked to poor
educational, socioeconomic and health outcomes for both women and their children. We study
two regions of the world, Sub-Saharan Africa and India, where, despite improvements in female
educational and economic opportunities, a large number of women continue to marry at an early
age and where there is a persistent tradition of marriage payments: throughout Sub-Saharan
Africa, it is customary for the groom or his family to pay a bride price to the bride’s family,
whereas in India, the prevailing tradition is for the bride’s family to pay a dowry to the groom
or his family at the time of marriage. In these regions, child marriage is strongly associated with
poverty: it is more prevalent in poorer countries, and within each country, among the poorest
households (UNICEF, 2014a).
   How do aggregate economic conditions affect marriage decisions, and particularly child mar-
riage in developing countries? Do traditional marriage payment norms influence such a relation-
ship? To study these questions, we develop an equilibrium model of child marriage. Families
choose when their children marry and societies are virilocal, i.e. women move to the groom’s
family upon marriage. When aggregate income is temporarily low, marginal utility of consump-
tion is higher, and households prefer to bring forward (with bride price) and delay (with dowry)



                                                1
their daughter’s marriage in order to consume the marriage transfer. In equilibrium, however,
also the grooms’ families are affected by the same aggregate shocks. Hence, equilibrium marriage
payments fall with negative income shocks and equilibrium quantities vary depending on which
side of the market is more sensitive to the price decline. Because of virilocality, we show that,
in equilibrium, child marriages increase under bride price and decrease under dowry, because
a man’s parents value future marriage transfers less if they can rely on their son’s economic
support in older age, compared to a woman’s parents, who are less likely to benefit from a
daughter’s support after she is married. Hence, the relationship between aggregate income re-
alizations and the timing of marriage in equilibrium is not univocal: its sign changes depending
on the cultural norms regarding the direction of the marriage payments, i.e. whether bride price
or dowry prevails.
   To test the implications of our model, we examine the effect of rainfall shocks –a major
source of income variability in rural areas that rely on rain-fed agriculture– on the hazard into
early marriage among women in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. We combine rainfall data from
the University of Delaware Air Temperature and Precipitation project (UDel) between 1950 and
2010 with marriage information from 73 pooled Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from
31 Sub-Saharan African countries between 1994 and 2013, from the 1998-1999 India DHS and
from the 2005 Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS). We henceforth obtain information
on the age of marriage and on the history of rainfall shocks for approximately 400,000 women
for every year between age 12 and age 24 born between 1950 and 1989. To investigate the effect
of rainfall shocks on agricultural output, we also merge the UDel data with historical data on
crop yields provided by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and by the World Bank.
In both regions, a drought, defined as an annual rainfall realization below the 15th percentile of
the local rainfall distribution, is associated with a significant 10 to 15% decline in agricultural
production.
   Our main results indicate that droughts have opposite effects on early marriage in Sub-
Saharan Africa and in India, despite having similar negative effects on crop yields, as predicted
by our model: while in Sub-Saharan Africa low realizations of rainfall increase the hazard of
marriage before age 25, we find that in India they reduce such a hazard. The effects are sizable
and concentrated on child marriage: a drought raises the annual hazard of marriage between
ages 12 and 17 by 3% in Sub-Saharan Africa, and it decreases it by 4% in India. These findings



                                                2
are robust to a wide set of alternative definitions of rainfall shocks and alternative sample
specifications.
   To study whether indeed the direction of marriage payments can explain these differential
patterns, we examine heterogeneity between and within countries. First, we exploit historical
data on heterogeneity in marriage payments across ethnic groups collected by the anthropologist
George Peter Murdock for the Ethnographic Atlas (1967) and merged to country populations
in the University of Zurich’s Ethnomaps database. Within Sub-Saharan Africa, where there
is substantial variation in local marriage payment norms, we show that the positive effect of
droughts on the hazard into early marriage is concentrated in countries where the majority
of the population belongs to ethnic groups that traditionally make bride price payments at
marriage. We find no effect in countries where less than half of the population traditionally
engages in bride price payments. To dig deeper into the role played by marriage payments in
shaping early marriage’s decision, we test our main effect in Eritrea, a country within Sub-
Saharan Africa where dowry is prevalent. We find a negative correlation between drought and
early marriage, similar to the one documented in India. Our within-countries analysis also
suggests that the ethnic groups that traditionally engage in bride price payments are the most
sensitive to droughts, particularly in Zambia. Furthermore, within India, where nowadays dowry
prevails across regions, casts and religious groups, we find that the effect of rainfall shocks on
the hazard into early marriage is concentrated among Hindus, who have a stronger historical
tradition of dowry payments. Also, within India, the effect are strongest where irrigation and
banking are less developed, suggesting that reducing consumption volatility can mitigate the
effects of droughts on age of marriage.
   We then move to examining an important implication of child marriages: early fertility. We
show that in Sub-Saharan Africa, a drought is associated with a 4 percent increase in the annual
probability of having a child before turning 18. Furthermore, in countries where bride price is the
most common mode of marriage, one additional drought episode every three years experienced
between ages 12 and 24 reduces the age of marriage by 0.04-0.05 years and increases the total
number of children a woman reports by 0.04 or 1%.
   Are couples who match during droughts different from those who match outside droughts?
Opposite patterns arise in the two economies. In Sub-Saharan Africa, low-educated women are
more likely to marry during droughts and end up having lower decision-making power in their



                                                3
newly-formed family. In India, we show weak empirical evidence that high-educated women are
more likely to marry during droughts and end up having higher say in household decision making.
Importantly, we don’t find any statistically significant difference among couples who marry
during droughts in terms of likelihood of marriage migration, age gaps, husbands’ education
either in Sub-Saharan Africa nor in India.
       Finally, we investigate whether payments for marriages that occur during droughts are indeed
lower, as predicted by our model. To do so, we exploit additional available data on dowry
payments in India and in Indonesia from the 1998 Rural Economic and Demographic Survey
(REDS) and from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), as no extensive data from Africa is
available. In both countries, we find that transfers paid for marriages that occur during droughts
are substantially lower than those paid during normal times, consistent with the predictions
of our model: in India, a drought at the district level is associated with 15% lower dowry
payments, while in Indonesia, a drought at the province level is associated with 45% lower bride
price payments. Controlling for observable characteristics of the match does not affect these
estimates, suggesting that indeed marriage payments are likely to drop with aggregate negative
economic shocks.
       Our paper is related to three strands of the literature in economics. The first is the literature
on how marriage markets work (Abramitzky, Delavande, and Vasconcelos, 2011; Banerjee, Duflo,
Ghatak, and Lafortune, 2013; Chiappori, Salanié, and Weiss, forthcoming) and how they interact
with economic outcomes (Tertilt, 2005, 2006; Greenwood, Guner, and Vandenbroucke, 2017),
especially in developing countries. There is only limited and generally discordant evidence
about how the business cycle affects marriage behavior in developed or in developing countries
(Schaller, 2013; Dorn and Hanson, 2015; Brandt, Siow, and Vogel, 2016), and more generally
about how short-term changes in economic incentives influence marriage behavior. Generally,
the existing empirical evidence suggests that economic forces have at best small effects on the
marriage market. We contribute to this literature by showing that, where marriage payments
are customary, temporary aggregate income shocks lead to substantial shifts in the timing of
marriage, particularly at the crucial early ages, in the timing of fertility and in the fertility rate.
These findings suggest that economic policies that modify the incentives to marry in the short
run can have lasting effects on women’s marital and fertility outcomes.1
   1
    These insights are particularly valuable given increasing worldwide calls to eliminate child marriage. Accord-
ing to recent estimates by the World Bank, eliminating child marriage and child fertility could reduce fertility


                                                        4
   Second, this paper fits within the broad body of research on the importance of culture
and institutions in shaping economic behavior. Much of this work has studied the role of
cultural values and beliefs, such as trust, family ties, and gender norms on economic development
(Fernandez, Fogli, and Olivetti, 2004; Fernandez and Fogli, 2009; Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales,
2006; Alesina, Algan, Cahuc, and Giuliano, 2010; Tabellini, 2010; Nunn and Wantchekon, 2011).
A growing part of this literature has explored the influence of traditional cultural norms -
behaviors that are enforced through social sanctions or rewards - on determinants of economic
development (Platteau, 2000; Jacoby, 1995; Tertilt, 2005; La Ferrara, 2007; La Ferrara and
Milazzo, 2017; Jayachandran and Pande, forthcoming). While marriage payments are widespread
in many regions in Africa and Asia, only a few studies have examined their effect on households’
economic decision, such as female education and health (Bishai and Grossbard, 2010; Anderson
and Bidner, 2015; Ashraf, Bau, Nunn, and Voena, 2016; Bhalotra, Chakravarty, and Gulesci,
2016). In this paper, we show that these payments significantly influence how the marriage
market works, generating opposite responses to the same economic circumstances. These findings
are an example of how cultural norms may influence the external validity of natural experiments,
by radically modifying the economic relationship between variables. Hence, understanding their
role can contribute to policy design and evaluation: for example, our framework suggests that
income stabilization policies, like crop insurance, could reduce child marriage in some countries,
but increase it others. A deep understanding of the mechanism that regulate the marriage market
can shed light on what the most effective policies to address child marriage in each context are.
Our findings emphasize the value of replicating empirical and experimental analyses in different
environments and highlight the role of cultural norms as variables that may be relevant for
extrapolation (Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii, 2015).
   Third, our results contribute to the large economic literature that investigates the coping
mechanisms used by poor households to deal with income risk. Despite imperfect markets for for-
mal insurance, rural households seem well-equipped to smooth consumption in the face of short-
term, idiosyncratic income shocks, often through informal insurance arrangements (Townsend,
1994). However, in the face of aggregate shocks, households must rely on a different set of
strategies to cope such as seasonal migration, off-farm employment, and liquidation of buffer
rates and population growth rates by 10% in high-prevalence countries, generating over $500 billion in annual
benefits each years, through a reduction in deaths and malnutrition among young children and through increased
female labor market earnings and productivity, among other channels (Wodon, Male, Nayihouba, et al., 2017).

stock (Morten, 2016; Jayachandran, 2006; Fafchamps, Udry, and Czukas, 1998). These strate-
gies are typically unable to provide full consumption smoothing, as illustrated by the growing
empirical literature testing the effect of rainfall shocks on individual outcomes and showing a
detrimental effect of drought on infant and child health, schooling attainment and performance,
and domestic violence.2 In this paper, we show that households use female child marriage as
a strategy to cope with income volatility, bringing it forward when a payment is expected and
delaying it when a payment is due. The inability to smooth consumption leads households to
make irreversible decisions even in response to short-term shocks, with harmful long-run welfare
implications for young women and their offspring, thus contributing to gender inequality and
lower accumulation of human capital.
        The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides background information
on marriage markets, marriage payments, and early marriage in Sub-Saharan Africa and in
India. Section 2 illustrates the model. Section 3 describes the data used in the analysis, and
section 4 explains the empirical and identification strategy. Sections 5 and 6 show the empirical
results and provide robustness checks, while section 7 brings in additional data sources on actual
bride price and dowry payments. Section 8 concludes.



1         Background
    In this section we discuss the consequences and the theories about the persistence of child
marriages around the world and provide some background on marriage payments in Sub-Saharan
Africa and India.


1.1         Age of marriage and child marriage

    Early marriage is still a dramatic practice in many countries around the world. Worldwide,
more than 700 million women alive today were married before their 18th birthday and 25 million
entered into union before the age of 15. Child marriage, defined as marriage before the age of 18,
is especially pronounced among women living in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Estimates
from UNICEF suggests that 56% and 42% of women between 20 to 49 got married before the age
of 18 respectively in South Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa (UNICEF, 2014b). Early marriage

                                                           6
is associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes for women and their offspring, including
higher rates of domestic violence; harmful effects on maternal, newborn, and infant health;
reduced sexual and reproductive autonomy; lower literacy and educational attainment (Jensen
and Thornton, 2003; Field and Ambrus, 2008; Chari, Heath, Maertens, and Fatima, 2017).
Based on these findings, international organizations such as UNICEF and the World Bank have
called for "urgent action", arguing that the eradication of early marriage is a necessary step
towards improving female human capital accumulation, empowerment and autonomy around
the world.3 Despite the brutal consequences of early marriage and policy action taken to reduce
it, the causes of this phenomena has been so far seldom examined in the economic literature and
not well understood.
       There are many potential reasons why this practice has persisted. Parents often view early
marriage as a socially acceptable strategy to protect their daughter against events, like sexual
assault or out-of-wedlock pregnancy, that could compromise her purity and subsequent mar-
riageability (see for example World Vision 2013). Grooms also tend to express a preference for
younger brides, purportedly due to beliefs that younger women are more fertile, more likely to
be sexually inexperienced and easier to control (Field and Ambrus, 2008). Although culture is
considered an important driver of the persistence of early marriage, economic conditions may
also play a role. Poverty is strongly associated with early marriage worldwide (Harper, Jones,
Presler-Marshall, and Walker, 2014). Girls from poor households are almost twice as likely to
marry early as compared to girls from wealthier households (Klugman, Hanmer, et al., 2014).
In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, this relationship is likely to interact with the widespread
tradition of marriage payments. Indeed, the limited empirical evidence available suggests that
dowry is increasing in a bride’s age, while bride price is at first increasing and then rapidly
decreasing in a bride’s age, meaning that under both customs, marrying a daughter earlier can
be financially more attractive for her parents.4 Hoogeveen, Van Der Klaauw, and Van Lomwel
(2011) hypothesize that bride wealth is a source of insurance against the loss of livestock, but find
no empirical relationship between the timing of marriage and rainfall in rural Zimbabwe. In a
companion paper, Corno and Voena (2017) show that child marriage responds to income shocks

    For evidence on the relationship between dowry and bride’s age in India, see Chowdhury (2010). Arunachalam
and Naidu (2010) study the relationship between fertility and dowry. Empirical data on bride price is limited,
but for evidence on bride price and bride’s age in the Kagera Health and Development Survey from Tanzania,
see Corno and Voena (2017).

in rural Kagera, Tanzania, where bride price is customary and there is no variation in marriage
payment practices. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to systematically study
the relationship between child marriage, economic shocks and marriage payments.


1.2     Marriage payments

      Marriage payments, i.e. bride price and dowry, are widespread in developing countries. The
prevailing economic view of marriage payments is based on the seminal work by Becker (1991).
People enter in the marriage market to find the match that maximizes their expected utility:
the market matches partners and determines the division of surplus between them. Given this
characterization, marriage payments may emerge as pecuniary transfers to clear the market
when the rules for the division of household output are inflexible, so that a spouse’s shadow
price in the marriage market differs from his or her share of household output. In cases where
the woman’s shadow price on the marriage market is less than her share of household output, a
bride price will emerge to encourage her to marry; in the opposite case, when a woman’s shadow
price on the marriage market is more than her share of household output, dowries will emerge to
encourage male participation in the marriage market.5 Alternatively, different types of marriage
payments can emerge in response to scarcity on one side of the marriage market.
    There is an important difference between marital customs in sub-Saharan Africa and India: in
many Sub-Saharan African countries, bride price is the prevailing norm, while in India, dowry is
the most common practice. Traditionally, the practices of bride price was near-ubiquitous across
and within Sub-Saharan Africa countries: more than 90% of ethnic groups in Sub-Saharan Africa
traditionally paid bride price (Goody, 1976; Murdock, 1967). This practice is not universal in
contemporary Africa, but it remains a widespread practice across the region (see Appendix table
A1). For example, a household panel survey conducted in Zimbabwe in the mid-1990s revealed
near-universality of bride price at the time of marriage; average bride wealth in this data (received
primarily in the form of cattle) was estimated to be two to four times a household’s gross annual
   5
     Traditionally, dowry appears to have served mainly as a pre-mortem bequest made to daughters rather than
as a payment used to clear the marriage market (Goody and Tambiah, 1973). However, with development, dowry
appears to have taken on a function more akin to a groomprice, a price that brides’ parents must pay in order
to ensure a husband for their daughter. The transition of the property rights over dowry from the bride to her
husband is studied in Anderson and Bidner (2015), who document a similar transition in late-middle ages in
Europe. The view of dowry as a pre-mortem bequest to daughters is also at odds with the prevalence of dowry
violence in India, whereby grooms threaten domestic violence in order to get higher transfers from their wife’s
parents (see Bloch and Rao 2002; Sekhri and Storeygard 2013).



                                                      8
income, although partly paid in installments (Decker and Hoogeveen, 2002). Relying on DHS
data, Anderson (2007) reports that bride price was paid in about two-thirds of marriages in rural
Uganda in the 1990s, down from 98% in the period between 1960-1980 and 88% from 1980-1990.
In a large-scale survey conducted by Mbaye and Wagner (2013) in rural Senegal in 2009-2011,
bride price was paid in nearly all marriages. Ashraf, Bau, Nunn, and Voena (2016) document
that the practice is widespread in modern-day Lusaka (Zambia), with payments often exceeding
annual per capita GDP.
       The pioneering work on dowry in economics has focused on historical data from Europe (Bot-
ticini, 1999; Botticini and Siow, 2003), where it served primary a pre-mortem bequest function.
In contemporary India, dowry is paid in virtually all marriages (Anderson, 2007). Interestingly,
although dowry has been practiced in Northern India for centuries, it is a much more recent phe-
nomenon in the South, where bride price traditions were formerly the norm (Caldwell, Reddy,
and Caldwell, 1983; Srinivasan, 2005). Some authors have argued that dowry payments have
grown substantially over the first half of the twentieth century, a phenomenon which has been
explained by slowing population growth, or by hypergamy and the caste system (Rao, 1993;
Anderson, 2003; Sautmann, 2017). Edlund (2006), however, argues that actual net dowries have
experienced little change. In the time period of our study, dowry is widespread across India and
payments are large in magnitude, often significantly above average household income (Anukriti,
Kwon, and Prakash, 2016).
       There are several explanations proffered to explain the existence of dowry in India and
bride price in Africa. Boserup (1970) offers an hypothesis based on differences in women’s
agricultural productivity in the two regions. She argues that in Africa, which has a non-plough
agricultural system, female labor is more important than in Asia, a region characterized by
plough architecture, and this generates marriage payments to move towards the bride’s side of
the market. This hypothesis finds empirical support in Giuliano (2014) who documents a positive
correlation between women’s role in agriculture and the direction of marriage payments.6 In the
theoretical framework we present below, we hence follow this hypothesis as the historical source
of variation in marriage payment norms across countries.
   6
     In a partly different interpretation, Goody and Tambiah (1973) argue that land abundance and low population
density can explain the prevalence of bride price in Africa. The relative scarcity of labor requires men to
compensate the bride’s family for losing her labor, and increases the value of the woman’s ability to produce
offspring. In contrast, in South Asia, where population density is high and land is scarce, men differ substantially
in their land holdings, and women’s own labor and ability to reproduce is relatively less valuable.

2      The model
    In this section, we develop a simple equilibrium model to study how aggregate income fluctu-
ations affect child marriage decisions. Marriage payments play a crucial role in this setting and
their direction determines whether more or fewer women marry early when aggregate income is
low.
    Below, we present a simpler version of the model with logarithmic utility and a uniform
distribution of income heterogeneity. In Appendix B, we extend this framework in two ways.
First, we study how the presence of child labor, and the effect of droughts on children’s wages,
interacts with the marriage market and the marriage payments. Overall, we find that child labor,
and in particular female child labor, strengthens our main proposition. Second, we extend the
model to a more general utility functions and distributions of the heterogeneity.


2.1    Setup

    There is a unit mass of households with a daughter and a unit mass of households with a
son. There are two periods, which correspond to two life stages for a woman, childhood (t = 1)
and adulthood (t = 2). Note that because men tend to to be older than their wife at marriage,
period 1 may correspond to childhood for a woman and typically to young adulthood for a man.
The discount factor is denoted by δ.
    In each period, household income depends on three components: an aggregate realization
of weather, which can take values yt ∈ {y L , y H }, with y L < y H , each occurring with equal
probability independently in every period; an idiosyncratic realization t which is distributed
uniformly on [0, 1]; and last the contribution of adult children labor. Hence, in period t, the
total income of a household i with an adult daughter is equal to yt + it + wf , where wf is a
woman’s contribution to the household budget. Following Boserup’s (1970) interpretation of the
historical origins of marriage payments, we consider historical wf to be either positive or negative
depending on the available technology in the local community: wf > 0 then generate bride price
payment, while a dowry system emerges when wf < 0. The total income of a household j with
an adult son is equal to yt + jt + wm .
    The society is virilocal, and hence upon marriage women move to the groom’s family and
contribute to its budget. With marriage, the groom’s family acquires offspring, which deliver
utility ξ m > 0. There is also a potential utility gain of a woman’s family stemming from marrying

                                                10
off a daughter (for example, not experiencing the stigma associated with non-married women),
denoted as ξ f ≥ 0.


2.2      Adulthood

      We define τt > 0 a payment from the groom’s family to bride’s family (bride price) and
τt < 0 a payment from the bride’s family to the groom’s family (dowry). In adulthood, marriage
occurs if, given possible transfers, both parties prefer getting married to remaining single. This
implies that the following two conditions are satisfies


                                            ln(y2 + i2 + τ2∗ ) + ξ f ≥ ln(y2 + i2 + wf )


                               ln(y2 + j2 + wm + wf − τ2∗ ) + ξ m ≥ ln(y2 + j2 + wm ).

    When total income is sufficiently low, the bounds on τ2∗ may require a payment to take
place, even for the richest families. When historical wf > 0, a bride price payment is necessary
to persuade women’s parents to let their daughters marry, meaning that


                                              ln(yH + 1 + wf ) > ln(yH + 1) + ξ f .


Wherever historically wf < 0, a dowry payment is necessary to persuade men to support a bride
into their household:


                                   ln(yH + 1 + wm ) > ln(yH + 1 + wm + wf ) + ξ m .


    These conditions imply that a lower bound on the marriage payment is equal to τ 2 =
1−exp(ξ f )                     wf                                                exp(ξ m )−1
 exp(ξ f )
            (y2   + i2 ) +   exp(ξ f )
                                        ,   while the upper bound is τ¯2 =         exp(ξ m )
                                                                                              (y2   + j2 + wm ) + wf . In
what follows, we assume that there exists a payment τ2∗ ∈ [τ 2 , τ¯2 ] that satisfies these conditions.
A simple example of equilibrium is one in which men make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the
woman’s parents, and the parents decide whether or not to accept. For example, when ξ f = 0,
men offer τ2∗ = wf . Hence, whenever wf < 0, the transfer is a dowry, i.e. a payment from the
bride’s family to the groom’s family, while with wf ≥ 0, the payment is a bride price, i.e., a
payment from the groom’s family to the bride’s family.
    Following Boserup’s interpretation, the direction of the marriage payment may be due to

                                                                 11
the historical sign of wf , but in what follows, we do not impose that present-day wf has to
differ across areas of the world. In this sense, the fact that marriage payments are the way by
which the marriage markets clear and whether in adulthood grooms’ families (τ2 > 0) or brides’s
families (τ2 < 0) make such payments are cultural norms in this model, intended as a way of
selecting among multiple equilibria (Greif, 1994).
       Given the payment τ2∗ , payoffs from marrying in the second period are ln(y2 + j2 + wm +
wf − τ2∗ ) + ξ m and ln(y2 + j2 + τ2∗ ) + ξ f . If a couple is already married when entering the second
period, the families’ payoffs instead are ln(y2 + j2 + wm + wf ) + ξ m and ln(y2 + i2 ).


2.3       Childhood

   In the first period, parents decide whether or not to have their children marry.7 For a given
transfer τ1 paid in marriages that occur in the first period, payoffs are described below.
       If marriage occurs:


                          ln(y1 + j1 − τ1 ) + δE ln(y2 + j2 + wm + wf ) + ξ m
                                                                               



                                ln(y1 + i1 + τ1 ) + δE ln(y2 + i2 ) + ξ f .
                                                                          


       Instead, if marriage is delayed:


                          ln(y1 + j1 ) + δE ln(y2 + j2 + wf − τ2∗ + wm ) + ξ m
                                                                                



                                ln(y1 + i1 ) + δE ln(y2 + i2 + τ2∗ ) + ξ f .
                                                                           


       A woman from household i will get married in the first period if and only if:


               ln(y1 + i1 + τ1 ) − ln(y1 + i1 ) ≥ δE ln(y2 + i2 + τ2∗ ) − δE ln(y2 + i2 )
                                                                                           

   7
    An interesting extension would be to incorporate parental altruism (Doepke and Zilibotti, forthcoming).
Here, we model the parents as authoritarian. We discuss below a simple extension that captures parents prefer-
ences (or disutility) towards child marriage, which may incorporate the cost that a daughter can face by marrying
as a child.




                                                       12
   A man from household j will get married in the first period if and only if:


ln(y1 + j1 − τ1 )−ln(y1 + j1 ) ≥ δE ln(y2 + j2 + wm + wf − τ2∗ ) − δE ln(y2 + j2 + wm + wf ) .
                                                                                             



  Define the right handside terms as Ωf = δE [ln(y2 + i2 + τ2∗ ) − ln(y2 + i2 )] and
Ωm = δE ln(y2 + j2 + wm + wf − τ2∗ ) − ln(y2 + j2 + wm + wf ) . These quantities represent the
                                                              

option value of waiting to marry in the second period. For simplicity, define also H f = exp(Ωf )
and H m = exp(Ωm ): this definition will become useful below.


2.3.1   Demand and supply for brides in Sub-Saharan Africa

    When τ2∗ > 0, Ωf > 0 and H f > 1. Also Ωm < 0 and hence H m < 1.
   For a given τ1 , define a marginal household with daughter i such that:


                               ln(y1 + f1 ∗ + τ1 ) − ln(y1 + f1 ∗ ) = Ωf


   Given the expression above, there exists a threshold income shock for women’s parents such
that, when it < f ∗ (τ1 ), parents will want their daughter to marry in the first period. Hence,
because of the uniform assumption, a measure f ∗ of women wants to get married. The supply
of brides, defined on the [0, 1] interval, takes the form

                                                           τ1
                                      S BP (y1 , τ1 ) =        − y1 .                          (1)
                                                          Hf−1

and is decreasing in the aggregate income y1 and increasing in τ1 .
   For a given τ1 , also define a marginal household with son j such that:


                              ln(y1 + m∗ − τ1 ) − ln(y1 + m∗ ) = Ωm .


For jt > m∗ , men want to also marry in the first period. Hence, because of the uniform
assumption, a measure 1 − m∗ wants to get married. The demand for brides, again defined on
the [0, 1] interval, takes the form

                                                                 τ1
                                 DBP (y1 , τ1 ) = 1 + y1 +           ,                         (2)
                                                               Hm −1



                                                     13
which is increasing in the aggregate income y1 and decreasing in τ1 .


2.3.2     Demand and supply for brides in India

    In India, τ2∗ < 0. This implies that Ωf < 0 and hence that H f < 1. Also Ωm > 0 and hence
H m > 1.
   The supply of brides takes the form

                                                                    τ1

                                                                Hf   −1

and is increasing in the aggregate income y1 and increasing in τ1 (which is the opposite of the
dowry).
   The demand for brides takes the form

                                                                  τ1
                                   DDOW (y1 , τ1 ) = −y1 −                                               (4)

which is decreasing in the aggregate income y1 and decreasing in τ1 .


2.3.3     Equilibrium in the marriage market

    Equilibrium marriage payment which clears the marriage market in the first period is the
one that solves D(y1 , τ1∗ ) = S(y1 , τ1∗ ), which in both economies is



                                             (H f − 1)(H m − 1)
                               τ1∗ (y1 ) =                      (1 + 2y1 ).
                                                  Hm − Hf

   Equilibrium quantities are computed by substituting the equilibrium price in the demand or
in the supply equation. Equilibrium quantities of marriages are equal to

               1 + 2y1 − H f y1 − H m (1 + y1 )                         1 + 2y1 − H f (1 + y1 ) − H m y1
  Q(y1 )BP =                                    ,         Q(y1 )DOW =                                    .
                         Hf − Hm                                                  Hm − Hf

Proposition 1. For sufficiently large wm , aggregate income decreases the number of child mar-
riage in equilibrium in societies in which marriage payments are positive (i.e. bride price), and
increases the number of child marriage in equilibrium in societies in which marriage payments
are negative (i.e. dowry).

                                                     14
Proof. See Appendix B.

                                                                                                  1
   Intuitively, our results carry through when the supply curve for brides is flatter (slope   H f −1

with bride price and − H f1−1 with dowry) than the demand curve for brides (slope − H m1−1 with
                    1
bride price and   H m −1
                           with dowry, see Figure 1). This happens because a son’s income provides
insurance to his parents, thus reducing the absolute value of the option of waiting to marry
in the second period and making the change in the equilibrium quantity of marriage when
aggregate income changes more reflective of the bride’s family’s response than of the groom’s
family’s response. In other words, both the demand and the supply of brides are affected by
the aggregate income. The key to why equilibrium quantities respond in the opposite way to
income shocks in different economies, depending on the direction of the marriage payment, is
that women’s families are less price sensitive then men’s families, who can rely on their adult
son’s income (and potentially also on their daughter-in-law’s income) even after the marriage
has occurred.
   The model also generates a prediction on how marriage payments should vary with aggregate
income.

Proposition 2. Marriage payments are lower when aggregate income is lower.

Proof. See Appendix B.

   This finding, particularly in the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, is related to the literature on
firesales, in which assets are liquidated at lower prices during recessions (Shleifer and Vishny,
1992). Here, droughts are associated with low aggregate output, which is associated with lower
prices irrespectively of the direction of the payments.
   In sum, this model shows that the direction of marriage payments is likely to play a crucial
role in determining how aggregate income shocks affect the probability of child marriage. In
particular, in this model, it is the same mechanism (i.e. virilocality) which generates this type
of asymmetry: we do not need to invoke any other systematic difference between contexts to
generate the main theoretical predictions.
   Other mechanisms can generate these predictions within this model. For example, interesting
dynamics arise if we allow parents to have preferences over the timing of marriage, by introducing
a gender-specific cost or benefit of marrying in the first period ξ1f and ξ1m , which can be positive
or negative. These terms affect the slope of the demand and of the supply for brides: to see how

                                                  15
they would function, it is sufficient to redefine H f = exp(Ωf ) − ξ1f and H m = exp(Ωm ) − ξ1m . For
instance, if men especially valued marrying younger (more fertile) women, i.e. if ξ1m > 0, then
bride price payments in the first period would be higher and dowry payments would be lower
than with ξ1m = 0. However, in order for these preferences alone to generate opposite responses
to shocks for dowry and bride price economies, preferences for child marriage would need to vary
systematically across economies as well, which is something that has not been documented in
the literature.8



3        Data and descriptive statistics
        In this section, we describe the sources of data that we exploit to test the main predictions of
our model in Sub-Saharan Africa and in India. All datasets used in the analysis are summarized
in Appendix table A2.


3.1        Marriage data

        Our main data source are the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). DHS are nationally-
representative, household-level surveys carried out in developing countries around the world.
For Sub-Saharan Africa, we assembled all the publicly-available DHS between 1994 and 2013
where geocoded data are available, resulting in a total of 73 surveys across 31 countries.9 In the
DHS, GPS data consist of the geographical coordinates of each DHS cluster (group of villages
or urban neighborhoods) in the sample and are crucial for our analysis to identify respondents
exposed to local rainfall shocks. The list of African countries and survey waves included in the
analysis is reported in the Appendix table A3. For India, we use the DHS collected in 1998 for a
direct comparison with the DHS Sub-Saharan Africa sample. In addition, to span a larger time
horizon and to exploit useful information about marriage migration, we check that our results
are robust to the inclusion of the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) from 2004-05.10
    8
      For example, assume that the option values is the same for both genders and define it Ω. In order for
droughts to increase child marriage in bride price economies, we would need that ξ1f + ξ1m < 2Ω − 2 (i.e. the joint
utility premium for early marriage in Sub-Saharan Africa should be small), while for droughts to decrease child
marriage in dowry economies, we need that ξ1f + ξ1m > 2Ω − 2 (i.e. the joint utility premium for early marriage
in India should be large enough).
    9
      In addition to the 30 countries with publicly available data, we request access to the restricted DHS survey
from Eritrea.
   10
      The DHS India surveys are also referred to as the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS). There are two
additional DHS surveys available for India: one conducted in 1992, and one conducted in 2005, but they do not


                                                        16
    Across all the surveys, the information on a woman’s age at first marriage is collected ret-
rospectively during the woman’s interview: women are asked to recall the age, month and year
when they were first married.11 The main difference across the surveys is the universe of women
that is sampled for the interview. In the Africa DHS, all women in the household between
the ages of 15 and 49 are interviewed. In contrast, in the India DHS, all ever-married women
aged 15-49 in the household are interviewed.12 In order to ensure comparability across surveys
and avoid excluding never-married women in the sample from Sub-Saharan Africa, we limit our
analysis to women who are at least 25 years old at the time of the interview. By this age, most
women are married (87% in our African sample). To look at comparable cohorts across the two
sets of surveys, we focus on women born between 1950 and 1989.
    In the light of the evidence on the correlation between rainfall and conflicts (Miguel, Satyanath,
and Sergenti, 2004) and between civil conflict and marriage (Jayaraman, Gebreselassie, and
Chandrasekhar, 2009; La Mattina, 2017), we expect that marriage markets will be significantly
affected by the intensity of civil conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa. For this reasons, we exclude
women exposed to major civil conflicts between ages 12 and 17. To identify the onset and end of
the main conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa in our sample period, we use data from UCDP/PRIO
Armed Conflict Dataset, as detailed in Appendix table A4.
    As reported in table 1 Panel A, our final sample consists of 326,645 women in Sub-Saharan
Africa, and 66,466 women in India. Figure 2 plots the distribution of ages of marriage in our
data. We consider women who marry from age 12 onwards. Indeed, only few marriages are
recorded before the age of 12 years. In both regions, the hazard into early marriage is relatively
low up until age 13 or 14, which is consistent with the hypothesis that girls are often considered
ready for marriage at the onset of puberty, that usually occurs sometime in the early teenage
years (Field and Ambrus, 2008). The mean age at first marriage is low, 18.7 years in Africa and
provide information on women’s district of residence: this is why we complement our Indian data with the IHDS
instead. The IHDS is a nationally-representative, household-level survey first carried out in 2004-05. A second
wave was held in 2011-12, but it features primarily panel information on the married women who were already
interviewed in the previous wave, and hence does not add a significant number of observations to the 2005 sample.
The two Indian surveys do not contain GPS coordinate information; instead, they provide information on each
woman’s district of residence, which we can use to match each observation to the history of weather shocks.
   11
      The exact questions are: "Are you currently/Have you ever been married or lived together with a man as
if married?", "In what month and year did you start living with your husband/partner?" or "Now I would like
to ask about when you started living with your first husband/partner. In what month and year was that?" and
"How old were you when you first started living with him?". Note that the India DHS do not elicit information
on the month of first marriage.
   12
      In the IHDS, only one ever-married woman aged 15-49 is interviewed in each household.



                                                       17
17.6 years in India, and a significant fraction of women are marrying before age 18 (46.7% and
53.9% in Africa and India, respectively).


3.2       Weather data and construction of weather shocks

       To examine how income shocks affect the early marriage hazard for young women, we
follow an approach that is widely used in the economics literature, exploiting variation in local
rainfall as a proxy for local economic conditions (see Jayachandran (2006); Burke, Gong, and
Jones (2015); Kaur (2014); Shah and Steinberg (2016) among many others). The appeal of
this approach is that rainfall is an exogenous event that has meaningful effects on economic
productivity in both Africa and India, where rural households rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture
for their economic livelihood. Droughts, in particular, tend to suppress agricultural output,
which has deleterious effects on households’ incomes.
       To construct a measure of local droughts, we use rainfall data produced by geographers at
the University of Delaware ("UDel data"). The UDel dataset provides estimates of monthly
precipitation on a 0.5 x 0.5 degree grid covering terrestrial areas across the globe, for the 1900-
2010 period.13 For Africa, we use the GPS information in the DHS data to match each DHS
cluster to the weather grid cell and calculate rainfall shocks at the grid cell level. Our main
sample matches up to 3,180 unique grid cells across 31 countries in the Sub-Saharan African
region, each of which is approximately 2,500 square kilometers in area. For India, the lack
of GPS coordinate information prevents us from using the same approach. Instead, we use a
mapping software to intersect the UDel weather grid with a district map for India, and then
calculate land-area weighted average rainfall estimates for each district. Of the 675 districts in
India, 440 in 26 states are represented in our main sample, and these districts have a mean area
of over 5,000 square kilometers.
       The existing economic literature implements a wide variety of methodologies to construct
measures of relative rainfall shocks. Here, we adapt an approach used by Burke, Gong, and Jones
(2015) and define a drought as calendar year rainfall below the 15th percentile of a location’s
(grid cell or district) long-run rainfall distribution. We use a long-run time series (1950-2010) of
  13
    0.5 degrees is equivalent to about 50 kilometers at the equator. The rainfall estimates in the UDel data are
based on climatologically-aided interpolation of available weather station information and are widely relied upon
in the existing economic literature (see for example Dell, Jones, and Olken 2012; Burke, Gong, and Jones 2015).
For a detailed overview of the UDel data and other global weather data sets, see Dell, Jones, and Olken 2013.

rainfall observations to fit a gamma distribution of calendar year rainfall for each location. We
then use the estimated gamma distribution for a particular location to assign each calendar year
rainfall realization to its corresponding percentile in the distribution. We also explore robustness
to a rich set of alternative definitions of rainfall shocks.
   This measure of rainfall is particularly appealing given the requirements of our research de-
sign. First, as we document in the next subsection, our drought measure has a sizable impact
on local crop yields. Second, this measure of drought is orthogonal to permanent local charac-
teristics which are likely to influence the timing of marriage, such as the economic development
of an area and the economic opportunities available to women (e.g. access to schooling, labor
market condition, etc.). By defining the shock at a given location as calendar year rainfall be-
low the 15th percentile of that location’s historical rainfall distribution, all locations have the
same probability to experience a shock in any given year. Thus, by construction, this measure
of shock should be orthogonal to unobserved local characteristics. Although each location is
equally likely to have experienced a shock in any given year, rainfall in a given location varies
over time, so our identifying variation comes from the random timing of the shocks.
   In Appendix figure A1 we plot the percentage of grid cells (for Sub-Saharan Africa) and
districts (for India) exposed to drought in each calendar year. Given that droughts are defined
as a variation in rainfall below the 15th percentile, the average probability of experiencing a
shock in each region is close to 15%. Most importantly, figure A1 provides evidence that our
rainfall shock measures are orthogonal to long-run rainfall trends, thus limiting the concern of
a spurious relationship driving our results.


3.3     Weather shocks and crop yields

      The relationship between weather shocks and agricultural output is well established in
the literature. In this subsection, we explore how the specific measure of rainfall shocks we
constructed affects aggregate crop yields in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. To do so, we combine
the rainfall data with yield data, which are available annually for each country in Sub-Saharan
Africa over the period 1960-2010 from the FAOStat and for India over the 1957-1987 period
from the World Bank India Agriculture and Climate Data Set.
   For Sub-Saharan Africa, we estimate the impact of drought on the natural logarithm of yields
of the five main staple crops growing in the continent: maize, sorghum, millet, rice, and wheat.


                                                  19
Since we only have country-level yield data, we construct measures of country-level droughts
in the same manner as in the main analysis. All the estimates include year and country fixed
effects, so the impact of drought on agricultural output is identified from between-countries
and between-years variation in rainfall. As shown in table 2, droughts (rainfall below the 15th
percentile) reduce maize, rice, wheat, sorghum and millet yields looking both at the set of Sub-
Saharan African countries available in the FAO database (columns 1-6) and at the 31 countries
part of our DHS sample (columns 7-12). In particular, droughts reduce average cereals yields
by 12 percent (columns 6 and 12, p < 0.01).
    Similarly, for India, we rely on crop yield data from the World Bank, which has the great
advantage of providing crop yields at the district level. We look at the impact of rainfall shocks
(constructed at the district-level) on the natural logarithm of the yields of five most important
crops in the country (rice, wheat, jowar, maize and bajra). As reported in table 3, droughts
negatively and strongly affects yields of all the major crops cultivated in India. On average,
drought reduces average crop yields by 16% (column 6, p < 0.01).
    These findings are further supported by the evidence provided in Appendix figures A2 and
A3, where we plot the coefficients for dummies for each vingtile of the rainfall realization on the
natural logarithm of crop yields, to explore the relationship between shocks and yields across the
distribution of rainfall realizations. In Sub-Saharan Africa, lower rainfall is clearly associated
with lower agricultural output, but it is harder to identify a clear positive relationship between
higher rainfall realization and crop yields, at least with the type of geographical variation that
we are exploiting (figure A2). Similar patterns are found for crop yields in India, where we
document a consistently positive correlation between rainfall and yields for low levels of rain,
and a less clear one for higher levels (figure A3). The notable exception is rice, for which a
higher level of rainfall realization is positively associated with output (panel b).
    Overall, the evidence provided in this subsection confirms that our constructed measure of
drought strongly reduces agricultural output in both Sub-Saharan Africa and in India over our
sample period, serving as a useful proxy for adverse income shocks in both regions.



4    Empirical strategy
    To examine the impact of weather shocks on the timing of marriage and on the hazard
into early marriage, we estimate a simple discrete approximation of a duration model, adapted

                                                20
from Currie and Neidell (2005). Below, we discuss our baseline specification. We also present
additional specifications to study the characteristics of the marriages that occur during droughts
and the long-term effects of rainfall shocks on age of marriage and fertility. Finally, we discuss
the main potential threats to our identification strategy.


4.1       Main specification

       The duration of interest is the time between t0 , the age when a woman is first at risk of
getting married, and tm , the age when she enters her first marriage. In our analysis, t0 is age
12, which is the minimum age at which a non-negligible number of women in our sample report
getting married for the first time.
       We convert our data into person-year panel format. Hence, a woman who is married at age
tm contributes (tm − t0 + 1) observations to the sample: one observation for each at-risk year
until she is married, after which she exits the data. We merge these individual data with our
rainfall data at the year level. In Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is typically one rainy season in
the first half of the year and one in the second half, and where marriages occur rather uniformly
throughout the year according to DHS data, we consider the calendar year in which a woman is
age t. In India, where 70% of marriages in our IHDS data occur in the first half of the year, and
where the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons are in the second half of the year, we consider
rainfall in the year preceding the one in which the woman turns age t.
       Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the person-year merged sample used in the analysis.
Using this sample, we estimate the probability of marriage of woman i living in location g (grid
cell in Sub-Saharan Africa, district in India) born in cohort k and entering her first marriage at
age t as follows
                                 Mi,g,k,t = Xg,k,t β + αt + ωg + γk + i,g,k,t .                                (5)

       The dependent variable, Mi,g,k,t is a binary variable coded as 1 in the year the woman gets
married, and zero otherwise. Since we are interested in early marriage, we examine data on
women till age 24 or 17, depending on the specification. Thus, women married after age 24, or
17, are right censored.14 The variable Xg,k,t is a time-varying measure of weather conditions in
location g during the year in which the woman born in year k is age t. Specifically, included
  14
    For example, a woman who is married at age 16 would appear five times in the regression for child marriage,
and her marriage vector would be {Mi,k,12 , ..., Mi,k,15 , Mi,k,16 } = {0, ..., 0, 1}. A woman who is not married by
age 17 appears in the data six times, and her marriage vector is a string of zeroes.


                                                        21
in Xg,k,t are a dummy indicator for a drought in a given year. β are the main coefficients of
interest and measure the effect of rainfall shocks on the probability of marriage. αt is a vector
of age fixed effects, which controls for the fact that marriage has a different probability to occur
at different ages. We include location-specific fixed effects, ωg , to control for time-invariant local
unobservable characteristics, such as geographic, economic and cultural factors, and year-of-
birth fixed effects γk to account for cohort effects. Since we are combining data across multiple
countries, we use population-weighted survey weights to make the results representative of the
countries included in the analysis. We estimate regressions with standard errors clustered at
the grid-cell (for Sub-Saharan Africa) or district (for India) level, to allow for serial correlation
in the error terms across women in the same area, and show robustness to clustering at larger
geographic units.
   With the inclusion of location (grid cell or district) and year of birth fixed effects, the
impact of weather shocks on the early marriage hazard is identified from within-location and
within-year-of-birth variation in weather shocks and marriage outcomes. The key identifying
assumption of the analysis is that, within a given location and year of birth, the weather shocks
included in Xg,k,t are orthogonal to potential confounders. The exogeneity of rainfall shocks is
particularly important in our setting because, given the retrospective nature of our analysis,
there are many unobservables for which we cannot control for. Most importantly, we lack data
on parental wealth or poverty status around the time of a woman’s marriage, on the educational
background of her parents, and on the numbers and ages of her siblings, all of which will affect
the marital timing decisions (Vogl, 2013).
   To control for cohort-specific changes in marriage behavior at the country (Sub-Saharan
Africa) or state (India) level, such as a change in the legal age at marriage, we include additional
specification that control for country or state fixed effects interacted with ten-year birth cohort
fixed effects.


4.2    Cross-sectional regressions

   To study the characteristics of couples that form during droughts, we examine the following
specifications, for household i living in location g (grid cell in Sub-Saharan Africa, district in
India) born in cohort k and married in year τ :




                                                  22
                             yi,g,k,τ = Xg,k,τ β + δτ + ωg + γk + ζi + i,g,k,τ .                            (6)

       In this specification, Xg,k,τ are time-varying measures of weather conditions (i.e. droughts)
in location g during the year in which the woman marries τ . We control for location fixed effects
ωg , for current age (at the time of the survey) fixed effects ζi , for year of birth γk , and for year of
marriage δτ . It is important to notice that we cannot assign any causal interpretation to these
estimates, as they are the result of both selection forces (i.e. the characteristics of individuals
who chose to marry during a drought may differ from those who didn’t) and causal forces (i.e.
the fact that a couple married during a drought may lead to different long-term outcomes).15


4.3       Long-run effects of droughts

       To study the long-term effects of droughts on fertility, we follow Burke, Gong, and Jones
(2015) and we define our main explanatory variable as the number of droughts experienced by
a woman over different age ranges. Hence, we run the following specification for woman i living
in location g and born in year k:


                             yi,g,k = Xg,k,t β + Zi,g δ + ωg + γk + ζi + i,g,k,t .                          (7)

       In this specification, y represents two outcome variables: the age of marriage and the total
number of children, while X is a vector containing the number of droughts that woman i has
experienced over different age ranges: 12-14, 15-17,18-20, 21-24. In addition to location and year-
of-birth fixed effect, we control for country fixed effects and for current age also in Sub-Saharan
Africa.


4.4       Threats to identification

       A potential threat to our identification strategy comes from the fact that we are considering
weather shocks in the respondent’s location at the time of the survey rather than at the time
of marriage. Unfortunately, the DHS (and the IHDS) elicit information on where a women
currently resides, but not on where she resided around the time of her first marriage. This data
  15
    In India, when we are using a cross-sectional dataset from 1998, current age and birth year are collinear and
hence it is sufficient to control for year-of-birth fixed effect (i.e. ζi is not identified).



                                                       23
limitation may introduce error in our measure of rainfall shocks if the respondent’s recorded
place of residence is different, and sufficiently far, from her location at the time of marriage.
This can happen for two main reasons. The first one relates to the custom of virilocality. In India
and in many parts of Africa, a daughter joins the household of the groom and his family at the
time of marriage. Thus, the village they live in at the time of the survey may differ from the one
where they grew up in. In their seminal paper on marriage migration (Rosenzweig and Stark,
1989) argue that marrying a daughter to a man in a distant village reduces the co-movement of
parental household income and daughter’s household income, which facilitates the possibility of
making inter-household transfers in times of need.16 The second reason is due to the possibility
that the respondent and her families may simply migrate after marriage but before the survey
takes place.
       While virilocality is common in both regions, the available data on marriage migration in-
dicates that most married women do not move far from their natal home. Table A5 in the
Appendix reports migration pattern for the set of African countries in our analysis and for
India. Panel A, column 1, shows that more than 77% of women do not move at the time of
marriage in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, when migration does occur, previous literature
suggests that it happens across relatively short distances. Mbaye and Wagner (2013) collect
data in Senegal and find that married women live an average of 20 kilometers from their natal
home. Unfortunately, information on the distance from natal home to the current location is
not available in the DHS.
       In India, marriage migration is more common: 58.02% of women migrated at the time of
marriage. Again, though, migration happens at a relative close distance or likely within the
geographic area at which we define our rainfall shocks. By exploiting information in the IHDS,
we found that the median travel time between a married woman’s current residence and her
natal home is 2 hours at the median and less than 6 hours for 90% of the respondents (see
table A5, panel B). To better understand migration patterns in India, we also look at empirical
evidence coming from previous literature. In Rosenzweig and Stark (1989)’s South Indian village
data (ICRISAT), the average distance between a woman’s current place of residence and her
natal home is 30 kilometers. As described in Atkin (2016), according to the 1983 and the 1987-
  16
    This explanation has questioned in a recent work by Fulford (2013), who shows that inter-household transfers
from daughters to parents are virtually non-existent in India, and that households in areas with high rainfall
volatility do not send daughters to more distant villages, as might be expected under the theory.



                                                      24
88 Indian National Sample Surveys (NSS), only 6.1% of households are classified as "migrant
households", those for which the enumeration village differs from the respondent’s last usual
residence. Furthermore, only a small percentage of women move after marriage and even if they
migrate, they do not move very far away.
    While marriage migration over vast geographic areas does not appear to be a major threat
in our contexts, another potential concern for our identification strategy is whether marriage
migration may happen differentially during a drought. For example, if women who are getting
married are more likely to migrate to an area exposed to a drought, we would expect a positive
correlation between marriage probability and droughts. On the contrary, if women are less
likely to migrate to a drought area at marriage, we would expect a negative correlation between
marriage probability and droughts to arise spuriously. To examine whether either of these
scenarios is likely to occur, we estimate the relationship between the occurrence of a drought at
the time of marriage and a set of marriage migrations outcomes from the DHS and the IHDS. In
Sub-Saharan Africa, women do not appear less likely to have remained in their village of birth
(table A6, column 1), nor to have migrated for marriage during a drought (column 2). In India,
we do not find that drought affect marriage migration, nor distance from the village of origin
(table A6, columns 3-5).
    Taken together, the available information on marriage migration in Africa and India suggests
that most of the women who move away from their natal home at the time of marriage are not
likely to be migrating out of the geographic areas over which we measure the rainfall shocks. In
addition, they do not appear to change their migration patterns in response to droughts. Hence,
marriage migration is unlikely to significantly bias our estimates.
    A final potential threat to our identification strategy comes from measurement error in
women’s recollections of the age and year of marriage. Errors in women’s recollections will lead
to greater imprecision in our estimates. Overall, validations studies of age variables in the DHS
have suggested that such measures are rather accurate (Pullum, 2006), limiting concerns about
this form of measurement error.



5     Main results
    Our main results examine the effect of droughts on the timing of marriage and particularly
on the hazard into child marriage in Sub-Saharan Africa and in India.

                                               25
5.1       Effect of rainfall shocks on the timing of marriage

       Table 4 reports our first set of results: the effect of adverse rainfall shocks on the timing
of marriage for young women aged 12 to 24. We report the estimated coefficients for equation
5 separately for the Sub-Saharan African countries in our sample (columns 1-3) and for India
(columns 4-5). All specifications for the Sub-Saharan Africa sample include grid cell fixed effects
and those for India include district fixed effects. Consistently with our theoretical model, we
find that adverse rainfall shocks have opposite effects on the timing of marriage in the two
regions: in Sub-Saharan Africa, droughts increase the probability of early marriage while in
India droughts decrease it. In Africa, women who experience a drought between ages 12 and
24 are 0.37 percentage points (pp) more likely to get married in the same year (columns 1-2,
p < 0.01). The average annual marriage hazard for this age group is equal to 0.113, and hence
the effect corresponds approximately to a 3.3% increase. Even after controlling for fixed effects
for each country-by-cohort of birth combination, we find that the effect of a drought is equal to
3.2 percentage points (column 3, p < 0.01).17 In line with the predictions of our model, income
shocks have an opposite effect among Indian women. In India, women who experience a drought
between ages 12 and 24 are 0.41pp less likely to get married in a given year (column 4, p < 0.01).
Given a mean of the dependent variable of 0.145, this effect corresponds approximately to a 2.8%
decline. Including fixed effects for the interaction between states dummies and cohort dummies
further decreases the coefficient to -0.44pp (column 5, p < 0.01).
       In figure 4, we explore the heterogeneity of this effect by the woman’s age by interacting
drought with each age dummy. Consistently with our model, the effects are concentrated in
early years, and particularly among child marriages (before the age of 18) in both countries. In
Sub-Saharan Africa, the strongest effects are observed between ages 15 and 18 and at age 21,
with no effects at later ages (panel a). In India, the effects are concentrated between ages 14
and 16 only (panel b).
       Hence, in table 5 we focus on child marriage, our main outcome variable. We restrict the
panel dimension of our dataset between age 12 and 17, and find that, similarly to what reported
above, droughts have opposite effects on the hazard into marriage at these early ages in the
two regions. In Sub-Saharan Africa, girls who experience a drought between ages 12 and 17
are 0.2-0.26pp more likely to get married in the same year (columns 1-2, p < 0.05 and column
  17
    Cohorts dummies are defined as ten-years intervals in the year of marriage (1950-1959, 1960-1969, 1970-1979,
1980-1989).


                                                      26
3, p < 0.10). The average annual marriage hazard for this age group is equal to 0.088, and
hence the effect corresponds to a 2.3%-3% increase in the annual hazard of child marriage. In
India, women who experience a drought between ages 12 and 17 are 0.46-0.47pp less likely to
get married in that same year (columns 4-5, p < 0.01). Given a mean of the dependent variable
of 0.109, this effect corresponds to a 4.2-4.3% decline in the annual hazard of child marriage.
      In subsection 6.3, we extensively analyze the robustness of these findings to alternative
specifications of the sample and of the main independent variable.


5.2      Heterogeneity of the effects between and within countries

      Why does a negative rainfall shock, which affect agricultural output in the same way in
Sub-Saharan Africa and India, have an opposite effect on the timing of marriage and most
importantly on the harmful practice of child marriages? As illustrated in our theoretical model,
the traditional marriage payments that prevail in the two regions can generate incentives for
parents to time their children’s marriage as a consumption smoothing mechanism. In this section,
we examine whether the direction and the intensity of marriage payment norms can account for
the heterogeneity in the effects of droughts between and within the countries in our sample.


5.2.1     Effects by marriage payment norm in Sub-Saharan Africa

      We first exploit historical heterogeneity in marriage payments across ethnic groups in dif-
ferent countries within Sub-Saharan Africa. Our data source for measuring traditional marriage
customs in different ethnic groups is George Peter Murdock’s (1967) Ethnographic Atlas. The
Atlas provides historical information on transfers made at marriage, either bride price or dowry,
by ethnic groups and has been extensively used in the literature, often in combination with
the DHS (see Alesina, Giuliano, and Nunn 2013, Alesina, Brioschi, and La Ferrara 2016 and
Michalopoulos, Putterman, and Weil 2016 among others). For each ethnic group, the Atlas
provides information about the mode of marriage (variable v6 in the database), which is the
traditional marriage payment norm. We use the information from the Ethnomaps on the size of
each ethnic group in a given country to construct a measure of prevalence of the bride price norm
within each country in our sample, as reported in Appendix Table A1.18 Countries with a share
of the population belonging to ethnic groups with a bride price prevalence equal or greater than
 18
      Ethnomaps are available at http://www.ethnomaps.ch/hpm-e/atlas-e.html, accessed February 7, 2016.


                                                   27
50% include all Sub-Saharan Africa countries except Eritrea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique
and Zambia. Figure 3 clearly shows across-countries variation in marriage payments custom in
the countries in our sample.
   By using historical information on marriage payments at the country level, rather than actual
payments, we circumvent a fundamental empirical challenge. First of all, information on actual
bride price payments is unfortunately not available in the DHS nor in any cross-country source
of data for Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, bride price payments are endogenous to the economic
circumstances at the time of marriage, as shown in our model. We follow Ashraf, Bau, Nunn,
and Voena (2016), who use data from Zambia and Indonesia to show that bride price payments
are substantially higher among ethnic groups that traditionally engage in bride price payments
according to the Ethnographic Atlas.
   In table 6, we report the estimated effects of rainfall shocks in Sub-Saharan Africa exploiting
heterogeneity in bride price prevalence across countries. Columns 1 and 2 show the effect of
drought on child marriage for the subsample of Sub-Saharan Africa countries where the bride
price custom is the prevailing norm (BP≥ 50%). Descriptive statistics or this sample are reported
in table 1 Panel B. We find that droughts have a strong effect on the early marriage hazard:
during a drought, the annual hazard into child marriage increases by 0.26pp or 3% (columns 1-2,
p < 0.05). On the contrary, no statistically significant association between adverse rainfall shocks
and child marriage emerge in countries with a bride price prevalence lower than 50% (columns
3-4). Hence, in areas where bride price is the prevalent mode of payment at the time of marriage,
households hit by negative income shocks and with little access to credit market encourage their
daughters to marry before they reach adulthood to obtain the bride price payment at a time
when the marginal utility of consumption is the highest. More interestingly, on average there
does not appear to be a relationship between aggregate income fluctuations and the timing of
marriage in countries where marriage payments are not among the majority of the population.
   To dig deeper into the role played by marriage payments in shaping early marriage’s de-
cision, we next test our main effect in Eritrea. According to the Ethnographic Atlas and the
Ethnomaps, the Tigrigna people of central Eritrea – the largest ethnic group in the country,
originating from Egypt – is the only ethnic group to engage in dowry payments within Sub-
Saharan Africa. Several sources report that dowry is now widespread throughout the country,
even though multiple norms coexist (Tronvoll, 1998; Gebremedhin, 2002; Favali and Pateman,



                                                28
2003; Tesfagiorgis, 2010). Hence, we next study the effect of droughts using data from the
2002 Eritrea DHS.19 According to our model, we should observe a negative relationship between
droughts and early marriages in countries where young girls’ families have to pay a dowry at
marriage: when adverse shocks occur, parents would prefer to wait to marry their daughter. The
results reported in column 5 of table 6 confirm this hypothesis: when focusing on Eritrea only,
we find that droughts reduce the hazard of child marriage in the same year by 1.2pp (a 14%
reduction, p < 0.10). This finding further indicates that marriage payments indeed are likely to
play a role in marriage’s decisions: even within Africa, in the presence of an income shock and
in places where dowry is the prevailing mode of payment at marriage, a young girl is less likely
to get married when a drought occurs.
       To further corroborate our theory, we explore the relationship between traditional marriage
payments and the impact of drought on child marriage by exploiting heterogeneity in marriage
payments customs within Sub-Saharan Africa countries, taking advantage of the comprehensive
concordance of the ethnic groups reported in the DHS to those featured in the Ethnographic
Atlas compiled by Alesina, Brioschi, and La Ferrara (2016). Out of the five countries where less
than 50% of the population engages in bride price payments (see table A1), Alesina, Brioschi,
and La Ferrara (2016) features a concordance for three countries: Malawi, Mozambique and
Zambia. We restrict our within-country analysis to Malawi and Zambia because the extensive
civil conflict in Mozambique substantially limits the sample size from this country (see table
A4). In Zambia, as documented with unique survey data on bride price payments from Lusaka
collected by Ashraf, Bau, Nunn, and Voena (2016), ethnic groups that historically engage in bride
price payments make significantly larger bride price payments today, while other groups, which
are often classified as making so-called "token" bride price payments in the Ethnographic Atlas,
make lower bride price payments today. Hence, at least for Zambia, we know that historical
norms related to bride price have predictive power for current behavior. No microeconomic data
on bride price payments is available for Malawi, to the best of our knowledge. In Appendix table
A7, we report the coefficients that we obtain for estimating equation 5 separately for Malawi
(columns 1-3) and for Zambia (columns 4-6). Of course, the power of his exercise is limited by
the small number of observations in each subsample: 17,140 women in Malawi and 11,913 in
Zambia. While no effects of droughts on child marriage can be detected in Malawi, we find that

in Zambia, girls from ethnic groups that traditionally engage in bride price payments are 0.94pp
more likely to marry when a drought occurs between ages 12 and 17 (column 6). Compared
to a mean of the dependent variable of 0.084, this effect corresponds to approximately a 12%
increase (column 6, p < 0.10).


5.2.2   Heterogenous effects within India

   In contemporary India, dowry payments are widespread across all regions, castes and ethnic
groups (Anukriti, Kwon, and Prakash, 2016). Yet, the literature extensively documents and
reports that they originated in the Hindu community (Goody and Tambiah, 1973), among
which the tradition remains stronger (Borooah and Iyer, 2004; Bloch, Rao, and Desai, 2004;
Srinivasan, 2005). We therefore investigate the effect of rainfall shocks on the hazard into early
marriage, exploiting heterogeneity across religious groups, and focusing on Hindus and Muslims,
who constitute 75% and 11% of our sample respectively, compared to all other religious groups
(Christians 7%, Sikhs 3% and other smaller groups).
   In table 7, we augmented equation 5 with the interaction between drought and a dummy
variable equal to 1 if women i reported Hinduism as main religion and 0 otherwise in the DHS
(Hindu), a dummy variable equal to 1 if women i reported Islam as main religion and 0 otherwise
in the DHS (Muslim) and the interaction between drought and a dummy variable indicating that
the respondent belong to another religious group (Others). We also interact birth year and age
fixed effects with the full set of religion dummies. Column 1 shows that the coefficients on
Drought × Hindu is equal to -0.53pp (p < 0.01), while the one on Muslims is close to zero,
suggesting that the effect of negative rainfall shock on early marriages is concentrated among
groups where dowry payment is a deeply rooted cultural norm. These findings are robust to
the inclusion of the interaction between state fixed effects and cohort fixed effects, although the
difference between the coefficients becomes attenuated in this specification (column 2).
   Overall the results in tables 6, A7 and 7 suggest that norms on marriage payments in different
contexts can generate an opposite effect of how an economic shock affects households’ decisions
on child marriage, while there does not appear to be any effect of droughts on child marriage
where marriage payments are not customary.

6        Additional results and robustness checks
    In this section, we first study the effects of rainfall shocks on the timing of fertility and on
the number of children. We then investigate the characteristics of the matches that form during
droughts. Lastly, we examine the robustness of our main findings to a wide array of specification
tests.


6.1      Effects of rainfall shocks on fertility

    A dramatic consequence of child marriage is early fertility, which is arguably one of the most
important risks facing teenage girls in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa
(Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer, 2015). In addition to its socioeconomic consequences, pregnancy in
adolescence is associated with increased risks of maternal and fetal complications, including pre-
mature delivery (Kirbas, Gulerman, and Daglar, 2016), and with worse health and socioeconomic
outcomes for the next generation (Fergusson and Woodward, 1999; Chari, Heath, Maertens, and
Fatima, 2017). In our sample from Sub-Saharan Africa and India, 32% and 31.5% of women
respectively have their first child before turning 18.
    Documenting an effect of weather shocks on the timing of fertility is also important to show
that our main findings are likely to have long-term consequences on women’s lives, and possibly
on those of their children. Hence, in what follows, we study both the effect of droughts on
the onset of fertility, substituting marriage with birth as the outcome variable in equation 5,
and the effect of droughts on overall fertility, measuring at impact of the cumulative number of
droughts experienced by a woman in her youth on her parity as in equation 7. Of course, age of
marriage is only one of the many channels through which an income shock can affect fertility.
For example, women may choose to time fertility to avoid lean seasons or, on the contrary,
to take advantage of times when the marginal product of their labor is lower (Pitt and Sigle,
1998). Yet, the differential patterns we document across countries within Sub-Saharan Africa
are consistent with the hypothesis that changes the timing of marriage may generate a shift in
the timing of first birth and, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, in overall fertility rates.




                                                 31
6.1.1     Effects on the timing of the first birth

   We begin by examining the effect of negative rainfall shocks on the annual hazard of having
a child before the age of 18, by replacing the marriage outcome variable with a variable that
takes value 1 when a woman has her first child. We find that in Sub-Saharan Africa a drought
increases the annual hazard of early fertility by 0.22-0.18 percentage points (table 8, columns
1-3, p < 0.05), which corresponds to a 4-3.5% increase relative to a mean dependent variable of
0.055. We find no effects of rainfall shocks on the timing of fertility in India.
   In Appendix table A8, we examine these effects extending the age range up to age 24. In
this sample, the effect of drought on the timing of first fertility ranges from 0.34 to 0.30pp in
Sub-Saharan Africa (columns 1-3, p < 0.01).


6.1.2     Long run effects on fertility

   Having documented the effect of droughts on the timing of marriage and fertility, we now
turn to investigate their long-term effects, estimating equation 7 over different samples. We
first examine the sample of countries within Sub-Saharan Africa that have at least 50% of the
population traditionally engaging in bride price payments. We find that an additional drought
in a given year between ages 12 and 24 reduces the age of marriage by 0.04-0.05 years (table 9
column 1, p < 0.05 for ages 15-17 and 20-24). At the same time, an additional drought increases
the number of children that a woman has at the time of the survey by 0.04 (column 2, p < 0.05
for ages 12-14 and 20-24 and p < 0.01 for ages 15-17 and 18-20), out of a mean of 4.4 children
per woman in the cross-section. While the timing of marriage is a likely important channel of
this shift in fertility behavior, other factors, such as changes in education and human capital,
should also play a role, in particular in the earlier ages.
   We next focus on the subsample of countries in which bride price is not the prevailing norm
(Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Eritrea). In these countries, we find that
droughts have no effect on the age of marriage (column 3). Moreover, most likely because of an
income effect, women from these countries respond in an opposite way to what we encountered
above: experiencing droughts reduces the number of children a woman ends up having by 0.05-
0.08 (column 4, p < 0.10 for ages 12-14, p < 0.01 for ages 15-17 and 18-20, and p < 0.05 for ages
20-24).
   Last, we find that in India, droughts increase the age of marriage, particularly when expe-


                                                 32
rienced during the late teenage year, as seen in figure 4. Experiencing an additional drought
between ages 15 and 17 increases age of marriage by 0.05 years (column 5, p < 0.10), but ap-
pears to have no effect at later ages. Fertility also appears to vary according to the history of
droughts experienced by a woman, consistently with an income effects and possibly a marriage
effect. Drought effects get stronger with age: experiencing an additional drought between ages
20 and 24 reduces the number of children a woman ends up having by 0.05 (column 6, p < 0.05),
while effects at other ages are smaller and not statistically significant.


6.2       Characteristics of the spouses and of the matches by weather re-
          alization

    Who matches during a drought? To examine the characteristics of marriages that form during
years of drought and flood, we estimate equation 6 on a set of characteristics of the household.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, we find that the women who marry during droughts are 1.2 percentage
points more likely to be uneducated (table 10, column 1, p < 0.05), and they tend to marry
men of similar education and age as those who marry during regular times (columns 2-3). They
are not more likely to be in polygynous marriages, but may be slightly more likely to be a first
wife in a polygynous union, possibly because of the earlier marriage (columns 4 and 5). Finally,
they are 0.05 percentage points more likely to have no say in household ’s decisions (column 6,
p < 0.05).20
       In the data from India, we find no significant differential patterns among the couples that
form during droughts and those who don’t (columns 7-10), possibly because of the smaller sample
size or because matches are often established well in advance of the marriage. An additional
analysis shows that lack of power is the most plausible explanation: when we combine data
from the 1998 DHS with data from the 2005 IHDS, we find opposite patterns compared to those
documented for Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, women who marry during droughts are 1.6pp
less likely to be uneducated (Appendix table A9, column 1, p < 0.10) and are 1.2 less likely to
have "no say" in household’s decisions (column 4, p < 0.10).
  20
    This variable compounds 4 questions about who makes decisions in the household in different realms. We
classify the woman as having no say in decision n if she replies that it is the husband alone who makes that decision.
The questions are: i) Who usually decides how the money you earn will be used: you, your husband/partner, or
you and your husband/partner jointly? ii)Who usually makes decisions about health care for yourself: you, your
husband/partner, you and your husband/partner jointly, or someone else? iii) Who usually makes decisions about
making major household purchases? iv) Who usually makes decisions about visits to your family or relatives?
Hence, the maximum value that the variable "no say" can take is 4 , and the minimum is 0.


                                                         33
   Overall, these results suggest indicate that, in line with our model in which households
differ in the realization of the idiosyncratic shock, the most disadvantaged women marry during
droughts when a bride price payments is expected. Instead, when a dowry payment is expected,
it is the relatively more advantaged women who can afford to marry during droughts.


6.3     Robustness checks

   In this subsection, we perform a wide array of robustness checks and additional tests on our
data.


6.3.1   Robustness to alternative definitions of rainfall shocks

   As a first robustness check to our main results, we study how the impact of drought varies
with the definition of our drought measure. We use three approaches. First, we re-estimate
our main regression equation varying cutoff levels to define a drought, ranging from the 5th
percentile to the 45th percentile. Figure 5 plots the estimated coefficients for different cutoff
percentiles for drought, along with 95% confidence intervals. In both regions, the point estimate
is fairly stable around the default 15th percentile cutoff, and as the definition of drought becomes
more severe, the estimated impact increases in absolute value.
   Second, in table A10 we examine the association between the level of rainfall and the hazard
into child marriage, following our usual specification. We find that an increase in annual rain by
1 meter is associated with a decline in the child marriage hazard by 0.46-0.35 percentage points
in Sub-Saharan Africa (columns 1-2, p < 0.05, not significant at conventional levels in column
3), and with an increase in such a hazard by 0.39-0.41pp in India (columns 4-5, p < 0.10).
   We know from figures A2 and A3 that high level of rain have ambiguous effects on agricultural
output, particularly for rice. To further investigate the relationship between high level of rainfall
and child marriage, we add to our main specification a variable that captures floods, defined
as rainfall realizations that exceed the 85th percentile of rain. We find that floods have no
discernible effect on the child marriage hazard in Sub-Saharan Africa (Appendix table A11,
columns 1 and 2) but reduce the child marriage hazard in the India DHS sample (column 3,
p < 0.01). As expected, though, the negative effect of floods is concentrated in regions that do
not cultivate rice: when the percentage of land cultivated as rice is added to the regression and
interacted with flood, the interaction has a positive sign which exceeds the absolute value of the


                                                 34
main effect of flood (column 4, p < 0.05).
       Third, we estimate our main regression equation with indicators for the bottom rainfall
quintiles between 1950 and 2010. Effects are comparable to our measure of drought in India,
but weaker in Sub-Saharan Africa, as expected given that effects fade out substantially after the
15th percentile in figure 5 (see Appendix table A12, column 1 p < 0.10 and column 2 p < 0.01).
       Last, we consider the time structure of the effect of droughts, by examining lagged and
future shocks. In our model, without credit markets and with no serial correlation in the shocks,
only contemporaneous droughts affect behavior. When households can save or when shocks are
correlated over time, one may expect past shocks to matter for the current child marriage hazard
as well. Indeed, when we examine Sub-Saharan Africa, we find that past and future shocks have
no effect on the marriage hazard (Appendix table A13, columns 1-3). In India, past shocks have
a smaller but sizable effect on the marriage hazard relative to contemporaneous shocks, while
future shock does not appear to matter, reassuringly (columns 4-6).21


6.3.2      Inference: clustering at larger geographic units

   To account for the potential correlation in error terms across space between different grid
cells in Sub-Saharan Africa and districts in India, we consider clustering our standard errors
at the country level and at the state level respectively. To account for the small number of
Indian states in our sample, we also compute wild bootstrapped p-values following Cameron,
Gelbach, and Miller (2008). In table A17, we replicate the estimates from table 5 and report
the corresponding p-values under the different clustering assumptions. We observe only small
changes in p-values after the clustering at much larger geographic units, which do not affect the
statistical significance of our estimates.


6.3.3      Specification checks for the Sub-Saharan African sample

   As an additional robustness check, we verify that our Sub-Saharan Africa findings persist
when we do not use population-weighted sampling weights (table A14 column 1, p < 0.05), when
we use the most recent wave of data for each country (column 2, p < 0.05) and when we focus
on the subsample of ever-married women, which is more directly comparable to the India DHS
(column 3, p < 0.05).
  21
    Measurement error in the age of marriage or in the exact timing of the shock could in principle lead future
shocks to also matter. However, this is not the case in our analysis.


                                                      35
6.3.4   Robustness checks for the Indian sample

   To study whether our findings continue to appear in later datasets from India, which span
a time period closer to that of the DHS from Sub-Saharan Africa, we examine the impact of
droughts in the 2004-2005 IHDS. In the IHDS data, droughts reduce the child marriage hazard by
0.85 percentage points (Appendix table A15 columns 3 and 4, p < 0.01). When we pool together
the DHS and the IHDS, adjusting sampling weights for population, we find that droughts reduce
the child marriage hazard by 0.97-1pp (columns 5 and 6, p < 0.01).
   As additional robustness check, we explore the heterogeneity in the effect of droughts by local
conditions across Indian states. First, we examine heterogeneity by the availability of irrigation,
using data from the ICRISAT District Level Database of 19 States of India between 1996 and
2011. We construct a dummy variable named High Irrigation for states which in a given year are
in the top quartile of irrigation, defined as the percentage of cultivated land which is irrigated.
Other states are defined as being Low Irrigation. Effects appear to be concentrated in states
that have low irrigation, and the p-value of the Wald test for equality between Drought × Low
Irrigation and Drought × High Irrigation is p = 0.0598 (Appendix table A16, column 1). Of
course, irrigation is correlated with many other measures of local development that can also
attenuate the effect of drought. One example is the development of the local banking sector,
which varies substantially over time and across space in India (Burgess, Pande, and Wong, 2005).
We follow Jayachandran (2006) and use the three measures in that article: the number of bank
branches per 1000 people between 1960 and 1999, the number of per-capita bank deposits in
1981 and the number of per-capita bank credits in 1981. For each measure separately, we define
a state as having High Banking equal to 1 if it is in the top quartile of each variable in each year:
for the first measure, this is a time-varying variable, and for the remaining two it is stable over
time. For all three variables, we find that the effect of droughts are only statistically significant
in states that have low development of the banking sector, while no statistically significant effect
can be found in the High Banking states. However, we cannot rule out that the effects are the
same from a statistical viewpoint (columns 2-4, the p-values of the Wald test for equality of the
coefficients are p = 0.3371, p = 0.3622 and p = 0.3485).




                                                 36
7         Mechanisms: additional evidence from India and Indone-
          sia
         A key implication of our theoretical model is that marriages that occurred during droughts
should command lower payments. The decline in the marriage payments, combined with the
different price sensitivities of the two sides of the market, generates our equilibrium result on the
probability of child marriage. Studying this implication of the model is not possible with the DHS
or the IHDS, because neither survey features data on actual marriage payments. More generally,
for bride price, no nationally representative dataset from Sub-Saharan Africa is available, to the
best of our knowledge.22 We hence turn to a new dataset for India and to a new context
(Indonesia) for bride price.
         For dowry in India, we examine an additional data source, the 1998 wave of the Rural
Economic and Demographic Survey (REDS), which features information about the dowry paid
for the respondents’ own marriage and for the marriage of the respondents’ daughters. Following
Roy (2015), we define as dowry the gross amounts paid at the time of marriage and we express
it real terms (2010 Indian Rupees). We use the same variation at the district level that we use
in the rest of the paper, with the survey spanning 95 district across 15 states.
         For bride price, we turn to Indonesia, a country in Southeast Asia with an ancient bride
price tradition, as documented in Ashraf, Bau, Nunn, and Voena (2016). Rich data from the
Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) provides information not only on the location of current
residence, but also on the location at birth and on migration history. Most importantly, it also
collects information on bride price payments that were made for each couple’s marriage. We use
the 2000 (3rd round) and the 2007 (4th round) waves of the survey. We focus on the province of
birth of each female respondent, and merge rainfall data from UDel aggregated at the province
level. There are 18 provinces of birth in our sample.
         Both the REDS and the IFLS samples are rather small: for the groups we use in the rest
of the analysis, we have 5,513 women in the REDS and 11,745 women in the IFLS. Indeed, we
find no significant effects of droughts on the timing on marriage in either of the two samples.
However, our model predicts that marriage payments for all child marriages should be lower
during droughts, and not only for the marginal marriages. This implication suggests that we
    22
   One appealing source, the Kagera Health and Development Survey used in Corno and Voena (2017), only
examines one region of Tanzania that represents a single marriage market.


                                                  37
may be able to detect effects on marriage payments in relatively small samples. Hence, we move
to estimating equation 6 on the REDS and IFLS samples, using the natural logarithm of the
marriage payment for child marriages as the dependent variable.
    In the REDS data, the mean dowry for the sample of 2,169 child marriages is equal to 80,132
INR, with a standard deviation of 118,223.23 There is a negative association between dowry
paid and marriages occurred during droughts, which are around 17% lower than baseline (table
11, column 1 p < 0.10). This finding is indeed highly consistent with proposition 2. However,
it is worth emphasizing that such a finding may also be due to a differential selection of women
into marriage during droughts. Adding controls for the brides’ age of marriage (column 2) and
education (column 3) does not substantially change our estimates, suggesting that selection on
observables is unlikely to be driving this result.
    In the IFLS, the mean dowry for the sample of 1,131 child marriages is equal to 692,544
Indonesian rupees (in real 2005 values), with a standard deviation of 1,589,108. Dowries are
45 percent lower when a drought hits a woman’s province of birth. The coefficient is almost
unchanged when we include additional controls for the woman’s characteristics (table 11, column
4-6, wild-bootstrapped p-values clustered at the province level p = 0.108, p = 0.104 and p =
0.092 respectively).
    In sum, data on both dowry and bride price payments shows that these transfers are sub-
stantially lower during droughts, in line with the prediction of our model.



8     Conclusions
    This paper studies the relationship between aggregate economic conditions and the timing of
marriage, and in particular the hazard into female child marriage, when markets are incomplete
and marriage payments are prevalent. We develop a simple equilibrium model showing that
temporary income shocks can affect child marriage in equilibrium and that cultural norms on
marriage payments determine the sign of the effect. Consistently with our model, we then find
that negative rainfall shocks have opposite effects on the hazard into child marriage in Sub-
Saharan Africa and India, while having similar effects on agricultural output in the two regions.
In those Sub-Saharan African countries, where bride price payments are customary, droughts
  23
     These numbers and those for Indonesia exclude outliers strictly above the 99th percentile, which are likely
to be the result of measurement error.



                                                      38
lead to an increase in the early marriage hazard, while in India, where dowry is pervasive,
droughts lead to a decrease in the early marriage hazard. These effects, particularly in Africa,
are associated with changes in the timing of fertility and in overall fertility rates. In line with
our theoretical framework, we also find that both dowry and bride price payments drop during
droughts, indicating that general equilibrium effects are important in explaining these effects.
   Our findings indicate that in developing countries where marriage payments are customary,
the age of marriage responds to short-term changes in aggregate economic conditions in a way
that is consistent with simple economic theory. This suggests that there is a potential for
economic policy to influence marriage markets, however in complex ways that interact with
traditional cultural norms. Hence, in order to design successful policies to reduce child marriage
– a goal that has received increasing attention because of its potentially large impact on human
capital accumulation and economic development (Wodon, Male, Nayihouba, et al., 2017) – it is
crucial for economists and policy makers to understand the economic role of traditional cultural
norms. More generally, our findings point to the importance of cultural norms in influencing the
external validity of natural experiments and of replicating empirical and experimental analyses
in different contexts to better understand the economic mechanisms behind empirical results.

     The dependent variable is the log of annual crop yield (tons per hectare) for each included country from 1961 to 2010. Crop yield data are from FAOStat.
     “All SSA” columns include all SSA countries in the FAOStat database, whereas “DHS SSA Only” columns include the SSA countries available in the DHS
     and used in our main analysis. In the columns labeled “Average”, the dependent variable is the log of the sum of total production of main crops reported
     (maize, sorghum, millet, rice, and wheat) divided by the total area harvested for those crops. The crops (except for “Average”) are sorted by total production,
     averaged across the available years, from the most to the least. Robust standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the country level. All regression
     specifications include year and country fixed effects.

                           The dependent variable is the log of annual crop yield (tons per hectare) for each district from 1957 to 1987. Crop
                           yield data are from the World Bank India Agriculture and Climate Dataset. In the columns labeled “Average”,
                           the dependent variable is the log of the sum of total production of main crops reported (rice, wheat, jowar, maize,
                           and bajra) divided by the total area harvested for those crops. The crops (except for “Average”) are sorted by
                           total annual production, averaged across the available years, from the most to the least. Robust standard errors
                           (in parentheses) are clustered at the district level. All regression specifications include year and district fixed
                           effects.

            Note: Figures show the point estimates of the Effect of Droughts on early marriages, estimated using
            OLS regressions for the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and India full regression samples: women aged 25
            or older at the time of interview. The different points represent different definitions of drought based
            on the percentile of rainfall in a grid cell (SSA) or district (India) in a given year, relative to the
            fitted long run rainfall (gamma) distribution in that grid cell or district. The gray bands show the
            95% confidence intervals of the estimated coefficients. For all the analyses in this paper, for any grid
            cell or district, we define a drought as having rainfall lower than the 15th percentile of the long-run
            rainfall distribution.

            Note: Figures shows the prevalence of drought in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and India, presented
            as the percentage of grid cells (SSA) or districts (India) with drought in each calendar year. For all
            the analyses in this paper, for any grid cell or district, we define a drought as having rainfall lower
            than the 15th percentile of the long-run rainfall distribution. The black dashed line shows the mean
            of drought in each sub-figure from 1950-2010.

Note: Figure plots the coefficients of rainfall vingtiles in regressions with log of annual crop yield
(tons per hectare) from 1961 to 2010 as the dependent variable. The sample consists of SSA countries
with DHS surveys in our main analysis. The “Average for Main Crops” panel has the dependent
variable as the log of the sum of the total production of main crops reported (maize, wheat, sorghum,
millet, and rice) divided by the total area harvested for those crops. The individual crop figures
are sorted by total production, averaged across the available years, from the most to the least. All
regression specifications include year and country fixed effects. The capped vertical bars show 95%
confidence intervals calculated using robust standard errors clustered at the country level.

Note: Figure plots the coefficients of rainfall vingtiles in regressions with log of annual crop yield
(tons per hectare) for Indian districts from 1957 to 1987 as the dependent variable. The “Average for
Main Crops” panel has the dependent variable as the log of the sum of the total production of main
crops reported (rice, maize, wheat, bajra, and jowar) divided by the total area harvested for those
crops. The individual crop figures are sorted by total production, averaged across the available years,
from the most to the least. All regression specifications include year and district fixed effects. The
capped vertical bars show 95% confidence intervals calculated using robust standard errors clustered
at the district level.

B      Theoretical appendix
B.1     Proofs
Proof of proposition 1 The derivatives of equilibrium quantities in the two economies with
respect to income are equal to

            ∂Q(y1 )BP   2 − Hf − Hm                           ∂Q(y1 )DOW   2 − Hf − Hm
                      =                                                  =             .
              ∂y1         Hf − Hm                                ∂y1         Hm − Hf
   In both economies, the sign of the derivative is equal to the sign of the term 2 − H f − H m .
This means that, when τ2∗ > 0 (sub-Saharan Africa) we can expect low income to lead to more
marriages whenever 2 − H f − H m < 0 or H f1−1 < − H m1−1 . When τ2∗ < 0 (India), we can expect
low income to lead to fewer marriages whenever 2 − H f − H m > 0, or that − H f1−1 < H m1−1 .
                m            ∂Ωm
   Note that ∂H
             ∂wm
                  = exp(Ωm ) ∂w m and that

                                                                                      
          m                                 m      f                         m     f
                                                                                 

                                                           − ln                          .
       ∂w                         ys + w + w − τ                   ys + w m + w f     

   In the case of SSA, with τ > 0, H m is increasing in wm : again, when wm is larger, the
inequality is more likely to be satisfied. In the case of India, where τ < 0, H m is decreasing in
wm : again, when wm is larger, the inequality is more likely to be satisfied.

Proof of proposition 2 The derivative with respect to income is

                                   ∂τ1∗ (y1 )    (1 − H f )(1 − H m )
                                              =2                      .
                                     ∂y1             Hm − Hf
   This derivative is positive when transfers are positive (i.e. bride price payments are higher
when income is higher), i.e. when H f > 1 and H m < 1. It is negative, instead, when transfers
are negative (i.e. dowry payments, which are −τ1∗ , are also higher when income is higher), i.e.
when H f < 1 and H m > 1.

B.2     Incorporating child labor
    We now consider the case in which children provide labor, either on their parents’ farm or
in the market, and children’s wages w1 , are affected by aggregate shocks. In particular, we will
assume that child labor wages are negatively affected by droughts: dwdy
                                                                      1 (y1 )
                                                                         1
                                                                              ≥ 0.
    Under these conditions, a woman from household i will get married in the first period if and
only if:

                              ln(y1 + i1 + τ1 ) − ln(y1 + i1 + w1 ) ≥ Ωf

    In SSA the supply of brides, defined on the [0, 1] interval, takes the form

                                                     τ1           H f w1
                               S BP (y1 , τ1 ) =          − y 1 −        .
                                                   Hf − 1         Hf − 1
                                                                            H f dw1 (y1 )
    Note that SτBP (y1 , τ1 ) is unchanged, while SyBP (y1 , τ1 ) = −1 −   H f −1 dy1
                                                                                            < 0.

                                                      18
    Similarly, under these conditions, a man from household i will get married in the first period
if and only if:

                         ln(y1 + j1 − τ1 + 2w1 ) − ln(y1 + j1 + w1 ) ≥ Ωm .

   Hence, the demand for brides becomes
                                                         τ1    Hm − 2
                           DBP (y1 , τ1 ) = 1 + y1 +         +        w1 .
                                                       Hm − 1 Hm − 1
                                                                                          m
                                                                                       H −2 dw1 (y1 )
Again, the derivative with respect to prices is unchanged, while DyBP (y1 , τ1 ) = 1 + H m −1 dy1
                                                                                                      >
0.
   In India, the supply of brides, defined on the [0, 1] interval, takes the form

                                                       τ1           H f w1
                            S DOW (y1 , τ1 ) = 1 −          + y 1 +        .

                               f
Here, SyDOW (y1 , τ1 ) = 1 + HHf −1 dwdy
                                      1 (y1 )
                                         1
                                              , which cannot be signed: droughts reduce parent’s ability
to pay dowry, but also makes a child daughter’s labor less valuable to the household.
    The demand for brides becomes
                                                         τ1    Hm − 2

Again, the derivative with respect to prices is unchanged, while DyDOW (y1 , τ1 ) = −1− H m −1 dy1
                                                                                                       .

drought on the quantity of child marriages is stronger. This effect happens because families of
boys are affected less strongly by the drought even in the first period, because they can rely on
their child son’s labor even if he gets married.
   More complex but more realistic is the case in which children provide labor, either on their
parents’ farm or in the market, and children’s wages differ by gender {w1f , w1m }. Again, the

B.3     Generalizing preferences and distributions
     Consider general preferences represented by a function u(·) which is strictly increasing,
strictly concave and twice-continuously differentiable. For proposition 1 to hold, we will also
require that households are prudent (u000 (·) > 0). Allow also the distribution of t to follow a
continuous distribution with pdf f (·) and cdf F (·) for both men and women.
    As in the log-utility case, a woman from household i will get married in the first period if
and only if:

              u(y1 + i1 + τ1 ) + δE u(y2 + i2 ) ≥ u(y1 + i1 ) + δE u(y2 + i2 + τ2∗ )

   Similarly, a man from household j will get married in the first period if and only if:

                        u(y1 + j1 − τ1 ) + δE u(y2 + j2 + wm + wf ) ≥
                                                                     

                        u(y1 + j1 ) + δE u(y2 + j2 + wm + wf − τ2∗ ) .
                                                                     


   Consider now the income thresholds ∗f and ∗m at which the above expressions hold with
equality:




                                                   20

                                  u(y1 + m∗ − τ1 ) − u(y1 + m∗ ) = Ωm .

   Define Ωf = δE [u(y2 + i2 + τ2∗ )]−δE [u(y2 + i2 )] and Ωm = δE u(y2 + j2 + wm + wf − τ2∗ ) −
                                                                                                

δE u(y2 + j2 + wm + wf ) . Applying the implicit function theorem (IFT) and the chain rule,

we have that
                     ∂∗f (τ1 , y1 , Ωf )          u0 (y1 + ∗f + τ1 )
                                          =− 0
                            ∂τ1             u (y1 + ∗f + τ1 ) − u0 (y1 + ∗f )

                     ∂∗m (τ1 , y1 , Ωm )            u0 (y1 + ∗m − τ1 )
                                          = 0
                             ∂τ1            u (y1 + ∗m − τ1 ) − u0 (y1 + ∗m )

Sub-Saharan Africa Monotonicity and concavity of the utility function, as well as the fact
that continuation values do not depend on i1 , imply that below threshold ∗f every household
wants their daughter to be married, ceteris paribus. This implies that the supply of brides is
defined in SSA as:

                  S BP (τ1 , y1 , Ωf ) = P rob(it < ∗f (τ1 , y1 , Ωf )) = F (∗f (τ1 , y1 , Ωf )).
                                ∂∗ (τ1 ,y1 ,Ωf )
   Concavity ensures that f ∂τ1      > 0.
   The above conditions, together with the chain rule and the fact that F 0 (·) = f (·) > 0, also
imply that

            ∂S BP (τ1 , y1 , Ωf )     BP             f        ∗               f

and the derivative of the threshold with respect to the marriage payment is                                   ∂τ1
                                                                                                                            > 0.

Equilibrium In both economies, equilibrium prices are defined implicitly as the solution to

                                         S(τ1∗ , y1 , Ωf ) − D(τ1∗ , y1 , Ωm ) = 0.

By the IFT, the derivative of the equilibrium price with respect to y1 is

                                     ∂τ1∗    Sy (τ1 , y1 , Ωf ) − Dy (τ1 , y1 , Ωm )
                                          =−                                         .
                                     ∂y1     Sτ (τ1 , y1 , Ωf ) − Dτ (τ1 , y1 , Ωm )
This derivative is positive in SSA and negative in India (as stated in proposition 2).
    Define now τ = S −1 (q1 , y1 , Ωf ) as an inverse supply function and τ = D−1 (q1 , y1 , Ωm ) as an
inverse demand function. Note that Sq−1 (q, y1 , Ωf ) and Dq−1 (q, y1 , Ωm ) have the same sign as
Sτ (τ1 , y1 , Ωf ) (positive) and Dτ (τ1 , y1 , Ωm ) (negative), respectively. Moreover, Sy−1 (q, y1 , Ωf ) =
              f                                                                                             m

       (τ1 ,y1 ,Ωf )
                                                                                         Dy (τ1 ,y1 ,Ω ) 24
                     is positive SSA and negative in India, as is Dy−1 (q, y1 , Ωm ) = − D            m .
                                                                                          τ (τ1 ,y1 ,Ω )
                               −1       m      ∗      −1          f
     In equilibrium, D (Q, y1 , Ω ) = τ = S (Q, y1 , Ω ) where Q is the equilibrium quantity
of child marriage. Again the IFT allows us to derive

                                                 Sy−1 (Q, y1 , Ωf ) − Dy−1 (Q, y1 , Ωm )
                                  Q0 (y1 ) = −                                           .
                                                 Sq−1 (Q, y1 , Ωf ) − Dq−1 (Q, y1 , Ωm )
   The denominator of the above expression, Sq−1,SSA (Q, y1 , Ωf ) − Dq−1,SSA (Q, y1 , wm , Ωm ), is
always positive.
   Hence, in a bride price economy, in order to have that Q0 (y1 ) < 0, we need that Sy−1,BP (Q, y1 , Ωf ) >
  24
       To see this, consider the conditions q − S(τ1 , y1 , Ωf ) = 0 and q − D(τ1 , y1 , Ωm ) = 0 and apply the IFT.

    Applying the above derivations of these partial derivatives, we have that:

  As in the less general case, prudence (u000 (·) > 0) is sufficient for these conditions to become
more likely to hold when wm (and wf , holding τ2∗ constant) becomes larger (proposition 1).
                                                                       2 ∗  ,y1 ,Ωm )

irrespectively of the direction of the marriage payment.
     Moreover, under concavity and prudence, we have that u0 (y1 + ∗m − τ1 ) > u0 (y1 + ∗m ) and
u00 (y1 + ∗m ) > u00 (y1 + ∗m − τ1 ) in a bride price economy and u0 (y1 + ∗m − τ1 ) < u0 (y1 + ∗m ) and

u00 (y1 + ∗m ) < u00 (y1 + ∗m − τ1 ) in a dowry economy. Hence ∂ m∂τ(τ11∂w m       > 0 with bride price
