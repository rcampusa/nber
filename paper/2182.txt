                            High Tech Trade Policy




                                  ABSTRACT



    This paper analyzes the role of network externalities and expectations

about them in the formulation of trade policy. Their effects are studied in

duopoly situations when products are compatible and when they are incompatible

and when multimarket effects are possible.

     Network externalities and expectations regarding the size of the network

affect optimal trade policy in three ways. First, the presence of

expectations effects creates a role for policy if there are differences

between the way the externalities operate and expectations about how they

operate. Second, when goods are compatible, the existence of network

externalities can make goods complementary which reverses the direction of

optimal policy. lhird, since multimarket effects occur naturally with netowrk

externalities and compatible products, purely domestic policies, which are

legal under GAIT, can have international profit shifting effects which may be

 in the nationalinterest.

                           High Tech Trade Policy



                                Section 1

                                Introduction



    With some 90 nations about to embark on a new round of multilateral

trade negotiations under GATT, there is concern that rules for "high tech"

industries be high on the agenda. The United States has been the leader in

expressing this view because it perceives that the products of its high tech

industries will have (or could have) a long—run comparative advantage. Aho

and Aronson (1985, p. 44) point out that "The United States pushed for work

on high technology at the 1982 GATT Ministerial Meeting, but did not

convince other countries that high technology industries should be handled

any differently from other industries." In fact, they say that "the

initiative was so poorly defined that LOC (less developed countries)

representatives asked how high technology discussions could be related to

transfer of technology, which is a legitimate question but not what the

United States had in mind." More recently, in March 1984, the U.S.

government officially called for new GATT negotiations in the area of high

tech goods. The United States informed the GAIT Council meeting at that

time that it would begin bilateral trade talks. on high tech goods with

interested delegations. These were to be the basis for future council

discussions. Other countries, however, questioned the urgency of these
                                      —2—


negotiations.

     Why is it useful to think of high tech trade separately, and why has

the interest in trade policy for these industries been on the upswing? The

two questions are closely related. There are two reasons for this increase

in interest. First, trade in these products has been a growing part of

total trade. Second, a number of high tech industries possess certain

characteristics that provide opportunities for currently legal (under GAIT

rules) and profitable unilateral trade policy that could be harmful to all

parties in the international arena if practiced by all parties. In other

words, these characteristics make the industries "fall between the cracks"

of trading arrangements that are meant to prevent such suboptimal situations

from arising. The importance of high tech trade and the sector's special

characteristics indicate that policy for this sector should be thought of

separately and take into account its special characteristics.

     It remains to identify the characteristics that make some high tech

industries special. The first characteristic is that network externalities

play a significant role in determining the demand for the products of these

industries. Network externalities are said to exist when the utility that a

user derives from consuming a good and the user's willingness to pay for a

good increases with the number of people who also consume the good or are

expected to do so. These externalities arise in a number of ways, both

directly and indirectly. In communications equipment, such as telephones,

they arise directly. People derive a greater benefit from a phone if all

the people they wish to communicate with also possess a phone. They may

arise indirectly, for example, if the amount of software produced is related
                                         —3—


to the number of computers in use, so that increases in the number of

computers would increase the available stock of software which in turn would

raise the willingness to pay for a computer.

     Such network externalities arise for many products that are not "high

tech" —-   for   example, they arise for many durable goods since the

availability of servicing for any durable good is likely to be related to

the number of units of the good already sold in the market.1 The network

externalities are especially important, however, in such key high tech

industries as computers and telecommunications systems. In part, this is

because these and a number of other high tech goods are information-related,

and goods with this characteristic tend to have Qreater network

externalities.

     For industries in which network externalities are important,

expectations about the size of the network, i.e., the number of units of the

good sold, are a major determinant of the demand for such goods.2 This

paper analyzes how network externalities and expectations about their size

can provide a special role for trade policy. The conditions for such a role

to exist are shown to be quite severe. Other characteristics of high tech

 industries that may also serve as the basis for government intervention in

 international trade are briefly mentioned at the end of the paper.

      Recent work in international trade theory has led both academics and

 policy makers to a better understanding of trade policy in imperfectly

 competitive markets.3 It is now understood that to the extent that national

 interests do not include the well being of foreigners, in particular of

 foreign firms, there may be a case for trying to draw away the profits of
                                      —4-


foreign firms. This can be done directly, or if this is illegal,

indirectly, by altering the behavior of domestic firms in order to improve

their strategic position. Attention has focused on the use of taxes and

subsidies for such purposes.

     This point was first made in Brander and Spencer (1985) who showed that

in a particular strategic setting government subsidization of a domestic

firm competing with a foreign firm in a foreign market would improve its

strategic position if no other governments attempted this as well. As might

be expected, this conclusion aroused a good deal of interest in many circles.

     It has become clear through recent work4 that the appropriateness of

this kind of policy depends very much on the nature of the strategic

setting. Loosely speaking, if the firms5 choose their actions on the basis

of incorrect beliefs about the actions of other firms and the government

understands how these are incorrect and can precommit to tax/subsidy

schemes, there is a role for government policy to correct the distortion

arising from the incorrect beliefs of the firms. If, for example, a

domestic firm expects its foreign rival to keep its sales constant as it

raises its sales, while in fact its foreign competitors tend to reduce their

sales whenever this happens, a wedge exists that can be exploited by a

knowledgeable government. In this case the government would give the

domestic firm a strategic advantage by subsidizing it.   In contrast, if the

foreign competitor raised its sales with those of the domestic firm, the

optimal policy would be imposition of a tax.

    The existence of consumer expectations about network size creates

another possible role for government policy. In industries where
                                     -5-


expectations of network externalities are important, firms may believe that

they are unable to influence expectations. This may be an incorrect

assumption. If, for example, firms believe that an increase in their output

will not increase the expected network size on which consumers base their

purchasing decisions, while consumers really do adjust their expectations

about network size in response to output changes, then there is a role for a

government that knows the true relationship to offset the incorrect beliefs

of firms with a subsidy that would induce the firms to produce more.

     Another possibility, that in view of existing GATT rules is perhaps

more disturbing, relates to the existence of strategic multimarket

interactions.6 Such interactions are bound to be important in those high

tech industries where expected network size affects demand in all markets,

domestic and foreign. There is a possible role for the government in trying

to shift profits from foreign to domestic firms by an appropriate policy for

domestic firms exporting to foreign markets. Under these conditions a

purely domestic policy, such as a tax/subsidy on consumption for the

domestic market only will have repercussions for the firm's behavior in

foreign markets.

     The basic idea can be understood quite easily with a simple example.

Consider a situation where the individual firm takes expectations about

network size as given. The firm is assumed to compete in both foreign and

domestic markets. Network expectations adjust to network size so that in

equilibrium the expected network size is the actual one. If the government

subsidizes only national sales of the product, the firm will produce more.7

This, in turn, will raise expectations about the network size of the product
                                      —6-


at home and abroad, and therefore affect the product's international

competitiveness. This natural interdependence of markets via network

effects could possibly be used strategically by a government to affect a

firm's behavior in international markets so as to promote the national

interest.8

     This possibility is particularly disturbing, since trade laws are

designed to deal with direct government subsidization of exported goods, but

are not framed in a way to deal with purely domestic policies that have

indirect international effects. Under GAIT rules, countervailing duties are

allowed if there is a foreign subsidy on a product and imports of the

product cause material injury or retardation of growth to the domestic

industry producing the same good. Thinly disguised subsidies to exports

are prevented under this clause. An example is the x radial steel-belted

tires case in which Canada subsidized a tire company to build a new factory

in an area with high unemployment. Since virtually all of the product was

to be exported and likely to cause material injury, it was found to be

countervailable. The countervailing duty provisions clause cannot be used,

however, in the case of "purely domestic" policies, i.e., where the subsidy

applies only to goods consumed domestically. This leaves only the last

resort, the escape clauses, as the means to deal with such policies. These

provisions can be used if increased imports cause or threaten serious injury

to domestic producers or if increased imports threaten national security.

The requirements for obtaining protection via these two routes are quite

stringent, however. Thus, "purely domestic" policies with favorable effects

on international competitiveness could look quite attractive as a means of
                                     —7—



promoting exports.

     The next sections present a simple model that helps isolate and

interpret the effects of network externalities and expectations on optimal

trade policy. Two versions of the model are considered in the next two

sections. Section 2 examines the implications for profit-shifting

possibilities of the two previously mentioned characteristics of high tech

industries; network externalities and expectations about them. Section 3

contains an analysis of the nature of multimarkets interactions that occur

due to these characteristics and the implications of these interactions for

trade policy. The last section discusses some other characteristics of high

tech industries and the problems they may and do cause for trade policy.

                                Section 2

         Expectations, Network Externalities and Profit-Shifting


     Recent work on the role of government policy when oligopolistic firms

operate in international markets has focused on the possibility of

profit-shifting from foreign to domestic firms and on the tradeoff between

the gains to domestic firms from such profit-shifting and the losses to

domestic consumers. A number of recent papers have developed this idea.

One of the earliest papers is by Brander and Spencer (1985), who show in a

model with one home firm and one foreign firm acting as Cournot duopolists

and competing in a third market, that the optimal government policy is to

subsidize exports. Dixit (1984) extends this result to cases with many

firms and shows that the same result holds as long as the number of domestic

firms is not too great. Eaton and Grossman (1986), in an insightful paper,

show that the Brander and Spencer result can be interpreted as a special

case of a more general policy. Their basic interpretation is in terms of a

government acting in response to differences between conjectured and actual

responses of foreign firms to changes in the domestic firms' output when

they are competing in a third market.9 They also develop a number of

extensions, including allowing for many firms and domestic consumption.

      As argued previously, demand for a firm's product depends on the

expected size of the "network," that is, the expected number of units of

compatible goods sold. These expectations are very important in industries

with network externalities. Government intervention may be useful in
                                                 —9-


influencing these expectations. This idea is explored in this section using

a model that embeds the Eaton and Grossman model in it.'° Use is made of the

simplest version of the model that makes the point, namely, the case where a

domestic and foreign firm compete in a third market and there is no

consumption of the product in either the home or foreign country.

Extensions along the lines of allowing more firms or domestic consumption

are possible, and the interested reader can use Eaton and Grossman (1984) as

a guide to do so. The next section analyzes multimarket interactions with

firms competing in both domestic and foreign market.

       When network externalities exist, a consumer's willingness to pay for a

product depends on the expected network size for the product. The products of

the two firms could be compatible or incompatible with each other, and are

substitutes for each other. If they are compatible, expected network size is

the expected total output of both firms; if incompatible, the network is the

expected output of each firm. The inverse demand functions for the home and
                                 E       *
foreign firm are given by P(x,x N ) and P (xx ,N
                                                       *   * *E ),            *
                                                                     where x,x and N E

N*E are the outputs and expected network sizes of the home and foreign

firms, respectively. The superscript E denotes that these are the expected

levels of these variables. If the products are competible,

NE =   N
           *E =   xE + x*E .   If            .       .     E    E
                                    they are incompatible, N = x and N
                                                                      *E =        x*E   .   Of

course, price, P, falls as x or x rises since the products are substitutes,

and rises with increases in the expected network size. Similarly, P rises

as N*E rises and falls as x or x* rise.11

       Consumers are assumed to base their demand for a firm's product on the

expectations they hold about a firm's network size. Firms take these
                                            -10--



expectations as dependent on their output. They assume that a unit change

in x(x*) creates an c(c*) change in the expected domestic (foreign) output

with consequent effects on expected network size. The special case where

expectations about network size do not change as the firm's output changes

arises when £ and      equal zero. However, in general expectations are

perceived as being affected by firm's output. In addition, firms have

conjectures about how their opponent will react to changes in their output.

7 and      denote the conjectural variations parameters of the domestic and

foreign firms.

        Finally, expectations about network size must fulfill a consistency

condition that allows them to be tied down. A natural condition is that

expectations about the network sizes of the firms are fulfilled in

equilibrium. This defines a "fulfilled expectations equilibrium." It is

useful expositionally to be slightly more abstract at this time. An (e,e*)

fulfilled expectations equilibrium is said to occur when the expected

domestic output equals e times actual domestic output, and expected foreign

output equals e* times actual foreign output. This corresponds to a
                                                        *

In addition, the (e, e*) fulfilled-expectations equations,


(5)        xE=ex

must be met. Substituting (5) and (6) into (3) and (4) or (3') and (4') gives

two equations to solve for the only two variables, x and x in these equations.

Equations (5) and (6) then define expectations. Therefore, the effect of a

change in "t" on the endogenous variables x and x in such an equilibrium can be

found by performing comparative statics analyses on (3) and (4) or (3') and

(4'), after substituting (5) and (6) into them. Let the actual change in x

as x changes be given by g. This is defined by equations (4) or (4'), after

equations (5) and (6) have been substituted into them. It also equals the

       The problem is now fully specified. Firms maximize their profits

taking any taxes and subsidies by the government as given. These

first-order conditions for the firms define their best-response functions

which gives two equations in x, x, E and x*E. The condition that

the equilibrium be an (e,e*) fulfilled expectations equilibrium gives

another two equations in these four variables. This allows solving for the

endogenous variables x, x, E and x*E.

       The question of optimal government policy can now be analyzed. Since

the firms compete in a third market, welfare consists only of domestic
                                                                 -   c(x).

       t does not affect welfare directly, since transfers between the

government and firms cancel out, but does affect welfare via its effect on

the endogenous variables. Hence,

        Using the first—order condition (3) in (7) and (3') in (7') allows the

welfare changes to be expressed as:

        The first—order conditions for an interior welfare maximum require (8)

or (8') to be zero depending on whether the products are incompatible or

compatible. This gives the optimal policy assuming that second—order

conditions are met. notice that the optimal value of t depends on the

direction of both the wedge between conjectured and actual responses to own

output changes, (g-y), a la Eaton and Grossman, as well as on the difference

between the conjectured change in expected network size in response to own

output and the actual change. This difference depends only on (c-c) if

products are incompatible, but on the additional interaction term (ge*_yc*)

as well when products are compatible.

     Consider first the case when products are incompatible. The difference

between g and y defines a reason for the government to set t 4 0. If g <

and e =   c,   the government should subsidize the domestic producer. This is

because the domestic firm is too pessimistic in its conjecture about the

foreign firm's behavior. If, for example, y = 0 and g < 0, the usual

Cournot case, the domestic firm acts on the assumption that the foreign one

will keep its output fixed. However, since its opponent actually reduces

its output in response to any increase in domestic output, the domestic firm

should produce more. The government can ensure this by subsidizing the

domestic firm, as was pointed out by Eaton and Grossman.

     The interpretation of (c-c) is similar. If e >     c,   the domestic firm

should be subsidized since the firm conjectures a smaller change in the

expectations of consumers about network size in response to output changes

than actually occurs. This leads them to produce too little. If, f or

example, firms take the expected network size as given, and a

fulfilled-expectations equilibrium is considered, there would be reason to
                                          —14—


subsidize the domestic firm. Expectations are likely to be fixed in the

short run, and a fulfilled-expectation condition can be thought of as a

static way of incorporating the longer run into the model.13 If firms tend

to take a short term view of the industry, as is implicit in £       = 0,   there is

a role for a government that is aware of the long-run consequences to take

appropriate action.

     The interpretation of the case with compatible products is similar.

The only difference lies in the fact that any effect of a tariff via the

network externality must include the effect on the foreign firm's expected

and actual output as well as that of the domestic firm. Notice that e +            ge*

is the actual change in the network size, while £ +          is   the conjectured

change in the network size. This makes e and y interact in the formula, but

allows the same interpretations to be made as done previously.

      It is worth calling attention to a few points at this stage. First, it

should be noted that g is the slope of the foreign firm's best—response

 function after imposing the expectations condition on it. In this it

 differs from the analogous concept in the absence of any expectations.

 therefore, even if e =    £, the   introduction of expectations would tend to

 make the assumption g =   y   even stronger since g is not the slope of the best

 response function of the foreign firm for given expectations but when

 expectations are fulfilled in the (e,e*) sense.

      Second, if c = 1 = e and a firm fully takes into account the effects of

 its actions on the network size, then in the case with incompatible products

 the direction of optimal policy depends on the sign of g - y only. Also

 notice that the direction of the optimal policy when e =      £=1    =   e*   =    (in
                                                  —15—


the case of compatible products) is dependent on more than just the sign of

(g-y). If      +        is positive, even if P2 is negative, the goods would
                   P3
become effective complements due to the presence of network externalities.

In this case the incentives to subsidize would, of course, be reversed since a

decrease in output by a competitor hurts rather than helps a firm when the

goods are complements. Thus, if £ =           £* = e*            e =       1, P2 + P3 is positive,

and g <   y = 0, as in the Cournot case, the anticipation that the other firm
would keep its output fixed would be too optimistic if it really lowered it.

Obviously, the optimal policy would then be a tax which would correct the

firm's over—optimism.

     Third, note that having compatible products tends to reduce the

desirability of a subsidy or a tax when g =              y   <    0.        Consider, for example,

the case where e =      e*,   c =     but   e >   c and g = y          <    0.   The direct effect of

a subsidy is beneficial since the firms underestimate the value of the

network externality. This is captured by the P3(e-c) term. A subsidy,

however, raises the foreign firm's network as well and tends to make it wish

to produce more. If g <         0,   this makes the domestic firm produce less. This

is captured by the term P3g(e*_C*). This works against the desirability of

a subsidy.

     Thus, network externalities and expectations regarding the size of the

network affect optimal trade policy for oligopolistic industries in two

ways. First, the presence of expectations effects creates a wedge if there

are differences in the way the network externalities really work, as given

by e and e*, and the way they are expected to work, as given by c and                            e.
This wedge creates a role for government taxation/subsidization to correct
                                     -16-


this "distortion". Second, when the goods are compatible the existence of

network externalities in the absence of any expectations distortions tends

to make goods complementary. If in fact this effect dominates, the

direction of optimal policy is reversed.

3.1 Introduction

    Multimarket    interactions are said to exist when decisions made in one

market spill over into another by affecting optimal decisions there. The

existence of such interactions is important for two reasons. First, it

creates problems in identifying unfair trade practices since purely

"domestic" policies could actually be trade policies in disguise. Second,

such interactions are bound to exist in markets with network externalities,

both because markets are linked by common networks and because expectations

about network size are a determinant of demand and can be affected by

domestic government policy.

     The topic of multimarket oligopolies has aroused a great deal of

interest recently. The work of Bulow, Geanakoplos, and Klemperer (1985),

Fundenberg and Tirole (1985), Krugman (1981), and Baldwin and Krugman (1986)

is closely related to this part of the paper. Baldwin and Krugman (1986)

focus on an important technological aspect of the production of 16K RAMS:

the fact that experience lowers the effective cost of production. This

creates multimarket interactions that are made important by the extremely

large experience effects estimated to occur in this industry. They develop

a model that is rich enough to capture the particular aspects of

learning—by-doing in this industry, and then use their theoretical structure

in a simulation exercise to see if   the   effective closure of the Japanese
                                      —18—


market to imports played a critical role in developing Japanese superiority

in this area. Their results indicate that this closure did indeed play a

critical role. In this spirit, any domestic policy that raised Japanese

domesti.c output of semiconductors could have significant trade effects.

     Bulow, Geanakoplos and Kiemperer examine many examples of multimarket

interactions. The core of their work is their definition of "strategic

complements and substitutes" and they show that these play a crucial role in

the results of many oligopoly models.14 The approach of Eaton and Grossman

(1986) can also be extended, as is done in this paper, to better understand

such interactions in markets with the characteristics previously mentioned.

This approach provides a way of understanding multimarket interactions that

is complementary to that of Bulow, et al. (1985). It focuses on the wedges

created by differences between how firms expect the relevant variables to

affect profits and how they actually do so. These wedges create an

opportunity for possible government intervention.

     While many possibilities for multimarket interactions have been

discussed, network externalities and expectations concerning network size

have been neglected. In what follows, this paper will first discuss

informally how such network externalities make "success" across markets

positively correlated and then examine in a more formal way the differences

in the roles played by expectations and network externalities in such

interactions.

3.2 Network Externalities, Expectations, and Market Interactions

     Both the existence of network externalities and expectations about them

create linkages between markets and give rise to the possibility that

government policy in one market can affect a firm's competitive edge in

another.

     Consider for example a firm operating in two markets, a home and a

foreign market, and facing the same competitor in both of these markets.

Assume for concreteness that the two firms are Cournot multimarket

duopolists who produce incompatible products so that each firm's expected

network size is the size of its expected output in all its markets. A

fulfilled—expectations equilibrium15 where firms take expectations about

network size as given will be considered. Equilibrium is therefore

characterized by each firm maximizing profits by choosing its sales in each

market, taking as given its competitors' output and expectations about

network size. In order for expectations to be fulfilled, in equilibrium

each firm's total output must equal the expected network size as well.

     Any subsidy on domestic sales will tend to raise total output of the

domestic firm and lower the total output of the foreign firm. In a

fulfilled—expectations equilibrium, greater output will lead to greater

expectations about the network size of the domestic firm and smaller

expectations of the foreign network size. This will help the domestic firm

and hurt the foreign firm in both markets. Notice that domestic policy has

international effects because of the role played by expectations. The same

kind of argument works even if firms do not take expectations as given but

assume they are equal to their total output, since greater sales in the
                                                   —20-


domestic market raise marginal revenue in the foreign market due to the

effect via network externalities. Network externalities by themselves also

create multimarket interactions.

       The preceding argument can be made clearer by using a series of

diagrams to illustrate the process.16 It can be verified that the same kinds

of effects occur even when the effects of output changes on expectations are

taken into account by firms. Some notation is required at this point to

help follow the diagrams used to illustrate the process by which these

multimarket interactions occur. Since the products are incompatible, each

firm's network consists of its total expected output in the two markets.

The firm's problem is, therefore, to:


                                                                             -
            Max it(x,yI x*,y*,NE) =       r(x,x*,NE)       +    R(y,y*,NE)       c(x+y)
            x,y


where x,y are output levels of the domestic producer in the two markets;                        x
and y are the competitor's outputs in the markets, and c is the constant

marginal cost of the home firm.17             NE is the expected network size of the home

firm. The home firm's revenue functions in the two markets are r and R and

are assumed to have the usual properties, r2, r11, r12 < 0 and r3 > 0.                          It is
                                                                                            *   *
also   assumed that R2, R22, R12 < 0 and                  >    0. The home firm takes x ,y and
NE as given. This is denoted by the profit function, it,                         being conditional on
given values of these variables. Similarly, the foreign firm's problem is:


            Max it
                  *    * * x,y,N
                      (x   ,y I
                                  E
                                      )   = r* (x,x*,N*E       )   + R (y,y* ,N
                                                                      *      *E),
             **
            xy
                                             *
                                          - C (x
                                                 **+y ).
                                      —21—


Therefore, equilibrium in the home market (depicted in Figure la), where the

revenue functions of the home and foreign firm are given by r and r*, is

characterized by the intersection of the best response functions, b, b*,

implicitly defined by ir = 0 and
                                     =   0.   Similarly, equilibrium in the

the foreign market (shown in Figure ib) is defined by Ity = 0 and 1T* =   0.

Both these equations hold at the intersection of B and B* which are defined

by these equations. The usual stability conditions are also assumed in

Figures 1(a) and (b). These are equilibria only for the given expectations,

however. In addition, these expectations must be fulfilled. For a given

N*E, it is easy to verify that increases in NE shift the home firm's best

response function outwards in both markets and so raise its equilibrium

output in both markets. Therefore total output, N, of the domestic firm

rises with NE as shown in Figure 1(c) by N(NE) = NE.

     What happens to "A" as N*E changes? Since an increase in N*E shifts B*

and b* outward, it must reduce N for any NE. Thus, an increase in N*E

shifts N(NE) inwards so that the NE that is self fulfilling falls. This

relationship between the self fulfilling NE and N*E is depicted in 1(e) as

NE(N*E). Since the position of the two firms is symmetric, the same

arguments give another diagram, 1(d) analogous to 1(c), and another function

N*E(NE), depicted in 1(e), which for any NE gives the expectation of

N*E that is self—fulfilling. The intersection of these two loci, N*E(NE)

and NE(N*E), gives the set of expectations about NE and N*E which are

jointly self fulfilling. Once again, the relative slopes of these two

functions are as shown for stability reasons.

     How would a subsidy program for production for the domestic affect a
                                     —22—


firm abroad? The direct effect of a subsidy with given expectations about

network size would be to shift the best-response function at home outwards

to b', as shown in 1(a). This raises total output of the domestic firm for

the given expectations. In fact, it is easy to show that total output rises

for any given expectations. Thus, for any N*E, N(NE) would shift to the

right, to a line such as N' in Figure 1(c). Hence, for any N*E, the self

fulfilling expectation of NE would rise, or in other words, NE(N*E) would

shift outwards to a line such as NE, in Figure 1(e).

     Moreover, since the subsidy reduces total foreign output with the

original set of expectations, it must reduce total foreign output for any

given set of expectations, or in other words it must shift N*(NE) inwards to

    as in 1(d). This reduces the self fulfilling expectation level of

N*E for any NE, so that N*E(NE) shifts in as well to N*E, which is shown in

1(e). Both the shifts in Figure 1(e) raise the jointly self fulfilling

level of NE and lower that of N*E. This shifts demand for the domestic

product out and the foreign product in in both domestic and foreign markets,

shifting the equilibrium in these markets to the points "f" and "F" from "a"

and "A" in 1(a) and 1(b), respectively.

     A subsidy to the home firm in the home market raises expectations about

 its network size, which raises its output in all markets. A similar effect

could easily be demonstrated even if firms completely take into account the

 effects of output changes on expectations, because the size of the network

 still connects the two markets.

      Although this exercise shows how expectations and network externalities

 can link markets and how a subsidy to domestic sales can raise foreign and
                                                --
domestic sales, it does not say much about whether this subsidy is desirable.
Fortunately, the model developed in the previous section can be extended to

help answer these questions. The only modification that needs to be made is

to allow the firms to compete in two markets. The case where firms make

incompatible products is analyzed first. The results for compatible products

are similar and are presented more briefly later on.

     The domestic (foreign) firm is assume to behave as if it believed that

a unit change in the domestic (foreign) network would lead to an £(c)

change in the expected network.           'y and F are the conjectural variations

parameters for the domestic firm in the home and foreign market, and                and

   are the conjectural variations parameters for the foreign firm in the

home and foreign markets. r and R are the revenue functions of the domestic

firm in the domestic and foreign markets, respectively. r* and R* similarly

denote the revenues of the foreign firm in these markets. An (e,e*)

fulfilled expectations equilibrium is analyzed as before. Domestic

consumption of the domestic firm's output is taxed or subsidized by the

government at the rate t. Hence, the profits, ir, of the domestic firm are

given by:


            it   = (1_t)r(x,x*,NE)    +   R(y,y*,,4E)   -
                                                            c(x+y)

and ,r, the profits of the foreign firm, are given by:

              *
                  = r* (x,x*,N*E )      *   * *E
                                     + R (y,y ,N )      - c* (x*+y*).

     The four first-order conditions are given by:

The first two equations define equilibrium in the home market given y*,x*, and

the second two define equilibrium in the foreign market given x,y. The

condition that expectations be (e,e*) fulfilled requires that in addition

NE =    e(x+y)      and N*E =           e*(x*+y*).         These conditions will give the equilibrium

levels of x, x, y and y as a function only of t. Also, comparative statics

on the system will give the effects of changing t on these endogenous

        For simplicity, the welfare function is broken into two components,

consumer surplus, W, and profits, W. The effects of t on the two

components are analyzed separately. This isolates the strategic multimarket

profit shifting effects, so that they can be analyzed clearly. Notice that

in (13), welfare depends on t only indirectly via the effect of t on the

endogenous variables.

                                                                       dx/dt'                           dy/dt'
and h = dy/dt          Now, equation (14) can be expressed as:
           dx/dt

            dWlT
(15)               =                           +            +              +
                        ([(c—R3c)/(1—'c)]          hc'y3t        (g—y)r2       (G—r)R2h

                   +
                        (r3+R3)(e-c)(1+h)).

       The first-order conditions for a welfare maximum will give t to be zero

optimally if actual changes due to a slight change in tariffs are equal to

the conjectural changes, or if g =                 y,   G =     r,   and e =

       The previous Cournot example can be analyzed in this framework by

setting y = 0 =         r,   G <   0,   g < 0 and c =       0, e = 1, h > 0.           Since (g-y)r2 > 0

and (G—r)R2 >      0,    these effects call for a subsidy on domestic production.

This is the standard effect that depends on the form of competition, as

pointed out by Eaton and Grossman.

       Moreover, notice that although the subsidy is imposed at home, the

effects of a subsidy are desirable in both markets. This is evident in

their being two terms, one for the domestic market and one for the foreign

market. A subsidy desirable in the home market since the domestic firm is

being too "pessimistic" in its conjectures at home which leads it to produce

too little and a subsidy alleviates this distortion. This effect is
                                           —26-


captured by the term (g-y)r2 being positive. A subsidy is desirable abroad

because it causes the domestic firm's output to rise in both markets so that

h is positive, and because the domestic firm is being too "pessimistic"

abroad as well. This is captured by the term (G-r)R2h being positive.

     Expectations affect revenues in both markets. For this reason we see

the term r3 + R3 in equation (15). Since the effects of a subsidy are

direct at home and indirect abroad, we see the terms (1+h) multiplying the

term (r3+R3) in equation (15). Finally, since e -        £>0     in this case, firms

are too conservative in their estimate of the network benefits of increased

output. For this case, (r3+R3)(e-e)(1+h) is positive, since h is positive

and the expectation effect just reinforces the previous effects. Therefore,

the optimal policy would be a subsidy. This completes the analysis of

profit shifting in the Cournot example.

     If c   0, the sign of the term multiplying t in (15) is ambiguous.
However, as long as    < 0   at t =   0,   similar arguments to those previously

made indicate the direction of welfare increasing policies from an initial

state of no taxes or subsidies on domestic consumption of the domestic good.

If, for example, firms over-estimate the effect of output on network

expectations so that e -   £ < 0,   and g = 'y and G =   r,   then a small tax on

domestic consumption of the domestic firm's product will raise welfare from

the t = 0 welfare level.

      It is clear from the expression for the change in welfare that the

optimal policy depends not only on the form of the strategic interaction, as

 parameterized by F and r relative to g and G, but also on the sign of h. In

 addition, it also depends on the distortions inherent in the expectations

       Now to turn to the effects on consumer surplus,

where U(s) is the utility function being maximized.

                       {(U1-r1+eU3-er3—r)                        (U2_r_r2+U4e*_re*)g

                       (U3—r3)eh           (U4-r3)e Gh}.

       The four terms in brackets give the effect of changes in x, x, y and y

due to changes in t on consumer surplus. Since U1 = P, the inverse demand

function facing the domestic producer at home, U1 —                                   r1,    is positive.

Similarly, U2 -           is     also positive. U3 -                        r3   is positive/negative if an

increase in the network size raises utility more/less than it raises

revenues. The sign of this term is ambiguous and depends on the particular

specification of demand used. A useful interpretation, along the lines of

Spence (1976), can be made as follows.

       If increments in network externalities are valued less for marginal

units than for all units on average, then U3 -                                       is   positive. If the

increments in network externalities are valued more for marginal units than

for all units on average, then U3 -                         r3    is negative. This is because
                                                  -28--




(18)                  x*, e(x+y), e*(x*+y*)] -         r3(x,   x, e(x+y))
             1J3(x,


             =   JXIJ (s,    x, e(x+y)]ds — P3(x, x, e(x+y))x


             =
                 x( fxp(s     x, e(x+y)]ds - P3(x, x, e(x+y)]).


       The first term is the average willingness to pay for increments in the

network size over all units purchased while the latter is the willingness to

pay at the margin for increments in network size.2° The interpretation of

U4 -   r    is similar to this. Also, r and r2 are negative since the goods are

substitutes. The effects of a tax or subsidy on consumer surplus can now be

analyzed.

       Assume that a tax lowers x. Consumer surplus is affected through four

channels, x, x, y and y*, as shown. First consider the effect via x

directly. A tax reduces x and since the fall in utility exceeds the fall in

expenditure, this reduces consumer surplus. This is captured by the term

U1 -        being positive. The fall in x also reduces the network size. This is
       r1
                              If U3 —        is positive, the fall in the network size
captured by U3 -       r3.              r3
will also reduce consumer surplus. If U3 - r3 is negative, it will raise

consumer surplus. Since the goods are substitutes,                             < 0   and the fall in x

will raise the revenues of the foreign firm in the domestic market which, for

a given level of x*, will reduce consumer surplus.                    Therefore, the effect of a

 tax via x reduces consumer surplus as long as U3 -                   r3   >    0.
                                             *
                                                  If              .
                                                       the fall in x raises x ,
                                                                                .       * i.e.,   g <   0,
       Now turn to the effect via x .
           *
 and U4 - r3 > 0, then g(—) < 0.                 A tax then raises consumer surplus via
                                ax
 its effect of raising x

        y effects consumer surplus only via its effect on network size. If
                                                            —29-


h >   o,   so that a tax reduces sales in both markets, then the effect via y also

reduces consumer surplus if U3 -               r3      >    0.

           also affects consumer surplus only through its effect on network size.

If 0 <0, h >         0,   then the tax raises y thereby raising the network for the
                                                                          *
foreign    firm and raising consumer surplus if U4 -                      r3   >   0.
       The total effect of a tax on consumer surplus is therefore rather

complicated and consumer surplus could rise or fall with a tax. For the

Cournot example previously discussed, if the average increase in the

willingness to pay associated with an increase in network size

exceeds the marginal increase in the willingness to pay, and direct effects

on surplus via x and y outweigh the relatively indirect ones via x and y
                                                                                                 *    *
a tax reduces consumer surplus. Thus, if a subsidy is called for due to

strategic considerations in maximizing W, it will also raise consumer

surplus.

        Exactly the same procedure can be used to define the welfare effects of

a tax or subsidy when the products are compatible. The analogous

expression to equation (15) is somewhat formidable. With compatible

products W is given by:

                  = (1-t)r(x,           *          *         *             *            *    *
                                    x ,     e(x+x      +y+y )] +   R[y,   y ,      e(x+x +y+y )] - c(x+y).

Then,

                            c-R
                          {t      c(1+y)
                it

(19)                 =                      + hcr3(1+r)]

                     +
                          (r3+R3)(e[(1+g)
                                               +    (1+G)h] — c((1+y) + (1+r)h))

                                    +                  dx
                     +
                          (g-y)r2       h(G—r)R2J.
                                                                  -30-


Notice that even with compatible products there is a role for subsidizing

domestic consumption of the domestic firm. If, for example, e -                                         £ > 0,

9 = y < 0, G = y       <   0, h > 0,                <    0 and ((l+g) + (1+G)h)             >   0,   then        >   0

for "t" close to zero, so that a subsidy raises domestic profits. However,

with compatible products, some of the benefits of a larger network accrue to

the foreign firm, and even if e >                        c,   it may not be worthwhile subsidizing

domestic consumption in order to shift profits. This is captured by the

fact that (l+g) + (1+G)h is required to be positive as well in this case.

Also,

             C =             *                 *         *        - r(x, x*,           *        *
            W      U(x,     x ,   e(x+x            +y+y )]                         e(x+x   +y+y )]


                - r*       [x, x ,
                                  *   e(x+x
                                                    *         *
                                                        +y+y )].


Therefore,

             dWC =                        +
                                                              *         —
                                                                             *

                   +
                       [(u3—r3—r)e](h+Gh)}.

 It can, however, be analyzed as done for incompatible products.

        The basic message of this section and the last one is fairly clear. If

 firms tend to underestimate the benefits of output increases in creating

 network externalities, there will be a role for government intervention both

 to shift profits to domestic firms from foreign firms in a third market, and

 to use subsidies on domestic sales to help their competitive position in

 foreign markets where it may be illegal to offer such subsidies. In
                                      —31—


addition, such subsidies may also raise consumer surplus.

     This should not be taken as a call for government action to subsidize

domestic production for the domestic market for at least three reasons.

First, governments may not be informed enough to identify a welfare

increasing policy. Second, even if a welfare increasing policy is

identified, the government may not be able to implement it since the

possibility of subsidization may unleash lobbying efforts which endogenously

determine the policy as well as waste resources. Third, foreign governments

may well retaliate with consequent possible losses for all parties.

However, since these domestic subsidies are legal under the GATT,

governments will be tempted to use them in the hope that they will be

beneficial. For this reason trade policy toward certain high tech

industries could easily be conducted in an extremely non-cooperative way

with consequent losses for all parties.

                  Other Features of HIQh Tech Industries


    There are other characteristics of high tech industries that make this

sector special and pose difficulties f or the trading system. Another

feature of such industries, which is also related to the existence of

network externalities, is that firms have a choice of what product standards

to adopt or which network to link to. This choice is often posed ai one of

deciding whether to make one's product compatible with competitor's

products. This matter has at least two aspects that are relevant for trade

policy. The first is that in an effort to keep out competition, firms may

deny networks linkages to competitors by making their product incompatible

with products of foreign firms, thereby effectively impeding competition.

Often international competition is more effective in holding down excess

profits than domestic competition, given the size of some firms in

industries.

     Aho and Aronson (1983) recognize this point. They point out that

"except for the United States and Canada almost all major countries provide

telecommunication services through government-owned or -controlled postal,

telegraph and telephone authorities. Neither group of countries is likely

to abandon their regulatory preferences; therefore, rules need to be

negotiated to allow for fair competition between public and private sector

firms" (Aho and Aronson, 1985, p. 147).

     The second trade policy aspect of such compatibility decisions is that
                                      —33.-



trade restrictions in product lines where network externalities are

important may well affect the nature of compatibility choice. The manner in

which they might do so is not well—understood at present.

     High tech industries are also characterized by high rates of

technological change and the presence of very significant rates of

experience effects. For example, the capabilities of a modern personal

computer worth $2,000 are equivalent to those of a mainframe computer that

cost several million dollars in the early seventies. Nor is the end in

sight for this technological revolution. Technological change has reduced

the real price of a Unit of computing capacity in the semi-conductor

industry by 99 between 1976 and 1984.21

     In the semi-conductor industry there are also significant experience

effects. This comparative advantage in such industries can be "made"22 to a

large extent. This puts enormous pressure on governments to act to secure

the advantages brought by experience for domestic firms, since these

industries are likely to be critical ones, both economically and for

national security. Recent work by Baldwin and Krugman (1986) paints a

convincing picture using a simulation model, that current Japanese

superiority in semi—conductors may well be due to the effective closure of

the Japanese market to foreign firms that allowed Japanese firms to benefit

from experience effects.23 While this may lead to advantages for a country

if it is the only one operating such policies, it is likely to be mutually

destructive if all countries subsidize particular high tech industries to

gain an experience advantage.

     Still another feature of high tech industries is their extremely high
                                     —34-


level of research and development expenditure and the related problem in

enforcing property rights, especially for software. Since counterfeiting is

becoming a significant trade problem for some high tech industries, it is

important to consider ways of regulating property rights optimally in this

area 24

     Finally, there are likely to be large switching costs and coordination

problems in high tech industries where many possible standards are possible

ex-ante. For example, it has been suggested that although the DVORAK typing

board is more efficient than the QWERTY one,25 even allowing for retraining

costs, the latter remains the standard.26 This makes it important for

national policy on standards to be formulated at an early stage.

Shapiro (1985).

2.   The classic example of this comes from the computer industry. Although

when the Macintosh came out it was universally regarded as a far superior

machine to the IBM PC, its main competitor, the expectation that the IBM

machines would ulitmately set the industry standard gave IBM a definite

competitive edge over Apple. See J. Pepper (1986) for a discussion of this.

Geanakoplos and Klemperer (1985) have contributed to this.

precommit, and even if it does, it may not be able to credibly do so.

6.   See Bulow, Geanakoplos and Klemperer (1985) and Fundenberg and Tirole

(1985) for more on this topic. Multimarket interactions exist when a firm's

behavior in one market affects its optimal behavior in another.

7.   This could be accomplished by a domestic consumption subsidy on the

firm's product or a production subsidy coupled with a requirement that the

subsidy be rebated if the product is exported.

8.   This is of course assuming no retaliation!

9.   See Bresnehan (1981), Perry (1982), and Kamien and Schwartz (1983) on

conjectural variations and consistent conjectural variations. There may be

significant problems with existence of equilibirum in such models, which are
                                     —36-


not addressed in this paper.
10. The usual objections to conjectional variations in game theory, such as

the lack of an extensive form associated with the game, are important to note.

Nevertheless it remains a useful tool.

11. In general N*E and NE could also enter P and P respectively, and this

can easily be incorporated in the framework provided. A model which provides

a special case of the one presented is that of Katz and Shapiro (1985). In

their model goods are perfect substitutes for each other so that inverse

demand depends on total output and own expected network size.

12. Of course, the usual assumption of a numeraire good is made.

13. There are often multiple equilibria in such models as a result of the

usual bootstrapping phenomena associated with expectations. That is, there

may be many expectations that are consistent in the sense of being

self-fulfilling. It remains possible, however, to do comparative statics by

choosing any one of these, since they are locally unique.

14. A firm is said to regard its product as a strategic substitute

(complement) for its competitors if more aggressive play by its rival lowers

(raises) the marginal profitability of more aggressive play by itself.

15. The assumptions made in the diagrams ensure that the equilibrium is

unique. There may in general be many fulfilled-expectations equilibria.

There are usually only a finite number of these, which ensures local

uniqueness of an equilibrium.

16. These diagrams are simlar to those in Krugman (1982).

17. This is because non-constant marginal costs can provide another link

across markets. See Krugmari (1982) for an analysis of such interactions.

18. In addition, when e, and/or R3 are large enough, the term premultiplying

t need not be positive. This must be taken into account as well.

19. As usual, a numeraire good is assumed to exist. Demand arises from

utility maximization subject to a budget constraint. Also, all profits and

tax revenues are returned to consumers in a lump sum manner.

20. It is assumed that P3(o, x*, e(x+y)) = 0, which is reasonable since if no

units are purchased, there is no reason to value increments in network size.

21. See Baldwin and Krugman (1986).

22. See Krugman (1985) for a model that shows how comparative advantage can

be "made.t'

23. Baldwin and Krugman (1986) argue that this was destructive even in the

Japanese case.

24. Recent work by Grossman and Shapiro (1986) is a step in this direction.

25. See, for example, David (1984).

26. See Farrell and Saloner (1985) for a model that addresses such inertia.
