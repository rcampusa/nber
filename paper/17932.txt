We examine the effects of a major Swedish educational reform, that increased the years of
compulsory schooling, on mortality and health. Using the gradual phase-in of the reform between
1949 and 1962 across municipalities, we estimate insignificant effects of the reform on mortality
in the affected cohorts. From the confidence intervals we can rule out effects larger than 1-1.4
months of increased life expectancy. We find no significant impacts on mortality for individuals
of low SES backgrounds, on deaths that are more likely to be affected by behavior, on
hospitalizations, and consumption of prescribed drugs.

  The strong correlation between socio-economic status (SES) and health is one of the most
recognized and studied in the social sciences. Economists have pointed at differences in
resources, preferences and knowledge associated with different SES groups as possible
explanations (see e.g. Grossman, 2006, for an overview). However, a causal link between any
of these factors and later life health is hard to demonstrate and the relative importance of
different contributing factors is far from clear. A series of studies (e.g. Lleras-Muney, 2005;
Oreopoulos, 2006; Clark and Royer, 2013, Lager and Torssander, 2012; summaries in
Mazumder, 2008 and 2012), use regional differences in compulsory schooling laws or
changes in national legislations on compulsory schooling as a source of exogenous variation
in educational attainment in order to identify a causal effect of education on health. The
results from these studies are mixed. Lleras-Muney (2005) for the US, Oreopoulos (2006) for
the UK and van Kippersluis, O’Donnell, and van Doorslaer (2011) for the Netherlands find a
strong link between attained schooling and adult health and mortality, Lager and Torssander
(2012) find some effects, while Clark and Royer (2013) cannot reject the null hypothesis that
extra schooling has no impact on later-life health. Analyzing outcomes of twins Behrman et
al. (2011) find no causal impact of schooling on health in Denmark.

  In this paper we study the long-term health consequences of the introduction of a
comprehensive school in Sweden, which mandated an increase in the number of years of
compulsory schooling from 7 or 8 years (depending on municipality) to a new compulsory
national level of 9 years. The reform was intentionally phased in between 1949 and 1962 by
being adopted early by some municipalities while others delayed its introduction. The reform
had a sizeable impact on educational attainment in Sweden (Meghir and Palme, 2005;
Holmlund, 2007; Spasojevic, 2010; Meghir et al., 2012). Prior work has shown that labor
earnings increased later in life for those exposed to the comprehensive school, in particular for
children born in homes with low educated fathers (Meghir and Palme, 2005).

  We use register data including about 1.5 million individuals born between 1940 and 1957,
which enables us to link assignment of type of school system to individual information from
national registers on three different health outcomes. First, we study mortality using date and
cause of death from the national Swedish Cause of Death Register.1 The follow-up period
stops in December 31, 2015, which means that the birth cohort born in 1940 is aged 75 when
we stop observing them. Second, we look at hospitalization by cause using the Swedish In-
patient register containing all hospitalization dates and ICD diagnosis codes for all hospital
stays in Sweden between 1987 and 2014. Finally, we use the national Prescription register
containing information on quantities and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes for
all prescribed drugs in Sweden between 2005 and 2015.
  We consider the impact of the reform on overall mortality as well as on death by cause. We
first distinguish between deaths caused by circulatory diseases, shown here to be strongly
associated with educational attainment, and by cancer, which is the main cause of death in the
age group we study. We also consider causes of death classified by epidemiologists as
“treatable” and “preventable” causes.
  We use two estimation strategies. First, a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach that
compares changes in mortality outcomes across cohorts in municipalities that implemented
the reform compared to those that did not. Since we use 14 years of gradual implementation
across the (approximately) 1,000 municipalities, we have many such comparisons, leading to



  1

very high levels of precision. The second approach, a regression discontinuity (RD), exploits
the cutoff date for assigning a child to a school year. In the calendar year when the reform is
implemented the children born before 1st January are assigned to the pre-reform system, while
those born after that date are assigned to the school year that first implements the reform. In
all cases the econometric approach is based on a Cox proportional hazard model for lifetime
duration.
  One of the advantages of this research, as compared to previous studies relying on similar
educational changes to identify the education gradient in life expectancy, is that the Swedish
reform allows us to study two groups of people, born in the same years and active in the same
labor markets, but having been educated by two different education systems at the same time.
This allows us to use the econometric techniques described above rather than comparing
across different birth cohorts or across groups of people brought up in different states that
may differ in numerous ways. Compared to previous Swedish studies (such as Lager and
Torssander, 2012 and Spasojevic, 2010) we use both Regression Discontinuity, and
Difference in Differences, a much larger sample, a longer follow-up period and a larger set of
outcome variables.
  Our results show that, although the reform significantly elevated the educational attainment
of the least skilled and increased the average years of schooling by more than a quarter of a
year, it did not affect the life expectancy of those assigned to the new school system compared
to the old one. Neither do we find an impact on hospitalization or drug use. This is despite a
strong association between schooling and better health outcomes that we establish in our
descriptive analysis.




                           I. The Comprehensive School Reform

                  A. The Swedish School System before and after the Reform

  Prior to the implementation of the comprehensive school reform, pupils attended a common
basic compulsory school (folkskolan) until grade six. After the sixth grade pupils were
selected to continue either for one or, in mainly urban areas, two years in the basic
compulsory school, or to attend the three year junior secondary school (realskolan). The
selection of pupils into the two different school tracks was based on their past performance,
measured by grades. The pre-reform compulsory school was in most cases administered at the
municipality level. The junior secondary school was a prerequisite for the subsequent upper
secondary school, which was itself required for higher education.
  In 1948 a parliamentary committee proposed a school reform that implemented a new nine-
year compulsory comprehensive school.2 The comprehensive school reform had three main
elements:
            1. An extension of the number of years of compulsory schooling to 9 years in the
         entire country.
            2. Abolition of early selection in different schooling tracks based on academic
         ability. Although pupils in the comprehensive schools were able to choose between
         three tracks after the sixth grade - one track including vocational training, a general
         track, and an academic level preparing for later upper secondary school - they were
         kept in common schools and classes until the ninth grade. This is likely to have
         resulted in changes in the peer groups of pupils going through the reformed schooling
         system, leading to a broader of mix of students by SES and ability over a longer period
         of their schooling.
            3. Introduction of a national curriculum. The pre-reform compulsory schools were
         administered by municipalities and the pre-reform curriculum varied between
         municipalities. The new national curriculum equalized academic standards across
         Sweden. While there is no direct evidence that the quality of schooling was affected
         by the reform, we cannot exclude the possibility that it changed.



                               B. The Phased Introduction of the Reform

  The phased introduction of the reform, with the new comprehensive nine-year compulsory
school, was viewed at the time as a social experiment, albeit not randomized. It started during
an assessment period between 1949 and 1962, when the new curriculum was finalized.3 The
proposed new school system, as described above, was introduced in municipalities or parts of
city communities, which in 1952 numbered 1,055 (including 18 city communities).



  2
     The school reform and its development are described in Meghir and Palme (2005), Meghir et al (2012), and
Holmlund (2007). Holmlund (2007) offers detailed analysis of the implementation of the reform and shows that,
conditional on municipality fixed effects, there are no significant observable predictors of the timing of the
reform. For more detailed reference on the reform, see Marklund (1981).
   3
     The official evaluation was mainly of administrative nature. Details on this evaluation are also described in
Marklund (1981).
  Municipalities could elect to implement the comprehensive school starting with first or fifth
grade. Once the grade of implementation was fixed, all individuals from the cohort
immediately affected and all subsequent cohorts went to comprehensive school. The older
cohorts continued in the pre-reform school. Although many new schools were built as a
consequence of the extension of compulsory schooling and municipalities were offered
subsidized loans from the government to build schools (see Marklund, 1981), most of the
post-reform schooling took place in the existing school buildings and the same teachers from
the pre-reform system were used in the comprehensive school.
  The phased-in introduction of the reform implied that the curricula of the pre- and post-
reform school systems were taught in parallel in the same schools. However, the post-reform
children were always younger than the pre-reform ones and the post-reform system was never
rolled back in any municipality. The pre-reform junior secondary schools that formed the
academic track in the pre-reform school system, were phased out as a consequence of the
reform. The school buildings were in some cases used for the last three grades in the new
comprehensive school, but in many cases used for the expanding upper secondary schooling.
  Figure 1 shows the take up rate of the experiment by cohort. It is evident from Figure 1 that
the cohorts included in our empirical analysis, born between 1940 and 1957, cover the entire
period of implementation of the comprehensive school. In 1962 it was decided that the new
comprehensive school would become the standard education in Sweden. The last class that
graduated from the old schooling system did so in 1970.




  FIGURE 1 - PERCENTAGE       SHARE OF BIRTH COHORT ASSIGNED TO THE POST REFORM

(COMPREHENSIVE) SCHOOL SYSTEM.
   The selection of municipalities was not based on random assignment. However, the
decision to select the implementing areas was based on an attempt to choose locations that
were representative for the entire country, both in terms of demographics as well as
geographically. In the first phase of the experiment a committee appointed by the National
Board of Education chose municipalities from a pool of applicants in order to form a
“representative” sample of municipalities. In later phases of the experiment the selection
process became less strict.
   Meghir and Palme (2005) and Holmlund (2007) study the effect of the comprehensive
school reform on educational attainments. Meghir and Palme’s (2005) estimates are based on
individual reform assignment recorded in school registers. For their entire sample they find
0.252 additional years of education for males and 0.339 years for females; for low SES
background persons the estimates are 0.3 extra years for males and 0.512 for females.
Holmlund (2007) reports estimates in the range 0.21-0.61 additional years of schooling for
men and 0.13-0.44 for women.4



             II. Data and the Association between Educational Attainments and Health

   The original sample was obtained from Statistic Sweden’s Multiple Generation Register
(see Statistics Sweden, 2012).5 We include all who were born in Sweden between 1940 and
1957 and who survived until the year they turn age 16. This sample resulted in 2,184,857
observations (1,115,426 males and 1,069,431 females). We acquired data from the Population
Census on church parish of birth, which was subsequently used to infer the municipality of
birth and reform assignment, for 2,064,013 individuals from the original sample.
   To assign date of reform assignment for each of the municipalities, i.e., the first birth cohort
assigned to the reform, we use information on municipality of birth combined with an
algorithm described in Holmlund (2007) and generously provided to us by Helena Holmlund.6
The original sources for date of implementation used by Holmlund are Marklund (1981) and
various reports obtained by the National Board of Education (Skolöverstyrelsen) and listed by

       Holmlund (2007) does not have individual treatment status and imputes it from municipality of residence in 1960.
   5
     All the register information described above was merged using the personal identification numbers by
Statistics Sweden.
   6
      The advantage of using municipality of birth as a basis of reform assignment - rather than municipality of residence, or self-reported
reform status – is that it is not susceptible to parental choice of reform assignment, based on child ability. This could be achieved by moving
to a municipality with a particular reform status corresponding to the year of birth of their child. There is also some evidence that that parents
let their children live with relatives to avoid the reform if it was implemented in their municipality of living (see Marklund, 1981, or Meghir
and Palme, 2005, for empirical evidence).
Holmlund (2007). Since the reform was implemented by parts of the cities in Sweden’s three
largest cities - Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmoe – and because we have no historical
records on which cohorts were first affected in each of these parts, we have excluded those
born in these cities from the data. This reduced the sample to 1,562,522 observations.
  Our main outcome variable is mortality, which has the strong advantage that its reporting
does not depend on individual behavior (as hospitalizations might, for example). For the
purpose of context, male life expectancy in 2015 in Sweden was 80.7 years and female was
84 years. As far as our sample is concerned 25.4 percent of those not assigned to the reform
were observed until death as well as 14.6 of those assigned. Of course, the latter group is on
average younger. On average, individuals who went through the old schooling system have
11.4 years of schooling; those who went through the post-reform schools have 12 years. We
show some basic descriptive statistics about the sample in Table 1 below.

  We use two further sets of health measures as outcomes: data on number of nights in
hospital care obtained from the National in-patient register and data on all prescribed drugs
obtained from the National prescription register. The National in-patient register contains
information on duration and ICD codes for all hospital stays in Swedish hospitals. It has
national coverage since 1987 and we have data through December 31, 2014. The National
prescription register includes quantities, measured in defined daily doses, and ATC codes for
all prescribed drugs in Sweden since 2005. We use data for the period until December 31,
2015.
  Data on educational attainment for the father of the individual included in our sample was
obtained from the 1970 census where only those aged 60 or younger were included. This
restricts the sample to individuals with fathers born after 1910 when we report results by
parental education (1,347,854 observations). Data on the individual’s own education was
obtained from the National Education Register included in the Integrated Database for Labour
Market Research (LISA, see Statistics Sweden, 2011).7 Descriptive statistics including sample
size are reported in the appendix.
  We describe the association between mortality and education using a Cox proportional
hazard model (see e.g. Cox and Oakes, 1984) as well as a linear probability model (LPM).
With discrete duration data the hazard function at the heart of the Cox model is interpreted as
the conditional probability of dying in the next age interval given survival to that age. This
takes the form



(1)                       𝐼! 𝑟 𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐, 𝑇 = 𝐼! 𝑟 exp 𝜃𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐! + 𝛾 ! 𝑇! ,


  where, r is duration to death (age), educ represents years of education and T are cohort
dummies (not reported). The function I0(r) is left unrestricted. This model is convenient
because it is straightforward to control for censoring (due to survival at the end of the sample


  7
     The National Education register only provides information on individual level of education. To obtain Years of schooling, we use
information on self-reported number of years of formal education for the relevant cohorts from the Swedish Level of Living surveys to
impute average years of schooling corresponding to each level.
period) and also naturally permits the analysis of competing risks, when considering
alternative causes of death. The coefficient 𝜃 measures the change in mortality at each age
associated with an extra year of education.
  In column 1 of Table 2 we report exp(𝜃), i.e. the ratio of the hazard for some level of
education relative to the hazard with one year less of education. Thus no impact of education
corresponds to a reported coefficient of one. A number below 1 is equivalent to a reduction in
the hazard. We also report the association between years of education and the probability of
dying in our sample period, using a linear probability model and controlling for cohort effects.

  In columns 2 and 3 we report results using independent competing risks models for the two
main causes of death in the sample: circulatory diseases, cancer and other. We repeat the
exercise by reclassifying the diseases as “preventable”, “treatable” and “other”.8 The
preventable causes of death may reflect health behaviors and investments and the treatable
ones may reflect access to healthcare.
  The association between mortality and education is statistically very strong: the first column
in Table 2 shows that an additional year of schooling is associated with a 7 percentage point
reduction in the mortality rate. This translates to an increase in life expectancy associated with
a year of education of 3.75 months for our observation window (16-75 years of age).9 It also
corresponds to a decline in the probability of dying of 0.0125 for each extra year of schooling


  8
     Circulatory diseases are defined as ICD-10: C Chapter and cancer as ICD-10: I Chapter in the Swedish Cause of Death Registry.
Appendix Table A1 reports how these are classified using the ICD codes available in the data.
   9
     This estimate is obtained by integrating the difference between the baseline hazard and the prediction obtained by calculating
𝑆 𝑡 𝑥! = 𝑆! !"# (!!! ) , where exp 𝛽𝑥! is the hazard ratio estimate for years of schooling, ie., 0.9286 (see Cleves et al., 2004).
within our sample as shown by the linear probability model. As a benchmark, for the cohorts
under consideration life expectancy overall has been estimated to have increased by 1.6 years
and average schooling increased by 2.4 years. If the reported association reflected a causal
impact, the increase in education would have accounted for 47 percent of the increase in life
expectancy. The remaining columns show that the effect is largest for circulatory diseases but
similar for treatable and preventable diseases.
  In the appendix (Tables A3 and A4) we show how education is related to days of
hospitalization and to the use of prescription drugs. Overall, an extra year of education is
associated with fewer days in hospital (-1.9 with SE of 0.035). Interestingly, an extra year of
schooling is associated with a 0.6 percentage point reduction in pain relief medication usage
and 0.33 percentage point reduction in the use of antidepressants, an issue of relevance given
the opioid epidemic in the US.
  The implication from this section is clear: there is a very strong statistical association
between improved health and education, even in a high income country such as Sweden, with
its strong welfare system and almost universal access to high quality healthcare. The key
question is, of course, whether there is a causal link.



        III. Empirical Strategy for estimating the effect of the educational reform

  To estimate the impact of the reform on our various outcomes we use two approaches. The
first is based on a difference in differences (DiD) design and the second is based on regression
discontinuity (RD).
  The DiD design exploits the fact that individuals in the same birth cohort were either
exposed to the educational reform or not, depending on which municipality they lived in. For
some of the outcomes, namely years of education, days of hospitalization, indicators for
hospitalization for various diseases and for prescription drugs we use the standard linear
difference in differences model. In our DiD specifications we include a dummy variable for
gender, a full set of dummies for municipality of birth, a full set of cohort dummies, separate
linear trends for each municipality of birth and, finally, an indicator of whether the individual
was assigned to the reform.
  To examine the effects of mortality we use both a linear probability model (as is standard in
DiD specifications) where the outcome is death in any year the person is observed in the
sample. We also use a Cox proportional hazard model for the duration of life again based on
the DiD assumption to identify the effect. The index function is the same in both
specifications. However, in the Cox proportional hazard model we stratify on municipality of
birth. This means that we allow for different baseline hazard in each municipality of birth,
which is more flexible than simply including separate dummy variables for each municipality.
Also, rather than including separate linear trends for each of the about 1,000 different
municipalities of birth, we estimate separate linear trends for each group of municipalities,
grouped by the year they implemented the reform.10
   As Altonji and Blank (1999) and Athey and Imbens (2006) point out the DiD approach does
not require linearity. The assumptions required are that (i) the outcome variable in the
untreated state is related to unobservable heterogeneity in a strictly monotonic fashion; (ii) the
distribution of this unobservable must be time invariant, but may depend on the group to
which the individual belongs (here the municipality); and (iii) conditional on a value for this
unobservable, growth of the outcome in the absence of treatment is assumed independent of
group, which is the usual common growth assumption.11 The linear model is just a special
case of this.
   Based on these ideas, and while a nonparametric analysis is in principle possible (as shown
in Athey and Imbens, 2006) we take the simpler route of using the Cox proportional hazard
model.12 This allows us to deal with censoring and with competing risks when we look at
death by cause. We also show results using the standard linear probability model where the
outcome is mortality over the sample period, as in the descriptive analysis. This is a standard
linear DiD regression.
   Similarly to the descriptive analysis, for the Cox model the hazard function at duration of
life r takes the form
   (2)       𝐼!,!,!,! 𝑟|𝑋 = 𝐼!,! 𝑟 𝑒𝑥𝑝 𝛽𝑅!,!,! + 𝛾! 𝐹! + 𝛾!! 𝑇! + 𝛾!! 𝐺! ∗ 𝐶! ,
   where i, m and t are sub-indices for individual, municipality and birth cohort, respectively;
the function Iom(r) varies freely by municipality and age; R indicates whether the individual
was assigned to the reform or not based on municipality of birth and cohort; T is a vector of
dummy variables for cohort of birth; F is a dummy variable for female; G is a vector of
dummy variables indicating the first cohort to implement the post-reform school system in the
individual’s municipality of birth and C is the individual’s year of birth. Thus the Gi*Ci term

   10
        Given the nonlinear nature of this approach adopting 1000 separate trends would be computationally infeasible.
   11
      If the outcome variable is discrete then point estimates require a functional form assumption – most people use the linear probability
model when they have a binary outcome – however this is just one possible identifying assumption.
   12
      The nonparametric approach is particularly complicated by the large number of treatment and comparison groups and the numerous
periods.
allows for differential trends by municipality groups classified by the year in which they
implemented the reform. The 1000 or so municipality fixed effects are absorbed by the
baseline hazard, which is different for each municipality and is not specified parametrically.13
The coefficient β measures the effect of the reform on mortality. By using these various
approaches, we hope to improve confidence in the results.
   When we consider death by different causes we use the independent competing risks
models.14 The hazard function for each cause of death takes the same form as above.
   This approach identifies the impact by comparing growth in the outcome variable across
municipalities. An alternative approach is to identify the effect of the reform within
municipalities based on a regression discontinuity design where we use the threshold date that
determines in which year the child will start attending school - 1st January in Sweden. Anyone
born on or after that date in the calendar year of the reform implementation is assigned to the
reform. Before that date they are assigned to the previous school year and, as a result, to the
old schooling system. Ideally we would use a very narrow window around the discontinuity,
comparing outcomes of people born just before the cutoff date and those born just after;
however this would lead to too small a sample. Instead of restricting the bandwidth, we use
polynomials in the month-distance from the discontinuity (one before and one after)
combined with dummy variables to control for month of birth effects. The assumption is that
these polynomials control for any outcome-relevant differences for people born just before or
after the break point. In addition, the discontinuity is “fuzzy” in the sense that some people
may relocate their children to a different entry cohort than the one they are strictly assigned
to. In an attempt to further alleviate the potential effects of selective cohort placement we
assign individuals to the reform based on their municipality of birth and their date of birth,
akin to an intention to treat design.
   The specification we use for the hazard in this case is
   (3)
𝐼!,!,!,! 𝑟 𝑋 = 𝐼! 𝑟 exp (𝛽! 𝑅!,!,! + 𝛾! 𝑊! + 𝛾! 𝑊!! + 𝛾! 𝑊! 𝑅!,!,! + 𝛾! 𝑊!! 𝑅!,!,! + 𝛿𝑇! + 𝜃𝑍! )
   where W is a variable measuring the time in months to January 1st which is the cutoff date
for determining the school-year for the ith individual,15 Ti is a full set of dummy variable for
cohort of birth, Zi includes a dummy variable for gender as well as a full set of dummy


  13
      This model satisfies the assumptions stated by Athey and Imbens (2006) for nonlinear DiD models. A similar parametric approach in
the context of nonlinear DiD models was followed by Blundell, Dias, Meghir and van Reenen (2004).

      See Honoré and Lleras-Muney (2006) among others, on the identifiability of a competing risks model with dependent risks.

variables for month of birth to control for seasonal effects in time of birth (see Dobkin and
Fereira, 2010). In the estimation we included successively higher order polynomials until the
additional terms became insignificant. In all cases, a second order polynomial turned out to be
sufficient.16 We can interpret the coefficient β1 as the impact of the reform averaged across
discontinuities. In the appendix we also present results based on the linear probability model
using this discontinuity design. The conclusions do not change.
  Both empirical approaches (DiD and RD) control for time-invariant differences between the
treated and the comparison groups. Both have a causal interpretation under our assumptions
but they may relate to different sub-populations and if the effects are heterogeneous the
results may differ.
  Throughout, we present results for males and females separately because they are expected
to follow different underlying health processes. Since the reform had a stronger effect for
those with low educated fathers (see Meghir and Palme, 2005 and below), we also break
down the results by father’s education. We refer to those whose father had just compulsory
education as low socio-economic status (SES) and the rest as high SES.

                                                             IV. Results

                                A. Effects of the Reform on Educational Attainment

  In Table 3 we start by presenting the impact of the reform on years of education.17 The
results are broken down by father’s education and shown for males and females combined as
well as separately. The standard errors for all results are clustered at the municipality level.
  The sets of estimates from the two approaches are in general very similar. The reform led to
an increase of about 0.25 of a year in education. The effect is substantially larger for the low
SES group than and higher for males than for females. More detailed results including
impacts by level of education and the sample sizes for all comparisons are presented in
Appendix Table A2.




  16
       In addition, Gelman and Imbens (2014) recommend to not use higher order polynomials in order to avoid over-fitting.
  17
       This has been documented elsewhere for different samples (Meghir and Palme, 2005; Meghir et al, 2012), but not on this sample.

Notes: Each number represents an impact from a separate regression by method and demographic group. DiD specification
includes a full set of dummy variables for year of birth and municipality of birth as well as separate linear trends for
municipalities of birth. RD specification includes separate quadratic polynomials in the running variable before and after the
break point, a dummy variable for gender as well as a full set of dummy variables for month of birth. The samples of low and
high SES background men and women do not add up to the aggregate sample size because of missing information on father’s
education in the registry data. Standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered by municipality of birth.
   Finally, Figure 2 illustrates the effect graphically. The upper two panels illustrate the RD
models. The left panel refers to the proportion attending the pre-reform compulsory level of
education, while the right panel shows the years of education. Each dot in the figures
represents the average outcome by month of birth on the basis of distance from the first
month-of-birth cohort assigned to the reform in each municipality.18 The regressions
discontinuity estimates shown in Table 3 can be obtained using weighted least squares on the
collapsed data shown in the upper panels of Figure 2.
   For each outcome there is a marked jump at the first cohort assigned to the reform.
However, the figures also show apparent trends pre-reform towards higher educational
attainment. The main reason for this overall trend in the graph is a composition effect: groups
of observations (dots) that are distant from the discontinuity and to the left will represent more
municipalities that delay the reform, which is correlated with lower schooling. This feature is
controlled for in the regression analysis and does not obscure the fact that there is a clear
break at the time of the reform in the municipality.

   18
       That is, if the first cohort in a municipality to be assigned to the reform was those born in January 1948, those who were born in, say,
April 1949, are born 15 months after the first month of birth cohort in that municipality. Correspondingly, those born in January 1947 are
born 12 months before the first ones assigned to the reform. To the right of zero on the horizontal-axis we have the treated group and to the
left the comparison group.
         The lower panels of Figure 2 show the average residuals from a DiD model where we have
excluded the reform indicator. The left panel relates to the share attending the pre-reform
compulsory school, while the right relates to years of education. The jump in schooling
associated with the reform is evident here as well.

Diagnostics


  Before proceeding, we show some validation tests for the regression discontinuity. The
results from these tests are shown in Figure 3. The most robust model is obtained if we only
include observations very close to the breakpoint. However, as the graph in the top left panel
shows the parameter does not change significantly when we extend the width of the window
over which estimation takes place.
  The top right panel of Figure 3 shows the result from a density test suggested by McCrary
(2008). The density plot shows no indication of a sudden change in the density of
observations for date of birth just before or just after the discontinuity point; this illustrates
that there is no significant manipulation of the date of birth, the running variable, on which
our classification relies.
  Finally, the lower two panels show that there is no “impact” on variables that should not be
affected by the reform, namely the education of the father and the municipality tax rate.20
Similar placebo tests with other observables yield the same result (see Appendix Figure A2).
These tests illustrate the robustness of our approach. We now proceed with the central results
of interest.



                                                  B. Effects on Mortality

  Consider first the same type of graphs we just showed for education, but for mortality. The
left panel of Figure 4 shows raw mortality rates by distance in months from the cutoff date of
reform implementation. The upper panel shows the results for the entire sample and the lower
panel the corresponding ones for low and high SES individuals, respectively. There is a
negative slope in all graphs reflecting the fact that individuals are getting younger along the
horizontal axis. However, there is no large or significant break in this trend at the cutoff date.
  The right panel of Figure 4 shows the residuals from the linear probability DiD models with
an indicator for having died before the end of the follow up period as dependent variable and
excluding the reform indicator from the specification. These results provide further visual


  20
      These were obtained from the multigenerational register and from the Yearbook of Swedish Municipalities 1960 respectively. They
were linked to our data through the municipality identification number.
evidence that the reform had no effect on mortality. We then confirm these with the
regression results, using both DiD and RD approaches.
  Table 4 shows the results from four different specifications estimating the effect of the
schooling reform on mortality. Two are based on the DiD framework and the specification
shown in Equation (1) and two on the RD specification in Equation (2). Each of these models
is estimated using both Cox regressions and the linear probability models (LPM). The first
panel combines males and females and the two lower panels show results by gender.

  The estimates shown in Table 4 imply no effect of the reform on mortality: the hazard ratio
is not significantly different from one either for the DiD estimates or for the RD ones and the
LPM estimates are not significantly different from zero. The general result is supported by the
fact that it is robust to the choice of econometric model and that it holds within each sub-
group under study – even within the group of men from low SES families, where we
estimated the largest effect of the reform on educational attainment. In Section 6, we discuss
the magnitude of these effects and how large they could be potentially, if one takes into
account the width of the confidence interval. In Appendix Table A5 we also show that the
impact of the reform is zero at all ages in our observation window (44-70).

                                                  C. Effects by Cause of Death

   We now turn to two alternative classifications of diseases to see whether mortality declined
from causes that may be more explicitly related to behavior.21 We first consider mortality
from circulatory diseases (strongly correlated with education) and cancer (the single most
important cause of death in the age group we study), with other causes of death acting as
censoring.
   The results are shown in Table 5 and as is evident from the first column, the effects are not
significant at the 5% level for either circulatory diseases or cancer.22 Some marginally
significant effects for the high SES group are easily discounted, once we take into account
that the p-values need to be adjusted for testing multiple hypotheses. These results can be
confirmed visually in the various plots presented in Appendix Figure A3.




   21
        Appendix Table A1 reports how these are classified using the ICD codes available in the data.
   22
       We only present results for males and females combined and we concentrate on the sample that excludes the three main cities. Results
for the two gender groups separately are shown in Table A4 in the Appendix.

  In Appendix Table A6 we also demonstrate that the reform did not result in significant
reductions in mortality from preventable or treatable diseases. Appendix Figure A3 shows the
corresponding plots by causes of death.



                                             D. Hospitalization

  As we discussed in Section 3, a possible limitation of mortality as a measure of adult health
is that we are not able to observe entire life histories and effects of education on health could
potentially show up later in life. Moreover, the reform could have improved health in ways
that affects the quality of life but not necessarily its length. Therefore, in addition to mortality,
we also use hospitalization and consumption of prescribed drugs as health outcomes. For
hospitalization we use three different measures: total number of days in hospital care as well
as binary indicators for having ever been hospitalized for cancer, circulatory and respiratory
diseases. The regressions used here are linear DiD or linear RD regressions with a quadratic
polynomial in the time from the reform. The coefficient is thus interpreted as the effects of the
reform on days of hospitalization.

  Notes: Each number represents an impact from a separate regression by method and demographic group. DiD
specification includes a full set of dummy variables for year of birth and municipality of birth as well as separate
linear trends for municipalities of birth. RD specification includes separate quadratic polynomials in the running
variable before and after the break point, a dummy variable for gender as well as a full set of dummy variables
for month of birth. The samples of low and high SES background men and women do not add up to the
aggregate sample size because of missing information on father’s education in the registry data. Standard errors
are in parentheses and are clustered by municipality of birth. Standard errors clustered on the municipality of
birth level in parentheses.
   Finally, in Appendix Table A7 and Figure A4 we show that the reform did not affect the use
 of prescription drugs either. Among the many results we show, there are two which are
 significant at the 5% level: the use of anti-depressants among high SES individuals declines.
 However, one must note that we are testing many hypotheses and any adjustment for multiple
 hypotheses testing would imply p-values higher than 5 percent. So these results need to be
 discounted.



                                                V. Discussion

   What is the effect of the compulsory schooling reform on mortality? The point estimate
 implies a very small effect on mortality as we saw earlier. To translate the mortality estimates
 to implied effects on life expectancy (within the age support of the sample) we first compute
 the survival functions, based on the estimated hazard rates. Life expectancy is then given by
 the area under these functions. We see from Table 7 that the point estimates for the reform
 caused a change in life expectancy of between -0.026 to 0.052 of a month. This is consistent
 with the effects on hospitalization, repeated here for completeness, which indicate a very
 small increase. Of course, there is a standard error around these estimates and the extreme of
 the confidence interval allows for a reduction of mortality as a result of the reform of 1.4
 months; similarly, the edge of the CI for hospitalization allows for a reduction of 0.7 days.

   Note: Estimates obtained based on results shown in Tables 4 and 6, respectively.
   One way to compare our estimates to the overall associations between years of schooling
 and mortality would be to derive the implied effect of a year of schooling by using
 instrumental variables. However, a priori this is not supported by the nature of the reform that
 may have changed not only the quantity of schooling but also its quality. Lower
 socioeconomic status individuals (who are the main target) would now attend comprehensive
 schools, associate with peers from higher socio-economic groups and some would also obtain
monetary support for attending extended schooling. One can argue that many of these
mechanisms are beneficial to outcomes, although this may not have been so for higher SES
students since their peer group may have been diluted. In any case, it is not valid to use the
reform as an excluded IV. If we do, we reject OLS strongly.23 The p-values of this test are
0.036 and 0.006 based on DiD and RD respectively. For hospitalization the p-values are 0.001
and 0.029 respectively.24

                                                         VI. Conclusions

   In this paper we study the relation between education and health using rich administrative
data. We use the introduction of Sweden’s comprehensive school, which increased the
amount of compulsory schooling, as a source of exogenous variation in educational
attainment. We look at overall mortality and mortality by cause of death as outcome measures
and consider the population of all Swedes born between 1940 and 1957 who survived until
age 16. The follow up period stops in December 2015, allowing us to observe the oldest
individuals until age 75 and the youngest until age 58.
   We find no significant effects of the reform on overall mortality, regardless of whether we
use difference-in-differences models or a regression discontinuity approach. Indeed, our
results indicate that the effect of the reform on mortality is zero for the age window we
consider with an upper limit of the 95 percent CI suggesting an increase of life expectancy of
at most 1.4 months.
   The significance of the findings of no effect of the reform on health lies in the fact that we
look at a very large set of outcomes, that the sample is very large, that the effect of the reform
on extra schooling is substantial, and that we are able to use two alternative quasi-
experimental evaluation methods that yield similar results (DiD and RD). Furthermore, there
is established evidence in the literature that the reform significantly increased earnings for the
low SES children (Meghir and Palme, 2005). Overall, the results presented here echo others
and particularly those of Clarke and Royer (2013) for the UK and Behrman et al. (2011) for
Denmark, but contrast with those of Lleras-Muney (2005) for the US and van Kippersluis,
O’Donnell, and van Doorslaer (2011) for the Netherlands, who do find relatively large
impacts of education on mortality.



   23
        We use the linear probability model specification where we use reform assignment as instrumental variable for years of schooling. F-
statistics in first stage: 158.5 (DiD) and 157.5 (RD).
    24
        Point estimates from the IV models are reported in Table A8 in the Appendix.
  The education reform under study in this paper did not only affect quantity of schooling.
The centralized and more academic curriculum could potentially have had an effect on ability
to critically process information on health related behavior and risks (see e.g. Cutler and
Lleras-Muney, 2006, for a discussion). Moreover, the abolition of tracking after 6th grade
could have affected health related behaviors through peer-group influences. To distinguish
these effects from those of the quantity of schooling is not possible given our data and is our
main motivation for not using reform assignment as an instrumental variable for years of
schooling.
  For the cohorts we are considering in this study, Sweden had an advanced public healthcare
system providing services independently of individual income. This may limit the role of one
channel through which improved education may affect health, namely that of financial
resources. However, the role of education in allowing better access to and understanding of
information and in changing one’s behavior vis–à-vis investments in one’s health is still
potentially present. And even in the context of a public healthcare system individual resources
may be helpful in improving outcomes. Thus, it is important that our study does not identify
an effect of improved education at the lower end of the education distribution on mortality, a
result that is very robust. Ultimately, it is important to understand the roles of various
channels in improving health, such as resources, access to free healthcare, information and
investments in health.

   Notes: Each number represents an impact from a separate regression by method and demographic group.
Standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered by municipality of birth. DiD LPM specification includes a
full set of dummy variables for year of birth and municipality of birth as well as separate linear trends for
municipalities of birth. Stratified Cox regressions include year of first implementation specific linear trends. RD
specification includes separate quadratic polynomials in the running variable before and after the break point, a
dummy variable for gender as well as a full set of dummy variables for month of birth.. The samples of low and
high SES background men and women do not add up to the aggregate sample size because of missing
information on father’s education in the registry data. Standard errors are in parentheses and are clustered by
municipality of birth.

   Notes: Each number represents an impact from a separate regression by method and demographic group. DiD specification includes a full
set of dummy variables for year of birth and municipality of birth as well as separate linear trends for municipalities of birth. RD
specification includes separate quadratic polynomials in the running variable before and after the break point, a dummy variable for gender
as well as a full set of dummy variables for month of birth. The samples of low and high SES background men and women do not add up to
the aggregate sample size because of missing information on father’s education in the registry data. Standard errors are in parentheses and
are clustered by municipality of birth. Standard errors clustered on the municipality of birth level in parentheses.
