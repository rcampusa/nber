Various quasi-Newton methods periodically add a symmetric              "correction"

matrix of rank at most 2 to a matrix approximating some quantity A of
interest        (such as the Hessian of an objective function). In this        paper we
examine several ways to express a symmetric rank         2 matrix          as the sum of

rank 1 matrices. We show        that   it is easy to compute rank      1 matrices
and             such that        +
                                     2 and        I   + 2I   I   is   minimized, where

H     1I   is   any inner product norm. Such a representation recommends itself

for use in those       computer programs that maintain A explicitly, since it
should reduce cancellation errors and/or iiiprove efficiency over other

representations. In the common case where              is indefinite, a choice of

the form                       appears best. This case occurs for rank 2 quasi-

Newton updates L exactly when L may be obtained by syrmnetrizing some

rank 1 update; such popular updates as the IJFP, BFGS, PSB, and Davidon's

new optimally conditioned update fall into this category.

1.    Introduction
                                                                                 nxn
      Various quasi-Newton methods        n.intain an   approximation A         IR         to
some nxn matrix of interest.       In   the case of unconstrained minimization,
for example, A might approxnate the Hessian of the objective function or
its   inverse (see [Dennis a More, l97]). Such quasi-Newton              methods

periodically    determine a new approxima.tion A A + tx,         which       is required

to satisfy a "quasi-Newton equation" of the form Aw = b              (i.e. Ew z b -             Aw)

for certain w, b        Rr determined by the method. Frequently A, A, and

hence i are required to be symmetric and                 is chosen to have rank at most 2.

In this case A and are also often required to be positive definite. It

may be desirable to maintain such matrices A in the factored form A                         LLT

and to explicitly update only the factor L: this assures that A has no

negative eigenvalues. Brodlie, Gourlay, a Greenstadt [1973] have shown

under   these   conditions that         may be expressed as      =   i   +   T)A(I     +   T)
(for certain n-vectors p, q c ff) if and            only if 1         -A       may be expressed

in the form              -        which   is possible   for such popular      quasi-Newton
updates as the BFGS and DFP; Davidon [1975] recommends that such a factored

representation be used with his optimally conditioned update. (See Davidon's

[1975] paper for another view of such factored representations.)

       Despite the above, it may     sometimes be desirable to maintain A explicitly.
Moreover, there exist situations in which the approximation A must be                      allowed
to be indefinite; this happens, for instance, in certain algorithms for solving
the nonlinear least squares problem, in which a quasi-Newton approximation
is made   to only one paxl of the Hessian [Dennis, 1975]. Thus it is natural

to ask how symmetric matrices                     of rank     2 may be represented as

 sums    of   rank 1 matrices            (outer   products)   and to   compare   such   representations
 with an      eye       toward efficiency and        accuracy   in computer .mplementations.
         If             has   rank 1 and satisfies w z              0, then it is easily seen that
     T                            T
 w z      0       and                .   While    the syrrunetric rank 1 update (SRi) can also

 be written in any of the forms considered below for rank 2 updates, the
                              T
 sinple representation A         would appear to be the most efficient (and
                                           wz
accurate).  (Of course, any of the standard, normally rank 2 updates may
degenerate to the SRI under certain conditions; in algorithms using such
updates,        detecting degeneracy may be difficult and it may well be most

efficient to always use the rank 2 form of the update.) We therefore

consider below various ways to represent a symmetric, rank 2 matrix A

as the sum of two or three matrices of rank 1.

         This         paper   is organized as follows.        The next section presents some
background material.               Section three considers the common case where A
has eigenvalues of opposite sign (i.e. is                     indefinite). Section four briefly
considers             the semidefinite case (where A has two eigenvalues of the same

sign)     and section five examines asymmetrict                  representations        A =        +
                                                                                              A1       A2
with
          A1, 4, A2, and 4 all distinct. Finally, section six discusses
applications to some quasi-Newton updates and section                       seven presents our              conclusions.


2.       Background
         We shall have occasion below to refer to both the standard inner product
yTx and a possibly nonstandard one

(1)

defined for x,y                  1R by a positive definite (hence synunetric) nxn matrix
         nxn
Me            .        We   shall also refer both to the corresponding inner product vector
norm              I     defined by
                                                 —3—



(2)             lxii     lI<x,x>


   to the matrix norm which this induces. Reasonable choices for M may
arid


include I (the nxn identity matrix) and A1, if        is used in the
update     A = A +           with A positive definite; we shall say more about the

choice of M in section 7.

        We shall find it useful to classify rank 2 matrices b by the signs

of their nonzero eigenvalues. Hence we state:


(3)            Liiuia If                £ flXfl has    rank 2, then           may be expressed

               in the form


(La)                          -vvT
(Lfb)
(c)
               uuL_T + 1uu
                              +vv


where u        and v are linearly independent, if and                only   if Lx    has


        [(a) one positive and        one   negative
        (b)    two positive                               eigenvalue(s).
        (c) two negative

Hence          may be expressed in exactly one of the forms (1+).                It is possible
to     choose u and v           in ()   so   that <u,v>    0.

Proof    (Cf Leimia 1 of [Brodlie, Courlay, F, Greenstadt, 1973]): It is easily

seen    that       may be expressed in the form ('i)            if   and   only if     is
respectively (a) indefinite, (b) positive seinidefinite, or (c) negative
semidefinite.
       It remains       to   show -that          <u,v>       0 is possible. If L is any

rratrix (e.g.,     a Cholesky factor of N) such that N                           LTL and   x,y   are

(orthogonal) eigenvectors of
                                                     T         T
                                          1(a) xx -yy
                                                     T +
LT such that LLT                           (b)
                                                         T         T
                                          (c) —(xx +yy)
then () holds for u L1x and v                                 Ly.U
       In   comparing expressions for I,                      we shall employ the following easily

proved lemma.

              then there exist unique scalers ii, ',                         c    ER    such that

       As we shall see presently, many                       quasi-Newton updates generate a I with
one positive and one negative elgenvalue. Hence we shall first examine the

case   where

 (6)           uu       T

for some linearly independent u, v c ER".                              There are many     ways to express

in the form (6), as the next lemma shows:

 (7)           Lemma If (6) holds, then

                 --T —w
               Luu    --T

 if and only if there exist S                       ER and                1 such that
                                                               —5—




(9a)                 =    (sec 0) u +       (tan 0)      v              and


(9b)                 =    (tan e) u     +   (sec    e)   v.

Proof:       ()           If (6) and (8) hold, then                             u and v          must be linear            cornbina-

of appropriate sign. From                     (lOc)      we obtain a13
                                                                                            a1a2

Inserrting these into the above expressions for y and                                                   (5     and     using (lOc), we
obtain       y       a tan 0 and            (5 =   a sec 0, where a =                             1, whence (9) follows.

((z)        Conversely, if (6) and (9) hold, then it is easily verified that (8) also
holds. U

        It   seems to be fairly well )iown that                                 a matrix        of the form                     +

has one positive and one negative eigenvalue. We can, however, say more than
this:

(11)             Lemma. If              =          E RnX has rank 2,                         then             has one negative and
                 one     positive eigenvalue if and                         only if

(12)             xy T+yxT
for some linearly independent x, y E FF'.                                           Moreover, if (12) holds, then x
and     y    are essentially unique: if                                             +            then        there exists T c                IR,


T O such that                  either

Proof If L has eigenvalues of opposite sign, then by Lemma (3) there

exist   linearly independent            u, v c             such that                   -
then (12)     holds with

Conversely,        if   (12) holds, then U

whence            has eigenvalues of opposite signs. Finally, if

        Generalizing Powell's [1970c] derivation of the "Powell-syimietric-Broyden" (PSB)

update, Dennis [1972] showed that a large family of symmetric rank 2 quasi-

Newton updates could be obtained                by symiietrizing nonsymmetric rank                  1 updates.

Thus, given nonzero w, z c                R, we may obtain a symmetric                 rank   2

which satisfies the quasi-Newton equation.

       We   have seen that there are various ways to express a syninetric
indefinite matrix                   of   rank 2 as the sum of two or three rank 1 matrices.
For explicit floating point computations involving , it would appear more
efficient and probably more accurate (as there is less chance for roundoff
to occur)        to use one of the forms (6)               or (12) expressing                           +


as the sum of two rank 1 matrices                           and 2 Form (6) offers a one
dimensional family of possibilities, while (12) offers essentially just

one. To compare all these possibilities, it seems reasonable to examine

                                since   minimizing this sum should hopefully tend to minimize

both nonzero eigenvalues are positive. Just as in the                                           case   of mixed signs,

and (27) reduces to the expression described in Lenina (20). On the other hand,

if t            0       but a = -1, then (26) becomes

multiple of rr/L. For 0 an integral                                       multiple        of irI2, (29) reduces to (6),

and      for        0 an odd multiple of ff/L, (29) reduces to (12). Other choices of

0 apparently boast no practical advantages.


6.       Application to Quasi-Newton Updates

         As previously remarked, it may improve efficiency and reduce some cancel-

lation errors to express rank 2 quasi-Newton updates A                                                 A +   t as     the si.nn

     =         +
                    2 of two rank 1 matrices.                           This     is   readily done for soma of the popular

updates.                For example, the direct DFP                            and inverse        BFGS formulae satisfy the

but we may approach it in the following general way.

        Suppose s, t                  and

                                                                                                    .

positive definiteness of A insures                        o > 0, y > 0, and        > 2 we

       Some quasi-Newton methods, such as Powell's [l970a,b] MINFA and

Dennis F Mel's [1975] MINOP (which, like Davidon's OCOPTR,                         uses       the OC

update) require        that both A and A1                     be maintained. If the (direct)
                                                                                              —l
DFP is   used    to update A ,            then the corresponding update for A
has   the   form of the (direct) BFGS, and                    vice   versa. If the OC update is

used   for A, then the corresponding update for A is also optimally
conditoned in        the same sense, whence (using the above notation)


                A1 =   A1   +        - (Ab)(A)                   +    (W -    A)(W -        A)T

Thus we may interchange a and y in (3'4c ,d), detennine x and y by
                                        -1

In the case of a general Li                as   in (31), if A and A =            A +   Li     are

nonsingular,        then

This   may be       expressed   as       A1 plus two rank 1 matrices by a device like (32).

7.     Conclusion

       In the common case where A and                     are positive definite, it may seem

desirable to choose M A1 in (1) and express the update A = A +                                               A +     +

in   a form (with            and 2 of rank 1) which minimizes                  J
                                                                                                  +           with
respect to the inner product norm (2). Such a norm seems quite in keeping with

Davidon's 11959, 1975] notion of a "variable metric" determined by the current

approxima±ion A. It should select L.                      pqT (j     1,2)          which make smaller

changes   to A in eigendirections corresponding to                 small eigenvalues in the

sense that    I (r'p )   (5Tq•)    is reduced for unit eigenvectors                        r ,s       of A
corresponding   to small eigenvalues. Lemmas (19) and (25) establish the

remarkable fact that when               is indefinite (as is the case for what appear

to be the nst frequently used updates), a choice of the form
                                                                                            l T and
           minimizes          llJ I +   I   A21 no    matter what inner product (1) defines

the norm (2). We have seen that such representations can be readily programmed.

In the opposite case where i                is   semidefinite, (32) shows how Li may be

conveniently represented in the form                      uuT +        Lemmas (20) and (25)

                                                                                   +

note: if a =             0   in (31) with s,t linearly independent, then Li is

indefinite; thus if Li has two eigenvalues of the same sign, then at least

one of a,m must be nonzero, and by possibly interchanging s and t we may

arrange that T      0 and thus that (32) makes sense.)
