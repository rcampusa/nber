A growing literature argues that early environments affecting childhood health may influence
significantly later-life health and socioeconomic status. In this article, we present new evidence
on the relationship between infant mortality and later-life outcomes using variation in infant
mortality in England and Wales at the onset of World War II. We exploit the variation in infant
mortality across birth cohorts and regions to estimate associations between infant mortality and
adult outcomes, such as health, disability, and employment. Our findings suggest that exposure to
a higher infant mortality environment is significantly associated with higher likelihood of
reporting poor health, a higher likelihood of reporting a disability, a lower probability of
employment, and a higher probability of reporting no earned income. We also find that the effects
of the infant health environment do not become manifest until after age 55.

Introduction

       A growing literature argues that early environments affecting childhood health may

influence significantly adult health and socioeconomic status (Almond and Currie 2011). If so,

then investments in early childhood health may have particularly large returns and public policy

targeted at infant and child health should be encouraged, particularly when private investment is

constrained, for example, among low-income families. In addition, if childhood health does have

a lasting effect, then associations between adult socioeconomic status and adult health may

overstate the importance of socioeconomic status because child health may have influenced both

these adult outcomes.

       Infancy may be a particularly important time in life when the health environment could

matter for later outcomes, and several studies have assessed this hypothesis using infant

mortality to measure the health environment. Barker and Osmond (1986) and Ben-Shlomo and

Smith (1991) obtained associations between infant mortality and adult cause of death for birth

cohorts born in England and Wales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although both studies

found some evidence that higher rates of infant mortality were associated with higher rates of

death, particularly from heart disease, associations were not consistent and adjusting for

socioeconomic status eliminated significant associations (Ben-Shlomo and Smith 1991). Similar

studies using 19th century birth cohorts from countries other than England and Wales generally

found evidence of scarring— birth cohorts that experienced relatively high rates of infant

mortality experienced relatively high rates of adult mortality (Bengtsson and Lindstrom 2000;

Catalano and Bruckner 2006; Crimmins and Finch 2006; Bengtsson and Broström 2009;

Myrskylä 2010; Schellekens and van Poppel 2016). Studies of more recent birth cohorts by

Bozzoli et al. (2009) and Case and Paxson (2009) reported similar findings. Case and Paxson



                                                 2
(2009) reported that infant mortality was positively associated with infectious disease and

cognitive decline in adulthood, and Bozzoli et al. (2009) found that infant (post-natal) mortality

was negatively associated with adult height. A limitation of the studies just described is that they

do not exploit plausibly exogenous variation in early-life conditions.1 Therefore, it is unclear

whether the associations obtained are causal. In addition, most of these studies examining the

lasting impact of child health used samples of people born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

and results may not generalize to birth cohorts alive today.

        There are several studies that exploit more plausibly exogenous variation in early life

(i.e., in utero or infancy) health conditions, for example, Almond (2006) who studied the 1918

flu pandemic, and Bleakley (2007, 2010) and Lucas (2010) who studied eradicating malaria and

hookworm.2 These studies, and many quasi-experimental studies focused on famines, generally

find evidence that early life health shocks are associated with worse adult health and

socioeconomic status, which is consistent with a scarring effect of early life health conditions.3

However, findings from these quasi-experimental studies are not uniform, as a few studies

reported no significant association between early health shocks and adult outcomes (e.g., Stanner

et al. 1997; and Kannisto et al. 1997; Lumey et al. 2011; Brown and Thomas 2013). Similarly,

van Ewijk and Lindeboom (2017) found largely null effects for prenatal cohorts exposed to the

adverse effects of World War II in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

  There are several quasi-experimental studies that examine not health shocks, but the effect of early economic
environments on adult outcomes (e.g., Van de Berg et al. (2006); Cutler et al. (2007); Banerjee et al. (2010);
Almond, Currie, and Herrmann (2012)).

         We present new evidence on the relationship between infant health and later-life

outcomes using plausibly exogenous variation in infant mortality in England at the onset of

World War II. Our research makes several contributions to the literature. First, we focus on

relatively recent birth cohorts. As noted, many studies have used 19th century birth cohorts.

Second, we exploit plausibly exogenous variation in infant mortality. Third, as we explain in

more detail below, we assess whether the health environment in infancy is particularly important

vis-à-vis the health environment at other ages during childhood. Fourth, we examine whether

fertility responses confound the effect of the infant health shock.4 Finally, we assess whether

effects of adverse infant health environment differ by family socioeconomic status and whether

effects, if any, manifest at different ages over the life course.

         The key empirical fact that motivates our study is the spike in infant mortality (deaths

under 1 year of age per 1,000 births) in England in 1940 and 1941; infant mortality rose 17

percent between 1939 and 1941, although the increase is even larger than this value implies

because infant mortality was declining steadily during this period. The increase in infant

mortality was largely driven by a marked increase in post-neonatal deaths mainly from

pneumonia and whooping cough. Historical evidence indicates that the rise in infant mortality

during this period was due to a combination of a wartime food rationing, disease transmission in

day nurseries, and unusually harsh winters (discussed in the following section). From 1942


4
  Our research is somewhat related to studies that have examined the long-term impact of childhood exposure to
warfare and armed conflict on adult outcomes (e.g., Akresh et al. (2012); Akbulut-Yuksel (2014); Kesternich et al.
(2014); Lee (2014); and Havari and Peracchi (2017)). Kesternich et al. (2014) and Havari and Peracchi (2017) study
the effect of WWII on several European countries, although not England, and they define exposure in terms of
ground combat. However, these studies examined exposure to general war conditions including, poor nutrition, mass
dislocation, combat and destruction of the physical environment. Our study is different because we do not study the
effects of warfare, but the war-induced rise in infant mortality in 1940-41, which is a very specific exposure caused
by identifiable factors. Ground combat never occurred in the United Kingdom, and bombing and relocation was
focused mainly on London and a few port cities. The German bombing of London began at the end of 1940
subsequent to the initial spike in infant mortality observed in the data (see Figure 1). We describe the nature of the
exposure and the quasi-experimental design in more detail below.

                                                          4
onward, infant mortality fell back to its pre-1940 trend arguably because of priority rationing that

favored pregnant women, less harsh winters, and improvement in health services in childcare

facilities (see Figure 1).

        Within England, the extent to which infant mortality increased varied markedly across

regions. For example, infant mortality in London changed little between 1939 and 1941 while in

Northeast England it rose by nearly 27 percent. Because the negative health shock was short

lived, severe, and varied within the country, it provides a natural opportunity to test the

relationship between exposure to an adverse, early childhood health environment and later-life

outcomes.

        Using data from the British Household Panel Survey, we exploit the variation in infant

mortality across districts and cohorts of birth to estimate associations between exposure to a

higher infant mortality environment and adult outcomes, such as presence of various health

conditions, employment, earned income, education, home ownership, and disability. Our

findings suggest that the increase in infant mortality in the early 1940s is associated with worse

health as an adult. Specifically, a one standard deviation increase in infant mortality is associated

with approximately a 24% increase in reporting poor/very poor health; a 35% increase in

reporting a disability; a 10% decrease in the probability of having a job at the time of the survey;

a 17% increase in reporting no annual real income; and a 9% decrease in reporting top tercile

annual real income. Notably, these associations manifest mainly in later life, particularly after

age 55. Another important finding of our study is that childhood socioeconomic status, as

measured by father’s occupation, does not appear to have moderated the adverse association

between infant mortality and adult outcomes.




                                                  5
Background: England and Wales in the 1940s

       Since the 1930s, infant mortality in England followed a marked downward trend except

for 1940 and 1941, as shown in Figure 1. Between 1939 and 1942, infant deaths rose from 50 per

thousand births in 1939 to 59 per thousand births in 1941 and the dropped back to 49 per

thousand births in 1942. The deviation from trend in 1940 and 1941 is arguably the result of the

interaction of food rationing policies, crowding and poor conditions in day nurseries, and the

unusually harsh winters of 1940 and 1941, each of which we discuss in turn.

       The Ministry of Food was created in 1939 and was responsible for food distribution

during the war. Various rationing schemes were used including direct distribution of items and

allocations based on coupons and points for different foodstuffs. Food items including milk,

eggs, cereals, oranges, butter, bacon, sugar, meats, and cheeses were rationed beginning in

January of 1940 at the start of major wartime actions and rationing became increasingly stringent

as the war went on. The allocated rations provided approximately 910 calories per day, but little

calcium and vitamins. Orr (1937) reported that, depending on family income, per-capita calorie

consumption was between 2300 and 3330 in 1932-35. Therefore, the rationing of food and

provision of 910 calories per day suggests that nutrition was likely to be adversely affected by

the war, although we do not know what actual caloric intake was during the war. While many

food items were included in the ration, some were not—for example, bread was not rationed.

       To protect the health of women with children and expectant mothers, the National Milk

Scheme was implemented in June of 1940 and provided additional priority allowances, which

supplied an additional 540 calories per day and the bulk of their daily requirement of calcium

and vitamins. However, initial take-up was low and the program did not witness significant

uptake until 1942. The priority allowance was later credited as having “done more than any other



                                                 6
single factor to promote the health of expectant mothers and young children during the war”

(Great Britain Ministry of Health 1946, p. 93). Note that infants who died in 1940 were born

between January 1939 and December 1940, and were therefore conceived between March 1938

and March 1940. Thus, it is unlikely the food restrictions, which began in January of 1940,

influenced nutritional conditions in the womb, instead influencing nutritional conditions after

birth.

         By 1940, England began to develop day nurseries for displaced children and children of

parents engaged in the war effort (Great Britain Ministry of Health 1946, p. 98). Initially, staying

in the day nurseries was associated with the transmission of infectious disease given close

confinement of children and disorganization as local authorities worked to “extend water

supplies, sewerage and drainage, and to increase hospital accommodations for maternity and

infectious disease, and to obtain many more midwives” in areas that previously lacked these

amenities (Great Britain ministry of Health 1946, pg 107). However, by 1942 the quality of the

nurseries improved because of better staffing and more abundant supplies and resulted in a

decrease in the incidence of disease (Great Britain Ministry of Health 1946, p. 99). Note that

during this period (e.g., 1940), England was under assault from bombing campaigns that targeted

the more densely populated and better developed areas of England such as London. From these

areas, the government evacuated children and expectant mothers to rural areas in England (Great

Britain Ministry of Health 1946, 92). The number of local and evacuated children being cared for

in day nurseries likely exacerbated shortages in supplies, staff, and accommodations that

arguably further adversely affected the quality of infant and child healthcare, further raising

infant mortality rates. In addition, the evacuation may have been non-random with respect to




                                                 7
income and child health, for example, poorer families may have been over represented, and this

would alter (e.g., raise) disease in places where children were evacuated.

        Another adverse event at the time was weather. The 1940 and 1941 winters produced

extremely low temperatures, extensive frosts, and large snows. The meteorological record from

the period described January 1940 as “exceptionally cold; intense frost; considerable snow in the

latter half of the month”; January 1941 was described as “cold, with frequent snow” (“Monthly

Weather Reports 1940s” 2016). The inclement weather of the period was not uniform across

regions, however, as England, despite being a relatively small country, has surprisingly diverse

microclimates that exacerbate or buffer general weather patterns. For example, within Devon

County in the Southwest of England, the average monthly temperature can vary by 4 degrees

Celsius within a 20 mile radius and rainfall can be twice as much in one area as another.5

        The evidence from rationing and harsh winters is consistent with areas farther from

London experiencing a greater increase in infant mortality. More remote areas likely had fewer

resources and fewer rationed goods. Historical weather information suggests that the winters in

the north of England were somewhat harsher than in the south, which also partly explains the

within-country variation. Appendix Figure 1 presents the difference in average January

temperatures between the observed value and a region-specific linear trend. The figure illustrates

that the 1940/41 winters were particularly harsh across the UK, with the regions experiencing

January temperatures around three to six degrees below trend. Note that in the years leading up

to 1940-41, the temperature across regions follows a similar trend, suggesting no pre-existing

differences in weather trends. Moreover, the predominately rural areas where shelters were built

to house expectant mothers were also away from London, which would additionally explain part

of the pattern in infant mortality.

        To explore further the relationship between weather and infant mortality, we compiled

weather data from the UK meteorological office. 6 The data contain monthly measures of average

minimum temperatures which we use to illustrate the relationship between infant mortality and

weather in Figure 2. The solid line represents deviations from a linear trend in infant mortality

from 1931 to 1960. The dashed line represents deviations from a linear trend in the average

minimum daily temperature in January of each year. The two measures appear inversely

correlated, with mortality rising above trend when minimum temperatures fall below.

Particularly salient is the sharp decline in minimum temperatures during 1940 and 1941, which

coincide with sharp increases in mortality. Note too, that the increase in infant mortality

coinciding with the colder winters in 1940-41 is significantly larger than the increase in infant

mortality corresponding to similarly a cold winter in 1945, which is consistent with the

interaction between poor nutrition, poor conditions in day nurseries, and cold weather. Although

we lack weather data on all areas of the UK, the analysis is suggestive of unusually harsh winter

conditions in 1940-41.

        Table 1 displays infant mortality rates by cause between 1939 and 1942. The noteworthy

contributions to the increase in mortality in 1940 and 1941 are bronchitis, pneumonia, and

whooping cough. These illnesses account for 60% of the total increase in infant mortality

between 1939 and 1941, and are conditions that are plausibly affected by inadequate nutrition,

inclement weather, and wartime dislocation. For example, harsh winters, poor nutrition

combined with a lack of fuel products to heat homes (from the ration), and the crowding of

Only six of our ten regions are represented during the entire 1930 to 1960 timeframe.

children into day nurseries may have facilitated the transmission of pneumonia and whooping

cough because of their infectious nature (Griffiths and Brock 2003). Indeed, infancy exposure to

whooping cough has also been shown to affect later life outcomes in Sweden (Quaranta 2014).

Moreover, several researchers have linked pneumonia incidence to vitamin D deficiency (Muhe

et al. 1997; Wayse et al. 2004; McNally et al. 2009; Wonodi et al. 2012). Eggs are rich in

vitamin D and were among the rationed food items that were particularly scarce in the early war

years.

         Figure 3 displays the aggregate trend in neonatal, post-neonatal, and childhood mortality

in England and Wales from the period. Note that while overall neonatal mortality increases

somewhat, the significant deviation from trend occurs for post-neonatal mortality and mortality

for children aged 1-2 and aged 3-5. Notably, we also observe substantial variation in the

magnitude of infant deaths within the United Kingdom across regions and districts. The United

Kingdom is divided into regions, which are comprised of counties, and counties comprised of

districts. Generally, areas farthest from London experienced the greatest rise in infant mortality.

         In Figure 4 we present the difference in infant mortality between observed value and a

predicted linear trend by region. A value of zero indicates that infant mortality in a region is

perfectly on trend. In 1940-41, there is a clear upward divergence from trend with regions

farthest from London experiencing the largest increases.7

         To summarize, Figures 1-4 and Table 1 document the circumstances surrounding the

significant spike in post-neonatal and early childhood mortality in 1940-41. The combination of




7
  We also conducted a regression analysis using infant mortality in district d in region r for cohort c as the dependent
variable with controls for region fixed effects, cohort fixed effects, and region-by-cohort fixed effects. Results of
this analysis indicated that all pre-1940-41 region-year coefficients were statistically zero. This provides evidence
that there were no significant or economically important differences in pre-existing differences in infant-mortality
between regions that would confound our estimates.

                                                          10
food shortages, harsh weather, and disruption in children’s healthcare resulted in greater

incidence of infectious and respiratory disease for young children in 1940 and 1941.

Additionally, the incidence differed substantially by region within England. The variation in

child health across both time and region, as measured by infant mortality, represents our measure

of the exposure to adverse health shocks. These infant health shocks mainly reflect infectious

disease, and, as Crimmins and Finch (2006) and others have articulated, there are plausible

biological mechanisms linking infectious disease during infancy/childhood to adult disease.



Data

        To test whether exposure to a health shock in infancy affects adult outcomes, we use data

from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Great Britain Historical Database:

Health and Health Care Data Mortality Statistics from 1851-1973. The BHPS is a longitudinal

survey of approximately 5,500 households in Britain from 1991 to 2009.8 The survey is well

suited for our study because respondents are asked their date and place of birth, which we match

with the Great Britain Historical Database by district and birth year to determine exposure to the

health shock as an infant. The Great Britain Historical Database contains information on infant

deaths and births, as well as population by location and year.9

        The primary sample we use is limited to those born between 1935 and 1950, which is a

period that spans the sharp rise in infant mortality, but is a relatively narrow window of time to

reduce potential confounding from economic and technological changes occurring during the

period. There are 52,348 person-by-wave observations for this sample. From the initial 52,348

person-waves selected, we drop six observations missing birth month, and 4,784 observations

that are missing information for place of birth, and another 12,874 observations for which we are

unable to match district-level mortality. Our final sample consists of 34,684 person-by-wave

observations for 3,218 persons from 245 districts. In Appendix Table 1, we report descriptive

statistics for the sample at each stage of construction, illustrating that the final analysis sample is

similar to the initial sample.

        The BHPS are longitudinal data covering an 18-year period. In our sample, the average

individual is observed in approximately 9.45 waves of the survey. Our primary regression

approach uses all person-wave observations thereby treating each person-wave observation as a

separate observation. This is a reasonable approach because most outcomes we measure are

changing over time as the person ages.

        The Great Britain Historical Database reports district-level annual infant mortality during

this time period. We use annual mortality in conjunction with the BHPS, which reports

individual birth month, to calculate infant mortality (IM) and birth rates by district and year.10

Infant mortality for person i born in district d in year c (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) is measured as a weighted

average of infant mortality in the year of birth and in the following year, for example, because

those born in January experience a different environment than those born in December of the

same year. Specifically:

                                    𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 = 𝛼𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 + (1 − 𝛼)𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑,𝑐+1

where birth-year mortality (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) and the following-year mortality (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑,𝑐+1 ) are weighted (𝛼)

by birth month. An individual born in January receives a weight of 1. The weight reduces by

   Specifically, we use table “mort_lgd” which records “Birth & Death Statistics for Local Government Districts
from 1921-1974.”

1/12 for each additional month so that an individual born in February receives a weight of 𝛼 =

0.916; March a weight of 𝛼 = 0.833; and so on. The approach places more weight on actual

birth-year infant mortality for those born earlier in the year; for those born later in the year more

weight is placed on the subsequent year’s mortality. 𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 is our measure of treatment, or

exposure, to adverse early health conditions. We standardize infant mortality to have an overall

mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The standard deviation of infant mortality is 13.5, roughly

the size of the mortality shock in 1940/41.

       Survey respondents in the BHPS answer questions about their health including self-

reported health status, presence of health problems, and disability status in addition to

information about employment, income, and home ownership. For self-reported health status,

individuals are asked, “Please think back over the last 12 months about how your health has

been. Compared to people of your own age, would you say that your health has on the whole

been” and they may check excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor from which we define two

indicators: an indicator for good or excellent health and an indicator for poor or very poor health.

For the presence of health problems, individuals are asked “Do you have any of the health

problems or disabilities listed on this card?” which include thirteen conditions including

problems with arms or legs, problems with chest or breathing, problems with heart or blood

pressure, difficulty seeing, difficulty hearing, skin conditions, stomach/liver/kidney, diabetes,

nerves/anxiety/depression, alcohol/drugs, epilepsy, migraine/chronic headache, or other.

Respondents could check any conditions that apply and our measure of any self-reported health

problems is an indicator that equals one for those who suffer from at least one of the

aforementioned conditions. We also examine the top three most prevalent conditions




                                                 13
individually.11 Note that self-reported health measures have been shown to be reasonably strong

predictors of mortality (see for example: Franks, Gold, and Riscella 2003 and Idler and

Benyamini 1997).

        Our measure of disability status comes from the question “Can I check, are you registered

as a disabled person, either with Social Services or with a green card?” Those who check yes are

defined as disabled. Home ownership status is derived from a question that asks individuals if

they own a home or rent a home. We define an indicator for home ownership equal to one if the

individual responds that they own their home outright or with a mortgage and zero otherwise.

We measure employment using a dichotomous measure that equals one if the respondent did any

paid work in the previous week and zero otherwise. Finally, respondents report annual income

from labor (i.e., earned income), which we use to create terciles of earned income. The terciles

correspond to no earned income, income greater than £0 and less than or equal to £12954, and

income above £12954. We also report estimates using annual real earnings as a continuous

measure instead of the terciles. Respondents are also asked to note the highest level of education

they had completed, using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)

definitions. We use these reports to generate an indicator for completing primary education only

(ISCED = 1).12

        Respondents are also asked “Thinking back to when you were 14, what job was your

father doing at that time?” If working and not deceased, the father’s job title, nature of work, and

industry were recorded and used to create several variables that measures the social class of the

   Approximately 69% of our sample report suffering from one or more of the thirteen conditions. The top three
reported conditions include arm/leg problems (38%), heart/BP problems (23%), and chest or breathing problems
(13%).

   Because education does not change during the ages of life we observe, analyses of this outcome use a randomly
selected observation for each person instead of all the years a person was observed.

father’s job. Occupations are grouped into the following categories: professional,

managerial/technical, skilled (manual/non-manual), partly-skilled, and unskilled. From this we

categorize respondents as growing up in a high (professional or managerial/technical) or low

(remaining categories plus non-working/deceased) socioeconomic class.

       Table 2 reports descriptive statistics. On average, the sample is 56 years of age, although

there is significant variation in age indicated by a standard deviation of 6.8 years. Slightly more

of the sample is female (54%), which is consistent with longer life expectancy of females vis-à-

vis males. Figures related to our outcomes indicate that approximately 69% report a health

problem, although only 12% report being in poor or very poor health. The apparent discrepancy

between the proportion being in poor health and the proportion with a health problem likely

reflects the self-reported nature of the questions and the fact that many respondents report a

health problem that is relatively minor. Roughly 37% report having no real earned income.

Those in the final analysis sample have similar characteristics to the full BHPS sample, as

illustrated in Appendix Table 1.

Measurement of Exposure

       Our measure of exposure, or treatment, is the infant mortality in the district and year of

birth, which is derived from administrative data. Given the wartime relocations, there is a

question as to whether births and deaths were recorded consistently with respect to place of

residence or place of occurrence. The administrative data indicate that deaths were recorded

based on place of occurrence. However, it is possible that births might have been recorded at

place of permanent residence if relocation occurred soon after birth, but there were great efforts

to relocate pregnant women which would minimize this possibility. For example, in 1939,

13,900 pregnant women were relocated out of greater London (Johnson 1985). Consistent with



                                                 15
this, births in London fell by roughly 20,000 between 1939 and 1941 (Appendix Figure 2).

Therefore, it is likely that most births were recorded in the place of occurrence and thus the

extent of any misreporting of births would appear to be small.

        A second concern is measuring exposure for individuals who were relocated. Note that

the adverse health shocks were manifest within the first year of life, as shown in Figure 3. Thus,

infant mortality in the place of birth accurately reflects exposure for all those who stayed in the

relocation region for several months, which is likely to be the vast majority of persons that were

relocated.13 Exposure would be incorrectly assigned if survey respondents who had been

relocated reported their birth region as their permanent residence rather than the actual region of

birth. To address this concern, given that most of the relocation is associated with London, we

re-estimate our regressions omitting survey respondents born in London. Our findings are largely

unchanged when we omit London births.



Empirical Approach

        The hypothesis we are interested in assessing is whether exposure to a health shock in

infancy affects adult outcomes. This hypothesis is motivated by two broad causal mechanisms.

The first is often referred to as “scarring” (Elo and Preston 1992). The scarring channel suggests

that exposure to a negative health shock may adversely affect developing organs and the immune

system (e.g., inflammation) and cause worse later-life health. For example, the observed increase

in infectious disease during 1940-41 because of food rationing and harsh winters may lead to

worse later-life outcomes for those born during this period. A second mechanism linking early

and late health is often referred to as culling (Almond and Currie 2011). The culling channel


13
  However, for those who return to their permanent residence, some of the effect of exposure could be confounded
with their moving during childhood.

                                                       16
suggests that during exposure to an adverse health event the weakest children die leaving a

healthier group of children. In this case, early health shocks result in better adult health.

        Of course, these broad causal pathways are not mutually exclusive and which channel

dominates is an empirical question. There may also be behavioral responses to the health shock

in childhood. Parents may respond by investing in affected children and, as we discuss below,

fertility may be affected by the health shock. Parental responses and their influence are

additional considerations relevant to the interpretation of estimates of the association between

child health and adult outcomes. Such behavioral responses may reinforce or offset the scarring

and culling effects.

Regression Model Specification

        To estimate the effect of infant mortality on later-life outcomes, we use regression

methods and the following regression model:

(1)     𝑌𝑖𝑑𝑐𝑚𝑎 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 + 𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑎 + 𝜃𝑑 + 𝜙𝑐 + 𝛿𝑚 + 𝜆𝑎 + 𝜀𝑖𝑑𝑐𝑚𝑎

𝑖 = (individuals)
𝑑 = 1,2, … ,245 (Districts)
𝑐 = 1935, … . ,1950 (Birth year cohort)
𝑚 = 1, … ,12 (Birth month)
𝑎 = 40, … ,73 (Survey Age)

where adult outcome 𝑌𝑖𝑑𝑐𝑚𝑎 for individual 𝑖 born in district 𝑑 in birth year 𝑐 and month m and

surveyed at age 𝑎 is a function of the weighted-average infant mortality rate (per one thousand

live births) in their district and year of birth, 𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 . Other covariates include controls for

observable individual characteristics at the time of survey (𝑋𝑖𝑎 ) including current place of

residence and sex, a district of birth fixed effect (𝜃𝑑 ), a birth cohort fixed effect (𝜙𝑐 ), a birth

month effect (𝛿𝑚 ), a survey age fixed effect (𝜆𝑎 ), and an error term (𝜀𝑖𝑟𝑐𝑚𝑎 ). The adult outcomes

we consider are self-reported health status, incidence of health problems, disability status,


                                                    17
educational attainment, labor force participation, real annual labor income, and home

ownership.14

        The district fixed effect (𝜃𝑑 ) accounts for unobserved differences between the districts

including resources available, local economic conditions, local development, and any other fixed

differences across districts related to both infant mortality and later-life outcomes for the cohorts

born between 1935 and 1950. By including the fixed effect, we compare outcomes for those born

within the same districts. The birth cohort fixed effect (𝜙𝑐 ) accounts for differences by year of

birth common to all individuals in England and Wales, such as changing medical technology,

environmental conditions, or aggregate trends in the UK economy that account, partly, for the

downward trend in infant mortality experienced during this time. The survey age fixed effect

(𝜆𝑎 ) accounts for any differences in age at the time of the survey (and any survey year effects

because birth year plus age equals survey year).

        The identifying assumption of our approach is that, conditional on district, age, and birth

year fixed effects, variation in infant mortality is largely driven by exogenous factors associated

with the war such as food rationing and adverse weather conditions. To test for the presence of

pre-trends in the outcome variables, we conducted a regression analysis using each outcome as

the dependent variable with controls for region fixed effects, cohort fixed effects, and region-by-

cohort fixed effects. We omit London as the base region and 1935 as the base cohort. Results of

this analysis indicated that pre-1940-41 region-year coefficients were statistically zero. This

provides evidence that there were no significant or economically important differences in pre-

existing differences in outcomes between regions that would confound our estimates. The results

of this analysis are available in Appendix Figure 3. In some specifications, we include district-

specific, linear birth-year trends and the results remain unchanged.15 To estimate equation (1),

we use a linear probability model for dichotomous outcomes, but estimated effects are similar

when using a logit model. The effect of infant mortality as embodied in the coefficient β

represents the consequences of an adverse health shock early in life.

        As noted earlier in the description of the data, the sample includes multiple observations

for each person, which raises three potential concerns: one related to the construction of standard

errors; another related to the timing of any effect (or age that an effect becomes manifest); and a

third related to possible bias from including different numbers of observations for individuals if,

for example, survival is correlated with infant mortality.

        With respect to standard errors, we use a cluster-robust method that assumes the errors

are correlated (non-independent) within district of birth cells (i.e., the level of treatment). While

we believe this method is valid even in the context of multiple observations per person, we also

used an alternative method that clusters standard errors by person, thus assuming non-

independence of errors within a person over time. Standard errors from this alternative approach

were very similar to those we reported and are available in Appendix Table 2.

        With respect to the possibility that using more observations for some individuals and

fewer for others may introduce bias, we obtained estimates using a sample consisting of one

randomly selected observation for each person. In this case, each individual contributes only one

observation and the sample of unique persons has the same distribution of characteristics as the

full sample that includes multiple observations per person. Estimates from this sample address



15
  In a separate specification (available upon request) we also included a survey year linear trend, which had
virtually no effect on our estimates. Following Almond and Mazumder (2005), we also interacted age and survey
wave which also had virtually no effect on our estimates (available upon request).

concerns over the standard errors and concerns related to any potential issue arising from using

more observations for some people than others. This sample is also appropriate when examining

education because education does not vary over the ages observed.

Moderation by Socioeconomic Status

       It is possible that family socioeconomic status during childhood could moderate effects of

early-life health shocks. For instance, even with a food ration in place, wealthier families may be

able to obtain more food through alternative channels, which would tend to lessen any adverse

effect. To explore this possibility, we estimate a model that allows the effect of infant mortality

to differ by socioeconomic status, as measured by indicators for whether your father worked in a

lower (unskilled, partly-skilled, or skilled manual/non-manual) or higher (managerial/technical

or professional) social class occupation when you were 14. Specifically, we estimate:

(2)     𝑌𝑖𝑑𝑐𝑚𝑎 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ∗ 𝐻𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) + 𝛽2 (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ∗ 𝐿𝑂𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) + 𝛽3 (𝐻𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) + 𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑎 +

𝜃𝑑 + 𝜙𝑐 + 𝛿𝑚 + 𝜆𝑎 + 𝜀𝑖𝑑𝑐𝑚𝑎

Equation (2) is identical to equation (1) except now we include an interaction between infant

mortality (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) and higher (𝐻𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) and lower (𝐿𝑂𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑐 ) early-life socioeconomic status. We

include both interactions between infant mortality and socioeconomic status and exclude the

infant mortality main effect. If differences by early-life socioeconomic status exist, they would

be reflected in differences between 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 in equation (2).

Age when Effects Become Manifest

       To investigate the timing (age of occurrence) of observed effects, if any, we estimate a

model that allows the effect of infant mortality to differ by age. Specifically, we estimate:

(3)    𝑌𝑖𝑑𝑐𝑚𝑎 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ∗ 𝐴𝐺𝐸1 ) + 𝛽2 (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ∗ 𝐴𝐺𝐸2 ) + 𝛽3 (𝐼𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑐 ∗ 𝐴𝐺𝐸3 ) + 𝛾𝑋𝑖𝑎 +

𝜃𝑑 + 𝜙𝑐 + 𝛿𝑚 + 𝜆𝑎 + 𝜀𝑖𝑑𝑐𝑚𝑎


                                                 20
Equation (3) is also identical to equation (1) except now we allow the effect of infant mortality to

differ by age classified by terciles [the 1st (lowest) tercile ranges from 40 to 53; the 2nd tercile

ranges from 54 to 59; the 3rd (highest) tercile ranges from 60 to 73]. We include all three

interactions between infant mortality and age groups and exclude the infant mortality main

effect.

Considering Birth Rates

           One issue that merits consideration is the potential response of births to infant mortality.16

For example, parents may try to replace children lost to illness (Ben-Porath 1976). Wartime in

the UK brought considerable changes in birth rates. Total births in London fell along with the

population, but rebounded beginning in 1942 (available in Appendix Figure 2). A similar pattern

is evident from the regions outside London. Also, note that London makes up a relatively small

fraction (15%) of total births. We also document birth rates for the entire country (Appendix

Figure 4), which indicates that the birth rate started increasing beginning in 1942, eventually

peaking in the immediate post-war years. Birth rates from 1935-41 were stable at around 15 per

1,000 total population, but in 1942 birth rates increased to 17 per 1,000 total population. From

1942 until well after the end of the war, birth rates stay at or above this elevated level with some

noticeable decline after 1947.

           The increase in birth rates in 1942 is suggestive of a parental response to the negative

health shock that may vary at the region-by-time level and would not be accounted for by any of

the fixed effects in the regression specification. In short, the fertility response may have altered

later-life outcomes because of differences in family size (spacing) by birth cohort and district.

Therefore, we estimate some models with birth rates to assess whether estimates of the



16
     There may be other (parental) responses, but we are unable to measure them because of data limitations.

                                                           21
association between infant mortality and later-life outcomes is sensitive to the inclusion of birth

rates.



Results

         Table 3 presents estimates of the association between infant mortality in the respondent’s

region and year of birth and adult outcomes.17 In all regressions, infant mortality is standardized

to have an overall mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and standard errors are clustered by

district of birth cells. The first column of Table 3 shows the baseline specification without

additional person-level covariates or controls for birth rates. The second column adds person-

level controls including age, sex, and current region of residence. The third column adds the birth

rate in the year and district the respondent was born. The fourth column adds district-specific,

linear birth-year trends.

         Estimates for each outcome are similar across the four columns. The estimates suggest an

adverse effect of a poor infant health environment on adult health and socioeconomic status,

which is consistent with a scarring effect. For instance, the association between infant mortality

and self-reported poor/very poor health suggests that a one standard deviation increase in infant

mortality (roughly the size of the increase between 1939 and 1941) is associated with

approximately a 2.9 percentage point increase in poor/very health, which is a 24% increase

relative to the mean. With respect to self-reported disability, the estimates suggest that a one

standard deviation increase in infant mortality (roughly the size of the increase between 1939 and

1941) is associated with approximately a 3.5 percentage point increase in disability, which is a

35% increase relative to the mean. The estimate remains stable across all specifications. A


17
  We also estimated a non-linear specification where infant mortality entered as a quadratic form (available upon
request), but the results do not differ qualitatively from the linear specification.

                                                        22
summary of the other significant effects of a one standard deviation increase in infant mortality

is as follows:18

     •   An approximately 5.7 percentage point (10%) decrease in the probability of having a job;

     •   an approximately 6.4 percentage point increase (17%) in the probability of reporting no

         earned income;

     •   and an approximately 3 percentage point decrease (9%) in the probability of reporting

         earned real income above £12954 (the 3rd and highest real income tercile) .

Notably, estimates in column 4, which come from regression models with district-specific, linear

birth-year trends are largely similar to estimates in other columns. The specification of the model

in column 4 controls for potentially unmeasured confounding from factors that vary by district

and birth year. Therefore, the similarity of estimates across columns suggests that the variation in

infant mortality arises largely exogenously due to food rationing, weather and conditions in day

nurseries described earlier.

         In Table 4, we explore whether the effects of infant mortality differ by father’s

occupational (socioeconomic) status. In particular, we estimate equation (2) which includes

interactions between infant mortality and indicators for whether your father worked in a lower

(unskilled, partly-skilled, or skilled manual/non-manual) or higher (managerial/technical or

professional) social class occupation when the child was 14. In the regression, we include

interactions between mortality and both SES categories and exclude the main infant mortality

effect. Estimates in Table 4 indicate that for most outcomes the effect of the infant mortality

shock on adult outcomes is statistically the same for those from lower and higher SES families.



18
  If we apply the Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing, the estimates associated with having a
job and disability remain significant. Note, however, that the Holm-Bonferroni correction is overly conservative
because it assumes that estimates are independent, which is not the case.

                                                        23
However, the estimates for whether a person reports very good/excellent health, has a job,

reports no income, and owns a home do statistically differ. For these outcomes, the estimate for

the high socioeconomic group is statistically smaller than the estimate for the low socioeconomic

group as indicated by the P-values reported in column (3) that test the equality of the estimates

for the low and high SES groups. However, note that for two of these outcomes, very

good/excellent health and owns home, neither of the infant mortality-by-SES interactions from

columns (1) and (2) are statistically different from zero. These results suggest that, in general,

either exposure to the shock was no worse for those in lower and higher SES households or that

family SES did little to moderate the relationship, with the exception related to whether a person

works and has income.

         In Table 5, we explore whether the infant mortality effects differ by age. To do so, we

estimate equation (3), allowing the effect of infant mortality to differ by age, which is measured

as indicators denoting age groups. 40 to 53; 54 to 59; and 60 to 73. In the regression, we include

all interactions and exclude the main infant mortality effect.19 The results from Table 5 are

consistent with those in Table 3, but show that the adverse effects of mortality are concentrated

later in life. For instance, the effect of infant mortality on the probability of reporting a disability

grow monotonically with terciles of age, with estimates suggesting a standard deviation increase

in infant mortality is associated with a roughly 20% increase in disability relative to the mean for

those aged 40 to 53 compared to roughly 45% for those 60 and over. A similar pattern emerges

for self-reported poor or very poor health, the presence of chest/breathing problems, the




19
  We also estimated a specification interacting infant mortality and a quadratic in age, and calculated the partial
effects of mortality on the outcomes at the midpoints of the age terciles. The partial effects at these ages line up
closely with the effects by age terciles (available upon request).

probability of having a job, and real annual labor income, with associations becoming larger at

later ages.



Sensitivity Analyses

        In Table 6, we report a variety of sensitivity analyses that address possible concerns

related to sample selection and the measurement of infant mortality.

Altering the Birth Cohorts Examined

        As noted earlier, our sample includes individuals born between 1935 and 1950. One

potential problem with including cohorts born before 1940 is that there was also an unusually

large increase in mortality of children ages 2 to 5 in 1940 and 1941 (see Figure 3). Therefore,

children born in these earlier cohorts may have been exposed to a poor health environment, but

at later ages. Including cohorts born before the shock may attenuate estimates if older children

(e.g. those born in 1935 who would be 6 or 7 in 1940/41) were themselves harmed by the 1940-

41 health environment. We assess this hypothesis by re-estimating the regression model with a

sample that excludes these earlier cohorts. We also explore whether our estimates are sensitive to

using different ending birth cohorts instead of 1950, specifically, 1945 and 1955. For

comparison, column 1 of Table 6 replicates column 3 of Table 3.

        In column 2 of Table 6, we present estimates from a model that includes cohorts born

between 1940 and 1950, leaving roughly 26,500 person-by-wave observations. Comparing

estimates in columns (1) and (2) indicates that there is little difference, particularly for estimates

that were previously statistically significant. The similarity of estimates and lack of attenuation

when earlier birth cohorts are included suggests that the effect of health shocks in infancy are

more important than health shocks at later childhood ages. This result is consistent with the



                                                  25
hypothesis that infancy is a critical period for development and that shocks to health during this

period have particularly long-lasting effects (Knudson 2004; Heckman et al. 2006; Grantham-

McGregor et al. 1997; Grantham-McGregor et al. 2007; Hoddinott and Kinsey 2001; Maccini

and Yang 2009; and Maluccio et al. 2008).

           Estimates in columns 3 and 4, which alter the ending year of the birth cohorts included,

are also consistent with those in Table 3. Estimates using 1935 to 1945 birth cohorts consist of

roughly 21,000 person-by-wave observations while those based on 1935 to 1955 birth cohorts

consist of roughly 46,500 person-by-wave observations. These estimates show that the adverse

effects of infant mortality are not sensitive to the sample period. Overall, changing the beginning

or ending period of birth cohorts has relatively little effect on the estimates.20

Using Only One Observation per Individual

           As noted earlier, the average individual is observed in approximately 9.5 waves of the

survey, with a standard deviation of 6. To address any concern that estimates and standard errors

may be biased by using multiple observations per person, we re-estimate models using a sample

consisting of a randomly selected observation for each person. So, the sample for this analysis

consists of the roughly 3,200 unique individuals with characteristics that have the same

distribution as the full sample. The results from this analysis are presented in column 5 of Table

6.

           Qualitatively, estimates in column 5 are similar to other estimates and indicate that infant

health shocks are associated with adverse adult health. For example, a one standard deviation

increase in infant mortality is associated with approximately a 3.98 percentage point increase in

disability, nearly identical to the original estimate. We note that standard errors using the



20
     The one exception to this conclusion may be estimates for whether a person has a chest/breathing problem.

                                                          26
randomly selected sample are similar, though somewhat larger, compared to estimates using all

person-year observations.

Using Only the 1940 and 1941 Variation in Infant Mortality

       The inclusion of district and birth year fixed effects controls for much of the variation in

infant mortality over the sample period unrelated to the shock in 1940 and 1941. For example, a

regression of infant mortality on region fixed effects and birth year fixed effects has an R-square

of approximately 0.87—implying that 87% of the variation in infant mortality is explained by

these fixed effects alone. After including region-specific linear time trends, the share of

explained variation rises to 91%. This is consistent with the evidence in Figures 1-4, which

shows that other than 1940 and 1941, infant mortality follows a very predicable trend during the

period. Thus, the only meaningful variation in infant mortality that remains is arguably driven by

deviations from trend in 1940 and 1941.

       Nevertheless, one may argue that the use of all the variation in infant mortality may

induce bias from endogenous changes in infant mortality unrelated to the wartime conditions that

we have argued are largely exogenous. To assess this possibility, we use an alternative measure

of treatment. Specifically, we set infant mortality to the UK linear trend in all years except 1940

and 1941, and use this measure of treatment in the regression. Effectively, this approach

mechanically removes all variation in years away from the years of the shock to infant mortality,

given the birth year fixed effects. If the estimates remain similar, this suggests that variation

away from the shock does not drive our findings.

       In column 6 of Table 6, we report estimates obtained using this alternative measure of

treatment. The estimates from this approach are consistent with those in column 1 and similar in




                                                  27
sign, magnitude and statistical significance, which suggests that variation away from the shock

period in 1940 and 1941 does not drive our findings.

Omitting London

       Finally, because residents of London experienced the greatest amount of relocation

during the war, there is a concern about potential measurement error in infant mortality. To

address this, we re-estimating our primary specification omitting people who reported being born

in London, which drops roughly 3,230 person-by-wave observations (Column 7 of Table 6). A

comparison between estimates in Column 7 and Column 1 (original estimates) indicates that they

are very similar suggesting that any measurement error introduced by dislocation does not affect

estimates.



Conclusion

       The marked increase in infant mortality in England and Wales during WWII represents a

severe infant health shock. As other research has suggested, such adverse health shocks early in

life may have long lasting effects. In this paper, we add to that literature by examining how the

spike in infant mortality in Great Britain at the start of WWII affected adult outcomes. Historical

evidence suggests that the sharp rise in infant mortality in England in 1940 and 1941 was largely

driven by a combination of a wartime food rationing program, unusually harsh winters, and over-

crowded day nurseries. Moreover, the extent of the adverse health shocks varied considerably

across regions within England. It is this plausibly exogenous variation in infant health, arising

largely due to greater rates of infectious disease, which we exploit to obtain estimates of the

effect of early life health on adult outcomes.




                                                 28
        We find that the wartime spike in infant mortality had a negative effect on later-life

outcomes. The results are consequential in magnitude. We find that a one standard deviation

increase in the district infant mortality rate (roughly the size of the increase between 1939 and

1941) was associated with a 24% increase in reporting poor/very poor health; a 35% increase in

reporting a disability; a 10% decrease in the probability of having a job at the time of interview;

a 17% increase in reporting no annual real earned income; and a roughly 9% decrease in

reporting top-tercile (>12954 pounds) annual real earned income.

        One contribution of our study was focusing on recent birth cohorts, as relatively few

studies have done so. Bozzoli et al. (2009) reported that, for birth cohorts from a comparable

period as those in our sample, higher rates of post-neonatal mortality from pneumonia, which is

similar to our context, was the most consistent predictor of lower adult height in the US and

European countries. The effect size for the US implied by these estimates is small—the change

in post-neonatal mortality rate in the US from 1950 to 1980 is predicted to have increased adult

height by 0.2 centimeters. Case and Paxson (2009), reported that higher rates of infant mortality

among US cohorts born between 1910 and 1950 were associated with reduced cognitive

function. Here too, the effect size was quite small; a 50% increase in infant mortality rates were

associated with one-tenth of a standard deviation decrease in cognitive test (word recall) score.

Our estimates also show scarring effects of infant health shocks like these studies, but our effect

sizes are larger.

        Several other findings merit note. First, we found that the health environment during

infancy was particularly important, and that there was no evidence that a poor health

environment at later ages (2 to 5) had any meaningful effect on adult wellbeing. This evidence

suggests that the first year of life may be a critical period influencing adult outcomes (Heckman



                                                 29
2007). Second, while descriptive evidence suggested that there was a fertility response to WWII

and that average family size differed by birth cohort, this variation in fertility was not a

confounding factor of the effect of infant mortality. Third, we found little evidence that higher

socioeconomic status moderated the effect of the infant health shock. Finally, the evidence was

clear that the association between the early life health shock and adult outcomes grew with age

and were more present after age 55.

       In summary, the findings of our study add to the literature documenting the adverse

effects on adult health and socioeconomic status of early life health shocks. Our study examined

the effects of a specific health shock during a narrowly defined age (post-neonatal) on adult

outcomes for a contemporary population of adults in a developed country setting—England and

Wales. Whether these findings are relevant to today is unknown, but poor infant health remains a

problem among disadvantaged populations in developed countries. It is possible that the effects

of such poor health on future adult outcomes may be diminished by current medical technology,

and social and economic institutions, but if so, then this beneficial effect underscores the

importance of these mediating forces. If not, then our results highlight the potential for

significant benefits from interventions targeted at improving infant health.

              Source: Authors calculations from table “mort_lgd” in the database of “Birth & Death Statistics for Local Government Districts from 1921-1974.”
Notes: This figure plots deviations from a region-specific linear trend in infant mortality from 1930 to 1964. It illustrates that there is substantial variation within the country in
                                                                  the extent to which infant mortality increased.

Notes. We present cause-specific infant mortality by year. For instance, in 1939 bronchitis and pneumonia deaths were the cause of 8.9 infant
deaths per every 1,000 live births. Between 1939 and 1940, bronchitis and pneumonia deaths rose to 12.7 infant deaths per every 1,000 live births,
a change of 3.8. Between 1939 and 1940, the total change in infant deaths per live births was 6.3. As a share of the total change, the rise in
bronchitis and pneumonia deaths explain 60.8 percent.

Notes. We present average sample characteristics for our sample analysis sample. Because our sample contains
individuals aged 40 to 73 and education is unlikely to change much at these ages, the sample size for the
outcome “college or higher” is based on a random observation from each person in the sample leaving 3206
observations.

Notes. Each estimate comes from a separate regression. The sample sizes for each outcome correspond to the number of
observations listed in Table 2 and range from 33359 to 34275. Because our sample contains individuals aged 40 to 73 and
education is unlikely to change much at these ages, we conduct this analysis on a random observation from each person in
the sample leaving 3206 observations. The key independent variable, infant mortality, is standardized to be mean 0 and
standard deviation 1. All regressions control for fixed effects for district, cohort, and month of birth. Additional controls
include dummies for current age, sex, and current region of residence. In column 3 we add a control for the birth rate which

Notes. Each row represents a separate regression. The sample sizes for each outcome correspond to the
number of observations listed in Table 2. We interact standardized infant mortality with indicators for if your
father worked in a lower or higher SES occupation when you were 14. We include the main effect of “High
SES Occupation.” The main effect of standardized infant mortality is subsumed by the interactions. All
regressions control for fixed effects for district, year, and month of birth. Additional controls include dummies
for current age, sex, and current region of residence, and birth rates which vary by district and cohort of birth.
Standard errors clustered by district of birth are in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01

Notes. Each row represents a separate regression. The sample sizes for each outcome correspond to the
number of observations listed in Table 2. We interact standardized infant mortality with terciles of age. All
regressions control for fixed effects for district, year, and month of birth. Additional controls include
dummies for current age, sex, and current region of residence, and birth rates which vary by district and
cohort of birth. Standard errors clustered by district of birth are in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, ***

Notes. Each estimate comes from a separate regression. The sample sizes in column 1 correspond to those in Table 2. For comparison, Column 1 reports
the estimates from Column 3 of Table 3. The means of each dependent variable correspond to the means for the birth cohorts between 1935 and 1950. The
key independent variable, infant mortality, is standardized to be mean 0 and standard deviation 1. In columns 2-4 we vary the included birth cohorts. In
column 5 we randomly select one wave per individual. In column 6, we set years away from 1940/41 to the region-specific trend. In column 7, we exclude
individuals born in London. Standard errors clustered by district of birth are in parentheses. * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01

Appendix Fig. 3 Evidence of Parallel Pre-trends in Outcomes

Notes. The above figures are results of a regression analysis using each outcome as a function of region fixed effects, cohort fixed effects, and region-
by-cohort fixed effects. We omit London as the base region and 1935 as the base cohort and cluster standard errors by district. The coefficients are from
the region-by-cohort fixed effects.

Notes. The table illustrates differences in sample means and standard deviations for the original sample compared to
the final analysis sample that includes region of birth information. The r-square is from a regression of indicator for
being in the final sample on the initial sample. A small r-square indicates that inclusion in the final sample is not
predictive of being in the initial sample.

Level of clustering for the standard errors               District             Person
Notes. Each estimate comes from a separate regression. The sample sizes for each
outcome correspond to the number of observations listed in Table 2. The key
independent variable, infant mortality, is standardized to be mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. All regressions control for fixed effects for district, cohort, month of birth,
dummies for current age, sex, and current region of residence, and birth rates. Column
1 corresponds to column 3 of Table 3, where standard errors are clustered by district.
