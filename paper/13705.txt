We study the impact of information and communication technology on growth through its impact
on organization and innovation. Agents accumulate knowledge through two activities: innovation
(discovering new technologies) and exploitation (learning how to use the current technology). Exploitation
requires the development of organizations to coordinate the work of experts, which takes time. The
costs and benefits of such organizations depend on the cost of communicating and acquiring information.
We find that while advances in information technology that lower information acquisition costs always
increase growth, improvements in communication technology may lead to lower growth and even
to stagnation, as the payoff to exploiting innovations through organizations increases relative to the
payoff of new radical innovations.

                               1. INTRODUCTION

  The development of a new technology brings with it a new set of production chal-
lenges that must be dealt with for production to take place. Tackling these new
problems requires individuals to acquire specialized expertise and to work with each
other. Specialization allows individuals to acquire knowledge only about a narrow set
of problems, which they then utilize intensively. The cost of such specialization is that
it requires communication and coordination among di¤erent individuals. That is, it
requires ‘organization’. Information and communication technology a¤ect the costs
and bene…ts of organization and, through them, the extent to which a new technology
can be exploited. Thus information technology is a ‘meta-technology’: a technology
that a¤ects the costs and bene…ts of investing in technology. In this paper we study
how the cost of acquiring and communicating information a¤ects growth through its
e¤ect on organization and innovation.
  We propose a theory of economic growth through organization. When a new tech-
nology is introduced agents learn only the most common problems associated with it.
As times passes, organizations, in the form of knowledge-based hierarchies (Garicano,
2000) are created. In them, some agents (‘problem solvers’or experts) specialize in
dealing with exceptional problems and other agents specialize in production and learn
the routine problems. We model this process as the emergence of a collection of mar-
kets for expert services (referral markets) where agents sell the problems they cannot
solve to other agents. These referral markets could be equivalently seen as consulting
market arrangements or inside-the-…rm hierarchies, as we have shown elsewhere (Gar-
icano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006). The dynamics of our model result from the time to
build these markets. As we discuss later, in our view it is critical to growth dynamics
that multiple complementary specialists do not emerge instantaneously, but that they
take time to emerge. Speci…cally, we assume agents have to see the problems that
remain unsolved at some moment in time before they decide to specialize in those
problems. Thus, only one expert market can be created per period.
  Our model di¤erentiates two knowledge generating activities: exploiting existing
technology and innovating to develop new technologies. First, exploitation takes place
as organizations undertake production over time and add new layers (new markets)
of experts. By allowing these new experts to leverage their knowledge about unusual

                                           1
problems, the new layers allow for more knowledge to be acquired and make pro-
duction more e¢ cient under the current technology. This process exhibits decreasing
returns, as eventually most problems are well known and the knowledge acquired is
less and less valuable.
  Second, innovation is the result of agent’s decisions of how much to invest to create
radically new technologies. This investment process exhibits adjustment costs, so
that the investment, if it happens, takes place smoothly over time. Of course, the
ability of the economy to exploit the new technology through organization determines
the pro…tability of innovation investments. The rate of innovation, the extent of
exploitation, and the amount of organization in the economy are jointly determined
in our theory, and depend on the cost of acquiring and communicating knowledge.
  If it happens, progress in our model takes place in leaps and bounds. After a new
technology is adopted, investment in innovation decreases and agents concentrate in
exploitation as …rst the more productive pieces of knowledge about this technology
and then the rarer ones are acquired. Radical innovation will not take place again
until the current innovation has been exploited to a certain degree. Both the timing
of the switch to a new technology, and the size of the jump in the technology are
endogenous, as agents must choose how much and when to invest in radical inno-
vation. As long as the value of continuing on an existing innovation is su¢ ciently
high, the switch to the new technological generation does not take place. Adopting
the new technology makes the knowledge acquired about the previous technology
obsolete, and thus requires agents to start accumulating new knowledge and start
building new organizations.1 Thus inherent in new knowledge is a process of creative
destruction (Schumpeter, 1942) whereby adopting a radical innovation makes the ex-
isting organization obsolete.2 That is, we built on the insight of Arrow (1974) that
organizations are speci…c to a particular technology.
   1
     Indeed, empirically, new technologies are usually associated with new organizations. For exam-
ple, associated with the arrival of the electricity at the end of the XIX century were notably Edison
General Electric (now GE) and Westinghouse; associated with the development of the automobile a
few years later were Ford and General Motors; with the development of …lm, Kodak; with the arrival
of the computer and microprocessors …rst IBM and then Intel; with the development of the World
Wide Web, Google, Yahoo, Amazon and E-Bay. We discuss these stylized facts in the next section.
   2
     Previous models of creative destruction, following on the pioneering work of Aghion and Howitt
(1992) and Grossman and Helpman (1991) do not take organizations into account– new products
substitute the old, but organizations play no role.



                                                 2
  Progress may also come to a halt if agents decide not to invest in radical innovation.
Speci…cally, the payo¤ of exploiting existing technologies may be such that agents
optimally create very large organizations, composed of a large set of referral markets
and a large number of di¤erent specialized occupations. Such organizations take a
long time to build, and thus agents choose to postpone forever the moment in which
a new technology would be exploited. That is, the radical innovation process never
gets started. When the current technology is fully exploited, agents do not have any
development in the alternative radical technology to build on, and prefer to place
their e¤orts on small advances of the existing technology. The result is stagnation.
  Information and communication technology determines the depth to which an in-
novation is exploited, and thus the rate of growth. Consider …rst information tech-
nology. The main bene…t of organization is that individuals can leverage their cost
of acquiring knowledge over a larger set of problems, increasing the utilization rate
of knowledge. Information technology advances that reduce the cost of acquiring and
accessing knowledge (e.g. databases), decrease the need for organizational complexity,
shorten the exploitation process, and unambiguously increase growth. Alternatively,
increases in the cost of acquiring and accessing knowledge may dramatically slow long
run growth, maybe to the extend of stopping it, as they require the creation of large,
complex organizations with a long time to build.
  Better communication technology reduces the time spent by agents communicat-
ing with others. This unambiguously increases welfare, but has an ambiguous e¤ect
on growth. Lower communication costs increase the value of both current technolo-
gies (which are more deeply exploited as organizations are more e¢ cient) and of
future technologies. If agents value the future su¢ ciently (because either they do
not discount it much, or because their ability to sell their innovations is limited: ‘ap-
propiability’) this increases the value of innovation. However, if individuals do not
value the future much, particularly when communication is costly, better communi-
cation technology makes investment in exploiting current technology more appealing
which means that organizations spend more e¤ort on the process of deepening their
production knowledge. But this postpones the moment when future technology will
reap its rewards and may lead to lower investment in radical innovations and less
future growth. In fact, it may lead to stagnation. In other words, making organiza-


                                           3
tions more e¢ cient may shift the balance of economic activity from investing in new
innovations to exploiting better existing innovations, and that may reduce economic
growth, potentially to zero. Thus improvements in communication technology could
leave a less developed country, where communication costs and discount rates are
high, with a lower rate of innovation, whereas they would tend to have a positive
e¤ect on the growth of more developed countries. Eventually, su¢ ciently large or
continuous drops in communication costs are favorable to growth, as spans of control
become very large and organizations very simple.
  Throughout, we assume that knowledge is appropriable. In the case of problem
solving and production knowledge because communicating it takes time, and indi-
viduals available time is limited. In the case of innovation knowledge, we assume
individuals invest because they will appropriate the results of their investment by
selling or using the future technologies. Alternatively, we could assume that there are
externalities and that, for example, radical innovations are a by-product of the accu-
mulation of production knowledge. This would also result in an endogenous growth
theory, but one in which better communication technology trivially leads to faster
growth as it incentivates agents to acquire more production knowledge.
  Our theory has some other implications for growth and organization. Scale e¤ects
are absent. Empirically, as Jones (1995) …rst observed, adding more agents to the
research side of the economy (in our case the allocation of more agents as problem
solvers) does not necessarily increase the rate of growth. In our model, there are no
scale e¤ects on average. In fact, we actually obtain larger shares of agents in the
‘knowledge’sector in the …nal periods of an existing technology, where the value of
the extra innovations is the lowest.3 Moreover, the rate of investment in innovation
is lowest when the growth rate is highest (the existing technology is being exploited
increasingly well) while it is highest then the growth rate is lowest. Second, produc-
tivity moves in cycles, involving large gains at the initial stages of the organization
of a radical innovation, and decelerating for a long period of time as the decreasing
returns involved in increasingly deep exploitation of existing technologies take place.
   3
     The main previous existing explanations of this puzzle are Kortum (1997), Young (1998) and
Howitt (1999). The …rst one’s explanation is that the …rst ideas are low hanging fruit, and as these
ideas are exploited, future innovations become increasingly costly to …nd. The other two papers
focus on the increase in the amount of varieties as innovation increases, which leads to an increase
in the innovation cost, as workers must improve a larger number of products.


                                                 4
  Our work has several precedents on top of the seminal endogenous growth theo-
ries of Lucas (1988), Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and
Howitt (1992). Becker and Murphy (1992) …rst studied the connection between co-
ordination costs and growth through economic organization. Unlike in their model,
we speci…cally take into account the knowledge accumulation process and the occu-
pational distribution and organization that results. We also depart in di¤erentiating
between exploitation and innovation. Second, Jovanovic and Rob (1990) develop a
theory in which growth is generated by small innovations within a technology and
large innovations across technologies. In their framework, alternative technologies are
random and are not a¤ected by the choices made within the current technology. In
this sense, our theory endogenizes the quality of alternative technologies and adds
organization as a source of growth. Jovanovic and Rob (1989) present a model in
which communication technology also a¤ects growth through the search process, not,
again, through organizations. Our theory also builds on the work of Penrose (1959)
who …rst (informally) identi…ed the role of …rms in inducing growth through their im-
pact on knowledge accumulation, and emphasized how the constraints on the growth
of managerial hierarchies constrain …rm growth.
  Our work is also related to the work on vintage human capital (Chari and Hopen-
hym, 1991) where older individuals operate in old vintages of technologies; if skilled
and unskilled labor are complementary, it is hard to switch to a new technology.
Also, Comin and Hobijn (2007) present a model where a technology must not just
be discovered, but it must also be implemented in order to be bene…cial and learn-
ing must take place after implementation. Organization does not play any role in
this model, nor does information technology a¤ect how far can organization exploit
the new technology. Firms only choose where to start the implementation process;
from then on it is exogenous. Organization does play a role in Legros, Newman and
Proto (2007) where, like in our work, the division of labor is endogenously determined
with the growth path. The approach in that paper is di¤erent, and complementary,
to ours. While the key organizational issue in their paper is to monitor workers,
the purpose of organization in our work is to increase the utilization of knowledge.
The idea that information and communication technology is a ‘meta-technology’(a
technology to implement technology) so that better information technology a¤ects,


                                          5
through organization, the e¢ ciency of exploitation is, we believe, novel.
  Our theory can explain why some economies stagnate. It shares this feature with
Krusell and Rios-Rull (1996) and Jovanovic and Nyarko (1996). In both of those
papers increased incentives to exploit the current technology may lead to stagnation.
In the former paper due to the political economy problem of insider versus outsider
rents and in the latter because of the cost implied by the loss of expertise when
switching technologies. We argue that stagnation can also be the result of a lengthy
proses of building organizations to exploit the current technology.
  One way to understand our contribution is as a theory of endogenous growth in
labour-augmenting technology. Take a standard production function of the form
AF (K; HL) where A denotes TFP, K capital, H labor-augmenting technology (hu-
man and organizational capital) and L labor. Then, we present a theory of the
evolution of H. It is straightforward to embed it in a standard neoclassical model so
we abstain from doing so. In Section 2 2. we present a theory of the evolution of H,
where H increases as deeper organizations are formed and the technology is exploited
more e¢ ciently. The evolution of H exhibits decreasing returns and so permanent
growth can never be the result of more complex and e¢ cient organizations. In Section
2.3. we allow agents to invest in order to improve technology too. Even though H
exhibits decreasing growth rates, agents will sporadically make radical innovations
that will make the growth of H increase discontinuously and then follow a similar
decreasing path. Section 3 analyzes the model and Section 4 presents some empirical
evidence on technological cycles. Section 5 concludes.

                                   2. THE MODEL

2.1. Preferences and Technology

  The economy is populated by a mass of size 2 of ex-ante identical agents that live
for two periods. Every period an identical set of agents is born. Agents work when
they are young only and they have linear preferences so they maximize the discounted
sum of income or consumption of the unique good produced in the economy. That
is, agents preferences are given by U (ct ; ct+1 ) = ct + ct+1 :
  At the start of the period agents choose an occupation and a level of knowledge


                                             6
to perform their job. Agents can either work in organizations that use the current
prevalent technology, or they can decide to implement a new technology. The quality
of the new technology will depend on past investments in innovation knowledge which
will be the only technology available to save for the retirement period.
  A technology is a method to produce goods using labor and knowledge. One unit of
labor generates a project or problem. To produce, agents need to have the knowledge
to solve the problem. If they do, they solve the problem and output is produced. If the
worker does not know the solution to the problem, she has the possibility to transfer
or sell the problem or project to another agent that may have the knowledge to solve
it. Organizations are hierarchical, they have one layer of workers and potentially
many layers of problem solvers (as in Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg, 2006). Problem
solvers have more advanced knowledge than workers and so are able to solve more
advanced problems, but they need to ‘buy’these problems from workers or lower layer
problem solvers since they do not spend time producing but communicating existing
problems.
  The key assumption in our model is that specialization requires organization and
organization cannot be built instantly. Organization takes time to build (see Kyd-
land and Prescott (1983) for a similar argument for the case of physical capital).
For people to specialize in di¤erent types of problems, they must have mechanisms
that allow them to know who knows what and to ask the right question from the
right person— specialization requires organization. Two main factors prevent the si-
multaneous development of specialists in many di¤erent areas who can work together
instantly. First, it is impossible to know what are the problems that will prove impor-
tant in the next cycle of innovation, and the types of expertise that will be required.
For example, experts in internet marketing or sophisticated wireless networks be-
came available only after the internet was developed and there was a demand for
their services. Second, agents have to be trained in the basic knowledge of the cur-
rent technology before others can be trained in the more advanced knowledge; in fact,
learning how to deal with the rare and advanced problems may not be useful if there
are no agents specialized in simple tasks who can actually ask the right questions. The
appearance of sophisticated radiologist who specialize in some speci…c kinds of tumors
requires the previous appearance of normal radiologists, and of cancer specialists who


                                          7
can use the information obtained in these X-rays.
  A technology is used more intensely the more layers in the organization. In the …rst
period a technology is in use, agents learn basic knowledge to develop it and they work
as production workers. Since higher layers of management have not been developed,
the problems they cannot solve go to waste. In the next period, agents observe that
in the last period some valuable problems were thrown away and some of them decide
to work as …rst layer problem solvers. These problem solvers, in turn, learn to solve
some problems and throw away those that they cannot solve. This induces the entry
of second layer experts in the next period. This process goes on making the hierarchy
taller as time proceeds and the use of the prevalent technology more e¢ cient through
a better allocation of workers. Of course, the knowledge acquired by agents in all
layers will depend on the number of layers in the organization as well as the fees or
prices for transferring problems. The price at which an agent with a particular level
of knowledge can sell a problem is a measure of the e¢ ciency of the organizational
structure in exploiting a technology. As we will see, the more organizational layers,
the higher the price and so the more e¢ cient is the organization in allocating labor
and knowledge.
  As emphasized in Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006) there are many equivalent
ways of decentralizing these organizations. First, as here, there can be a market
for problems and agents sell and buy problems for each other at a market price.
Alternatively, there can also be …rms that optimally organize these hierarchies and
hire workers and managers for particular positions at a wage given their knowledge
level. Finally, organizations can also be decentralized as consulting markets in which
workers hire knowledgeable agents as consultants to solve problems for them for a
fee. All of these interpretations are equivalent and can exists at the same time. In
all of them agents obtain the same earnings and perform the same roles. In what
follows we model these hierarchies as markets for experts services –there are markets
for problems and problem solvers buy them, but we may as well talk about …rms and
managers.
  We now turn to the description of the formation of organization and the use of a
technology. We then study the decisions of agents to drop the technology currently
in use and make a radical innovation instead of going deeper in the development of


                                          8
the current technology (add a new layer).

2.2. Organizing a Technology

  Suppose a new technology A           1 is put in place at time t = 0. The evolution
of this technology will be our main concern in the next section. For now we just
keep it …xed and focus on how it is exploited. Obtaining A units of output from
this technology requires a unit of time and a random level of knowledge. An agent
specialized in production uses his unit of time to generate one problem, which is a
draw from the probability distribution f (z). We assume that f (z) is continuous and
decreasing, f 0 (z) < 0; with cumulative distribution function F (z). The assumption
that f 0 (z) < 0 guarantees that agents will always start by learning how to solve the
most basic and common problems.4 In order to produce, the problem drawn must be
within the workers’knowledge set, if it is not, then no output is generated. Knowledge
can be acquired at a constant cost e
                                   c > 0; so that acquiring knowledge about problems
in [0; z] costs e
                cz: Denote the wage of an agent working in layer ` 2 f0; 1; ::::g of an
organization with highest layer L (or in period L since the highest layer is, throughout
this section, the time period) by wL` : Then, the earnings of a production worker (layer
0) working on a new idea (so the highest layer in the organization is L = 0) at time
0 are:


                                  w00 = max AF (z)     e
                                                       cz;
                                          z

where AF (z) is total output by workers with ability z (they solve a fraction F (z) of
problems each of which produces A units of output) and e
                                                       cz is the cost of acquiring
knowledge z. Denote by z00 the level of knowledge that solves the problem above
(where the notation is analogous to the one for wages). Note that an organization with
only workers of layer zero will leave unsolved a fraction of problems 1       F (z00 ) : These
problems, if solved, would produce output A(1 F (z00 )): But this simple organization,
where workers only work by themselves, chooses optimally to discard them.
  In order to take advantage of the discarded problems next period, t = 1, some
agents will decide to buy the discarded problems from workers as long as they can
  4
    That is, f 0 (z) < 0 will be chosen by agents if they can sequence the knowledge acquired
optimally.


                                              9
then solve some of them and obtain higher earnings. The assumption is that these
agents need to …rst see that valuable problems are discarded to enter next period and
take advantage of them. Agents can communicate the problems they did not solve in
exchange for a fee or price. If communication is cheaper than drawing new problems,
then some agents may …nd it in their interest to specialize in learning about unsolved
problems; they pay a price for these problems, but in exchange they can solve many of
them as they do not need to spend time generating the problems, only communicating
with the seller. Organization makes it, potentially, optimal to learn unusual problems,
as agents can amortize this knowledge over a larger set of problems.
  Thus at time t = 1 agents have a choice between becoming production workers or
specialized problem solvers. If they become production workers they earn

                          w10 = max AF (z) + (1            F (z))r10         e
                                                                             cz             (1)
                                     z

       0
where r1;1 is the equilibrium price at which workers in layer 0 sell their problems. As
problem solvers they need to spend their time communicating with workers to …nd
out about the problems they are buying. The number of problems a manager can
buy is given by the communication technology. Let h be the time a problem solver
needs to communicate with a worker about a problem. Then, a problem solver has
time to …nd out, and therefore buy, 1=h problems. Clearly h is a key parameter of the
model that determines the quality of communication technology. The manager knows
that workers only sell problems that they cannot solve, so he knows that all problems
                                            0           0
sold by workers will require knowledge z > z1;1 (where z1;1 solves the problem above).
                                                                              0
Hence, the manager acquires knowledge about the more frequent problems above z1;1 .
The wage of the layer one problem solver is then given by

                                 1           F (z10 + z) F (z10 )
                    w11 = max            A                             r10        e
                                                                                  cz:
                             z   h                1 F (z10 )
Namely, they buy 1=h problems at price r0 and solve a fraction (F (z10 + z11 )          F (z10 ))
= (1   F (z10 )) of them, each of which produces A units of output. On top of this, they
pay the cost of learning the problems in [z10 ; z10 + z11 ] : As long as r10 > 0; the value of
the problems that were being thrown out was positive, and so w00 < w10 = w11 ; where
the last equality follows from all agents being identical ex-ante. Hence, if r10 > 0
adding the …rst layer of problem solvers is optimal at time t = 1. We will show below

                                                   10
that in equilibrium under some assumptions on F; r10 is in fact positive. Note also that
agents in layer 0 will choose to acquire less knowledge as we add a layer of problem
solvers: It is not worth it to learn as much since unsolved problems can now be sold
at a positive price.
  Next period, t = 2, agents observe that some valuable problems were thrown away
last period. Namely, a fraction 1 F (z11 ) of problems. Hence, some agents enter
as managers of layer 2 to buy these problems from problem solvers of layer 1. This
process continues, adding more layers each period, as long as some valuable prob-
lems are thrown away and agents can acquire enough knowledge to solve them and
earn higher wages. Hence, each period this economy potentially adds another layer
of problem solvers. More unusual and specialized problems are solved and society
acquires a larger and larger range of knowledge.
  To avoid repetition, we write the problem for period t = L when the hierarchy has
a maximum layer L. As described above, production workers earn

in…nity the number of layers also goes to in…nity. In the next section we will introduce
radical innovations that will prevent this from happening. For the moment, however,
we continue with our technology A.

(or organizations with L + 1 layers), given prices, agents choose knowledge so as to
maximize their earnings as stated above. The …rst order conditions from this problems

  Note that the knowledge acquired is increasing in A and decreasing in e c, h (for
problem solvers) and the price obtained for selling problems. The intuition for the
e¤ect of A and e
               c is immediate. For h, remember that a higher h implies a worse
communication technology. So a higher h implies that problem solvers can buy fewer
problems and so they can span their knowledge over less problems. Knowledge be-
comes less useful. As the price at which agents sell problems increases, agents have
an incentive to sell their problems instead of learning more to squeeze all their value,
which creates incentives to learn less.
   At any point in time t an economy with technology A and organizations with L + 1
layers is in equilibrium if the knowledge levels of agents solve Equations (3) and

                          wL` = wL`+1       w~ (A; L) for all ` = 0; :::; L                      1:                    (5)

This condition is equivalent to an equilibrium condition requiring that the supply
                                                                                                                      L 1
and demand of problems at every layer equalize at the equilibrium prizes rL`                                          `=0
                                                                                                                          .
The reason is that when wages are equalized, agents are indi¤erent as to their role in
the organization, and thus they are willing to supply and demand positive amounts
of the problems in all layers. Equilibrium in the markets for problems given L then
implies that there are a number
                                                                                   `   1

of agents working in layer `. Since the economy is populated by a unit mass of agents,
the number of workers is given by
                                                                 1

So given t, A, and L an equilibrium for one generation of agents is a collection of L

in (3) and (5). Before we move on to characterize the solution to this system of
equations consider the solutions of the system as L ! 1: In this case, since there is

Since r1 is not a function of `; earnings of problem solvers are identical as is the
amount of knowledge they learn. This veri…es our guess if we can …nd an r such that

  The case of L ! 1 is helpful since it is evident that the economy will converge to it
as the number of layers increases. Furthermore, when L ! 1 no valuable problems
are thrown away. Thus w1 bounds the level of earnings agents can achieve with
technology A: We now turn to the characterization of an equilibrium given t, A and
L …nite. The next proposition shows that an equilibrium given A and L …nite exists,
is unique, rL` is decreasing in `; and zL` is increasing in `: The logic is straightforward.
Start with layer L. These problem solvers cannot resell the problems to a higher
layer. Hence, relative to agents one layer below, who can resell their problems, agent
in L are willing to pay less for them than agents in layer L        1 are willing to pay for
the problems they buy. Similarly, agents in layer L 1 are willing to pay less for the
problems they buy than agents in layer L 2 as they can sell them for a low price
to agent in layer L: This logic goes through for all layers. The more layers on top
of an agent the more valuable the problem, as it can potentially be sold to all the
layers above, up to L. Now consider the amount of knowledge acquired by agents.
Agents in layer L cannot sell their problems and so they have an incentive to learn as
much as possible to extract as much value as possible from each problem. In contrast,
agents in layer L   1 are less willing to learn as they can sell their problems to agents
in layer L. Agents in layer L 2 get a higher price for their unsolved problems so
their incentives to learn are smaller than the agents above them. Again, this logic
applies to all layers in the hierarchy, including layer 0 where the fall in knowledge is
even larger since worker can span their knowledge over only one problem instead of
1=h of them (since they use their time to produce). Of course, as L ! 1 this logic
does not apply and all prices and knowledge levels of problem solvers are constant,
since there is no …nal layer in which prices are equal to zero.
  To prove the next proposition we will use the following parameter restriction which
is necessary and su¢ cient for zL` > 0 for all ` and L:

Condition 1 A        1, h < 1 and A; ; e
                                       c and h satisfy
                                     A   1
                                        > + ln h:
                                      e
                                      c  h
Proposition 2 Under Condition 1; for any A; and L …nite, there exists a unique
                                                       L 1
equilibrium determined by a set of prices        rL`   `=0
                                                             and a set of knowledge levels

        L
 zL`    `=0
              such that rL` > 0 is strictly decreasing in ` and zL` > 0 is strictly increasing
in `:

Proof. Use (3) to obtain the knowledge of each agent as a function of the price the
                                                                                e
                                                                                ch                 e
                                                                                                   ch
agent receives for a problem passed. Letting                                         and       A        and using (4)
we obtain the following recursion for the set of prices:

                              rLL   1
                                        =     hwLL +       ln
                                                                A
                              rL` 1     =     hwL`   +     ln                    for 0 < ` < L:
                                                                A        rL`

Imposing (5) for ` = 1; :::; L                1 we obtain that


                       rLL     1
                                    =       hw~ (A; L) +        ln                                                (6)
                                                                     A
                        rL`    1
                                    =       hw~ (A; L) +        ln                   for 0 < ` < L:
                                                                     A         rL`

For a given w~ (A; L) there exists at most one rL0 > 0 such that the whole system
holds. Speci…cally, note that given w~ (A; L) we can determine rLL 1 : So choose some
w~ (A; L) > 0 such that the resulting price rLL 1 > 0 (and abusing notation slightly
denote by rL` (w)
               ~ the solution of the system above given w).
                                                          ~ It is easy to see that,
since rLL     1
                  > 0; rLL    2
                                    ~ > rLL
                                   (w)         1
                                                    ~ : Repeating this argument we can conclude that
                                                   (w)
              L 1
 rL` (w)
      ~       `=0
                    is decreasing in `. It is also immediate from (3) that the higher the price
                                                                                           L
the lower the corresponding knowledge level, so zL` (w)
                                                      ~ `=0 is increasing in ` (note
that for zL0 there is an extra e¤ect coming from the fact that workers cannot span
their knowledge over many problems, a missing h in (3)). Condition 1 guarantees
                                                    L
that the resulting values zL` (w)
                               ~                    `=0
                                                          are positive, as rL` (w)
                                                                                ~ < r1 since when L ! 1
all prices are positive (as opposed to zero in layer L) and, as can be readily observed
in the system of equations above, prices in layer ` 1 are increasing in prices in layer
`: Note also that as the price at which agents in layer L can sell problems is equal to
zero, the prices for all other layers are strictly positive.
  Note that rL0 (w)
                 ~ is decreasing in w~ as

and we can therefore invert it to obtain wLs (rL0 ) which is also a continuous and strictly
decreasing function.

since h < 1 and rL1   0. Thus, wLp (0) < wLs (0) : The Intermediate Value Theorem
then guarantees that there exists a unique value rL0 such that wLs (rL0 ) = wLp (rL0 ) and
so a unique equilibrium exists.

      We now turn to the properties of this economy as we change the highest layer
L. Note that for now, without radical innovations, changes in L happen as time
evolves and so studying the properties of our economy as we change the number of
layers is equivalent to studying the properties of our economy as time evolves. This
equivalence will change in the next section once we introduce radical innovations as
we will have organizations evolving for di¤erent technologies across time. The next
proposition shows that as the number of layers increases so do wages (or output per
capita if knowledge cost are considered forgone output). Furthermore since wages are
bounded by w1 , there are eventual decreasing returns in the number of organizational
layers. This is just the result of higher layers dealing with less problems as they are
more rare. So adding an extra layer contributes to output per capita (since more
problems are solved) but it contributes less the higher the layer since there are fewer
and fewer problems that require such specialized knowledge.
      The proposition also shows that as time evolves and the number of layers increases,
rL`    increases and zL` decreases for all `. The …rst result is a direct consequence of
the logic used in the previous proposition. As time elapses and the number of layers
increases the number of layers above a given ` increases, which implies that rL` in-
creases, since the problems can be resold further if not solved. In turn, higher prices
in turn imply less knowledge acquisition as the opportunity to resell problems is a
substitute for solving them.

Proposition 3 Under Condition 1; for any technology A; as the number of layers L
increase, wt increases and limL!1 w~ (A; L) = w1 . Furthermore, as the number of
layers L increase, prices rL` increase for all ` = 0; :::; L   1 and knowledge levels zL`
decrease for all ` = 0; :::; L: As L ! 1; rL` ! r1 for all ` = 0; :::; L   1 and zL` ! z1

Proof. Consider the individual incentives of an agent in period t to form layer L + 1
given that the economy’s highest layer is L. Such an agent can use the problems
thrown away by the agents in layer L: The wage such an agent in layer L + 1 would
command is given by
                                    A    e

which is always greater than the equilibrium wage in the economy given by
                                   A    rLL   1
                                                   e
                                                   c                   e
                                                                       ch
                            wt =                          1       ln         ;
                                       h                                A

since as shown in the previous proposition rLL             1
                                                                 > 0. Therefore, in the next period
such an agent has incentives to enter and form layer L + 1: Of course, once he enters,
agents in layer L will demand a positive price for their problems and so some of the
surplus will be distributed to other agents in the economy. However, the economy as
a whole will produce more output as the higher price is only a redistribution of wealth
between agents. Agents will also re-optimize and choose di¤erent levels of knowledge
     L
 zL` `=0 which will increase the surplus, as they have the option to choose the same
level of knowledge they chose before. Hence, w~ (A; L) > w~ (A; L + 1) for all L.
  This result can be formally proven as follows. Consider rL0 (w)
                                                               ~ de…ned in the proof
of Proposition 2. As rLL = 0 (the last layer throws problems away) but rL+1
                                                                         L
                                                                             > 0
                                              ` 1                 `
and since for a given w; by Equations (6), rL+1 is increasing in rL+1 ; we obtain
                0
that rL0 (w) < rL+1 (w) : Now de…ne the function rp using Equation (7), the price of
problems sold by workers, as
                                                   e
                                                   c
                                 rp (w)       A        e ce (A    w) 1
                                                                         :

In an equilibrium with L layers we know that rp (w~ (A; L)) = rL0 (w~ (A; L)) and in
                                                       0
an equilibrium with L + 1 layers rp (w~ (A; L + 1)) = rL+1 (w~ (A; L)) : Since rL0 (w) <
 0
rL+1 (w) and rp0 (w) > 0 and rL00 (w) < 0, this implies that w~ (A; L + 1) > w~ (A; L)
           0
and that rL+1                                             `
               > rL0 : By (6) this in turn implies that rL+1 > rL` for all ` < L            1: Note
                                      `
also that by (3) this implies that zL+1   < zL` for all ` < L 1:
  Note that as we have shown in Proposition 2, rL` < r1 for all ` and L …nite. Hence,
            1
since rL`   L=0
                  is a strictly increasing and bounded sequence it has to converge for all
`: Since the equilibrium is unique as shown in Proposition 2 the limit is r1 . Hence, as
               1                                                                    1
L ! 1, rL` L=0 approaches r1 from below. Equations (3) then imply that zL` L=0
              `
converges to z1 from above.
  The previous proposition shows that our economy will grow. But it also shows that
the level of wages is bounded. Hence, growth in wages (or per capita output) will
converge to zero. That is, the economy does not exhibit permanent growth. We now
turn to embed this evolution over time of organizations with a given technology A in

                                                  19
                                a growth model in which agents will have a choice to switch to better technologies
                                as they learn. This will yield a long-run growth model that will exhibit permanent
                                growth and where this growth will be driven by the ability of agents to organize.
                                    The following graphs illustrate the results proven in the previous propositions.
                                Figure 1 shows an example of a wage path. The properties we have proven are easy
                                to identify: wages increase at a decreasing rate and have an asymptote at w1 : Figure
                                2 shows the evolution of the size of a typical hierarchy. The top layer size is normalize
                                to one. Clearly, as the economy adds more markets for expertise, or layers, the lower
                                layers expand more than proportionally.

                                    Figure 3 illustrates the problem for prices for an economy with 5 layers and an
                                economy with 7 layers. As proven above, prices of problems are higher in an economy
                                with a higher maximum number of layers: Problems can be exploited further and
                                so conditional on someone having tried to solve them and failed, they preserve more
                                value. Prices of problems at the highest layer are equal to zero by assumption, since
                                there is no higher layer to sell them to. The price of problem is also decreasing
                                as we move up the hierarchy since problems are more and more selected. Figure 4
                                present the knowledge acquisition of agents for the same two exercises. The picture

                                                                                     20
                         is the reverse image of the prices in Figure 3, since higher prices imply less knowledge
                         as selling the problems becomes more attractive. So, given the layer, knowledge
                         acquisition is higher the smaller the maximum number of layers.

                           Another way of illustrating the implications of our model for knowledge acquisition
                         given the level of technology A is presented in Figure 5. The …gure presents cumulative
                         knowledge in the economy. Clearly, as the number of layers increases the cumulative
                         amount of knowledge acquired increases. Note that this is happening even though
                         the growth in output per capita is converging to zero as illustrated in Figure 1.5 Note
                         also that the knowledge of problem solver in hierarchies with two or more layers is
                         constant. The …gure also illustrates how, given the layer or occupation, the knowledge
                         acquired decreases with time (or the maximum number of layers).
                            5
                              It is easy to develop a model of endogenous growth where the linear knowledge accumulation
                         observed in Figure 1 creates, through an externality, improvements in A. These improvements would
                         make agents switch to a new technology when the value of developing an extra layer with the
                         current technology is smaller than the value of starting with the new technology but zero layers (no
                         organization).

   Before we end this section it is important to make one remark about the evolution
of the distribution of gross wages (without subtracting learning costs). Overall wage
inequality, as measured by the ratio of the gross wages of the highest level problem
solvers to the gross wages of workers, increases over time as a technology is more
e¢ ciently organized. To see this note that everyone gains the same net of learning
costs, and knowledge levels of workers decrease with the number of layers, while
knowledge levels of entrepreneurs at the highest layer are constant. In contrast, the
distribution of gross wages among problem solvers becomes less dispersed. The reason
is that more layers are added and knowledge levels of intermediate problem solvers
converge to z1 . Thus, as organizations develop over time, inequality between workers
and managers increases while inequality within problem solvers decreases.

2.3. Technological Innovation

  In the previous section we studied how an economy organizes given a technological
level A. In our economy, as organizations grow and become more complex, society
learns how to solve a wider set of problems faced when using this technology. This
knowledge is fully appropriable and society invests optimally, conditionally on A; on


                                                                                     22
the development of this problem solving knowledge. We now turn to the evolution of
the technology A that we kept …xed in the previous section. For this, we will assume
that the technology is a fully private and rival good. Agents can invest in improving
their technology and sell their technology to other agents (in fact, this will be the
only savings technology of an agent). However, a technology has to be used in order
to be productive and organizations have to be developed to exploit it. Of course, only
agents that use the same technology can work with each other.
  We studied above the problem of exploiting a given technology. This problem
produced the equilibrium earnings that all agents in the economy working with a
particular technology receive in equilibrium. These earnings changed every period as
new layers of expertise develop in the economy to exploit this technology. As in the
previous section, denote the equilibrium earnings of agents working with technology
A in an economy with L + 1 layers of expertise by w~ (A; L) : w~ (A; L) contains all the
information we need about the organization of the economy to study the decisions of
agents to invest in innovation.
  The cost of learning new technologies, measured in terms of foregone income, in-
creases with the level of the new technologies — the more productive the technology
the higher the cost of spending time learning to solve problems. Thus we specify
the learning cost of the new technology as e
                                           c = cA: Then the cost of learning how
to solve problems in an interval of size z is equal to Acz where A is the technology
currently in use (not necessarily the best one). All the analysis in the previous section
remains unchanged apart from the parameter ec now becoming Ac:6 Then, it is easy
to see from Equations (4) and the equilibrium conditions in (5) that the prices of
problems are proportional to the level of technology A so rL` =A satis…es the problem
in the previous section with A = 1. Thus, earnings are proportional to the level of
technology. Namely, w(A;
                     ~   L) = Aw(L), where w(L) is the equilibrium wage given
that the economy has organized L + 1 layers and A = 1: So earnings are linear in the
level of the technology in use. This is a property that we will exploit heavily below.
                                                           2
  An agents with technology A faces a cost of A                of improving the best technology
he can use to (1 + ) A. So we are assuming that there are quadratic adjustment
   6
    Note that if we do not scale c by the level of technology, as the economy grows the cost of
acquiring knowledge relative to output will converge to zero. This would introduce an obvious scale
e¤ect in the model.


                                                23
cost of improving the frontier technology. The frontier technology is not necessarily
the technology in use, since changing technology implies wasting the organizations
created to exploit the older technology. So agents will improve the frontier technology
and, once it is good enough and the bene…ts from developing the old technology have
died out, agents will switch to the frontier technology and will start creating new
organizations to exploit this technology. The role of the quadratic adjustments costs
is to have smooth investments in the frontier technology. Without them, agents would
invest in the new technology only the period before a new technology is put in place.
  As discussed before, agents order consumption using a linear utility function with
discount factor . Because of this preference speci…cation, the marginal utility of
consumption in every period and for every agent in the economy is equal to one.
Hence, the solution to the problem of a sequence of two period lived agents that work
when they are young, is identical to the solution to the problem of an in…nitely lived
agent, up to consumption transfers between generations. Thus, the solution to the
in…nitely lived agent problem will lead to innovation levels and a timing of radical
innovation that are identical to the solution to the two period lived agents problem.
That is, both problems will maximize the discounted sum of consumption. The actual
consumption levels every period will, however, depend on the level of prices at which
individuals can sell their technology. In what follows we discuss the in…nite horizon
problem to analyze the equilibrium allocation of this economy. We then discuss the
price of technology and the consumption pattern across generations.
  The problem of an in…nitely lived agent (or a sequence of two period lived agents
that sell each other their technology) is therefore given by
                        2     2                                           33

V~ (A; A0 ; L) denote the value function of an agent using technology A, with a frontier
technology A0 in an economy with maximum layer L. Note that we are assuming that
all individuals (or sequence of individuals) have the same technology so their technol-
ogy, and the frontier technology, are the same for ever agent in the economy (more

                                          24
on this below). An agent can work using the current technology A with organizations
of L + 1 layers (remember that there is a layer zero) and receive w~ (A; L), invest
  at cost A 2 , and tomorrow repeat the problem with a new frontier technology
A00 = A0 (1 + ) and organizations with L + 2 layers. He can also decide to drop the
available organizations and do a radical innovation, in which case he uses the frontier
technology with zero layers and gets value V~ (A0 ; A0 ; 0) :
  We are assuming that everyone in this economy has the same A and A0 and there-
fore, as agents are identical they choose the same pattern of innovations. This requires
that, at period zero, all agents start with the same frontier technology. If this is the
case, then no agent would want to deviate by himself since this would force him to
work on his own, therefore reducing his reliance on organization and therefore his in-
come.7 Of course, if we allow the economy to start with agents that are heterogenous
in their level of technology, there may be other non-symmetric equilibria. The study
of these equilibria may be interesting, but we leave it for future research and, in this
paper, focus on symmetric equilibria only.
   The fact that w~ (A; L) = Aw(L) implies that V~ (A; A0 ; L) is also homogenous of

for L large the discounted bene…t of developing an extra layer converges to zero.
Similarly, the bene…ts of innovation also converge to zero as L becomes large since they
                        L
are proportional to         V (1; 0) ! 0 as L ! 1: This implies that there are two cases
that we need to consider. First, the case where there exists a unique …nite L such

    This follows immediately from w (A; 0)    w (A0 ; L) for all L and A      A0 and our assumption
that production knowledge is speci…c to the technology in use.

that next period a new technology is put in place, namely, V (G; L + 1) = GV (1; 0)
for all G. This is the case in which the value of innovation converges to zero more
slowly that the value of an extra layer. Second, a case where the value of innovation
converges to zero faster than the value of an extra layer and so L is in…nity. In this
case a new technology is never put in place and so the economy stagnates and the
growth rate converges to zero as we will discuss below.
  Since, given a …nite L ; the problem of choosing an innovation level                                 is a well
behaved concave problem by design, an optimal innovation level exits and is unique.
Denote it by         (L). Of course, if L = 1,               (L) = 0 all L, since there are no
incentives to invest in innovation capital.
     In any case, we can write the value function as

     Clearly, the left hand side does not depend on l and so since

with equality when                (l) = 0 all l in the case of stagnation when L = 1: Note that
the fact that the investment is positive in all periods (when there is no stagnation) is
only the result of discounting and the adjustment costs. Without adjustment costs we
would only invest in the last period before the switch to a new technology. Note also
that the above equation implies that                          (0) > 0 if L is …nite. That is, the economy
will invest positive amounts in innovation capital, as long as it eventually switches to
a new technology. Innovation is positive every period in the case of no stagnation. In
the stagnation case L +1 = 0 and so the left hand side of the …rst order condition
is equal to zero and so                  (l) = 0. Note that even in this case the solution to the
innovation knowledge problem satis…es the …rst order condition since the marginal
cost of zero investment is zero.

where       L   in the …rst term denotes the optimal innovation policy given that we switch
technologies every L + 1 periods. Note the two compensating e¤ect. First, as we
increase the number of periods we exploit a given technology we increase the total
income we obtain from it. Second, as we delay the switch of technology we discount
for a further period and have one extra period to invest in innovation. Since w (`)
is monotone in ` we know that the di¤erence in (10) is monotone too which implies
that there is a unique L as we conjectured above (see the upper-left panel of Figure
6 below). Note however, that this di¤erence being monotone does not rule out the

                                                               27
possibility that L = 1. This is the case where the second e¤ect (the discounting
e¤ect) dominates the …rst (each technology is more valuable because it is exploited for
more periods) for all layers and so only one technology is put in place. As discussed
above in this case there is no investment in innovation capital and so the long-run
growth rate is zero.
  We summarize our …ndings in the next proposition:

Proposition 4 Given a common technology in period zero, A0 , there exists a unique
competitive equilibrium of one of two types:

  1. Permanent Growth: The equilibrium exhibits technological cycles of …nite length.
                                                               Q
     This cycles repeat themselves at output per capita that is L`=0 (1 + (`)) times
     higher each cycle. Investments in innovation increase with the number of layers
     in the organization,    (l) <    (l0 ) all l < l0 . Furthermore   (0) > 0; so the
     economy exhibits
                  qQ positive permanent growth. The average long-run growth rate
                 L    L
     is given by      `=0 (1 +  (`)):

  2. Stagnation: The equilibrium decreasing growth rates that converge to zero. Out-
     put per worker converges to w1 : Investment in innovation is equal to zero each
     period and the long run growth rate is equal to zero as well.

  Figure 6 presents one example of an equilibrium allocation with positive permanent
growth (…rst type of equilibrium). In the upper-left corner we show the total value of
switching technologies every certain number of layers. The maximum of this curve is
V and is obtained at L . The plot stops at layer 21, and reaches a maximum at L =
20: So the equilibrium allocation for these parameter values ( = :87, h = :5, c = :9;
and = 50 (we keep this value constant throughout the paper)) exhibits technological
cycles every 21 periods. Note how the value increases the most when we lengthen the
technology cycles from zero to one period, as developing the …rst organizational layer
implies the largest gains. The lower-left panel shows the investment in innovation
during the 21 periods this technology is exploited. At the beginning when only a
few layers of organization have been formed, the switch to the boundary technology
is far away in the future, so agents invest little in innovation. As the time of the
switch approaches, agents invest progressively more. As Equations (9) reveal, this

                                          28
path is driven essentially by the discount factor . The higher                                                        the more even are
investment over the cycle. Note that agents invest a positive amount each period so
the frontier technology is constantly improving.

                                                  Figure 6

  The right column of Figure 6 presents the natural logarithm of output per capita or
wages (w~ (A; L)). The upper panel presents the long term view of this variable over
300 periods. It is clear that although output per capita grows in cycles the economy
exhibits constant long term growth as we formalized in the previous proposition. The
lower panel present a close up of equilibrium wages for two technological cycles. In
the previous section we discussed the general shape of w~ (A; L). This …gure illustrates
the time of the switch between technologies. As it is clear from the period, wages fall
for at least a period before recovering and surpassing the old technology wages. The
reason for the drop in wages is that the economy is losing the stock of organization (the
old markets for expertise are not longer used). This implies a short term reduction

                                                       29
in output per capita, although, of course, the economy wins in the long run, as the
timing of the switch is optimal.
  The second type of equilibrium, the one with stagnation, start similarly to the
equilibrium in Figure 6, but instead of the value function reaching a maximum, the
value function is strictly increasing but at a decreasing rate. Increases in the value
function are always positive but converge to zero as we increase the maximum number
of layers. Hence, the economy stays with the same technology forever, and ln w~ (A; L)
converges, so growth rates go to zero.
  We can now come back to the problem of a two period lived agent. Such an agent
will buy a frontier technology (which allows him to produce with any technology below
that) when his young and wants to produce. He will invest in innovation and improve
his frontier technology and will sell it when he is old. In fact, the way in which we
have setup the problem implies that the only way in which this agent can save is via
technology (Of course, we could also add physical capital to the model in a standard
way.) A technology includes all innovation knowledge acquired by society up to that
point. In particular, it allows the agent to use the technology currently in place, but
it also gives the agent the state of the art technology. The price of technology will be
a function of the level of alternative technology being bought, the technology being
used, and the number of layers in the current organization (the three state variables
in our problem). Hence, the price of a technology is given by P~ (A; A0 ; L) : Note that,
as we argued for the value function above, this function needs to be homogenous of
degree one in A and A0 : Hence,

                                           30
up to lump sum transfers between generations. If p = 0 and we let prices be identical
to the value function we are letting the …rst generation extract all the surplus that
can be generated from the initial technology they own. If p = V (1; 0) then this
…rst generation does not get any of this surplus. For our purpose what is important
is that this transfers do not change the equilibrium allocation in this economy apart
from consumption. Hence, they do not a¤ect growth, the length of cycles, or the
organization of production.
  Nevertheless, formulating the problem above is useful because it allows us to under-
stand the role that technology appropiability plays in this economy. By appropiability
we refer to the fraction of the payment for technology done by future generations that
the owner of the technology obtains. That is, suppose that appropiability is very low,
since we are modelling a country in which markets for technology are either taxed or
very ine¢ cient. Then there will be a gap between the price paid for technology by
future generations and the price received by the old generation that owns the tech-
nology. The higher appropiability is in an economy, the more incentives agents have
to innovate, since they will receive a higher price in return for their technology in the
future. It is easy to see from the previous equation that the level of appropiability is
technically equivalent to the discount factor . So this parameter plays a double role,
as a discount factor and as the level of appropiability in an economy. The higher the
higher appropiability and the more incentives do agents have to invest in innovating
the current technology. It is immediate from Equation (8) and the envelope theorem
that a higher (an economy where technology is more appropriable) implies a higher
welfare level. As we will discuss in the next section, a higher also implies a smaller
set of parameter values for which the economy stagnates.

   3. THE EFFECT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION
                TECHNOLOGY ON GROWTH

  In this section we study the e¤ect of information and communication technology
(ICT) on growth. We start by discussing the e¤ect of ICT on growth in the case where
the economy never stagnates. In the next subsection we study the circumstances in
which economies never switch technologies and stagnate.



                                           31
3.1. The Permanent Growth Case

  We explore the model numerically, since as we will show some of the e¤ect of
information technology are quite complex. First note that the e¤ect of the cost
of acquiring information c and the cost of communication h change innovation and
growth in the economy only through their e¤ect on the wage schedule w (L). This is
evident from the problem in (8), as c and h do not enter directly in the problem. So
ICT a¤ects the dynamic technology innovation process only by changing the bene…ts
of exploiting the current and future technologies. Essentially ICT is a technology that
allows society to exploit other technologies. So better ICT, either through reductions
in c or reductions in h, implies increases in w~ (L) that, if we apply the envelope
theorem to (8), result in increases in welfare. That is,
                                       PL     ` dw(`)
                        dV               `=0     dc
                                         Q L
                                                               <0
                         dc     1    L+1
                                           `=0 (1 +     (`))

since dw~ (`) =dc < 0 and
                                       PL     ` dw(`)
                        dV               `=0
                                         QL dh                  0
                         dh     1    L+1
                                           `=0 (1 +     (`))

since dw (`) =dh    0 with equality if L = 0. The expressions are only approxi-
mate since L is a discreet variable so the envelope theorem does not apply exactly.
These expressions then imply that welfare always increases with improvements of ICT
independently of the source (unless L = 0 in which case welfare is unaltered).
  Even though the e¤ect of ICT on welfare is to unambiguously increase it, the same
is not necessarily true for growth. Note that welfare could be increased by consuming
more early and investing less in the future, as the future is discounted because of the
standard reasons and, as we argue above, limits to the appropiability of technology.
However, this is never the case for reductions in the cost of acquiring information c.
As Figure 7, where we …x h = :8; illustrates, a reduction in c leads to shorter cycles
and less organization, but faster growth. A reduction of c makes organization less
necessary as acquiring information is cheaper and so agents acquire more. Hence,
the number of layers of organization built to exploit a technology decreases. Even
though there is less organization in the economy, growth increases as each technology

                                          32
is more valuable since solving problems is more a¤ordable. This increases the value of
present and future technologies which incentivates agents to innovate more since their
innovations will be exploited more e¢ ciently. Note also that if the value of future
innovations is discounted less (or is more appropiable) the growth rate increases.

  Figure 8 shows two examples of the simulations presented in Figure 7. We …x
  = :87 and change c from :9 to :7: Figure 7 shows how the value function increases
almost proportionally as we decrease c, but the maximum number of layers decreases
as organization is less useful since knowledge is cheaper. As c decreases investments
in innovation increase in all periods although innovations are accumulated for less
periods as the technology cycles are shorter. The net e¤ect is an increase in the
growth rate as can be seen in the upper-right panel. Note how reductions in c increase
output per capita almost proportionally given a technology.

  The e¤ect of changes of communication technology on growth is more complicated.
The main reason is that a reduction in h changes the output per capita extracted from
a given technology more, the more organized is the technology. That is, the more
heavily intensive is the exploitation of technology on communication. Hence, when
agents are self-employed and there is no organization, changes in h do not a¤ect out-
put per capita. Figure 9 illustrates the e¤ect of reductions of h on growth. Note that
reductions in h increase the length of technology cycles and the use of organization
when communication costs a high. This is intuitive, as smaller communication costs
imply that building organizations is less costly. Agents can leverage their knowledge
more, since they can deal with more problems as their span of control increases. How-
ever, as technology can be exploited more e¢ ciently because building organizations is
cheaper, the value of current and future technologies increases. On the one hand, in-
creases in the value of present technologies reduce the incentives to innovate. On the

                                                                   34
other, increases in the value of future technologies increase the incentives to innovate.
Note however, that since value is added by building larger organizations, the e¤ects
on future technologies are discounted more. So if is small, the increase in the value
of the present technology dominates, reduces investments in innovation and decreases
growth. In contrast if                 is large, the second e¤ect dominates and the increase in the
value of future technologies leads to more innovation and growth.8 Figure 9 shows
that reductions in h can reduce the length of the cycles if h is small (we let c = 0:9).
This is because when h is small the value of organizing is concentrated more heavily
in the …rst few layers.

e¤ect of a reduction in communication costs when appropiability is high and when
appropiability is low. It is clear from the picture that h does not a¤ect wages in the
…rst period, as we argued above. It is also clear that for both ’s, investments in
innovation are higher when h is high. However, agents also invest for fewer periods.
The total accumulated e¤ect is larger for lower h only when appropiability is high.

  This exercise illustrates what we believe is an important point about the e¤ect
of communication technology on growth. Communication technology can improve
current technology and perpetuate its use for longer as it makes organization more
e¢ cient. This will increase welfare but reduce growth if appropiability is low. Hence,
what the model tells us is that countries where technology markets are not well
developed and appropiability is low or de…cient will experience negative e¤ect of
improvements in communication technology on their growth rates. However, as they
improve communication technology, their technology cycles will eventually become

shorter and growth will start to increase.

3.2. Stagnation

  As we discussed in the previous section, there are cases in which economies stag-
nates as agents decide optimally not to invest in innovation. The reason is that agents
prefer to extract more from the current technology in the near future through the de-
velopment of organizations than to invest and innovate in the long term. Building
organizations takes time and so there is a trade-o¤ between exploiting technologies
better and long term innovation.
  It is easy to understand the e¤ect of              on the possibility of stagnation. Clearly, the
higher    the larger the set of parameters for which the economy will stagnate. This
can be seen from the fact that the value of an agent in period zero is decreasing in
for all …nite L; namely,
                                     PL
                                         `=0 (w(`)
                                             `                 (`)2 )

                                                 QL
                                                     `=0 (1+    (`))
                                                                        <0
                                                 d
                                                                                   P1      `
by the envelope theorem but the value of never switching, given by                   `=0       w (`) is
independent of c:
  The e¤ect of the other three parameters is more complicated and cannot be signed
analytically so we proceed with numerical simulations. Figure 11 shows a graph
similar to Figure 7 but for a range of c’s that includes larger values and for smaller
values of . As in Figure 7 we can see that a larger c implies a lower growth rate:
The cost of acquiring knowledge has a negative e¤ect on growth. However, now the
Figure also illustrates how there is a threshold of c over which economic growth drops
to zero. Further increases in the cost of knowledge have no e¤ect on growth that stays
at zero. That is, numerically we …nd a threshold for c over which there is stagnation.
The lower panel of Figure 11 shows how the number of layers explodes to in…nity
as we approximate the threshold. 9 The logic for this result is straightforward.
As c increases knowledge acquisition becomes more expensive which implies that
organization becomes more useful to exploit technologies: Agents want to leverage
knowledge more since knowledge is more costly. However, as agents increase the
    9
      We calculate the equilibrium allowing for a maximum of 100 layers. If the value function is
strictly increasing for all 100 layers we set L = 1 and the growth rate to zero.

                                                     37
number of layers to leverage their knowledge, they also push back the date at which
innovations would happen and so investing in innovation becomes less attractive. At
some point the gains from innovation are so low (given that it will happen only in the
very long run and agents discount the future) that it is better to keep exploiting the
current technology. Of course, the more agents discount the future (or the less they
can appropriate the value of innovation) the less valuable are future innovations and
so the lower the threshold of c for which the economy stagnates.
  This exercise as well as the one in the previous subsection indicates how in our
model the growth rate of an economy and the cost of acquiring knowledge are related.
However, the model also indicates why, in a cross-section of countries with di¤erent
c’s, output, knowledge acquisition and investments in innovation are not perfectly
correlated.

obtain stagnation is more complicated. The reason is, essentially, the non-monotone
e¤ect of h on the length of the technology cycle. For large values of h the maximum
number of layers organized for a given technology is relatively low as the span of
control of agents is small (and therefore their ability to leverage their knowledge
through organizations). For small values of h the value of creating the …rst layers of
organization is so large, that it is more valuable to keep innovating and organizing only
these …rst set of expertise markets. For intermediate values of h the e¤ect the number
of layer is large as organization is useful because spans of controls are relatively large
but the di¤erence between the value of the …rst and later layers is not large enough
to want to only organize the …rst layers and innovate quickly. Hence, it is for the
intermediate values of h for which the number of layers might explode and we can
obtain a stagnating economy. This is illustrated in Figure 12 which parallels Figure 8
but includes lower values of the discount factor or appropiability level . The …gure
shows how as we decrease the set of values of h for which we obtain appropiability
increases. As we have argued, and as the lower panel shows, these are the parameter
values for which L = 1.
  The welfare e¤ects still hold. Decreases in h always increase welfare in this econ-
omy, independently of whether the economy stagnates or not. However, h will a¤ect
the growth rate dramatically. Communication technology is a technology to exploit
today’s and future’s technologies, and the cost of using it is that it takes time since
society has to organize these markets for expertise. If this technology is good, but
not great, the value of organizing many of these markets is very large and so society
prefers to do that than to invest in innovations that will bene…t output only in the
very far future. But how can an economy with zero growth maximize welfare? The
key is that we are maximizing welfare from today’s perspective of an in…nitely lived
agent (or a dynasty of two period lived agents). These agents value a lot the sav-
ings from not investing in innovation today and value little the fact that output per
capita does not go up in the future. So, in this economy, stagnation is a choice of
the country’s ancestors. Current agents do not change the choice because the level of
technology is too low relative to output (given the large organizations) to start invest-
ing in innovation; it would take too long (or it would be too expensive) to improve
the alternative technology enough to make a technological switch valuable.

  Our view is supported by two main stylized facts.10 First, radical innovations of-
ten take place outside existing …rms. Second, successful …rms grow fast …rst but
their growth slows down as their innovation is exploited. Consider the …rst one. If
organizations are about acquiring knowledge, and knowledge is technology speci…c,
we expect radical innovation to take place outside of existing organizations and to
replace them. Casual observation is consistent with this, as the examples in the in-
troduction suggest. Microsoft, Apple, E-Bay and Google, are all recent examples of
  10
     The two following stylized facts concerns …rms; our model is broader than that, as it applies
to organizations mediated through markets, as well as …rms. Firm birth and growth is easier to
measure than the birth and growth of specialized consultants and experts in related technologies,
and that is why this is the evidence that exists. To the extent that changes inside …rms and outside
are correlated, the evidence is still illuminating.

new and large organizations that started small, have grown, and have replaced the old
large organizations. An expression of this phenomenon are the famous stories (such
as Hewlett-Packard) where founders (in HP’s case, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard)
developed the idea that was the germ of a large …rm in their garage. Some systematic
evidence in this respect is provided by a study by Rebecca Henderson (1993), where
she shows that, in the photolitographic equipment industry (producing pieces of capi-
tal equipment to manufacture solid-state semiconductors), each stage of technological
change was brought about by a new set of …rms. Table 1, taken from her work, shows
the evolution of market shares of …rms in this market as the technology changed.

   Second, …rm growth is fast as the new innovation takes place and slows down as
it is exploited. Figure 14 presents evidence on …rm sizes over time for a collection
of Fortune 500 high-tech …rms in the US (see also Luttmer, 1997). The data on
the natural logarithm of the total number of employees in these …rms comes from
Compustat and includes all employees (domestic and foreign). The period depicted
is governed by data availability and the initial period in which these …rms became
public. It is clear from the graph that the growth rate of these …rms is decreasing
over time.

  A third fact consistent with our theory is the existence of long run technological
cycles. The existence of such cycles (longer than business cycles) in the data has
been long documented (e.g. Schumpeter (1939)). In what Granger (1966) called the
‘typical spectral shape’, the data shows ‘technological’(Kondratie¤ (40-60 years) and
Kuznets (20 to 30 years)) cycles. This same patterns extend to our times.11 The
model also predicts that the technological cycle of output per hour should coincide
with the cycle of organizational size. This seems to be the case for the manufacturing
sector if we use average …rm size data to proxy for the size of organizations as Figure
14, which uses data from the Historical Statistics of the United States, illustrates.12
  11
     In a previous version of the paper, we used GDP per hour in the non-farm private sector from
1889 to 2000, from the Historical Statistics of the United States, Millennial Edition, and calculated
the linear trend of log wages, as well as the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) …lter with parameter 100 to
remove the very low frequency component. The di¤erence between both served to compute the long
run cycles in the data. We identi…ed three long term technological cycles. A large one at the turn of
the century. A relatively small one in the middle of the century and a very large one in the second
half. The one in the second half is related to what has been called the productivity slowdown. In
the last part of the 90’s we seem to be moving to a new technological cycle.

     We calculate a ’technology’cycle as the di¤erence between the linear and HP (100) trends for
a output per hour and as the HP (100) trend for …rm size (since the model implies no long term
growth in the size of organizations).

  Change is a fundamental aspect of growth. Growth is not a smooth continuous
process of accumulation. As the ‘new growth literature’ has recognized, it involves
the creation and destruction of products and, as we underscore, of organizations.
Each new idea requires a particular type of knowledge, and new organizations — with
experts in the relevant sets of knowledge— gradually emerge to exploit this knowl-
edge. When technology is revolutionized, knowledge becomes obsolete and so do the
organizations that have developed to allocate it and exploit the existing technology.
Our paper provides a new framework to think about this process. We distinguish be-
tween the accumulation of knowledge about how to use the existing technology more
productively, which we term, following Schumpeter ‘exploitation’ and the develop-
ment of new technologies through innovation. Exploitation of existing technologies
takes place within existing organizations. As organizations grow by adding more hi-
erarchical layers, they steadily improve the e¢ ciency of the allocation of agents in
production. Radical innovation makes existing knowledge, and organizations, obso-


                                                                                   43
lete. Decreases in communication costs that allow for the establishment of deeper
hierarchies permit more exploitation of existing knowledge and may increase the rate
of innovation. However, by making exploitation more attractive, they may also, if
agents don’t value the future enough, decrease the rate of growth, even to the extent
of stopping the growth process altogether.
  We view our analysis as the start of an e¤ort to understand, at a deeper micro-
economic level, the use of the labor input usually introduced in aggregate production
functions. What matters for development is not how many units of labor are used,
but how these units are organized, and how this changes over time. The dynamics in
our theory are due to the di¢ culty of building up organizations and of acquiring the
relevant pieces of complementary knowledge. Or, in other words, the dynamics are
the result of the di¢ culty of forming markets so that agents can sell their specialize
knowledge and buy the knowledge of others. We believe that, in a world where
the sources of growth are the creativity and the ideas of individuals, rather than
raw materials and capital, understanding the way individuals organize to produce is
fundamental to our understanding of the observed income di¤erences across countries.
  An interesting avenue for future research concerns the dynamics of switching to
entirely new technologies. In our analysis, given that agents are homogeneous, all
agents switch at the same time. An analysis with heterogeneous agents would bring
about deeper, game theoretical, considerations to the switching decision that may
be of interest. Agents need to form expectations on when and who will switch to
new technologies; such expectations will a¤ect their own investment paths and the
moment of their own switching. We believe our framework is simple and ‡exible
enough to permit an analysis of such issues.
  Our analysis studies a one good economy, and thus when a radical innovation is
introduced all the existing knowledge, and the existing organization, is made obsolete.
Clearly, this is an extreme conclusion. While it is quite reasonable that the develop-
ment of the automobiles wiped out the stagecoach industry, it is clearly not the case,
in a multi-good economy, that all existing …rms disappear. Thus another avenue for
future research may generalize the model to a world with di¤erentiated commodities,
which would yield a smoother prediction.
  Finally, our theory has a range of empirical implications that may be tested. First,


                                          44
our model predicts that long term cycles in output should be related to long term cy-
cles in organization, and speci…cally (to the extent organizations and …rms coincide)
in average …rm size. When a new technology appears, we should see fast productivity
growth and a drop in average …rm size. As the technology is exploited, …rm size
should grow and productivity should slow down. Second, our theory has implications
for the impact of ICT on the growth rate and shape of organizations. The extent
to which di¤erent economies exploit available technologies by organizing in complex
organizations is mediated by communication technology, the cost of acquiring knowl-
edge, and the distribution of problems faced in production.       Any change in these
parameters will change the number of periods that a technology is used, the aver-
age (over time) size of these organizations, as well as the output level and growth rate
in the economy.    We leave for future research the investigation of the relationship
between information technology, organization and growth.
