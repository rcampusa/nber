                                            ABSTRACT

This paper presents novel evidence and analysis of the relationship between temperature and income.
First, using sub-national data from 12 countries in the Americas, we provide new evidence that the
negative cross-country relationship between temperature and income also exists within countries and
even within states. Second, we provide a theoretical framework for reconciling the substantial, negative
association between temperature and income in the cross-section with the even stronger short-run effects
of temperature estimated by panel models. The theoretical framework suggests that half of the negative
short-term effects of temperature may be offset in the long run through adaptation.

       It has long been observed that hot countries tend to be poor. A correlation between heat

and poverty was noted as early as Montesquieu (1750) and Huntington (1915), and it has been

repeatedly demonstrated in contemporary data (e.g. Nordhaus 2006). Looking at a cross-section

of the world in the year 2000, national income per-capita falls 8.5% per degree Celsius rise in

temperature (see Table 2 below). In fact, temperature alone can explain 23% of the variation in

cross-country income today.

       Despite the strength of this correlation, substantial debate continues over whether

climatic factors can explain contemporary economic activity, or whether other correlated

variables, such as a country’s institutions or trade policy, drive prosperity in contemporary times,

leaving no important role for geography (see, e.g., Sachs 2003; Acemoglu, Johnson and

Robinson 2002; Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi 2004). Given the small number of countries in

the world, and the many ways in which they vary, conclusively answering these questions using

cross-sectional, cross-country regressions is challenging.

       This paper offers two new insights into the climate-income relationship. First, we

provide novel cross-sectional evidence by considering the temperature-income relationship not

just using cross-country data but also using sub-national data at the municipal level for 12

countries in the Americas. Remarkably, we find that a negative relationship between income and

temperature exists when looking within countries, and even when looking within states within

countries. The within-country cross-sectional relationship is substantially weaker than the cross-

country correlation, but it remains statistically significant and of an economically important

magnitude, with a 1 degree C rise in temperature associated with a 1.2-1.9% decline in municipal

per-capita income. The fact that the cross-sectional relationship holds within countries, as well

as between countries, suggests that omitted country characteristics are not wholly driving the

cross-sectional relationship between temperature and income. 2

        Second, we provide a theoretical framework for reconciling these strong cross-sectional

effects of temperature with the even stronger short-run effects of temperature shown in panel

models. In related work (Dell, Jones, and Olken 2008; henceforth DJO), we build a climate and

income panel at the country-year level and examine what happens to the national growth path

when countries have unusually hot or cold years. The primary finding in DJO (2008) is that, in

poor countries over the 1950-2003 period, a 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature in a given year

reduced economic growth in that year by 1.1 percentage points. Moreover, the estimated

temperature effects over 10 or 15-year time horizons are similar to the annual panel estimate,

suggesting that these effects represent changes to growth rates, rather than level effects on

income. These temperature effects on growth are sufficiently large that, in the absence of

offsetting forces, they would quickly produce a much steeper relationship than we actually see

between temperature and income: if an extra 1 degree C reduces growth by 1.1 percentage

points, then it would take only 8 years of sustained temperature differences to explain the overall

cross-sectional relationship between temperature and income observed in the world today.

        To reconcile the cross-sectional and panel results, we consider a simple theory that

emphasizes two forces, adaptation and convergence, and shows how the causative estimate of the

temperature-growth effect in DJO (2008) can be reconciled with the long-run temperature-

income findings. The estimates suggest that, in the cross-country context, adaptation offsets

about half of the negative effects of higher temperatures.

  Albouy (2008) similarly finds a negative correlation between temperature and firm productivity within the United
States.

          To examine the temperature-income relationship at the sub-national level, we use

municipal-level labor income data for 12 countries in the Western Hemisphere, as constructed

from household surveys by Acemoglu and Dell (forthcoming). 3 To make the data comparable

across municipalities and countries, Acemoglu and Dell account for regional price dispersion and

adjust each country’s wage data so that it averages to GDP per worker in constant international

dollars, taken from the 2003 Penn World Tables.

          We use all countries in the Acemoglu and Dell dataset where the labor income data can

be geo-referenced to a municipality, and merge this data with climate and geography data. The

list of countries in the dataset, along with summary statistics, are shown in Table 1. Climate data

are at 30 arc second resolution (approximately 1 km) and averaged over the 1950-2000 period, as

calculated by Hijmans et al. (2005). Country-level climate variables aggregate the municipal-

level variables, weighting by 2000 municipal population. Details can be found in the appendix.

B. Results

          Using this data, we estimate the cross-sectional relationship between climate variables –

mean temperature and mean precipitation levels – and log income, i.e.

    (1)                                                                        ′


where LOGY is the mean log labor income, r represents a region, m represents a municipality,

and X represents other geographic variables. We estimate equation (1) using OLS. Standard

errors are calculated clustering observations by state (shown in parentheses) and, alternatively,

using corrections for spatial correlation (Conley 1999) (shown in brackets) 4 .

          The results from estimating equation (1) are presented in Table 2. As a benchmark, we

3
 Acemoglu and Dell focus on labor income since the errors in reporting are less severe than for total income.

 The Conley covariance matrix is a weighted average of spatial autocovariances, where the weights are the product
of Bartlett kernels in two dimensions (North/South and East/West). They start at one and decline linearly to zero
when a pre-specified cut point is reached. We choose the cutoff in both dimensions to be one degree (approximately
100 kilometers); choosing other cut points produces qualitatively similar results.

                                                        4
begin in column (1) of Table 2 with a cross-country regression for the whole world. Specifically,

we use all 134 countries in the DJO (2008) sample, and calculate LOGY as log GDP per capita

from the Penn World Tables. This regression shows that each additional 1 degree C is associated

with a statistically significant reduction of 8.5 percentage points of per-capita GDP. In Column

(2), we limit the sample to the 12 countries in our labor income dataset shown in Table 1. The

point estimate for the effect of temperature remains virtually unchanged at 8.9 percentage points

of per-capita GDP per degree C, although with only 12 data points the standard errors increase

substantially and the result is no longer statistically significant.

        In column (3), we switch to our labor income data set. Column (3) examines the same set

of countries as column (2) but at the municipality level. We regress mean municipal labor

income on municipal temperature and precipitation, and add additional geographic controls for

elevation, slope, and the distance from the municipality to the sea. The temperature coefficient is

-0.085 log points, which is virtually identical to the coefficient using country-level data, and is

now statistically significant with standard errors either clustered by state or corrected for spatial

correlation. Remarkably, the five explanatory variables in this regression – temperature,

precipitation, elevation, slope, and distance to the sea – explain 61 percent of the variation in

municipal income across these 12 countries.

        Columns (4) and (5) examine the relationship between temperature and income within

countries. In column (4), we add country fixed effects. The point estimate falls substantially to -

0.012 but remains statistically significant; that is, a 1 degree C increase in temperature is

associated with a 1.2% decline in labor income. Remarkably, when we add state fixed effects in

column (5), so that we are using only variation in temperatures within individual states, the point

estimate on temperature remains very similar to the estimate with country fixed effects (at -



                                                    5
0.019) and is significant when using spatial standard errors. 5 These results confirm that the

cross-sectional relationship between temperature and income holds within countries, as well as

across countries, though the relationship is substantially smaller in magnitude within countries

than across countries.

II.      Theory: Adaptation and Convergence

         In this section we consider means of reconciling the long-run cross-sectional

relationships documented in Section I with the short-run growth effects of temperature estimated

in DJO (2008). As discussed above, DJO (2008) use panel data to show that a poor country’s

growth in a given year is 1.1 percentage points lower when its temperature is 1 degree Celsius

higher that year. Moreover, as discussed in that paper, the persistent effect of temperature

shocks suggests that temperature affects the growth rate, not simply the level of income, at least

over 10 to 15 year time horizons.

         To reconcile these large growth effects of temperature with the more modest (though still

substantial) long-run cross-sectional relationship between temperature and income, we consider

two mechanisms: convergence and adaptation. First, convergence forces may pull lagging

countries and regions toward the frontier. Convergence effects offset temperature effects, so that

convergence limits the cross-sectional income differences that can be sustained. If rates of

convergence are larger within countries than across them, then the long-run effect of climate will

be more muted within countries than across them. While data on within-country convergence for

much of the world is limited, faster within than across country convergence is consistent with the

smaller income variance within countries and is natural given greater opportunities for migration,

 A state is defined as the first administrative level political unit below the central government. In Brazil, Mexico,
and the United States, the term for these political units is state, whereas in other countries they are alternatively
called departments or provinces. See the appendix for maps of the state boundaries.

public good provision, transfers, and idea exchange within countries. 6

          Second, over longer periods, regions may adapt to their climate. The panel growth

estimates reflect responses to climate shocks. To the extent that individuals adjust their behavior

to permanent temperature changes, e.g. by switching to more appropriate crops, industries, and

technologies and by migrating away from difficult environments altogether, the short-run

estimates may be larger than the longer-run response.

          To fix ideas, imagine that growth in per-capita income proceeds as

    (2)
                                                                                                                       0

where              is the log per-capita income in geographic area i at time t,                  is the

temperature in area i at time t,        is the average temperature level in area i, and                     is the

relevant frontier level of income to which the area converges. 7 The parameter                      captures the

causative short-run effect of temperature shocks on growth, as would be identified in a panel

specification such as DJO (2008). The parameter                captures the degree of adaptation over the

long-run to average temperature levels, potentially offsetting the short-run temperature effects.

The parameter            0,1 captures the rate of convergence. We further assume that all countries

start, in antiquity at time zero, with the same level of per-capita income,                     0         for all i.

Note that since equation (2) applies to all countries, including country *,

                     .

          Integrating the differential equation (2) with the initial condition and taking expectations,

we have

  Note that within-country studies do not show faster rates of convergence, though estimates vary substantially
depending on methodology (e.g. see Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) versus Higgins, Levy, and Young (2006)).
7
  Note that while (2) is a very simple description of growth, it departs from the usual neoclassical assumption, where
all countries have the same growth rate in total factor productivity, and convergence drives countries not towards a
distribution of income, but to a common income level. We model growth in (2) to accommodate the empirical
finding of DJO (2008), where temperature affects the growth rate (e.g. the ability to invent or absorb new ideas).

(This derivation is shown formally in the appendix.) Therefore, in the long run as                 ∞, the

cross-sectional relationship between income and temperature is

    (4)


          Equation (4) is an equation with four unknowns, and we have estimates for three of them.

The left-hand side of (4) is the cross-sectional regression parameter in the regression of income

on temperature; i.e.,          .085 in a cross-country context and               .012 in a within-country

context (see Table 2). As discussed above, the short-run growth coefficient is approximately

          .011 (DJO 2008). The convergence parameter, much analyzed in the growth literature, is

typically estimated in the cross-country context in the range               . 02, .10 (Barro and Sala-i-

Martin 1995; Caselli et al. 1996).

A. The Convergence Mechanism

          We first consider turning off the adaptation channel (setting            0 in (4)) to examine the

implications of convergence alone. In this setting, reconciling the short-run and long-run

temperature effects is achieved when              / . In a cross-country context, this requires

      .129 . . .011/ .085 , which appears somewhat high given estimates in the literature.

At a within-country level, we have no panel estimate of the short-run growth effect . If one

applies the cross-country estimate of , then we require               .917 . . .011/ .012 . While it

is reasonable that convergence rates might be substantially higher in a within-country context,

this estimate appears extremely high. 8 These calculations suggest that adaptation is likely to be

important in reconciling the data.

8
 For example, in developed countries (US, Japan, Europe) Barro and Sala-I-Martin estimate within-country
convergence coefficients of approximately 0.02 – 0.03.

                                                       8
B. The Adaptation Mechanism

         Over the long run, areas may adapt to difficult geographic conditions. Technologies,

skills, and physical capital can all be tailored to a given climatic regime. Moreover, population

can react, either through fertility, death rates, or migration, thus altering the local per-capita

intensity of the factors of production.

         We now relax the strong assumption of no adaptation (                  0 , and instead estimate

using our findings for       and , and a chosen convergence rate, . Rearranging (4) shows that

              . In the cross-country context, taking a middle-of-the-road convergence rate of

       .06 yields an estimate of         .0059. This suggests that 54% of the short-run effect is offset

in the long-run, so that the long-run growth rate effect of being 1 degree C warmer is

    .0051, or half of one percentage point per annum.

         In the within-country context, there is more uncertainty, both because the short-run

within-country growth effect has not been estimated in panel data and because the convergence

rate may be greater. If we apply the country-level panel estimate of                      .011 and take the

upper-bound cross-country convergence estimate of                    .10 internally, we find          .0098, so

that 89% of the short-run growth effect is offset within countries. Thus if the short-run growth

estimate was the same within countries as between countries, there would be an even larger role

for adaptation within countries than between countries. 9

C. The Omitted Variable Interpretation

         A typical objection to the cross-country temperature-income relationship is that it may be

driven by omitted variables. However, the findings of DJO (2008) suggest a substantial,

causative effect of temperature on growth for poor countries, and the above analysis shows how
9
  For example, prices can offset productivity shocks, such as those due to temperature. To the extent that markets
are more integrated within countries than across countries, the price adaptation mechanism may offset the effects of
temperature differences more completely within countries.

                                                         9
these growth effects can be reconciled with the cross-sectional evidence. One may then ask: is

there still no role for omitted variables in the cross-section? In fact, the same framework above

allows one to assess the role of such omitted variables; mathematically, omitted variables are

analogous to the       adaptation parameter. To see this, we can write the growth process as

     (5)
                                                                                                     0

where        is a vector of omitted variables that influence growth and also happen to be correlated

with average temperature,          .

           However, for omitted variables to reconcile the cross-section and panel estimates without

any role for adaptation, the omitted variables would need to have strongly positive effects on

growth in high temperature countries. That is, very hot countries (such as the Saharan countries

Chad, Mauritania, and Niger) would need to have characteristics that are making them grow

faster than they otherwise would. Cases where this omitted variable story seems plausible are the

Persian Gulf states, which are extremely hot but grow through large oil resources. However,

even if we drop these states the world cross-sectional coefficient β rises only to -0.097, and the

implied adaptation coefficient ρ is still 0.0036, so omitted variables would still need to be very

positive in other hot countries to reconcile the data without some adaptation being present. 10

           From the perspective of future climate change, the omitted variable interpretation of the

cross-section suggests worse effects of future warming than the adaptation interpretation of the

cross-section. With omitted variables, the long-run effect of warming on the income distribution

is / , which is substantially more negative than the long-run effect under adaptation, which is

           / . DJO (2008) emphasize an adaptation view and thus provide a lower-bound type of

10
  It is also possible that omitted variables are more substantial in a cross-country setting than a within country-
setting. This could help reconcile the milder income-temperature relationship within countries with the sharper
relationship across countries without relying on different adaptation or convergence rates.

III.      Conclusion

          This paper provides new evidence on the relationship between temperature and income.

Using sub-national data from 12 countries in the Americas, we show that the negative cross-

sectional relationship between temperature and income exists within countries, as well as across

countries. We then provide a theoretical framework for reconciling the substantial, negative

association between temperature and income in cross-section with the even stronger short-run

effects of temperature shown in panel models. The theoretical framework suggests that half of

the negative short-term effects of temperature are offset in the long run through adaptation.

Notes: The dependent variable in columns (1) – (2) is the log of GDP per capita in 2000 (Heston et al., 2006) and in
columns (3) through (5) is the log of mean municipality labor income (Acemoglu and Dell, 2009). Columns (3)
through (5) are weighted by the number of observations in the municipality. Robust standard errors, clustered by
state in columns (3) through (5), are reported in parentheses, and Conley standard errors are reported in brackets.
