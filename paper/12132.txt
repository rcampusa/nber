                                             ABSTRACT

Despite the conceptual differences between for-profit and non-profit firms stressed in conventional
economic analyses of the non-profit sector, U.S. antitrust law generally does not distinguish between
these two organizational forms. This paper argues that the same incentives to restrain trade exist in
the non-profit sector as in the for-profit sector. Altruistic firms benefit from exploiting market power,
just as non-altruistic ones do, even when they would price below cost without regard to competition.
Therefore, promoting competition is socially valuable regardless of the particular objectives of
producers, and the fact that antitrust law does not distinguish between the two sectors is efficient.

Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                          2
   The legal definition of a not-for-profit (NFP) enterprise is that it enjoys an exemption from

taxation and at the same time operates under a nondistribution constraint—that is, any surplus of

revenues over expenses cannot be distributed as profits to the firm’s “owners.” Much economic

activity nowadays occurs in the NFP sector of the economy. Even when the sector is defined nar-

rowly, as we shall do in this paper, as comprising only charitable nongovernmental enterprises

(thus excluding government corporations such as Amtrak and the Postal Service, public universi-

ties and hospitals, and worker, business, and consumer cooperatives), it is estimated to produce

one-fifth of all U.S. R&D, much of the economy’s human capital that is not produced by on-the-

job training, many cultural products and services, and much of the nation’s health care, which

alone accounts for about one-sixth of all U.S. economic activity. About a fifth of all U.S. corpo-

rations are incorporated under NFP statutes.

    A substantial amount of antitrust activity 1 occurs in the NFP sector. Table 1 presents data on

federal antitrust activity since 1980 in the health care industry, the largest industry in the sector 2 .

    If the pharmaceutical industry, which is entirely for-profit, is excluded, almost a third of the

antitrust cases in the health-care industry involved NFPs. This is due in part to the fact that the

community hospital industry, the most important industry in the NFP sector, recently experi-

enced a merger wave. There were about a thousand mergers in the industry in the 1990s, an in-

dustry consisting of about five thousand hospitals of which about 60% are not-for profit. 3

    Conventional economic analysis of the NFP sector 4 sharply distinguishes between the for-

profit (FP) and NFP forms, which might seem to imply that the behavior of the two sectors is

sufficiently different to warrant different antitrust treatment. It has been argued that non-profits

solve an asymmetric information problem between donors (who cannot readily monitor the pro-

vision of the services that they wish to promote) and the providers of those services 5 and have

different, altruistic objectives from profit-maximizing firms. 6 In either case, the fact that NFP

firms do not distribute profits for private gain has persuaded some judges and scholars that non-

profit firms may not be as interested in exploiting market power as for-profit firms are assumed

to be. 7 Other judges and scholars have questioned that analysis and concluded that there are no

significant differences in behavior of for-profit and not-for-profit firms that would justify a dif-

ference in antitrust treatment. 8

    Yet there is no general antitrust exemption for NFPs. 9 There are three major categories of

antitrust activity in the NFP sector. The first involves trade and professional associations and co-

operatives. Although these entities are usually organized in the NFP form, they are agents of FP

firms and individuals, and the courts sensibly pierce the NFP label and treat them as functionally
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                        4
FP entities. 10 The second class of NFP antitrust cases involves educational institutions charged

with collusion, for example collusion on financial aid to students or collusion on the grant of

rights to broadcast intercollegiate sports events. 11 The third major class of NFP antitrust cases

involves challenges to mergers between NFP hospitals. 12 In the second and third classes, defen-

dants will often argue that their NFP status entitles them either to an outright exemption from

antitrust scrutiny or to a different, more permissive standard of liability. These arguments fail.

Should they? The main efficiency rationale for applying antitrust law to for-profit firms—that it

reduces or eliminates the deadweight loss associated with market power— is equally applicable

to non-profits. Even if producers care about consumers in addition to profits, with the result that

the level of activity of the two types of firm differs—in particular, quantity and quality of output

may be greater for an NFP firm than for an FP firm—the incentive to change that behavior

through collusion, and the adverse social consequences that result from that change, are similar.

Altruism may lower prices but raise mark-ups relative to profit maximization because altruistic

firms benefit from exploiting market power even when this would lead them to price below cost

without regard to competition. For example, although many NFP universities in the US have tui-

tion revenues below operating costs, thereby indicating below-average-cost pricing, some of

these universities have been charged with collusive behavior that violates antitrust law. The im-

portant implication is that promoting competition is socially valuable regardless of the particular

objectives of producers. The fact that antitrust law does not distinguish between the two sectors

is thus consistent with our analysis. Indeed, we show that consumer-oriented antitrust policy may

be more important for consumer-oriented than for conventional profit-maximizing firms in en-

hancing economic welfare.
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                         5
   In addition to arguing that antitrust matters for the non-profit sector, we arrive at the coun-

terintuitive implication that the effects of antitrust enforcement for this sector depend on the be-

havior of firms in the for-profit sector. Non-profit firms receive free capital in the form of dona-

tions, giving them a cost advantage that makes the marginal firms in their industry the for-profit

firms, the firms that therefore drive the industry’s response to policy measures, such as antitrust.

    Our analysis relates to several strands of work on the NFP sector. Although there is a sub-

stantial economic literature on NFP firms, most of it is at the firm rather than the market level

and so does not address issues of competition. 13 There is also an empirical literature on the rela-

tive significance of concentration in raising price in the two sectors, particularly in the hospital

industry, 14 which to date has had mixed results.

I: Restraint of Trade by Monopolies That Do Not Maximize Profits

   For a given level of output y, let π(y) ≡p(y)y-c(y) denote profits where p(y) denotes the in-

verse demand function and c(y) the total cost of production. We assume that the firm is donor-

operated in the sense of being operated by someone who has utility over his own consumption,

m, and output u(m,y). 15 We call this “output preference.” Output preference can arise from an

altruistic concern with consumers, but need not. For example, professors who prefer research

output to maximizing their pecuniary income may favor lower-than-maximum tuition in order to

attract good students, teaching being a complement to research. Donors may give money to hos-

pitals or universities to do research on diseases they have or fear without necessarily being altru-

istic. They seek an in-kind return on their investment, in terms of output, rather than a pecuniary

return, as a for-profit investor would seek. Even donations that seem “purely” altruistic may be

motivated also or instead by desire to signal wealth, culture, or generosity. Our analysis, how-
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                          6
ever, applies regardless of the precise motivation for participating in or contributing to not-for-

profit activities.

      The producer chooses output subject to the constraint that his consumption and costs cannot

exceed unearned income, mo, and revenues earned on productive output

(1)                             m + c(y)= mo + p(y)y.

The output choice thereby induces a utility function over output alone

(2)                             v(y)=u(mo + π(y),y).

Donors forgo their own consumption to fund the activities of non-profit-firms; whatever costs

are not picked up by sales are funded by donations. Donations are equivalent to negative profits.

However, as donors do not give up all of their own consumption, there is always a tradeoff be-

tween profits and output.

      The producer chooses the quantity to produce that will maximize his utility:

(3)                             dv/dy = uc πy + uy = 0 ⇔ -uy /uc = πy .

      The feasible range for the consumption-output tradeoff is determined by the downward-

sloping part of the profit-function. An output-preferring firm will always operate in that region

and thus outproduce a profit-maximizing firm because if he did not, he would be better off ex-

panding both consumption and output. Therefore, output is depicted only for levels, above the

one that maximizes profits, π*=π(y*), at which consumption is maximized. Unlike profit maximi-

zation, where only the budget set is affected by choice of output, the optimal choice for the NFP

equates the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and output to the corresponding

tradeoff in the market, as represented by the declining part of the profit-function. Donations, i.e.,
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                             7
negative profits, are elicited if the output preference is strong enough to bring revenues below the

cost of production. 16

      Rewriting the optimality condition, one obtains a generalized mark-up condition

(4)                            p(1-|ε|)= cy - uy/uc

where ε≡pyy/p is the elasticity of the inverse demand function. This is the standard mark-up

condition adjusted by the marginal rate of substitution, uy/uπ, between profits and output and may

be reinterpreted as a reduction in the cost of production. The optimal price falls, and thus the op-

timal quantity rises, with the willingness of the monopolist to trade profits for output. However,

although price will be lower, markups above competitive prices may be higher. 17 Indeed, optimal

price may involve a mark-down below, as opposed to a mark-up above, costs but at the same

time be reduced by competition more than in the case of profit maximization. Mark-down below

cost occurs when donations finance production to the extent that revenue through sales need not

cover marginal or average costs.

      An illustrative special case is where the producer’s preferences are quasi-linear and the pro-

ducer cares about consumers in terms of their surplus

(5)                            u(m,y)=m + z(s(y))

(6)                            s(y) ≡ ∫ 0≤q≤y [p(q)-p(y)] dq

Substituting in uy=zsp|ε|, the mark-up condition has the compact form

(7)                            p[1-|ε|(1- zs)]= cy

In this case, the marginal rate of substitution between consumer surplus and profits discounts the

negative effect of the demand elasticity on price. This occurs because the gain in surplus from

expanding output by reducing price to infra-marginal consumers, sy=-pyy=p|ε|, confers benefits
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                  8
on a producer who cares about consumers. When the producer does not care about consumers,

i.e., when he maximizes profits as when uy=zs=0, the mark-up condition reduces to the conven-

tional one.

A. Socially Optimal Pricing

      The classic efficiency rationale for antitrust policy under profit maximization is that antitrust

eliminates the deadweight loss associated with monopoly power. There are two components to

this argument. The first is that socially optimal pricing differs from optimal monopoly pricing:

marginal cost pricing is different from the optimal mark-up of price implied by monopoly power.

Second, competition will lead to the socially optimal price: competition implies marginal cost

pricing. This subsection establishes the first result for the case in which the firm does not maxi-

mize profits. The subsequent section establishes the second result for such a firm.

      The output that maximizes social welfare w(y) is comprised of the sum of producer and con-

sumer welfare, w(y)≡v(y)+s(y), satisfies the necessary first-order condition

(8)                             dw/dy=dv/dy + ds/dy = 0

This simple first-order condition illustrates the basic misalignment between producer-surplus and

social-surplus maximization that exists even when firms do not maximize profits. Let yv and yw

denote the output levels that maximize firm utility v and social welfare w respectively. As the

consumer surplus rises with output everywhere, ds/dy > 0, the first-order condition for the so-

cially optimal level of output implies that the producer must lose on the margin by expanding

output farther; dv/dy(yw) < 0, which is in conflict with the first-order condition defining the opti-

mal output from the firm’s own perspective; dv/dy(yv) = 0. Whether producers prefer output to
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                            9
profits or the reverse, the socially optimal level of output will be larger as the firm takes into ac-

count consumer surplus, which rises with output. 18

      This general misalignment between producer welfare and social welfare implies that mar-

ginal cost pricing is not the norm by which social efficiency should be evaluated, as it is in the

case of profit maximization. We derive the socially optimal price by noting that the social wel-

fare function w for a monopolist with preferences u can be reinterpreted as the objective function

of a monopolist with preferences w=u + s. The socially optimal price that satisfies the reinter-

preted monopoly condition is

(9)                            p[1-|ε|]= cy -wy/wc = cy -[uy +sy ]/uc.

Since sy=p|ε|, we can rewrite this condition as

(10)                           p[1-|ε|(1- 1/uc)]= cy -uy/uc.

The socially optimal price discounts the optimal price for the monopolist even though the mo-

nopolist may well care about consumers. This means that the socially optimal price will often be

below cost.

       Consider by way of illustration the case in which the monopolist cares about consumer sur-

plus as much as does about profits:

(11)                           u=π+s

In that case the monopoly price will equal marginal cost, the benchmark competitive price for

efficient for-profit production. But the socially optimal price will involve a discount below cost

(12)                           p(yv)= cy

(13)                           p(yw)= cy/(1+ |ε|)
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                       10
   Thus, even though a supplier may be altruistic, he may not be altruistic enough, when acting

only to satisfy his own desires, to set the socially optimal price. The efficient output requires that

price be set below marginal cost because the producer desires to reduce his own consumption in

order to finance additional output. This implies the counterintuitive but fundamental proposition

that an efficient antitrust policy in the NFP sector should not seek merely to equate price to mar-

ginal cost, because output may be restricted (from a social standpoint) even at that level; the goal

of antitrust in such a case is to force price below marginal cost. 19

B. Competition and Socially Optimal Pricing

       To study the impact of competition on socially optimal pricing, we consider a homogeneous

model of Cournot competition with an inverse demand curve p(Y) for the total quantity of

i=1,2,..n firms; Y=Σ yi. Under the output levels represented by the vector y≡(y1, ..,yn ) the n pro-

ducers are assumed to have utility functions (v1(y), ..,vn(y)) over profits and output, as in

(14)                            vi(y)=u(πi (y),yi)

where πi(y)≡p(Y)yi–c(yi) are the profits of the ith firm under a given vector of output. It is

straightforward to show that the necessary first-order condition is

(15)                            p(1- mi |ε|)=cy-uy/uπ , i=1,2,..,n

where mi≡yi/Y is the market share of the ith firm. As was true for the monopoly case, the first-

order condition is simply a reinterpretation of the condition under profit maximization, with the

costs of production lowered because of output preference.

       If increased competition is defined as an increase in the number of producers, n, the socially

optimal price converges to the efficient price as n goes to infinity by making the market share, m,

of each firm go to zero. This is the generalized result of the case of profit maximization, where
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                       11
perfect competition leads to socially optimal marginal-cost pricing. The key point is that al-

though the levels of output may be more desirable from a consumer perspective under altruism,

induced by the effect of uy/uπ, the change in the behavior induced by market power, caused by

the effect of m, is similar across producer objectives. Competition, the subject of antitrust policy,

is valuable to consumers in both cases even though they may prefer an altruistic producer to a

selfish one.

       This analysis implies a general efficiency rationale for promoting competition regardless of

producer preferences. Competition, whether with profit maximizers or just with other NFP firms,

might drive the price of the altruistic firm’s output to a level so far below cost that the personal

utility loss of the donors exceeded their utility gain from the benefit of the low price to the firm’s

customers. If that were the case, the firm would have an incentive to collude with its competitors

to raise price, albeit not all the way to its costs.

C. The Value of Collusion by Altruistic Producers

       When we consider an oligopoly industry, we discover some important differences from the

monopoly case. Generally, altruistic producers will gain from coordinating their activities be-

cause the behavior of each firm affects the overall utility, as opposed to simply profits, of other

firms. It may be that collusion expands output and raises welfare, rather than restricts output and

lowers welfare, among altruistic producers.

       Under the output levels y≡(y1, ..,yn) among n producers with utility functions (v1(y), ..,vn(y)),

their joint utility is

(16)                             V(y)≡Σ vi(y)=Σ ui(πi (y),y)
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                         12
Note that the utility of each firm is assumed to depend on the entire output vector, including the

outputs of other firms, as would be the case, for example, if some producers cared about aggre-

gate output or consumer surplus. The output levels that are optimal with respect to the industry

satisfy the necessary first-order conditions

(17)                            dV/dyj=Σ dvi(y)/dyj = [(duj/dπ)(dπj/dyj)+ duj/dyj ] +

                                                           Σi≠j[(dui/dπ)(dπi/dyj)+ dui/dyj ] = 0

The first bracketed term is the marginal conditions for the jth firm when expanding its output.

The second term consists of the external effects on other firms from that output expansion. This

second external effect has two offsetting parts: the negative impact on profits induced by a lower

price and the positive impact that extra output has on other firms that value output. Whether the

net externality is negative or positive determines whether collusion produces less or more output

than the private equilibrium. The more altruistic firms are, as measured by the marginal rate of

substitution between output and profits, the more likely it is that the positive external effect will

dominate.

       To illustrate, consider a homogeneous constant-returns industry with a constant elasticity of

demand in which aggregate output is valued according to

(18)                            ui=πi + αY.

In this case the relative size of the socially optimal output from the industry’s perspective, Ys,

differs from the output of a private (Nash) equilibrium, Yp, satisfies

(19)                            ln Ys/Yp=-(1/|ε|)[ (c-α)(1-|ε|/n)/(c-nα)(1-|ε|)]
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                              13
It follows that the ratio rises in altruism α. In particular, the social optimum goes from being be-

low the private optimum at low levels of altruism, Ys/Yp < 1 for low α, to being above it for high

levels of altruism.

    So in industries in which it is clear that the value of output expansion is more important than

the cost of price reductions, such as industries in which output is sold at zero price, there is social

value in collusion to reduce free-riding. For example, welfare organizations should be allowed to

divide markets geographically in order to serve the largest possible poor population. But when

the NFP firm cares only about firm-level, rather than industry-level, output, collusion will restrict

output and should be forbidden. This situation is evidenced by firm-specific, as distinct from in-

dustry-wide, donations, such as alumni donations to universities or patient donations to hospitals.

In contrast, when donations are industry-wide, as in donations to organizations like United Way

or the Red Cross, collusion may expand output.

    Regardless of whether a firm has an incentive to collude with its competitors in restricting or

expanding output, it will often have an incentive to collude with its competitors to lower the

price of its inputs through the exercise of monopsony power. Utility-maximizing firms always

prefer lower costs. Indeed, the most common type of collusion in the NFP sector, is probably

monopsonistic, as in avoiding competition to “buy” minority students or student athletes. Until

challenged by an antitrust suit, the Ivy League colleges colluded to deny scholarships based on

merit rather than need in order to increase scholarships for minority students without a net in-

crease in scholarship expense. 20 The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a consor-

tium of nonprofit colleges and universities, appears to operate much like a conventional cartel
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                           14
designed in this case to reduce the cost of student athletes. 21 The welfare effects are presumably

the same as with other monopsonies.

D. The Welfare Loss of Altruistic Restraint of Trade

   Although we have argued that the standard rationale for antitrust—the avoidance of dead-

weight loss—generalizes to NFPs, one may suspect that the deadweight loss created by them

would be small compared to that created by firms interested only in higher profits. After all, if a

producer cares about consumers, the loss he imposes on them should be smaller than if he does

not care. However, our analysis produces the counterintuitive result that often monopolization is

more harmful when done by altruistic producers than when done by profit-maximizing firms.

   Consider an altruistic producer with preferences u(mo+π(y),y; α) parameterized by the degree

of output-preference α. If we denote the monopolistic and competitive outputs by yM(α) and

yC(α) respectively, then the welfare loss, L(α), is

(20)                           L(α)≡ ∫ yM(α)≤q≤ yC(α) [p(q)-p(yC(α))] dq.

Altruism has two effects on the welfare loss brought about by monopolization. The first is

through the reduction in output brought about by monopolization, the second through its effect

on the average surplus lost as a result of that reduction. Altruism will often entail larger losses of

output, and these losses will occur further down the inverse demand curve, because the altruist’s

output is often larger than a profit-maximizing firm’s output. Therefore, unless the inverse de-

mand curve is highly convex, so that the average surplus lost is larger when lost at low levels of

output, altruism will increase the welfare loss from monopolization. Even though the effects of

altruism on output are positive, market power may be more damaging under altruism.
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                       15
   To illustrate, consider the case in which demand curves are linear, p(y) = a - by, and the al-

truist has the quasi-linear preferences u(π,y;α)=π+αy. In this case, the monopoly output will be

half the competitive output and the monopoly price halfway up the demand curve from the com-

petitive price:

(21)                           yC - yM = yM =[a - (c - α)]/2b

(22)                           pM – pC = [a - (c - α)]/2.

These price and quantity effects imply that the deadweight loss is

(23)                           L(α)= [yC - yM][pM - pC]/2 =(1/4b)[a - (c - α)]2

In this case, both the output lost and the average surplus lost by excluded consumers increase

with altruism, so that altruism has a positive effect on deadweight loss, dL/dα >0. 22

       More generally, the positive impact of altruism on the efficiency loss from market power

comes from the fact that altruistic firms act as if they have lower costs, and the efficiency loss

caused by market power tends to decrease with costs.

E. Multiple-Product Monopoly

       Altruistic firms may use their market power to discriminate in favor of some consumers at

the expense of others. 23 For example, hospitals or universities may charge poor consumers less at

the expense of rich ones if expanding the output for poor is part of their mission. With altruistic

preferences, discrimination may involve using market power in one market to subsidize below-

cost selling in the other. 24 Several aspects of such cross-subsidization are worth noting. First, it

may be consistent with perfect competition. Second, it should not be confused with predatory

pricing. And third, as is true for the case of profit-maximizing firms, the feasibility of price dis-

crimination depends on the cost of preventing arbitrage.
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                     16
   Consider a monopoly producer that has two output levels, yP and yR, but for which the mo-

nopolist only has output preference for the first group (the poor) but not for the second (the rich).

The monopolist’s preferences are then

(24)                           v(yR, yP) = u(mo+ π(yR, yP), yP)

where profits are

(25)                           π(yR, yP) = pR(yR)yR + pP(yP)yP - c(yR, yP)

If costs are separable, so that serving the poor does not affect the cost of serving the rich, profits

will be maximized in the rich market at a level denoted π*. The market simply acts to expand the

consumption-output choice on its income-expansion path from [c(mo),yP(mo)] to [c(mo+π*),

yP(mo+ π*)]. Part of the extra income π* gained from the market power in the rich market will be

spent on extra consumption and part of it on extra output for the poor. Whether in funding the

consumption of the donor or the output of the poor, this use of market power entails an ineffi-

cient use of resources. If competing NFPs got together and agreed to charge rich patients uni-

formly high prices for medical care in order to subsidize the provision of medical care to poor

patients, the NFPs would be taxing the rich—forcing them to finance a portion of the NFPs’

charitable activities for the poor. In particular, the amount of donations would be determined by

the total profits in the rich and poor market. Donations would fall if the profit on the sales to the

rich rose more than the profit on sales to the poor declined:

(26)                           d[π* + πP(yP(mo+ π*)) ] / dπ* = 1 + (dπP/dyP)(dyP/dπ*)

       Thus market power in the rich market could lead the donor to donate less, shifting the bur-

den of subsidizing the poor to the rich consumers, even though they may not care about the poor

as much as the donor does, in which event there could be a decline in total utility. A further
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                     17
complication, however, concerns competition between such a firm and profit maximizers serving

both markets. The latter would operate at levels of output that satisfied the standard marginal

conditions. A firm with output preference for the poor would operate at a higher output level, but

if its two outputs are complements—that is, if serving the poor lowers the cost of serving the rich

on a per-person basis (and vice versa)—then the altruistic firm has a competitive advantage over

a for-profit firm that serves the same two markets. This occurs because its larger output in its

main activity (for example, serving the poor) lowers its costs in the complementary activity. 25

    Price discrimination as such does not violate antitrust law. In the case just given, where the

nondistribution constraint prevents the firm from obtaining monopoly profits overall, discrimina-

tion produces a net gain in efficiency. If, however, a firm that has a monopoly in one market uses

the profits that it obtains there to sell below cost in another market with the aim and probable ef-

fect of driving an equally or more efficient competitor out of that market (or preventing a com-

petitor from entering), it will violate section 2 of the Sherman Act regardless of the monopolist’s

NFP status. If an NFP sells below cost merely because it derives utility from the additional out-

put that such pricing enables, it is not really selling below cost and there is no antitrust violation.

If however it sells below cost with the additional objective of driving out an equally or more ef-

ficient competitor (or competitors) so that it can charge a higher price, albeit still a price below

cost, then it would be in antitrust jeopardy.

II: Competition and Antitrust in Mixed Industries

    In this section, continuing the discussion begun at the end of the preceding section, we con-

sider “mixed” industries, that is, industries that consist of both NFP and FP firms, as in the hospi-

tal industry and to a lesser extent the education industry. The previous analysis showed that the
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                             18
standard rationale for antitrust was as applicable to altruistic firms as it was to profit-maximizing

firms. In this section we arrive at the surprising implication that the effects of enforcing anti-trust

in the non-profit sector often depend on the supply behavior of the for-profit sector.

    If NFP firms have lower costs because of their free capital (and perhaps free labor) and this

leads them to price their output below marginal cost, then the only reason for the existence of FP

firms in the same industry would be a scarcity of altruists—that is, insufficient labor or capital

contributed by charitable donors to provide productive capacity sufficient to supply the entire

market at a price equal to marginal cost. On this view, the FP firms in a mixed industry corre-

spond to the fringe firms in a dominant-firm industry (George J. Stigler 1968), that is, an indus-

try in which one firm has a stable dominant market share because its average cost curve is below

that of the other firms throughout most but not all of the range of feasible output. The market

price will be equal to the marginal cost of the fringe firms, which here would correspond to firms

in the for-profit sector.

    It might seem to follow that, provided the antitrust laws are enforced against FP firms, com-

pressing their price to marginal cost, there is no need to enforce the antitrust laws against NFP

firms in mixed industries. But this is incorrect. The NFP firms may collude to reduce their out-

put. The resulting increase in price will induce an expansion of output by the fringe of FP firms.

Assuming that firms in the fringe have rising average costs and that the expansion of the fringe’s

output takes the form of the existing firms’ increasing their output rather than new firms’ enter-

ing whose average costs are identical to the average costs of the existing firms, the result will be

an increase in the industry’s marginal cost, and so the output of the industry will be lower than

before. (This is just an application of Stigler’s theory of how a dominant firm, provided it has a
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                   19
cost advantage, can obtain monopoly profits notwithstanding the existence of a competitive

fringe in its market.)

    This analysis is similar to the issues addressed by the Landes-Posner market-power model. 26

The higher the elasticity of supply of the fringe firms, the higher the elasticity of demand of the

firm whose market power we’re interested in measuring. And likewise the lower the market

share of that firm, the higher the elasticity of demand facing it. Of course, if the elasticity of sup-

ply of the fringe firms is infinite, the nonfringe firms have no market power regardless of their

market share, provided the market share of the nonfringe firms exceeds zero percent, however

slightly. And if the elasticity of supply of the fringe firms is zero because the optimal price

charged by the nonfringe firms is below the cost of the fringe firms throughout the entire feasible

range of output, then the fringe firms have no effect on the elasticity of demand of nonfringe

firms. The realistic case, however, has fringe firms with nonzero elasticity of supply and an ag-

gregate market share significantly greater than zero.

    Consider now a market in which the nonfringe firms are two NFPs each with 40 percent of

the market, and there is a fringe of FPs that supply the other 20 percent of the market demand.

Even though there is a competitive fringe that can expand its output if the nonfringe firms raise

their price (for we’re assuming a positive elasticity of supply), a merger of or collusion between

the two NFPs would result in a higher price (assuming that costs remain unchanged) because

their joint market share would now be greater than it was before the merger of collusion. For ex-

ample, suppose the market elasticity of demand and the elasticity of supply of the fringe firms

are both 1; then before the merger or collusion the elasticity of demand facing each of the NFP
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                     20
firms would have been 4; afterwards it is only 1.5, implying a substantial increase in market

power.

       This analysis shows that antitrust cannot ignore NFP firms in mixed markets merely because

they have lower costs than FP firms so that the market price is determined by the costs of the FP

firms. But in addition it is not certain that NFP firms will, merely because of their output prefer-

ence, be the low-cost producers. The nondistribution constraint may limit NFPs’ access to capital

and ability to incentivize their employees, and these disadvantages may outweigh the lower costs

that are due to altruism (and resulting output preference) and to tax-exempt status.

A. The Competitive Disadvantage of Profit-Maximizing Firms

       Consider to begin with competition between altruists and profit maximizers without worry-

ing about the legal regulations that by defining constrain the nonprofit sector. In the long run,

given free entry and exit in a competitive market, the breakeven combinations of output and

price (y,p) at which a producer is indifferent between entry and exit are defined by

(27)                           v(y,py-c(y))=v(0,0).

Under profit maximization, these combinations reduce to the familiar average cost curve

p=c(y)/y, which is assumed to have the standard U-shape. If a firm values output in itself, profits

along the breakeven curve are always negative, implying that donations are made. Specifically,

vy > 0 and v(y,π) = v(0,0) implies π < 0. Such a firm has average monetary costs above price. As

a result, the firm’s sales do not cover costs, and donations make up the shortfall. If there were an

infinite number of potential suppliers of each type v, then in the long run, price would move to its

lowest point along the breakeven curve of all types. This simply corresponds to the lowest-cost
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                         21
suppliers surviving in the for profit case. In the case of two firm types, the lowest sustainable

price is pl for the profit-maximizing firms and p0 < p1 for the profit-deviating firms.

    The above analysis implies the surprising result that profit maximizers can never survive

against competition from an infinite supply of profit-deviating firms. This competitive advantage

of profit deviators is most easily understood by realizing that the cost of capital is lower for

profit-deviating firms; donations represent capital obtained at zero cost, because they require no

interest payments and the firm may simply keep the principal. The fact that nonprofit firms spend

money soliciting and competing for the capital of donors provides evidence that donors, and thus

profit-deviating firms, must be in finite supply. We will assume this form of scarce altruism by

taking as given that there are A potential profit-deviating firms. Because we do not take a stand

on what determines the number or market share of the A firms, we will provide predictions based

not on the level of nonprofit activity but instead on the changes in nonprofit activity induced by

variations in market incentives. This resembles the approach of neoclassical theory, which avoids

explaining the level of production and focuses on the changes in production induced by varying

market conditions.

    If profit maximizers coexist with A profit-deviating firms, profit-maximizers will be the

marginal firms, whose behavior governs marginal changes in industry price and quantity. This

implies that in a mixed industry with competition, the long-run behavior of industry output and

price when the for-profit sector is perfectly elastic are unaffected by the presence of profit-

deviators. To see this more precisely, consider a case in which preferences are indexed by a pa-

rameter α in [0,1]. A firm α has the utility function v(y,π|α), with α = 0 for profit-maximizers,

and vy(y,π|α$) increasing in α. 27 Suppose the A profit-deviators are distributed according to
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                      22
G(α), where G has support α in $(0,1]. These firms act as if they were profit-maximizers with

the cost functions C(y|α) 28 , where marginal and average cost fall in α. Intuitively, since such

firms value output intrinsically, their overall (pecuniary plus non-pecuniary) costs are lower.

Profit-maximizing firms, those with the highest average and marginal cost, can survive only if

the long-run price is at or above their minimum average cost, denoted by m = minyc(y)/y. In

other words, they can survive only if the output supplied by profit-deviators cannot satisfy de-

mand at a price lower than m. More precisely, given a demand function D(p), profit-maximizers

can exist only if

(28)                            D ( p ) > A ∫ y ( p | α ) dG (α ), p ≤ m,


where y(p|α) is the supply function of type α. For the marginal firm α whose rents, but not nec-

essarily profits, are zero, reinterpreted average cost equal price:

                                      C ( y( p | α ) | α )
(29)                            p =                        .
                                           y( p | α )

Only firms with enough altruism produce; that is, only firms with α ≥ α are in the market. If de-

mand is not met by supply at a price below minimum average cost m, the price rises to m, and

profit-maximizers enter until excess demand is eliminated. Therefore, in the long run, when the

supply of profit-maximizing firms is perfectly elastic, the market behaves as if there were only

profit maximizers; long-run price gets driven down to minimum average cost, and long-run

quantity is given by the market demand at this price. The long-run equilibrium is:

(30)                           p = m,

(31)                           Y = D(m).
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                       23
Thus altruism confers a competitive advantage on profit-deviators. This conclusion differs from

the common belief that when profit maximizers are driven to please their customers, they disci-

pline the behavior of profit deviators in a competitive market. If profit maximizers price at

minimum average costs, the argument goes, competitive markets force producers with output

preferences to follow by eliminating “rents” which they might otherwise spend on output. 29 Our

analysis implies the opposite: competition allows profit deviators to drive out profit-maximizers

even if the former have neither market power nor legal advantages.

B. The Long-Run Neutrality of Antitrust for the Nonprofit Sector

       The NFP sector is defined by government regulations that distinguish it from the FP sector,

in particular (a) tax exemptions and (b) the nondistribution constraint. 30 Let d indicate the regula-

tory choice of the firm, where d = 1 when a firm chooses to be for-profit and d = 0 when it de-

cides to be nonprofit. The nonprofit firm is constrained to have economic profits below a certain

regulated level π ≤ πR, while under for-profit status profits are unconstrained. Monetary cost

functions differ across status: denoting by cd(y) the cost function in status d, we assume that c0(y)

≤ c1(y) and cy0(y) ≤ cy1(y). Holding output fixed, both total and marginal costs are lower in the

nonprofit sector. A firm in sector d with preferences v now has the reinterpreted marginal cost

function Cyd = cyd – (vy/vπ), with the supply function yd(p|v). Since nonprofit firms have to respect

the distribution constraint, the respective profit functions for the two sectors are

(32)                           π0=min{πR,py0-c0(y0)

and

(33)                           π1=py1 - c1(y1).
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                        24
Presented with the option of nonprofit status, the firm chooses between the ability to retain posi-

tive profits and the ability to produce more output given nonprofit tax breaks.

       Every profit-maximizing firm in the industry will choose for-profit status, because it does

not value the extra output afforded by nonprofit tax breaks. Every profit-deviating firm, on the

other hand, will choose nonprofit status, because the non-distribution constraint never binds it in

equilibrium. To understand this result, consider first the case in which the marginal firm is profit

maximizing. It earns zero profits at the equilibrium price p. Since all profit deviators are more

altruistic than the profit-maximizing marginal firm, they will choose higher output and lower

(negative) profits than the marginal firm. 31 Now suppose that the marginal firm is profit deviat-

ing. It must be earning negative profits in order that its rents be driven to zero; all other profit

deviators are at least as altruistic as the marginal firm and must also be earning negative profits.

There will then be N0 = A nonprofit firms, and N1 for-profit firms covering residual demand at a

price of minimum average cost

(34)                            N l y l ( m | 0 ) = D ( m ) − A ∫ y 0 ( m | α ) dG (α ).


       The for-profit sector is thus composed of marginal firms (see Darius Lakdawalla and Tomas

Philipson (1997) for a more comprehensive discussion of this result). As a result, industry behav-

ior mimics that of an entirely for-profit industry, insofar as the long-run price is equal to mini-

mum average cost when supply is perfectly elastic in the long run. We continue to have the neo-

classical results that price reflect costs at the minimum efficient scale and quantity reflects de-

mand at that price; p = m and Y = D(m). Put differently, one may understand the industry’s re-

sponse to an intervention, such as antitrust, without knowing anything about the share of output

produced in the nonprofit sector.
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                          25
   This has the counterintuitive implication that antitrust policy in the nonprofit sector may not

affect consumer welfare. This is so when antitrust policy is fully enforced in the for-profit sector.

In that case the for-profit sector will supply the residual amount of output not supplied in the

non-profit sector at a price reflecting minimum average costs in the long run. Aggregate output

will therefore be whatever demand is at that price regardless of what share of that output is pro-

duced by the nonprofit sector.

    This result holds only for mixed industries, however, which in our analysis result from altru-

ism being scarce relative to aggregate demand. If altruism is not scarce, there may only be non-

profits in the industry and then antitrust policy towards such firms may greatly affect consumer

welfare.

III: Antitrust Exemptions and Intellectual Property

    Patent, copyright, and trade secret law allows firms to obtain lawful monopolies of intellec-

tual property and thus raises the question whether this regime is as appropriate for the NFP sector

as it seems to be for the FP sector. The rationale for the law’s permitting (indeed encouraging)

these monopolies is that without protection from free riders, the creators of intellectual property

would have insufficient incentives to invest in its creation, since they could have no confidence

of being able to recover their fixed costs. The cost of making an additional copy of a piece of in-

tellectual property is generally less than its average total cost and is sometimes quite close to

zero even for intellectual property that may have cost a great deal to create. As patents are only

valuable when the market power granted is exploited by the innovator, the issue then becomes

whether an NFP firm will exploit market power to the degree necessary to generate sufficient

innovation. Our analysis implies that patents may have larger effects on R&D for altruistic firms
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                      26
even though they may price below costs when the product is marketed and therefore, mistakenly,

look as if they are not exploiting market power.

       More precisely, consider a firm that undertakes a level of R&D, z, that results in an increas-

ing and concave probability of discovery p(z). Given the generalized optimal utility level v(α) for

a producer with altruism α, the producer’s expected utility is

(35)                            E[v] = p(z)v(α) – z.

In the standard case of a profit maximizer (v = π), this reduces to expected profits. The question

is how the degree of altruism affects the degree to which R&D is encouraged through patents. If

z(v) denotes the R&D undertaken in case of v being the optimal level of utility when innovation

is marketed, then z(α)=z(v(α))-z(0) is the impact on R&D of allowing monopoly production. The

chain rule implies that

(36)                            dz/dα=(dz/dv)(dv/dα)

However, we know that the optimal R&D is defined by the first-order condition

(37)                            pZv = 1

Therefore, provided that p is concave so that there are diminishing returns to R&D, expenditures

on R&D will rise with the value of production: dz/dv >0. In addition, we know that altruistic

firms are the low-cost firms in a market, so that the value of production will rise with the degree

of altruism: dv/dα >0. Consequently, patent protection has larger effects on expenditures on

R&D for altruistic than for nonaltruistic firms even though the former may price below costs and

therefore mistakenly appear not to be exploiting market power.

       Since patents are valuable only if they confer market power in the sense of enabling the pat-

entee to charge a price in excess of marginal cost, enabling patentee to recapture the fixed costs
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                      27
that it expended on the R&D that enabled the patent to be obtained, the fact that NFP firms do

seek patent protection shows that they are willing to exploit market power. However, market

power used solely to recover fixed costs, rather than to generate rents, is benign, which is the jus-

tification for the antitrust exemption of the patent monopoly. But in this respect there is no dif-

ference between NFP and FP firms.

    But suppose that the NFP patentees are altruistic in an industry sense, that is, they value in-

dustry output and not merely their own output. 32 Then the NFP firms will not care quite as much

about obtaining patents because they want to encourage the use of their innovations rather than

simply wanting to increase their own revenues. But since, as we have emphasized, NFPs are not

insensitive to costs, and lost revenues are the equivalent of incurred costs, they may still want to

seek patent protection.

    Lastly, patenting by a NFP firm can simply be viewed as a special case of cross-

subsidization when the firm cares about a consumer group that does not buy the patented product

and the firm uses the profits obtained from the patent to subsidize that group. In this case, the

patent monopoly is used as a method of cross-subsidization that has the same negative welfare

effects as discussed above.

IV. Conclusion

Despite the conceptual differences between for-profit and nonprofit firms stressed in conven-

tional economic analyses of the nonprofit sector, U.S. antitrust law generally does not distinguish

between these two organizational forms. This paper defends that approach by demonstrating that

the same incentives to restrain trade exist in the nonprofit sector as in the for-profit sector. Altru-

istic firms benefit from exploiting market power, just as non-altruistic ones do, even when the
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                     28
altruistic firms would price below marginal cost without the spur of competition. Therefore,

promoting competition is socially valuable regardless of the particular objectives of producers,

and the fact that antitrust law does not distinguish between the two sectors is efficient.

    The paper has ignored several issues that may be fruitfully addressed by future research.

First, the regulations defining the NFP sector bars such firms from raising capital through equity

markets, but presumably few shareholders would be interested in firms pricing below cost which

is the norm in the NFP sector in which donations partly cover production costs. As we have as-

sumed, donors are essentially the shareholders in this respect. In a profit-maximizing world,

shareholders all agree that the firm should maximize profits as it raises incomes of all sharehold-

ers. However, an important issue regarding the unanimity of the goal of the firm arises for altru-

istic firms because it will likely not be agreement among donors as to the right course of action

of the firm. In addition, the market for corporate control is missing so that some donors cannot

pay others to have their say in the behavior of the firm. Therefore, NFP firms will be more likely

to be disciplined by output markets rather than input markets or corporate control in this respect,

which in turn makes antitrust regulations particularly important.

    Second, as our analysis captured only certain forms of utility distinct from that of owners of

profit-maximizing firms, more general forms of utility functions should be considered in future

work. However, the general misalignment between social and firm objectives that forms the ba-

sis of antitrust policy is likely to be present for many more general formulations.

    Lastly, the paper did not address fully the impact of antitrust policy in oligopoly markets.

The theory of the industrial organization of NFP industries is relatively poorly developed and as
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                       29
a result the impact of procompetitive policy poorly understood. Much more research in this area

seems warranted.

    The U.S. antitrust laws are concerned with two broad categories of firm behavior. The first consists of efforts by

which a firm collaborates with competing firms in an effort to reduce competition, ordinarily charged as a violation

of section 1 of the Sherman Act or section 7 of the Clayton Act. The second consists of efforts by a firm, ordinarily

one having monopoly power, to eliminate or reduce competition without collaborating with its competitors, violat-

ing either sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act or various sections of the Clayton Act.
2
    Health-care providers, particularly hospitals, dominate the NFP sector with about 50 percent of employment. Edu-

cation and research make up the second largest component of NFP employment, at about 20 percent, followed by

social services, such as child-care and job-training, at about 15 percent.

     The most general level of analysis of a utility maximizing firm would have him not only choose output but also

inputs maximize a utility function u(m,y,x) subject to feasibility constraints. Generalizing to include input choices in

this way leads to many analogous results to the ones discussed when there is monopsony power, but makes exposi-

tion more cumbersome. As long as there is no input preferences, the conditional demand function for a profit-

maximizer and utility-maximizing firm coincide. See Lakdawalla and Philipson (2000) for a discussion of the ef-

fects of input preferences on cost-functions.
16
     Note that the share of donations of revenue or cost is not a good indicator of whether there is output preference or

not. For example, it often argued that in the U.S. hospitals industry, in which donations as a share of revenues or

costs have fallen over time, profit-maximization is the relevant objective of the firm. However, this seems inconsis-

tent with the firm choosing to be in the non-profit sector.
17
     For empirical support of this theory in the case of a mixed industry see Gaynor and Vogt (2003).
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                                             36
18
     One may first think that whenever producer and consumer welfare coincide, v(y) = s(y), then the private incen-

tives of the firm coincide with social welfare maximization. However, in this case no optima exist as social and pro-

ducer welfare is strictly increasing in output everywhere.
19
     An illustrative special case is where preferences are of the quasi-linear form, as would be the case under a first-

order Taylor approximation of any utility function

(1)                                    v(y) = u(π, y) = π + αy


when the socially optimal markdown below costs is p = cy - α. The altruistic firm will price at


(2)                                    [p - (cy - α)]/p = 1/e

where e = |-ypp/p| is the demand-elasticity. Hence, the altruistic monopolist may be charging below cost but restrain-

ing trade at the same time.
20
     See Gustavo E. Bamberger and Dennis W. Carlton (1999). A complicating factor, however, is that if the best stu-

dents are complements to faculty, the loss of those students may be experienced as a cost to the faculty, thus requir-

ing the colleges to raise salaries in order to restore the wage equilibrium. However, this assumes that the bidding

wars have a significant effect on the assignment of students to colleges, and they may not. The students may end up

at the same schools, only with higher rents.
21
     See Arthur A. Fleisher et al. (1992); James V. Koch (1973).
22
     A similar argument holds for a constant elasticity demand curve with p(y)=y-1/ε, with ε> 1. In this case, the dead-

weight loss is L(α)= K(ε) (c - α)1-ε where K(ε) is a positive constant that depends on the elasticity of demand. Thus,

this again implies that the deadweight loss rises with altruism.
23
     Such altruistic discrimination does not violate the non-distribution constraint that defines the NFP sector because

the constraint applies to the organization as a whole rather than to each separate line of business or consumers.
24
     For empirical support of this theory, see Jonathan Gruber (1994).
25
     This relation has implications for the regulatory treatment of “unrelated business income.” If the alleged “unre-

lated business” is a complement to the NFP’s main, altruistic mission, then it isn’t really unrelated—it promotes the

fulfillment of the mission. But this is a topic outside the scope of the present paper.
Antitrust in Nonprofit Sector                                                               37
26
     See William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner (1981).
27
     For example, we could have v(y,π(y)) = αy + (1-α)π(y).
28
     Given the cost-function c(y), its reinterpreted counterpart satisfies:

                y              v y (θ , π | α )
C ( y | α ) = ∫ [ c y (θ ) −                      ]d θ .
                0              v π (θ , π | α )

This implies, as assumed throughout, that Cy(y|α) falls in α.
29
     See, for example, Estelle James and Susan Rose-Ackerman (1986).
30
     The nondistribution constraint has certain market consequences that we do not discuss in this paper. In particular,

the NFP sector cannot raise capital in the equity markets because it cannot offer a profit incentive to investors. As a

result, there is no market for corporate control of NFP institutions, and so there can be no hostile takeovers of such

institutions, as there can be in the FP sector, by means of tender offers, although of course friendly takeovers remain

possible. Despite the differences between the two sectors in terms of corporate control, both forms of organizations

co-exist under competitive conditions in many industries, which may suggest that output competition is a more im-

portant mechanism for disciplining a firm than competition in the market for corporate control.
31
     To see that profits fall in altruism, observe that a firm with utility v(y,π(y)) will respect the first order condition

vy/vπ = cy - p. Since vy/vπ is a measure of altruism, the more altruistic firms will choose a higher cost-price differen-

tial. In other words, more altruism leads to higher output and lower profits.
32
     A related issue is whether government-funded R&D should be patentable. It is related because government funded

R&D operates to replace voluntary donors with involuntary taxpayers who are unlikely to have a preference for the

output of any particular firm.
