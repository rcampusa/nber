                                            ABSTRACT

The Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) and other indices of consumer confidence are
prominent in public discourse on the economy but have little presence in modern economic research.
The sparsity of modern research follows an earlier period when economists scrutinized in some
depth the methods and data used to produce consumer confidence indices. The literature to date has
focused on the predictive power of the survey data used to form the indices; there has been very little
study of their micro foundations. This paper analyzes the responses to eight expectations questions
that have appeared on the Michigan Survey of Consumers in the period June 2002 through May
2003. Four questions elicit micro and macroeconomic expectations in the traditional qualitative
manner; two are components of the ICS. Four questions use a "percent chance" format to elicit
subjective probabilities of micro and macroeconomic events; versions of these questions have
previously appeared in the Survey of Economic Expectations.

1. Introduction



       In April 2001, concern about the state of the U. S. economy was evident in a New York Times

headline declaring “Confidence of Consumers at 8-year Low” and in an Economist story reporting

that “Consumer confidence is now down to the same level as when America went into recession in

1990.” Two years later, in February 2003, Reuters reported “Consumer Sentiment Hits 9-Year

Low.”1 The Times, Economist, and Reuters reports stated that their conclusions were based on an

index issued monthly by the University of Michigan, but did not describe the index. Apparently, the

meaning and measurement of consumer confidence were considered sufficiently well known as not

to require explanation. Indeed, the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment is reported regularly in

the media, along with commentary on its significance for the economy. So is another one, the

Consumer Confidence Index issued monthly by the Conference Board.

       The Michigan index was developed a half-century ago by George Katona and colleagues at

the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan (see Curtin, 1982). The Conference

Board index has been issued since 1967 (see Linden, 1982). Both indices aggregate survey

responses to a set of questions about current and expected economic conditions. The Michigan

index is described in Appendix A, which is taken from the code book of the Michigan Survey of

Consumers. The Conference Board appears not to make public its specific questions.

       Notwithstanding their prominence in public discussions of the economy, the Michigan and

Conference Board indices have little presence in modern economic research. Neither consumer

confidence nor consumer sentiment appears in the Journal of Economic Literature Subject Index of

Journal Articles. A search for the two terms in EconLit revealed 78 occurrences in the abstracts of

articles and discussion papers published from 1969 through February 2003, but relatively few of

these were in “mainstream” economics journals. The research that has been performed has mainly

sought to evaluate the predictive power of the Michigan and Conference Board indices in forecasting

aggregate consumption and other macroeconomic variables.

       The sparsity of modern research follows an earlier period when economists scrutinized in

some depth the methods and data used to produce consumer confidence indices. In the 1940s, the

U.S. Federal Reserve Board began to fund an annual Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted by

the University of Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC), that posed qualitative questions of the

type used to form the Index of Consumer Sentiment. The usefulness of such questions was

controversial and the Federal Reserve Board appointed a committee to assess their value. The

Federal Reserve Consultant Committee on Consumer Survey Statistics (1955), known informally as

the Smithies Committee for its chair Arthur Smithies, issued findings that questioned the predictive

power of the SRC data. The negative findings of the Committee were challenged by SRC

researchers, notably Katona (1957). A contentious conference followed (National Bureau of

Economic Research, 1960). Then Juster (1964) reported an intensive study, drawing largely

negative conclusions, on the predictive usefulness of qualitative approaches to elicitation of

consumer expectations. By the mid-1960s, opinion among mainstream economists was firmly

negative. However, SRC continued to perform its consumer surveys and to publish aggregated

findings in its Index of Consumer Sentiment.

          Economists today may be inclined to regard the prominence of consumer confidence indices

in public discussions of the economy as no more than an illustration of how little the public

understands serious economic research. However, there should be more to it than that. Economists

who study the decision making of consumers, firms, and governments should want to learn how

these agents use publicly available economic information. We should, moreover, want to improve

the quality of such public information. For these reasons, economists should examine the production

and utilization of consumer confidence indices. Going further, we should endeavor to develop

measures that improve on the ones now available.

          Various types of research can shed light on these matters, in differing respects. The literature

to date has focused on the predictive power of the data used to form consumer confidence indices.

The Smithies Committee, as well as Tobin (1959) and Juster (1964), recommended that predictive

power be evaluated by the ability of individual survey responses to predict subsequent individual

outcomes (e.g., durable goods expenditures) reported later in re-interviews. However, Katona

(1957) and Mueller (1957) argued that aggregate predictive tests are equally relevant. Recent

studies have used aggregate time series data to perform macro predictive tests broadly of the form

advocated by Katona and Mueller. The standard practice has been to regress an outcome of interest

on a consumer confidence index and other economic indicators. The value of the index is then

measured by its estimated coefficient in the regression, statistical significance, or contribution to R2.

See, for example, Batchelor and Dua (1998), Carroll, Fuhrer, and Wilcox (1994), Fuhrer (1988),

Kumar, Leone, and Gaskins (1995), Madsen and McAleer (2000), and Matsusaka and Sbordone

(1995).

          Although aggregate predictive tests may be useful, we believe that the Smithies Committee
                                                 4

was correct to recommend study of the micro foundations of consumer confidence indices.

Examination of the wording of the Michigan questions indicates inherent weaknesses that we have

found commonplace in attitudinal research (see Manski, 1990; Dominitz and Manski, 1997a, 1997b,

1999; Das, Dominitz, and van Soest; 1999). One obvious problem is that the events about which

respondents are queried are remarkably vague. Another is that the expectations questions posed do

not permit respondents to express uncertainty. Consider, for example, the question:

       “Now looking ahead – do you think that a year from now you (and your family living there)

       will be better off financially, or worse off, or just about the same as now?”

How do respondents interpret the phrase “better off financially?” Do different respondents interpret

the phrase in the same way? How do respondents who are uncertain of their future prospects answer

the question? We believe that empirical research addressing these and related issues is essential if

we are to understand the Michigan index and improve on it. This paper presents such research.

       The data analyzed here are responses to eight expectations questions that have appeared on

the Survey of Consumers in the period June 2002 through May 2003. Four questions elicit micro

and macroeconomic expectations in the traditional qualitative manner, and two of these questions

are components of the Index of Consumer Sentiment. The other four questions use a “percent

chance” format to elicit subjective probabilities of micro and macroeconomic events; versions of

these questions have previously appeared in our own Survey of Economic Expectations (Dominitz

and Manski, 1997a, 1997b).

       Section 2 describes the expectations data collected in the Survey of Consumers. In Section 3,

we examine month-to-month temporal fluctuations in the central tendency of these expectations.

Section 4 analyzes the cross-sectional variation of expectations with personal attributes. Section 5
                                                 5

uses re-interviews of respondents to study the temporal stability and variability of individual

expectations. Drawing lessons from the findings, Section 6 concludes with a set of questions

regarding effective conceptualization and measurement of consumer confidence.




2. Measures of Expectations in the Survey of Consumers



2.1. The Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS)



       As documented in Appendix A, the ICS is currently constructed based on responses to five

questions asked in the Survey of Consumers. These five questions concern two assessments of

current outcomes—family finances and “buying conditions”—and three assessments of future

outcomes—family finances in the year ahead, business conditions in the year ahead, and aggregate

economic conditions over the next five years. When the Survey of Consumers was initiated in the

early 1950s, responses to a price expectations questions were also included in what was referred to

as the “index of consumer attitudes” (Mueller, 1957). Approximately four years into this Survey

Research Center program, one of the principal investigators stated, “Tentatively, the six components

of the index have been given equal weight” (Mueller, 1957, p. 949). The remaining five components

are still given equal weight.

       The ICS is constructed as follows: For each question, the relative score is calculated as (a)

the difference between the percentage of respondents giving “favorable” responses and the

percentage giving “unfavorable” responses plus (b) the value 100. Then, the ICS equals (a) the sum
                                                 6

of the five relative scores divided by 6.7558 (the sum of the relative scores in 1966) plus (b) a

constant to “correct for” changes in sample design over the history of the survey.



2.2. Qualitative and Quantitative Expectations Questions



       The four longstanding Michigan qualitative expectations questions whose responses we

study are listed in Appendix B. These questions, each of which has a 12-month forecast horizon,

concern expectations of the change in family finances (PEXP), family income (INEXQ1), and

national business conditions (BEXP), as well as expectations of the level (e.g., “good” or “bad”) of

business conditions (BUS12). With the exception of BUS12, these questions have three response

options, exemplified by the question on family finances discussed in the introduction. Throughout

this paper we analyze BUS12 as a three-response question as well. To do so, we aggregate the

“good” and “qualified good” responses, and likewise aggregate the “bad” and “qualified bad”

responses.

       Six “percent chance” questions have been asked in the Michigan survey since June 2002.

These questions are listed in Appendix C.        These questions have been designed to elicit

interpersonally comparable expectations of well-defined events. Importantly, the questions elicit

expectations in the form called for by modern economic theory; that is, in the form of subjective

probabilities.

       One may contrast the qualitative assessments in the Michigan questions with, for example,

the following probabilistic assessment of personal income (V252):

       “What do you think is the percent chance that your income in the next twelve months will be
                                                          7

         higher than your income in the past twelve months?”

We analyze responses to question V252 and three other probabilistic questions with one-year

forecast horizons. These questions concern the chance that a mutual fund investment will increase in

value (V250), the chance that the respondent will lose his or her job (V255), and, conditional on the

loss of this job, the chance the respondent would find and accept an “equally good job” (V256).

         With the exception of the mutual fund question, these questions have been asked in the

Survey of Economic Expectations (SEE) since 1994. We discuss the origins of these SEE questions

in Dominitz and Manski (1997a, 1997b). A set of mutual fund expectations questions, similar to

those asked in the Michigan survey, were asked in SEE from 1999 through 2001. Responses to these

questions, discussed in Section 3, have not previously been analyzed.2



2.3. Surveys of Consumers: June 2002 – May 2003



         Each month, the Survey of Consumers is completed by telephone by approximately 500 adult

men and women who live in the coterminous United States. Michigan has adopted a rotating panel

design for this survey, in which the majority of individuals (approximately 60%) are first time

respondents from whom re-interviews will be attempted six months thereafter. Thus, over the 12-

month period of our analysis, we obtain data in each of the final six months from re-interviews of

approximately 200 of the 300 individuals who were in the sample six months earlier and had not

previously been interviewed. The following table describes the sample of respondents from June


2
  SEE respondents were asked to report the highest and lowest possible (one-year ahead) value for a $1000 investment
today in a mutual fund. These responses were then used to select a sequence of threshold values X for questions of this
form: “What do you think is the percent chance (or chances out of 100) that, one year from now, this investment would
be worth over $X?” For each respondent, one such value was 1000, yielding a question equivalent to V250.

           Observe that the total sample varies only from 500 to 504 observations each month over this

time period. The initial interviews each month are 12 independent random samples of size 285 to

304. The panel component of the survey yields a total sample size of 1254 individuals, with a re-

interview response rate ranging from 68% (Nov-02 to May-03) to 72% (Jul-02 to Jan-03).

           Calculation of the ICS includes responses given by both initial-interview and re-interview

respondents. In Section 3, we follow this practice to describe temporal fluctuations of the

distribution of expectations. However, in Section 4, where we describe the cross-sectional variation

of expectations, we only use data from initial interviews to avoid double counting sample members.

In Section 5, where we analyze temporal fluctuations of individual expectations, we restrict attention

to those who completed both an initial interview during the period Jun-02 through Dec-02 and a re-

interview during the period Jan-03 through May-03.

3. Temporal Fluctuations in the Distribution of Expectations



       The main use of the ICS has been to measure temporal fluctuations in consumer confidence.

The index aggregates responses to disparate questions with ordinal response categories. Hence,

there is no clear meaning to the magnitude of changes over time in the index. Indeed, even the

direction of change in the ICS is not clearly interpretable if responses to the component questions

move in different directions.

       To obtain a clear sense of temporal fluctuations, we examine the month-to-month variation in

responses to each question, one at a time. We also compare the responses to related qualitative and

percent-chance questions. The empirical findings are reported in Tables 1 and 2.



3.1. ICS Qualitative Expectations



       In a pattern that recurs throughout our analysis of qualitative expectations, Tables 1A and 1B

show much greater month-to-month volatility in responses to the macroeconomic expectations

question concerning national business conditions (BUS12) than to the personal expectations

question concerning family finances (PEXP). We show below the range of frequencies (as a

percentage of the sample) giving favorable or unfavorable responses, and the difference in these

percentages plus 100 (i.e., the ICS relative score):
                                                10




                                     minimum         (month)    maximum         (month)
 BUS12           % good                 26.6         Feb-03        54.4         May-03
                  % bad                 34.7         Jun-02        62.1         Mar-03

             % good - % bad
                 + 100                  65.5         Mar-03       118.4         May-03


 PEXP            % better               37.9         Jan-03        43.8         May-03
                 % worse                5.6          Jun-02        12.6          Jan-03

           % better - % worse
                 +100                  125.4         Jan-03       137.1          Jun-02


Observe that the ICS relative score for BUS12 rises from a 12-month minimum of 65.5 in Mar-03 to

a 12-month maximum of 118.4 in May-03, just two months later. In contrast, the ICS relative score

for PEXP varies only between 125.4 and 137.1 during the entire 12-month period.

       The greater time-series volatility of responses to question BUS12 could have several

explanations. It could be that the macroeconomic and personal financial outcomes are equally

variable, but that respondents are less informed about the economy than about personal finances and,

hence, have expectations that fluctuate more over time. Or the economy may really be more volatile

than are personal finances. Or, the volatility of responses to BUS12 may arise from the vagueness of

the question wording, which asks whether “business conditions” are “good” or “bad.”

       We find greater nonresponse to BUS12 (9% overall) than to PEXP (3% overall). We

conjecture that individuals are less likely to respond when they are more uncertain about the

appropriate response. Once again, greater uncertainty may occur because respondents are less well

informed about the outcome, because the outcome actually is more volatile, or because the question
                                                11

wording is more difficult to interpret.

       Regardless of the explanation, we find that variation in PEXP responses contributes little to

fluctuation in the ICS over this time period, relative to variation in BUS12. Historical evidence

shows that this is a longstanding feature of the ICS.        The Survey of Consumers website

(http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) makes available quarterly reports of the relative score for each

component of the ICS since 1960. Over the past 42 years, the PEXP relative score varied from a

minimum of 92 to a maximum of 141, with a standard deviation of 9.9. The BUS12 relative score

varied from 35 to 168, with a standard deviation of 31.7.



3.2. Other Qualitative Expectations Questions



       We now consider responses to two other questions that may help identify the source of the

greater fluctuation of BUS12 relative to PEXP. The Survey of Consumers asks another question

about national business conditions, BEXP, that seeks a “better” versus “worse” response rather than

the “good” versus “bad” response sought in BUS12. The wording of question BEXP thus eliminates

one source of ambiguity in BUS12, although it retains the vague reference to “business conditions.”

The survey also asks another personal question, INEXQ1, that focuses on family income rather than

finances in general. Questions BEXP and INEXQ1 do not suffer from as much vagueness in

wording as do BUS12 and PEXP. Hence, their responses may be somewhat more interpretable.

       Tables 1C and 1D report the monthly frequencies. We find these peaks and troughs:
                                                 12

Nonresponse for BEXP is 2% overall, and for INEXQ1 is 1% overall.

       These results indicate again that expectations for national business conditions are more

volatile than are those for personal outcomes. However, the “better/worse” responses to question

BEXP are considerably less volatile than are the “good/bad” responses to question BUS12. This

reduction in volatility and in nonresponse suggests either that vague question wording is an

important source of the fluctuations or that beliefs about the level of economic activity are more

volatile than are beliefs about changes in the level of activity. Noting that nonresponse to question

BEXP is much less common than to question BUS12, we conjecture that ambiguous wording is the

primary explanation for the greater volatility of responses to the latter question.

       Now consider the two questions asking about personal events, either family income or

finances. The responses to questions INEXQ1 and PEXP exhibit much less time-series variation

than do the responses to BUS12 and BEXP; the minimum and maximum values of the relative score

for INEXQ1 (PEXP) vary by only 8.8 (11.7) points during the 12-month period. This indicates that

expectations for national business conditions actually are more volatile than are expectations for
                                                13

personal finances.



3.3. Probabilistic Investment and Income Expectations



       Unlike the qualitative questions, the “percent chance” questions concern relatively well-

specified events and have consistent wording across these events. The present discussion focuses on

questions V250 and V252, which are most comparable to the Michigan qualitative questions.

Question V250 elicits expectations of a macroeconomic event relevant to many consumers, the

returns to a mutual fund investment, whereas V252 elicits expectations of personal income growth.

The monthly distributions of responses to these questions are reported in Tables 1E and 1F

respectively.

       We do not find the strong disparity in volatility that is evident in the responses to the

qualitative questions. The mean likelihood of a positive return to a mutual fund investment ranges

from a 39.3 percent chance in Oct-02 to 45.3 in Jun-02. The mean likelihood of an increase in

personal income ranges from a 47.9 percent chance in May-03 to 54.2 in Dec-02. The median

chance of mutual fund growth varies from 40 to 50 percent over the 12-month period, whereas the

median chance of personal income growth remains constant at 50 percent each month.

       We do find more nonresponse to question V250 (8.0% overall) than to V252 (4% overall).

We conjecture that respondents are less informed about the stock market than about personal income

and, hence, less likely to respond.

Investment Expectations in the Survey of Economic Expectations

            The mutual fund question V250 has previously been asked on three waves of the SEE survey

conducted in the period 1999-2001, also by telephone with a national sample of respondents. We

summarize the findings here:

                                                                Quantiles               N

                                                                                       (non-
    months      N (respondents)   mean       std dev     0.25     0.50      0.75   respondents)

    Jul-99 –
    Nov-99           405          66.4         29.3       50       75       90         142

    Feb-00 –
    May-00           335          70.8         27.2       50       75       95         130

    Sep-00 –
     Mar-01          468          66.1         27.6       50       75       90         171


      All            1208         67.5         28.1       50       75       90         443



Comparison of these results with those in Table 1E indicates that investment expectations in the

period Jun-02 to May-03 are sharply lower than they were in the earlier period Jul-99 to Mar-01.

However, this comparison should be made with caution. The nonresponse rate to the SEE question

was 27%, considerably higher than the 8% experienced when the same question has been

administered on the Survey of Consumers.3



Investment Expectations and the S&P500

            Figure 1 plots the monthly mean percent chance of mutual fund growth reported in the

Survey of Consumers against the daily time series of the Standard and Poors 500 (S&P). The two

  The variation in response rates is due at least in part to the questionnaire design. As explained in footnote 2, SEE
respondents were first asked to state the minimum and maximum values they believe the investment may have a year
after the interview. Respondents who did not answer these questions were not asked the question analyzed here.
                                                 15

series clearly move together.     The Spearman rank correlation, which measures the ordinal

covariation of the two time series, is 0.80. We think it premature with only one year of data to

attempt to assess whether expectations of mutual fund growth lead, coincide with, or lag the S&P

realizations. However, it may become possible to assess this relationship when a longer time series

becomes available.



3.4. Probabilistic Job Expectations

       Respondents to the Survey of Consumers who are currently working were posed two

probabilistic questions about job prospects. The composition of employment changes over time for

various reasons: regular seasonal variation in employment, business-cycle fluctuations, and long-

term changes associated with changes in the demographic composition of the population. For these

reasons, care needs to be taken in interpretation of the time-series variation in responses to the job

questions. Volatility in the responses could reflect changes in the composition of the respondents.

To remove a particularly important source of cyclical fluctuation in composition, we assign to the

currently unemployed a 100 percent chance of job loss, as we did in the Dominitz and Manski

(1997b) analysis of SEE data.

       The possible compositional changes notwithstanding, the findings on expectations of job loss

(V255) and re-employment prospects (V256) are interesting. The results reported in Tables 1G and

1H are very similar to those found for SEE respondents in the period 1994-1998 (Manski and Straub,

2000). The important new finding is that expectations vary little month-to-month. The mean

percent chance of job loss ranges from 19.0 in Sep-02 to 24.7 in Feb-03, and the median ranges from

5 to 10 percent. The mean likelihood of finding and accepting a job “at least as good” as the current
                                                  16

one ranges from 45.2 percent in Apr-03 to 49.6 in Aug-02, and the median remains constant at 50

percent. These results provide further evidence that personal expectations are not very volatile.

Note also that nonresponse is minimal: 1% overall for job loss, and 3% overall for the re-

employment question.



3.5. Covariation Among Expectations



       To conclude our analysis of temporal fluctuations in expectations, we examine how the eight

time-series shown in Tables 1A-1H covary over the 12-month period. Table 2 uses the Spearman

rank correlation to describe the ordinal covariation between each pair of time series. We use the

ranks of the relative scores to summarize the time series of responses to each qualitative question;

thus, variable BUS12 is ordered from a minimum rank of 1 in Mar-03 to a maximum rank of 12 in

May-03. We use the mean percent-chance to summarize the time series of responses to each

probabilistic question; thus, variable V250 is ordered from a minimum rank of 1 in Oct-02 to a

maximum rank of 12 in Jun-02.

       The table shows that the responses to each qualitative question covary very strongly with

each other. The rank correlations of all pairs of the variables (BUS12, PEXP, BEXP, INEXQ1) lie

in the range [0.72, 0.93]. This suggests that, from an ordinal perspective, the four qualitative

variables provide largely overlapping information on consumers’ expectations.

       In contrast, the responses to the four probabilistic questions covary weakly, if at all, with one

another. The rank correlations of all pairs of the variables (V250, V252, V255, V256) lie in the

range [-0.12, 0.23]. Thus, each of these four variables appears to provide distinct information on
                                                17

consumers’ expectations.

       Finally, consider the covariation of responses to the qualitative and probabilistic questions.

Responses to the qualitative macroeconomic questions (BUS12 and BEXP) covary moderately with

responses to the mutual-fund investment question (V250); the rank correlations are 0.58 and 0.46

respectively. However, responses to BUS12 and BEXP covary only weakly with responses to the

probabilistic question about personal income growth (V252); these rank correlations are 0.23 and

0.16. The responses to V252 covary more strongly with those to the two qualitative personal-

finance questions. The pair (V252, PEXP) has rank correlation 0.49, while (V252, INEXQ1) has

rank correlation 0.65. Viewed in their entirety, these findings make good sense; the highest rank

correlations occur between variables that inquire about the most closely related events.




4. Cross-Sectional Variation in Expectations



       Table 1 shows clearly that, at any point in time, expectations vary across the population. In

each month, a substantial fraction of respondents answering the qualitative questions report that

conditions, be they microeconomic or macroeconomic, will improve, whereas a substantial fraction

report that conditions will worsen. Similarly, probabilistic expectations vary substantially across

respondents. This is evident from the large standard deviations and interquartile ranges shown in

Tables 1E through 1G.

       This section examines how expectations vary with respondent attributes. The analysis pools

the samples of initial interviews from Jun-02 through May-03, which are independent random
                                                  18

samples of the population, yielding a total sample size of 3543. Cross-sectional variation may

reflect differences in the way that persons interpret the questions posed, rather than differences in

their expectations per se. This possibility seems most acute for the qualitative questions, as

respondents may reasonably differ in how they interpret the term “business conditions” or “better off

financially.” The discussion below focuses primarily on the percent-chance questions, which should

be less susceptible to variation in interpretation.



4.1. Univariate Analysis



       Table 3 reports a univariate analysis examining the cross-sectional variation in expectations

with each of several personal attributes.



Percent Chance Investment Expectations

       The results on investment expectations are particularly intriguing. In principle, all members

of the population have access to the same publicly available information about the stock market.

Hence, variation in responses to question V250 must reflect variation in the processing of public

information and/or variation in private information. We conjecture that most people have no

meaningful private information about the market. If so, then the observed variation in expectations

mainly reflects differences in the way people process the available public information. The

empirical existence of strong heterogeneity in investment expectations, already evident in Table 1E,

runs counter to the conventional rational expectations assumption that all persons process

information in the same way.
                                                 19

       Table 3A shows that some of this heterogeneity is systematic, in the sense that persons with

different demographic attributes have different distributions of expectations. We find that males

tend to be more optimistic than females. Optimism increases with schooling, from a mean (median)

of 38.4 (40) for those with no postsecondary education to 45.3 (50) for those with a bachelor’s

degree. Younger persons are more optimistic than older ones, with the mean (median) falling from a

46.3 (50) percent chance for respondents under age 35 to a 33.5 (25) percent chance for those 65 and

older. Most of this decline occurs at the highest age group. We also find variation by marital status,

which we conjecture to reflect variation by age. Most optimistic are the never married, who tend to

be young, and least optimistic are the widowed, who tend to be old. Finally, we find that

nonresponse is highest in the parts of the population that tend to be least optimistic.

       These findings raise important behavioral questions: (1) Why do investment expectations

vary so sharply and so systematically across the population? (2) How does the observed variation in

expectations affect investment behavior? The data available in the Survey of Consumers do not

enable us to answer these questions here, but we think them important subjects for future research.



Percent Chance Income Expectations

       Much of the variation in income expectations, described in Table 3B, resembles that found in

investment expectations. Males tend to be more optimistic than females, the young are more

optimistic than the old, and optimism increases with schooling. Unlike the case of a mutual fund

investment, income realizations actually do vary cross-sectionally. Moreover, income growth does

tend to be higher for males, the young, and the better educated. Thus, the findings on income

expectations broadly conform to observed variation in realizations, as has been found repeatedly
                                                  20

with expectations of personal events reported in SEE over the past decade. See, for example,

Dominitz and Manski (1997b) on health insurance coverage and job loss probabilities and Dominitz

(2001) on the central tendency and spread of income expectations.



Qualitative Expectations

       Table 3C describes the cross-sectional variation in responses to question BEXP, the more

precisely worded of the two qualitative questions on national business conditions. The responses

show the same ordinal patterns as the responses to investment question V250. Males are more

optimistic than females. Whites are more optimistic than others. Younger persons are more

optimistic than older ones. Optimism increases with schooling. Similarly, the variation in family

income expectations (INEXQ1), described in Table 3D, resembles that found for probabilistic

expectations of personal income growth.



4.2. Best Linear Predictors



       To jointly describe how expectations vary with multiple personal attributes and over time,

Table 4 presents best linear predictors under square loss of the probabilistic responses to the

investment and income questions. All but one of the ordinal patterns found in the univariate analysis

of Table 3 remain intact in this multivariate analysis. The one ordinal pattern that notably wanes is

the substantial variation in expectations with marital status, which corroborates our conjecture that

the univariate marital-status pattern actually reflects a pattern of variation with age.
                                                21



5. Temporal Fluctuations in Individual Expectations



       The analysis of Section 3 examined how the distribution of expectations changes over time.

With panel data available, another perspective on temporal fluctuations can be obtained from

analysis of changes over time in individual expectations. Although the Michigan survey does not

sample the same individuals each month, it does sample some individuals twice, at six-month

intervals. These data enable study of fluctuations in individual expectations.

       Table 5 shows linear auto-regressions of individual probabilistic expectations on the same

expectations lagged six months. We have also performed nonparametric auto-regressions, not

presented here, which yield findings very similar to those obtained with the linear fits. All auto-

regressions have substantial predictive power, lagged expectations being a strongly positive

predictor of expectations six months later. Thus, we find considerable stability over time in

individual expectations.

       This notwithstanding, we find that individual expectations do vary to some extent in the six

months between interviews. The slopes of the autoregressions of expectations for personal events

are steeper than those for investment outcomes. This suggests greater volatility in the latter

expectations.

       Table 6 shows transition matrices for responses to the ICS questions BUSI2 and PEXP.

Each matrix presents the probability that a person gives each of the three possible responses in the

re-interview conducted between Dec-02 and May-03, conditional on his response six months earlier.

The matrices show substantial positive dependency, with the probability of repeating the same
                                                22

response usually exceeding one-third by a substantial margin. The one exception is the rarely

chosen BUS12 response “pro-con.”

       Observe that the transition probabilities between positive and negative assessments of the

future are much higher for responses to the macroeconomic question BUS12 than to the

microeconomic question PEXP. In particular, 36% of those who initially foresee “good” business

conditions subsequently report “bad”, and 21% of those who initially foresee “bad” conditions

subsequently report “good.” In contrast, just 5% of those who initially think their family finances

will improve subsequently expect them to worsen, and just 16% with an initial report of “worse”

later say “better.” These results add yet further evidence that the qualitative expectations of

macroeconomic events elicited in the Survey of Consumers are more volatile than the expectations

of personal events.




6. Concluding Questions



       The Index of Consumer Sentiment is now constructed from responses to five questions, three

of which concern economic expectations, with each question given equal weight. The original

“index of consumer attitudes” included responses to a price expectations question as well. Except

for eliminating the question on price expectations, the definition of the index appears to have been

very stable for fifty years. Yet one of the principal investigators long ago called for careful

reconsideration of the index in the concluding paragraph of her paper:

       “The index of consumer attitudes which was related here to individual purchases is still in an
                                                 23

       experimental stage. Ahead is the challenging problem of seeing whether closer correlations

       with purchases can be established by improving the index—by adding new series, revising

       the weighting of components, and refining the attitudinal measures themselves” (Mueller,

       1957, p. 965).

Almost a half-century later, we take up the challenge to improve the measurement of consumer

confidence.

       The findings reported in this paper suggest that improvement is feasible. Drawing on these

findings, we close with three major questions regarding the effective measurement of consumer

confidence:



1. Should the Survey of Consumers and similar surveys ask consumers about national business

conditions?



2. Should the qualitative questions of the Survey of Consumers be continued as is, complemented by

probabilistic questions, or replaced by probabilistic questions?



3. Should the responses to the various questions be aggregated into an index or presented separately?

If an index is thought desirable, how should it be constructed?



       Although it is premature to assert definitive answers to these questions, we feel ready to offer

tentative responses, drawing in part on the findings of this paper. Regarding the first question, we

do not see an obvious rationale for asking consumers about such distant, ambiguous phenomena as
                                                         24

“national business conditions.” The respondents are not experts, as in the Livingston panel and the

Survey of Professional Forecasters.4 If the objective is to use expectations data to predict personal

consumption, expectations for the nation should be relevant only to the extent that they are an input

into formation of personal expectations. Hence, why not ask more questions that probe personal

expectations directly, and eliminate the questions on national business conditions? The case for this

change is especially strong if the month-to-month changes in the ICS are being driven largely by

spurious volatility in the responses to question BUS12.5

           We do think that consumers may usefully be queried about well-defined macroeconomic

events that are directly relevant to their personal lives. The question eliciting expectations for growth

in the value of a mutual-fund investment exemplifies what we have in mind. One might similarly

elicit expectations for aspects of government policy that directly affect consumer finances; for

example, tax policy and social security policy.

           Regarding the second question, we think that the traditional qualitative questions of

consumer-confidence surveys should at least complemented by, and perhaps replaced by,

probabilistic questions inquiring about well-defined events. Although probabilistic questioning has

obvious conceptual advantages, economists had little experience with it before the early 1990s, and

skepticism about its feasibility was rampant. However, substantial experience has accumulated in

the past ten years through the administration of probabilistic questions in SEE and in such major

national surveys as the Health and Retirement Study (Hurd and McGarry, 1995, 2002) and the


4
    These surveys of experts are described in Caskey (1985) and Keane and Runkle (1990), respectively.
           5
          A possible scientific reason to retain questions on national business conditions is to study expectations
formation; one may want to understand how individuals use their perspectives on national conditions to form their
personal expectations. This objective is distinct from the longstanding purpose of the Michigan survey. Moreover,
expectations formation may be much better studied through intensive interviewing than through short telephone surveys.
                                                 25

National Longitudinal Study of Youth-1997 Cohort (Fischhoff et al., 2000; Dominitz, Manski, and

Fischhoff, 2001). This experience, plus the new findings on the Survey of Consumers reported in

this paper, make plain that probabilistic questioning is feasible and yields richer information on

consumer beliefs than is obtainable with traditional qualitative questions.

       Finally, we suggest that the producers of consumer confidence statistics prominently report

their findings for separate questions. The responses to separate questions are much more readily

interpretable than are monthly reports of an index constructed from disparate, non-commensurate

elements. We do not go so far as to suggest a halt to reports of indices; simple summaries of masses

of data often are a practical necessity. However, we do think it long overdue to reconsider the

particular structure of the ICS and similar indices.

   Appendix C: “Percent Chance” Expectations Questions on the Survey of Consumers


V250
The next question is about investing in the stock market. Please think about the type of mutual fund
known as a diversified stock fund. This type of mutual fund holds stock in many different companies
engaged in a wide variety of business activities. Suppose that tomorrow someone were to invest one
thousand dollars in such a mutual fund. Please think about how much money this investment would
be worth one year from now.
       What do you think is the percent chance that this one thousand dollar investment will
increase in value in the year ahead, so that it is worth more than one thousand dollars one year from
now?


V251
What do you think is the percent chance that this one thousand dollar investment will increase in
value by more than ten percent in the year ahead, so that is it worth more than eleven hundred
dollars one year from now?


V252
Next I would like to ask you about your OWN (personal) income prospects in the next twelve
months. What do you think is the percent chance that your income in the next twelve months will
be higher than your income in the past twelve months?


V253
What do you think is the percent chance that your OWN (personal) income in the next twelve
months will be more than ten percent higher than your income in the past twelve months?


V255
What do you think is the percent chance that you will lose your job during the next twelve months?


V256
If you were to lose your job during the next twelve months, what do you think is the percent chance
that the job you eventually find and accept would be at least as good as your current job in terms of
wages and benefits?
