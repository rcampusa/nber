                                              ABSTRACT

We show that data on subjective expectations, especially on outcomes from counterfactual choices
and choice probabilities, are a powerful tool in recovering ex ante treatment effects as well as preferences
for different treatments. In this paper we focus on the choice of occupation, and use elicited beliefs
from a sample of male undergraduates at Duke University. By asking individuals about potential earnings
associated with counterfactual choices of college majors and occupations, we can recover the distribution
of the ex ante monetary returns to particular occupations, and how these returns vary across majors.
We then propose a model of occupational choice which allows us to link subjective data on earnings
and choice probabilities with the non-pecuniary preferences for each occupation. We find large differences
in expected earnings across occupations, and substantial heterogeneity across individuals in the
corresponding ex ante returns. However, while sorting across occupations is partly driven by the ex
ante monetary returns, non-monetary factors play a key role in this decision. Finally, our results point
to the existence of sizable complementarities between college major and occupations, both in terms
of earnings and non-monetary benefits.

1         Introduction
        Subjective expectations data are increasingly being used in economic research. While
early work focused on the accuracy of individual’s forecasts over objective events (Manski,
1993, 2004; Hurd and McGarry, 1995, 2002; Dominitz and Manski, 1996, 1997),1 more recent
work has used such forecasts in the estimation of structural dynamic models (Delavande,
2008; van der Klaauw and Wolpin, 2008; van der Klaauw, 2012). Using agents’ subjective
expectations requires fewer assumptions about how individuals form their beliefs about future
outcomes than is typically required to estimate such forward-looking models.
        Relatively new to the literature is the elicitation of: (i) probabilities of taking particular
courses of actions in the future and (ii) expectations about potential future outcomes corre-
sponding to counterfactual choices (or treatments) that are off the individual’s actual choice
path. We show that capturing future choice probabilities as well as expectations both on
and off the individual’s choice path can be a powerful tool in recovering treatments effects
as well as the non-pecuniary benefits associated with different treatments.2
        While the proposed approach can be applied to a broad class of potential outcomes mod-
els, in this paper we consider the role played by the expected, or ex ante, monetary returns
and non-pecuniary preferences in the choice of occupations for different college majors. As
recently emphasized in a series of papers on schooling decisions in the presence of hetero-
geneity and uncertainty (see, e.g., Carneiro et al., 2003; Cunha et al., 2005; Cunha and
Heckman, 2007; and Cunha and Heckman, 2008), agents’ decisions are based on ex ante
monetary returns, as opposed to ex post ones. Complementing this literature, we use data
that directly elicits agents’ ex ante returns, thus allowing us to remain agnostic about how
agents form their information sets. By using subjective expectations data on occupations for
all counterfactual majors, we are able to identify the separate influence of monetary returns
vs. non-pecuniary factors in the absence of exclusion restrictions.3
        There is substantial heterogeneity in earnings across majors and occupations. For in-
stance, data from the American Community Survey (2009-2010) reveal that those who ma-
    1

economics.
    2
      Related papers by Blass et al. (2010), Reuben et al. (2013), and Delavande and Zafar (2014) employ
elicited data on choice probabilities and expectations about counterfactual choices to estimate dynamic
structural models. Pantano and Zheng (2013) show how subjective expectations data about agents’ future
choices can be used to recover unobserved heterogeneity in dynamic structural models.
    3
      D’Haultfoeuille and Maurel (2013) investigate the relative importance of ex ante monetary returns versus
non-pecuniary factors in the decision to attend college. Their approach, which can be used in the absence
of subjective expectations data, does not require exclusion restrictions but does require imposing stronger
assumptions on the non-pecuniary factors. See also Eisenhauer et al. (2014), who use exclusion restrictions
between monetary returns and non-pecuniary factors to separately identify these two components.

jored in engineering earn as much as 77% more than those who majored in the humanities.
To the extent that a sizable fraction of college graduates work in an occupation which does
not match their major, those earnings differentials across majors mask the existence of sub-
stantial within-major dispersion.4 For instance, Kinsler and Pavan (2014) estimate that
there is a 30% premium for STEM college graduates who work in an occupation related to
their major. While these earnings differentials are based on individuals who chose particular
majors and occupations and, as such, are not causal, they clearly suggest that occupational
choice is a key economic decision, even after conditioning on college major. Occupations
also differ in a number of other, non-wage, dimensions. Preferences for these non-wage char-
acteristics are likely to be heterogeneous, in particular with respect to the chosen college
major.
       We use elicited beliefs from male undergraduates at Duke University to recover the distri-
bution of ex ante monetary returns to different occupations and to quantify the importance
of sorting across occupations on ex ante monetary returns versus preferences. This unique
dataset contains student expectations regarding the probability of working in different oc-
cupations as well as their expected income in each of the occupations where the period of
reference is ten years after they graduate.5 Importantly, these occupation probabilities and
expected incomes were asked not only for the major the individual chose but also for coun-
terfactual majors, making it possible to disentangle both the monetary returns from different
majors in different occupations as well as how attractive working in particular occupations
is with different majors. By doing so, we add to a growing set of papers using subjective
expectations data to distinguish between the role played by monetary returns versus non-
pecuniary preferences in individual decisions. While several papers have recently addressed
this question in the related context of college major and university choices (see, e.g., Zafar,
2011, 2013; Arcidiacono et al., 2012; Delavande and Zafar, 2014; Long et al., 2014; Stine-
brickner and Stinebrickner, 2014; and Wiswall and Zafar, 2014), our paper is, to the best of
our knowledge, the first to do so in the context of occupational choices.6
       The data allow us to identify both the ex ante treatment effects of particular occupations
(relative to a reference occupation) on earnings, for any given college major, as well as the

     See Altonji et al. (2012) for a recent review of the literature on college major and occupational choices.

     This dataset was previously used to examine the determinants of college major choice by Arcidiacono
et al. (2012). Their paper treated occupations as lotteries, where the lotteries were affected by the choice
of major. In this paper, we follow a more conventional route and treat occupations as choices, consistent
with, e.g., Miller (1984), Siow (1984), Keane and Wolpin (1997), Antonovics and Golan (2012) and van der
Klaauw (2012).
   6
     Related work by Osman (2014) uses subjective expectations data to investigate the determinants of the
decision to become self-employed, to engage in wage work, or to stay out of the labor force in a population
of Egyptian students graduating from a vocational high school.

ex ante treatment effects of particular majors on the probabilities of working in any given
occupation. Even though we do not observe the actual occupations chosen by the individuals,
we show that data on occupational choice subjective probabilities can be used to recover the
ex ante treatment effects of a given occupation for the subpopulation of individuals who will
end up working in that occupation (ex ante treatment effect on the treated). Taking the
initial major as given, the ex ante treatment effect on the treated for a given occupation k
is estimated by weighting the reported earnings differences between occupation k and the
reference occupation by the probability the individual reports that he will work in occupation
k (over the average declared probability of working in that occupation). Ex ante treatment
effect on the untreated are obtained similarly, by using instead the declared probability that
the individual will not work in occupation k. Importantly, our data allows us to go beyond
these average effects and investigate the heterogeneity across individuals by estimating the
full distributions of the ex ante treatment effects of working in any given occupation k relative
to education. Data on occupational choice probabilities further allows us to recover the
distribution of the ex ante treatment effects within the treated and untreated subpopulations.
   The results reveal substantial differences in expected earnings across occupations. Treat-
ing the education occupation as the baseline, the average ex ante return range from 31%
higher earnings (science) to as much as 124% higher earnings (business) ten years after grad-
uation. The ex ante returns are higher for the treated than for the untreated, suggesting
positive selection into occupations based on the monetary returns. We also document the
existence of a large degree of heterogeneity in the ex ante returns for each occupation across
college majors, consistent with the accumulation of occupation-specific human capital within
each major. For example, natural sciences majors anticipate a premium for a health career
(relative to education) that is more than five times larger than the premium that public
policy majors anticipate for the same occupation.
   We next propose a model of occupational choice where individuals are uncertain over their
preferences for particular occupations in the future. This simple framework allows us to link
the subjective data on expected earnings and choice probabilities with the non-pecuniary
preferences for each occupation. Under standard assumptions, unobserved preferences will
have continuous support over the real line, implying that perceived occupation probabilities
should be bounded away from zero and one. However, in our sample, a sizable fraction of
individuals do report zero probabilities of pursuing a particular occupation, conditional on
a particular major. To reconcile our conceptual framework with the elicited choice proba-
bilities, we assume that the resolution of preference uncertainty is costly to agents. That
is, we suppose that individuals must bear a cost to acquire additional information about
a given occupation, and that they will only do so if the expected benefits of doing so are

                                               3
sufficiently high. In estimation, we follow Hotz and Miller (1993) and Berry (1994) and
invert the perceived choice probabilities, taking into account the selection introduced by
costly information acquisition, to recover labor supply elasticities for each occupation and
preferences over occupation-major combinations.
        Our empirical model of agents’ valuations of occupations – which depend, in part, on
the expected incomes elicited for each occupation – allows us to estimate the labor sup-
ply elasticities for each occupation, along with the aggregate preferences over the different
occupation-major combinations and the heterogeneity in preferences for each occupation.
While we find significant and sizable earnings elasticities of occupational choice, our esti-
mates reveal that non-wage factors play a key role in the choice of occupation. In particular,
our results are consistent with the existence of large willingnesses-to-pay for non-wage char-
acteristics of the occupation-major combinations. For instance, an economics major would
need to make more than three times as much in education to be indifferent between education
and business.7
        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the survey data
used in the paper. Section 3 shows how to obtain ex ante treatment effects given the data,
and then discuss the estimated treatment effects. We then link the subjective occupational
choice probabilities and expected incomes with a model of occupational choice in Section
4. In Section 5, we discuss the estimation results of the occupational choice model and
the possible role that factors like differences in occupation-specific job offer arrival rates by
college majors might play in accounting for the large willingnesses-to-pay for the non-wage
components. Finally, we offer some concluding comments in Section 6.


2          Data
        We use data from the Duke College Major and Expectations Survey (DuCMES) that was
collected on a sample of male undergraduate students at Duke University between February
and April 2009.8 Gender was the only restriction on sample recruitment; male students
from any major, class, or race were eligible to participate in the survey. Sample members
were recruited by posting flyers around the Duke campus. Surveys were administered on
computers in a designated room in Duke’s Student Union. All 173 students who completed
    7
     As we discuss in Section 5, the large differences in willingness-to-pay for non-wage features of occupations
could also arise from differences in job arrival rates among the different major-occupation combinations.
Regardless of the mechanism, our results provide clear evidence that majors have a substantial influence on
occupations well beyond their impact on earnings.
   8
      Arcidiacono et al. (2012) also use the DuCMES data employed in this paper. We refer the reader to
that paper for a more comprehensive overview of the data.

       The DuCMES collected information on students’ background characteristics and their
current or intended major.10 Table 1 presents a descriptive overview of our sample. The
composition of our sample corresponds fairly closely to the Duke male undergraduate student
body. The sample includes slightly more Asians and fewer Latinos and Blacks than in the
Duke male student body, and it overrepresents students in natural science majors while
underrepresenting students in public policy.11 It also appears that a higher percentage of
the sample receives some financial aid than is the case in the Duke student body, although
the 22.0% figure for the student body is based on aid provided by Duke, whereas the higher
percentage of students receiving financial aid (40.5%) is likely due in part to the fact that
our survey asked about receipt of financial aid, regardless of source. Finally, we note that
the sample is slightly tilted towards upper-classmen.
       The DuCMES elicited from the students their expectations about their likelihood of
choosing future careers and how much they expected to earn in them. Specifically, for each
of the six majors groups displayed in the Table 1, we asked students the probability that they
would enter a particular career and the earnings they would expect to receive in that career
10 years after graduation. We used the following six broad career groups to characterize
possible careers: Science/Technology, Health, Business, Government/Non-Profit, Education
and Law. It is important to note that for all students in the sample, those probabilities and
expected earnings are elicited for all possible occupation-major combinations, i.e. both for
the chosen (or intended) majors and the counterfactual majors.
       Table 2 reports the mean expected incomes for the various major-occupation combina-
tions.12 Expected incomes exhibit sizable variation both across majors and occupations. For
instance, majoring in the natural sciences or engineering is perceived to lead to higher earn-
ings in science and health careers, while expected earnings in business are on average higher
   9
     We drop from our analysis five individuals who reported that they would choose one occupation with
certainty for each major, resulting in a final sample of 168 students.
  10
     In most of the paper we refer for simplicity to the current or intended major as
the chosen major.          A copy of the questionnaire used in the survey can be found at
www.econ.duke.edu/∼vjh3/working papers/college major questionnaire.pdf and is discussed further in Kang
(2009).

      The mapping of students’ actual college majors into the major groups displayed in Table 1 are found
in the Appendix to Arcidiacono et al. (2012).
  12
     In our sample, only 1.6% of the expected earnings are missing. For these cases, expected earnings,
for each major and occupation, are set equal to the predicted earnings computed from a linear regression
of log-earnings on major and occupation indicators, interaction between major and occupation, individual-
specific average log-earnings across all occupations and majors and an indicator for whether the subjective
probability of working in this occupation is equal to zero. One individual in our sample declared that he
expected to earn $1,000 for some occupation-major combinations. We assume that this individual declared
monthly rather than yearly incomes, and rescale his expected income accordingly.

for economics majors. Differences across occupations are even starker. In particular, average
expected incomes are lowest for a career in education and generally highest for a career in
law, with the exception of natural sciences and economics majors for which expected incomes
are highest for health and business occupations, respectively.
       Table 3 presents the average subjective probabilities of working in each occupation that
were elicited from students who were asked to condition on having majored in each of the
various subject areas. The subjective probabilities of entering each occupation vary substan-
tially across majors. It is worth noting that none of the majors are concentrated into one, or
even two, occupations. For any given major, the average subjective probabilities are larger
than 10% for at least three occupations. Even for majors which appear to be more tied to
a specific occupation, such as business for economics majors, the corresponding subjective
probabilities exhibit a fairly large dispersion across individuals (see Figure 1). Overall, the
likelihood of working in the various occupations appear to be selectively different across
individuals, even after conditioning on a college major.13
       Table 4 reports the prevalence of zero probability reported by students, for each major-
occupation combination.14 While some combinations display a large share of zero subjective
probabilities, the shares stay well away from one, suggesting that particular majors do not
rule out certain occupations for all individuals.



  13
     Results for other combinations of occupations and majors are not reported here to save space, but are
available from the authors upon request.
  14
     The survey design was such that the default values of the subjective probabilities were set equal to zero
for all occupation-major combinations. As a result, it might be that some of the zero probabilities observed
in the data reflect missing probabilities rather than true zeros. However, in the former case, it seems likely
that the latent (unobserved) probabilities are typically close to zero, so that aggregating these two types of
zero probabilities should not be too much of a concern.

       Since it is important for the rest of our analysis that the elicited expectations, in particular
over future incomes, reflect actual beliefs, we attempt to assess how reasonable they are by
comparing them with data form the American Community Survey (ACS). From this set of
comparisons, we can see where Duke students believe they rank relative to the population of
college graduates who actually chose particular major-occupation combinations. We utilize
data on wages, college major, and current occupation from the 2009-2011 ACS. We limit the
ACS sample to males between the ages of 29 and 35, with a reported major field for their
college degree.15 Majors in the ACS were categorized similarly to the Duke data. Several
majors in the ACS are not offered at Duke; to the extent they clearly fell into one of the six
major categories, they were included in that category.16 Occupations were constructed by
matching the occupations categories in the ACS with the occupation groupings in the Duke
data.17
       To compare the ACS earnings to the expected earnings from the DuCMES data, we
estimated the following regression using the ACS sample:

                                      ln(wijk ) = αjk + βk agei + νijk ,                                 (2.1)

where wijk is the annual earnings of person i with major j and occupation k and νijk is
an unobserved idiosyncratic shock, αjk is a vector of dummy variables for each major j-
occupation k pair and age effects (βk ) are allowed to differ across occupations. The results
of this regression were then used to estimate the distributions of log-earnings at age 32 for
  15
     The Duke respondents, on average, would be of age 32 ten years after graduation.
  16
     Most of the excluded majors were health services majors and vocational majors such as construction
services.
  17
     Science, computing, and engineering occupations were coded as science and technology careers; medicine
was coded as a health career; business and finance were coded as business careers; legal was coded as a law ca-
reer; nonprofit occupations as well as local, state or federal occupations were coded as government/nonprofit.

each occupation-major combination, enabling the comparison of the ACS labor earnings with
the distributions of expected earnings of the Duke students in our sample.
       In Table 5, we present the percentile of the distribution of predicted ACS earnings at
which the median Duke student who chose major j would fall based on their elicited expected
earnings in each occupation. The percentiles are all above 50% but generally below 90%,
with most entries in the seventies and eighties. These numbers seem reasonable given that
Duke is a highly selective institution, generally ranked in the top 10 according to U.S. News
& World Report.
       Finally, we provide some preliminary evidence about the role played by expected earnings
in the choice of occupation by presenting students’ expected earnings associated with each
of the possible majors under two different scenarios about occupations in Table 6. In the
first (“Reported Probabilities”), expected earnings are based on the weighted average of
elicited earnings for the different occupations, where the weights are the individual subjective
probabilities of working in each occupation that were elicited from students. In the second
(“Random Assignment”), we weight instead by the average subjective probability of choosing
each occupation conditional on major.
       Comparing the first two columns (see column labeled “Difference”), we find that students’
expected earnings are higher using their reported probabilities of sorting into occupations
relative to the case where the weights are the average probabilities of each occupation con-
ditional on major. This pattern provides evidence of sizable monetary gains to sorting,
consistent with the individuals pursuing their comparative advantage when choosing an oc-
cupation.18
  18
    Since we are using subjective data, one might be concerned that these gains to sorting are partly driven
by ex post rationalization. However, our respondents are college students and we suspect most of them had
not chosen an occupation at the time of our survey. This is confirmed by the fact that the share of subjective
probabilities larger than 80% is less than 5% for 90% of the respondents, suggesting that the vast majority
of these students were not yet committed to a particular occupation.

3     Ex ante treatment effects
    In this section we outline the different types of ex ante treatment effects we are interested
in can be measured and show the corresponding effects in our data. We begin by consid-
ering standard treatment effect measures such as the average treatment effect, the average
treatment on the treated, and the average treatment on the untreated. We then show how
to calculate the full distribution of the various treatment effects and report examples from
certain occupations. Finally, we consider treatment effects conditional on different choices
of major.


3.1     Average treatment effects
    We define the ex ante treatment effects of working in particular occupations on earnings
relative to pursuing a career in education, which serves as our baseline occupation and is
labeled as occupation k = 1.19 For any given individual i, the ex ante treatment effect of
occupation k ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, conditional on majoring (or intending to major) in field j,
is simply given by wijk − wij1 where wijk is individual i’s expected earnings in occupation
k given major j. These ex ante treatment effects are directly observed in our data. The
  19
     We choose to use education as a baseline because the earnings in this occupation do not vary much
across college majors (see Table 2), thus making it easier to interpret the heterogeneity across majors in the
ex ante treatment effects.




                                                     11
average ex ante treatment effect of occupation k, denoted by AT E(k), is then defined by:
                                                                                            !

                         AT E(k) := E                            I(di = j) [wijk − wij1 ]       (3.1)
                                                         j


where I(di = j) is an indicator for whether i chose (or intends to choose) major j. This
population parameter is estimated using its sample analog:
                                         P P
                                                 i           j   I(di = j) [wijk − wij1 ]
                          \
                         AT E(k) :=                                                       ,     (3.2)
                                                                       N

where N is the sample size.
   Similarly, we estimate the ex ante treatment effect of occupation k on the treated by
weighting the differences in the reported earnings between occupation k and the baseline
occupation by the probability the individual reports that he will work in occupation k 10
years after graduation (over the sum of declared probabilities of working in occupation k).
That is:                             P P
                                         i           I(di = j)pijk [wijk − wij1 ]
                                                     j
                         T\
                          T (k) :=                   P P                          ,             (3.3)
                                                      i   j I(di = j)pijk

where pijk is the elicited probability from individual i that he would choose occupation k
given major j.
   Finally, the ex ante treatment effect of occupation k on the untreated is estimated by:
                                   P P
                                     i       I(di = j)(1 − pijk ) [wijk − wij1 ]

                     T\
                      U T (k) :=             P P                                 .              (3.4)
                                              i   j I(di = j)(1 − pijk )


                           \
   The estimated effects, AT E(k), T\
                                    T (k) and T\
                                               U T (k), defined in (3.2), (3.3), and (3.4),
respectively, are not based on actual occupational choices, since these students have not yet
chosen an occupation. Rather, we use students’ elicited probabilities of choosing the various
occupations to characterize these choices.
   Table 7 presents estimates of the three ex ante treatment effects of working in particular
occupations on earnings 10 years after graduation which correspond to the estimators defined
earlier in (3.2)-(3.4). Relative to education, the average ex ante treatment effects range from
$22,541 for science (30.6% of the mean expected earnings in education) to as much as $91,181
in business (123.9% of the mean expected earnings in education). Health, business and law
careers all have very large earnings premia of over 94%, while those working in a science
or government occupation expect a much smaller premium of 30.6% to 35.7% ten years
after graduation. Consistent with positive sorting across occupations, our estimates show


                                                                 12

that, for each occupation, the untreated anticipate lower premia than the treated. The
difference is particularly large for health occupations, where the expected premium is almost
two times smaller for the untreated. These sorting effects turn out to be much weaker for
science careers, where the untreated anticipate to earn 70% as much as the treated, and are
negligible for government careers.


3.2    Full distribution of treatment effects
   Importantly, our data allows us to generate not only average effects, but also estimate the
distributions of the ex ante treatment effects of working in any given occupation k, relative
to the baseline occupation. We estimate the distributions of the ex ante treatment effects,
conditional on students’ initial college major choice, for three different subgroups of interest,
namely (i) the overall population, (ii) the treated subpopulation, and (iii) the untreated
subpopulation. We briefly sketch below the steps involved in their estimation.
   First, the density of the distribution of the ex ante treatment effects on the overall
population can be simply estimated with a kernel density estimator, using the fact that we
have direct measures of the ex ante treatment effects for each occupation k, k = 2, ..., 6, for
each student in our sample. We denote the resulting density by fT E,k (·) and its estimator
by f\
    T E,k (·).

   Second, it follows from Bayes’ rule that we can estimate the density of the distribution of
the ex ante treatment effects on the treated subpopulation, denoted by fTTE,k
                                                                          reated

       Finally, we note that the distribution of the ex ante treatment effects on the untreated
can be estimated by replacing pijk with (1 − pijk ) in (3.5).
       Figures 2, 3, and 4 plot the densities of the ex ante treatment on the treated and treatment
on the untreated for government, health, and business occupations, respectively.20 Each of
the figures shows a different pattern of selection. For government, the distributions for the
treated and the untreated are essentially the same: there is little role for selection into
government jobs, at least relative to education. For health, the treated distribution is to the
right of the untreated distribution, suggesting substantial positive selection. For business
careers, while there appears to be significant selection at the bottom end of the distribution,
the discrepancy between the two distributions is attenuated in the top end. This latter
pattern suggests that there is a significant group of individuals who would do quite well
in business—essentially as well as the highest returns individuals from the treated group—
but whose preferences, or expected earnings in other occupations, lead them away from
business. Overall, these results suggest that there is much more to the distributions of ex
ante treatment effects than just their means.

                      U T (k) and AT E(k) are obtained by averaging over different choices of
college major, we also can estimate the ex ante treatment effects of occupations conditional

ex ante treatment on the treated and treatment on the untreated for each chosen major j

Given that we also elicit the subjective expectations for counterfactual majors, we can es-
timate the ex ante treatment effects for those who did not choose major j by replacing
I(di = j) with I(di 6= j).
   In Table 8, we present the treatment effect parameters conditional on students’ chosen
majors. There is a substantial amount of heterogeneity in the expected earnings premium
for a given occupation across majors. Notably, natural science majors expect on average a
$136,450 premium for a health career relative to education, which is more than five times
larger than the $24,660 premium expected by public policy majors who anticipate to enter
this type of occupation. Examining some of the other average ex ante returns, economics
majors have the highest premium for business occupations, while engineering and natural
science majors have the highest premia for science careers. Overall, these patterns provide
evidence of complementarities between majors and occupations. In particular, the major-
occupation pairs that are typically thought of as being closely related to one another – such as
economics and business, natural science and health, as well as engineering or natural science
and science occupations – do have the highest premia. While these results are consistent
with the accumulation of occupation-specific human capital within each major, they are also
consistent with a form of selectivity in choice of major, whereby individuals who expect to
be more productive in health are more likely to choose a natural science major.
   As can be seen in Table 8, ex ante treatment effects on the untreated by student’s major
generally are lower than the treatment effects on the treated, similar to the results obtained
without conditioning on the major (Table 7). There are, however, a couple of exceptions.
For instance, ex ante returns to science careers are higher for the untreated in social science
majors, while ex ante returns to government careers are higher for the untreated in the
humanities and social sciences. The differences between the ex ante treatment effects on the
treated and the ex ante treatment effects on the untreated effects provide, for each major,
a measure of the importance of selection on the expected returns to each occupation. For a
majority of occupation-major pairs, this difference is positive, consistent with positive sorting
on expected earnings in different occupations, but the differences tend to be quantitatively
small. Notable exceptions include legal careers for social sciences majors, where selection
explains more than 40% of the expected premium among the treated, as well as government
careers for science majors, where selection accounts for around half of the expected premium.
   Finally, Table 9 provides estimates of the three ex ante treatment effects by counterfactual
major. The treatment effects on the treated are again generally larger than the treatment
effects on the untreated. It is worth noting that these ex ante treatment effects also exhibit

                                                 18
a substantial degree of heterogeneity across majors. Notably, expected premia for business
careers are higher for economics majors, while returns to science careers are higher for
engineering and natural science majors. The fact that these types of complementarities
between majors and occupations still hold when focusing on the majors which were not
chosen by the individuals points to the accumulation of occupation-specific human capital
within majors.21


4        An estimable occupational choice model using sub-
         jective expectations data
       In this section we layout a model of occupational choice that can be estimated with
elicited data on expected earnings in each occupation and expected probabilities of choosing
alternative occupations. The key purpose of this framework is to provide a link between
subjective expectations and preferences for occupations, which will allow us to estimate
the labor supply elasticities for particular occupations along with the preferences over the
different occupation-major combinations. In this model, the choice of an occupation is char-
acterized in three stages. First, an individual enrolls in a given college major. Second, upon
completing one’s major, the individual decides whether or not to acquire more information
about the value of a set of particular occupations. Finally, after receiving this information
about selected occupations, the individual makes a one-time decision regarding his occupa-
tion.


4.1       Choice of occupations
       We begin by examining the last decision, namely the choice of occupation conditional on
graduating from college in a given major and having paid the information cost for a subset of
the occupations. This information cost can be thought of as the cost of applying or qualifying
for an occupation, such as the costs of taking the bar exam or acquiring certification for
a medical occupation. Let vijk denote the expected present value of lifetime utility for
individual i from choosing occupation k conditional on major j, prior to the acquisition of this
occupation-specific information. Individuals form their subjective expectations regarding the
probabilities of entering different careers based on these conditional value functions. The new
information consists of a vector of shocks, or innovations, ijk , that vary at the individual-
  21
    See also Kinsler and Pavan (2014) on the importance of major-specific human capital. They find, using
data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, that individuals have higher wages when
working in an occupation related to one’s field of study compared to working in non-related occupations.

major-occupation level. For any given major j, we assume that the ijk ’s are independent
draws from a standard Type 1 Extreme Value distribution. After choosing a major and
graduating from college, these information shocks are realized for the subset of occupations
where the individual has paid for the new information and the individual proceeds to choose
an occupation. An individual who chose major j then chooses his occupation k ∗ according
to:
                                        k ∗ = arg max∗ (vijk + ijk ),                              (4.1)
                                                  k∈Kij

where Kij∗ is the set of occupations where the individual has paid for the new informa-
tion conditional on graduating from major j. We will discuss the decision to acquire more
information about particular occupations in Section 5.3.


4.2        Using subjective probabilities to characterize preferences for
           occupations
       Individuals’ self-reports of the probabilities of choosing particular occupations, i.e., the
pijk ’s, can be used to recover their expected utilities up to a reference alternative. To see this,
first consider the case where it is optimal for the individual to pay the informational cost for
all possible occupations, conditional on major j. With the Type 1 Extreme Value assumption
on the ijk ’s, we can recover the difference in conditional value functions (vijk − vij1 ) by
inverting the choice probabilities following Hotz and Miller (1993) and Berry (1994):

                                    ∆ ln pijk := ln(pijk ) − ln(pij1 )
                                                = vijk − vij1 .                                     (4.2)

       In order to tell apart the role played by ex ante returns versus preferences, we need to
impose some structure on the value functions. Specifically, we assume that the conditional
value functions, for any given major j and occupation k, can be written as follows:

                                   vijk = αik + δjk + ψw ln wijk + ηijk ,                           (4.3)

where αik is the preference individual i has for occupation k, δjk captures the average com-
plementarity of preferences between major j and occupation k, wijk is the expected earnings
elicited from i under choices {j, k}, and ηijk is a preference term for occupation k, conditional
on major j, which is assumed to be randomly distributed in the population and uncorrelated
with ln wijk or αik .22 Similar to Arcidiacono (2004, 2005), the value functions are assumed to
  22
       In practice, monetary or psychic costs of schooling associated with the occupations which typically


                                                     22
depend on future labor market outcomes through the logarithm of the expected earnings.23
Taking the difference with respect to the baseline occupation, it follows that:

          ∆ ln pijk = (αik − αi1 ) + (δjk − δj1 ) + ψw (ln wijk − ln wij1 ) + (ηijk − ηij1 )
                      = g (∆ ln wijk , ∆αik , ∆δjk , ψw ) + ζijk ,                                       (4.4)

where ∆ ln wijk := ln wijk − ln wij1 , ∆αik := αik − αi1 , ∆δjk := δjk − δj1 ,
g (∆ ln wijk , ∆αik , ∆δjk , ψw ) := ∆αik + ∆δjk + ψw ∆ ln wijk and ζijk := ηijk − ηij1 .


    If all of the elicited probabilities are strictly bounded between zero and one, then the
estimation of the parameters in (4.4) is straightforward since we observe, for each individ-
ual in the sample, the elicited probabilities, pijk , and expected future earnings, wijk , for
all occupation-major pairs (k, j). Variation across majors in occupation-specific subjective
probabilities and expected earnings plays a key role in telling apart ex ante returns and
preferences, similar to the longitudinal variation used by Wiswall and Zafar (2014) in the
context of college major choices. However, if any pijk ’s are zero, as is the case in our data,
we have to account for the selectivity of this event. It is important to do so since those who
report a zero probability for a given major-occupation pair presumably attach a low value
to this alternative. In the next section, we characterize this process in terms of individuals
choosing whether or not to acquire more information before entering an occupation.


4.3     Decision to acquire information about occupations
    We now consider the information acquisition stage of the occupational choice model.
Given that the information shocks ijk are assumed to have continuous support over the real
line, the subjective probabilities would never be zero if information was costless to acquire.
In fact, as summarized in Table 4, there is a significant share of zero probabilities. To
reconcile our model with the data, we assume that information about occupations is costly
and individuals may choose not to bother acquiring it for some occupations in which case
they report that they would not enter such occupations. We develop this logic below and
what we can learn about the costs of acquiring information about occupations.
require an advanced degree, such as Law, would also be captured by these preference terms. Therefore, it
seems likely that our empirical strategy will lead to underestimates of the true preferences for those specific
occupations.
  23
     While forward-looking individuals should consider the present value of lifetime earnings associated with
each occupation, in practice we only observe the expected earnings ten years after graduation. However,
we show in Appendix A that, under some plausible assumptions on the discount factor, worklife duration
and earnings growth, the earnings ten years out are, up to a multiplicative constant, a reasonably good
approximation of the present value of lifetime earnings.

                                                      23
       We assume that the decision to acquire information depends on expectations of the
maximal utility associated with different choice sets. Given the Type-1 Extreme Value
assumptions regarding the distribution of the ’s, it follows from McFadden (1978) that the
                                                                                (K)
expected maximum utility for any choice set K, denoted by Vij , can be written as:
                                                  "                    #
                                     (K)

                                   Vij     = ln             exp(vijk ) + γ,                              (4.5)
                                                      k∈K


where γ is Euler’s constant. Denote {k(1), k(2), . . . , k(6)} the occupation indices reordered
such that vijk(1) is the highest payoff (prior to the new information), vijk(2) the next highest
payoff, etc.. Let c denote the utility cost of obtaining information on a particular occupation,
which for simplicity is supposed to be constant across individuals, occupations and majors.
Individuals will choose to obtain this information only if the expected utility gain exceeds the
cost of acquiring it. Thus, individual i will choose to acquire information on the occupation
with the mth highest expected payoff, k(m), so long as:

                                            m
                                                                   !           m−1

                                                  `=1 exp(vijk(`) )

                                                  `=1   exp(vijk(`) )

where pijk(m) denotes the probability of choosing occupation k(m) (given major j) among the
set of occupations {k(1), k(2), . . . , k(m)}. It follows that Kij∗ , defined as individual i’s choice
set of occupations for major j, consists of the occupations for which condition (4.6) holds,
i.e., Kij∗ := {k(1), k(2), . . . , k(m∗ij )}, where k(m∗ij ) is the last occupation in the value-ordered
sequence of occupations for individual i, conditional on major j, for which (4.6) holds. It
follows from condition (4.6) that c may be consistently estimated by − ln(1 − p), where p
denotes the smallest positive self-reported probability of choosing any of the occupations,
conditional on any of the majors, that is found in the data. In practice, we choose to
estimate c using instead the 10th smallest positive self-reported probability from the sample.
The resulting estimator presents the advantage of being less sensitive to outliers, while still
being consistent.24
  24
    We also checked the sensitivity of our analysis to the use of the 5th smallest positive self-reported
probability. The estimation results were qualitatively, and in most cases quantitatively, similar. These
results are available from the authors upon request.

4.4       Selectivity of elicited zero choice probabilities
       Reports of zero probabilities can not be ignored in estimating the parameters of (4.3)
if there are selective differences in preferences across individuals. Those who report zero
probabilities are likely to have relatively low valuations for the associated occupation-major
pairs. In the following we characterize the selectivity of those zero probabilities using the
information acquisition model presented above.25
       Consider some occupation k 0 that is not in individual i’s choice set, Kij∗ , when he condi-
tions on major j. The individual’s expected payoff for this occupation did not warrant him
bearing the information cost to learn more about this occupation; as a result, the inequality
in (4.6) is flipped and given by:
                                         c > − ln(1 − pijk0 ).                                    (4.7)

where, with a slight abuse of notation, pijk0 denotes the counterfactual probability of choosing
occupation k 0 if that occupation was in the choice set. pijk0 is therefore not observed in the
data. However, one can express pijk0 as a function of the information cost c and the vijk ’s for
those occupations for which i reported non-zero choice probabilities. To see this, note that
pijk0 can be written as the following function of the valuations of occupation k 0 and of the
occupations in Kij∗ for which information was acquired (assuming without loss of generality
that the baseline occupation, k = 1, belongs to the choice set Kij∗ ):

                                              exp(vijk0 )
                        pijk0 =                 P
                                  exp(vijk0 ) + h∈K ∗ exp(vijh )
                                                         ij

                                                  exp(vijk0 − vij1 )
                              =                         P                        .                (4.8)
                                  exp(vijk0   − vij1 ) + h∈K ∗ exp(vijh − vij1 )
                                                              ij



Substituting the righthand side of (4.8) for pijk0 in the inequality in (4.7) and manipulating
the resulting inequality, one can express the (relative) valuation for occupation k 0 , vijk0 −vij1 ,

where the term c∗ij in the last line of (4.9) is a function of the non-zero choice probabilities
for occupations in Kij∗ elicited from individual i and the information cost. It follows from
(4.9) and the expression for vijk0 − vij1 implied by (4.4) that:

                                c∗ij − g (∆ ln wijk0 , ∆αik0 , ∆δjk0 , ψw ) ≥ ζijk0 .                        (4.10)

       Our model of occupational choice takes the form of a generalized censored regression
model, which is estimated via Maximum Likelihood. Assuming that the preference terms
ηijk are i.i.d., following a Type 1 extreme value distribution with scale parameter γ (whose
                                                                         −x/γ

are independent across individuals i’s and majors, but correlated across occupations.
       Taking as given the information cost c which has been estimated in a first step, it follows
that the likelihood function for the parameters θ := {{αik }i,k {δjk }j,k , ψw , γ} takes the form

    The proposed estimator of the information cost c (see Section 4.3) is a fixed-order statistic. This
estimator can be shown, under some regularity conditions on the lower tail of the distribution of the choice
probabilities pijk , to converge to the truth at a faster than parametric rate (see van der Vaart, 1998, Section
21.4). It follows that c can be treated as known when conducting inference on the parameters θ.

uijk := ∆ ln pijk −g (∆ ln wijk , ∆αik , ∆δjk , ψw ) and ωijk := c∗ij −g (∆ ln wijk , ∆αik , ∆δjk , ψw ).27


       Finally, it is worth noting that students may have better information about the labor
market for some majors than others. In particular, it may be the case that individuals have
better information about the labor market related to their own major than in counterfactual
majors. Our model can be relaxed to allow for counterfactual majors to have higher variances
associated with the information shocks. Absent additional assumptions, discrete choice
models are only identified up to a scale parameter. Implicit in (4.4) is a normalization of
the scale of the Type 1 extreme value distribution of ijk to 1. With the structure we have
placed on (4.4), we can allow for the variance of ijk to be different for counterfactual majors,
                                                            g (∆ ln wijk ,∆αik ,∆δjk ,ψw )         γ
which amounts to substituting in the likelihood (4.11)               1+ωI(di =j)
                                                                                           and 1+ωI(d i =j)

for g (∆ ln wijk , ∆αik , ∆δjk , ψw ) and γ, respectively. If ω is greater than zero, then students
are less certain about outcomes in counterfactual majors than they are in their own majors.


5        Results: Occupational choice model
5.1       The effects of expected earnings
       Estimates of the earning parameter, ψw , for different specifications of the conditional
valuation functions are given in Table 10. Model 3 corresponds to our baseline specification
(Equation (4.3)). For each of the specifications, the estimated effect of (log-)expected earn-
ings is positive and statistically significant at any standard significance level. These results
stress the importance of allowing for complementarities of preferences between majors and
occupations, with the estimated earning parameters being cut by 40% after controlling for
the occupation-major dummies.28
       The final column of Table 10 presents estimates when the variance on the new information
is allowed to differ between chosen and counterfactual majors, as discussed earlier. The
coefficient estimate for ω is positive but small, consistent with the log-likelihood and earnings
  27
      Our framework corresponds to a nonlinear panel data model with fixed effects, where the longitudinal
dimension is given by the college majors j ∈ {1, . . . , 6}. It follows that our MLE estimator is in principle
subject to the incidental parameter problem (Neyman and Scott, 1948). We investigated this issue in our
context using Monte Carlo simulations, which point to fairly small finite sample biases (of the order of 10%)
affecting our parameters of interest.
   28
      For all these specifications, the information cost c is estimated in a first step using the 10th smallest
positive self-reported probability from the sample. The cost can be expressed in terms of percentage decrease
in (expected) earnings ten years after graduation by dividing it by the effect of earnings differentials coefficient
ψw , resulting in estimates ranging from 0.7% (Model 1) to 1.2% (Model 2).



                                                        27
parameter estimate being stable between Columns (3) and (4). Given these results, we focus
in the following on Model 3 as our preferred specification.
       To quantify the extent to which expected earnings affects occupational choice, we calcu-
late the percentage change in the probability of choosing an occupation given a percentage
change in expected earnings, denoted by eijk . The elasticity formula for our specification is
(see, e.g., Train, 2003):
                                           eijk = (1 − pijk )ψw .                                        (5.1)

Note that this formula only applies for the intensive margin, that is for those individuals
such that the subjective probability pijk is strictly bounded between 0 and 1. For those
individuals in our sample, the subjective probabilities of entering a given career conditional
on a given major range from 0.003 to 0.962, yielding elasticities from 0.04 to 0.95 for our
preferred specification (Model 3). Taking the chosen (or intended) major from the data as
given, we can estimate the average elasticity for occupation k using:
                                           P P
                                            i    j   I(di = j)(1 − pijk )ψ
                                                                         cw
                                  eˆk :=                                                                 (5.2)

      cw denotes the maximum likelihood estimate of ψw (ψ
                                                        cw = 0.950 for our preferred
specification). These occupation-specific elasticities range from 0.70 (for business) to 0.86
(for education), resulting in a mean elasticity across all occupations equal to 0.79. It is
worth noting that these elasticities are sizable, especially in comparison with the very low
earnings elasticities which have been found in the literature on college major choices (see,
e.g., Beffy et al., 2012; Long et al., 2014; and Wiswall and Zafar, 2014). This further stresses
the importance of considering the choice of college major and the choice of occupation as
two separate, albeit related, decisions.


5.2       Preferences for occupations
       Our specification in (4.3) of the value of college major-occupation bundles allows us to
recover, from our subjective probabilities and expected earnings data, individual-specific
components of non-wage payoffs for occupation k relative to the baseline occupation (αik −
αi1 ) along with the average preferences for occupation k relative to the baseline occupation,
for any given major j (δjk − δj1 ). We can express these non-wage components in terms
of percentage increase in (expected) earnings ten years after graduation using the effect of
earnings differentials coefficient ψw , and we refer to these as compensating differentials.29
  29
    Note that, strictly speaking, these differentials do not correspond to the traditional definition of com-
pensating differentials, which refer to the existence, in a competitive equilibrium, of wage differentials com-

    We first discuss the estimation results for the individual preferences, before turning to
the average preferences. Since the mean of αik − αi1 is zero because of the inclusion of
the occupation-major fixed effects (δjk ’s), individual i would have to be compensated an
additional (αi1 − αik )/ψw percent increase in earnings (if positive, otherwise would be willing
to forego (αik − αi1 )/ψw percent of earnings) to choose occupation k over occupation 1
relative to the average individual, all else equal.30 We can then calculate how much those
who actually chose major j value different occupations–beyond the value due to the average
complementarity of the major-occupation combination–relative to the average individual.
    Table 11 gives, for each occupation and major, the median estimated compensating
differential (αi1 − αik )/ψw , computed across the individuals who chose that particular major.
These differentials are reported as the percentage changes in expected earnings ten years out
that are required to make the median individual in a particular major indifferent between
the two occupations, all else equal. As one can see, individuals in our sample tend to have
preferences to avoid education. In particular, the median individual in social sciences or
humanities majors strongly prefer any other occupations relative to education. Natural
science majors also tend to have strong preferences for business, government and law over
education.
    Table 12 gives the median absolute deviations (MAD) of the compensating differentials
and of the log expected earnings, for all occupations relative to education.31 The key take-
pensating for job amenities (see, e.g., Rosen, 1986). Instead, our measure is best understood as a measure
of the (opposite of) willingness-to-pay for non-wage characteristics associated with each occupation-major
combination.
  30
     Note that ‘all else equal’ includes the choice of major as majors vary in their non-pecuniary benefits
across occupations as picked up by the δjk ’s.
  31
     We choose to use the median absolute deviation as a measure of dispersion here since it is more robust
to outliers than the standard deviation. However, the fact that the compensating differentials are estimated,

away from this table is that compensating differentials are much more dispersed than log
expected earnings, the ratio of median absolute deviations ranges from 2.4 (law) to as much
as 4.5 (science). Overall, these results suggest that variation across individuals in non-wage
factors plays a key role in explaining occupational choices.
   We next examine how preferences for occupations vary across majors, translating our
estimates of the δjk parameters into percentage increases in earnings. Table 13 reports aver-
age compensating differentials for particular occupation-major combinations, again relative
to the education occupation. For a given occupation k, conditional on major j, the average
                                             δj1 −δjk
compensating differential is given by:          ψw
                                                      .   Overall, the signs are generally intuitive and
the magnitudes of the compensating differentials strengthen the view that non-wage factors
are a major determinant of the choice of occupation. For example, an economics major
makes working in business so attractive that, on average, individuals would need to make
over three times as much in education (or making less than a third of what they would make
in business) to be indifferent between the two occupations. Similarly, a science major makes
working in a science occupation so attractive that on average individuals would need to make
over two and a half times more in education to be indifferent between the two occupations.
unlike the expected earnings which are directly taken from the data, should mechanically lead to overstate
the MAD of the compensating differentials relative to that of the log expected earnings. We investigated
this issue through Monte Carlo simulations (available from the authors upon request), which suggest that
in practice this bias is unlikely to affect our conclusions.


                                                     30
   Finally, the last column of Table 13 reports what the compensating differentials would
need to be if we did not account for differences in earnings across occupations. In this
case, we estimate a restricted version of the model where ψw is set equal to 0, and we use
the earnings parameters from our Model 3 to express the preferences in monetary units.
Comparing the last two columns of Table 13 then allows use to see the role earnings play
in mitigating compensating differentials. As expected, the compensating differentials in the
last column are generally higher (in absolute value) than those when earnings are accounted
for, consistent with expected earnings in education being substantially lower than in other
occupations. In other words, in all cases, not accounting for those earnings differences would
make it appear as though education was even more unattractive than it actually is.


5.3    Non-pecuniary determinants of occupational choice: differ-
       ences in offer arrival rates?
   Our estimates of the average compensating differentials associated with different occupation-
major combinations are large, especially relative to the expected monetary gains from them.
What can explain these large compensating differentials? The most obvious interpretation,
which is the one we have been focusing on so far, is that there are non-pecuniary aspects to
the choice of occupations. Individuals may simply like certain occupations (e.g., one has “a
calling to be a teacher”), and those preferences may vary across college majors (e.g., studying
economics makes business more attractive beyond any salary gains). We did not directly
measure these possible motives or factors when we elicited information from students about
their ex ante valuations of potential occupations, so we cannot directly answer this question.
   In this section we explore the possibility that search frictions and differential rates of
arrival of job offers across occupations and majors might be another potential explanation for
the large compensating differentials. For example, it may be that the subjective probability
of working in business tends to be higher for economics majors (relative to other majors)
because the arrival rate of offers in the business occupation is higher for economics majors.
Below, we illustrate how such differences in offer arrival rates might affect what the above
estimates attribute entirely to preference-based compensating differentials.
   Consider a simple case where there are two occupations, k ∈ {1, 2}. Suppose for major
j individuals receive one offer per unit of time in occupation 1 compared to two offers in
occupation 2. We assume that the difference between the two offers in occupation 2 comes
solely through non-pecuniary shocks, not through income. If each of the non-pecuniary
shocks are treated as another Type 1 Extreme Value shock, then the probability of choosing

                                   2 exp(vij2 )                exp(vij2 + ln(2))

                              exp(vij1 ) + 2 exp(vij2 )   exp(vij1 ) + exp(vij2 + ln(2))

Hence, if offer rates for various occupations differ by major, then this will manifest itself as
a compensating differential.32
       While we cannot separate compensating differentials from variation in offer arrival rates,
we can say how large differences in offer rates would have to be to explain the average
compensating differentials we find for particular major-occupation combinations. Namely,
denote λjk as the arrival rate of offers for occupation k conditional on major j. We assume
that the offers unobserved components are independently drawn from a Type 1 Extreme
Value distribution. Allowing for correlation in this component within an occupation category
would result in increases in magnitudes of the differences in arrival rates needed to account for
the estimated differences in compensating differentials. Hence, one can think of our approach
as identifying the minimum amount of differences in occupation-major offer arrival rates that
accounts for the estimated compensating differentials. It follows from the derivation above
that our estimates of (δjk − δj1 ) can be transformed into differences in arrival rates using:

                                        δjk − δj1 = ln(λjk ) − ln(λj1 )                                (5.4)

               λjk
Solving for    λj1
                     then gives the number of offers in occupation k per offer in education needed
                                                                                     δj1 −δjk
to account for the average major-occupation compensating differential (                 ψw
                                                                                              )   previously
estimated.
       Results are presented in Table 14. The differences in job arrival rates needed to fully
account for the compensating differentials associated with major-occupation pairings are
quite large. For example, natural science majors would have to receive at least 12.6 offers in
science occupations and 2.6 offers in business for every one offer in education. In contrast,
humanities majors would expect significantly fewer offers in the sciences, 0.3 offer for every
offer in education, with twice as many offers in business as in education. Majoring in
economics would need to result in 20.6 offers in business for every offer in education to account
for the compensating differential associated with the economics-business combination. These
results, combined with those in Table 13, suggest that in practice both stories (major-specific
preferences and major-specific job offer arrival rates, for each occupation) are likely to play
a role. In either event, college majors have a substantial effect on the future labor market
  32
    Note that variance in earnings from which offers are drawn would also generate a similar result, but
would require heterogeneity in the variance across majors. Variance in offered wages would have to be
unreasonably different across majors to explain our results.

6     Conclusion
    This paper investigates the role played by ex ante monetary returns versus preferences
in the context of sorting across occupations. To do so, we use elicited beliefs from a sample
of male undergraduates at Duke University on the probabilities of working in different oc-
cupations as well as on the expected earnings in each of those occupations, ten years after
graduation. Importantly, these beliefs were asked not only for the college major the indi-
vidual chose or intended to choose, but also for all counterfactual majors, thus making it
possible to examine the complementarities between majors and occupations, both in terms
of earnings and preferences.
    The distributions of the ex ante monetary returns (or ex ante treatment effects on earn-
ings) for particular occupations, conditional on each college major, for the overall, treated
and untreated subpopulations are directly identified from our subjective expectations data.
We find large differences in expected earnings across occupations, with a substantial degree
of heterogeneity across individuals. The estimates also suggest that those who place high
probabilities on working in particular occupations also tend to expect the greatest monetary
returns from those occupations: the treatment on the treated is, for most occupations, signif-
icantly higher than the treatment on the untreated. Clear complementarities exist between
majors and occupations. For example, expected returns for business careers are highest for
economics major, which in turn leads individuals to report higher probabilities of pursuing
a business occupation in the (sometimes) hypothetical case that they were an economics
major.
    We then derive a simple model of occupational choice which provides a link between


                                                 34
subjective expectations and preferences, making it possible to tell apart the role of expected
earnings and non-pecuniary factors in this context. While sorting across occupations is
found to be partly driven by the ex ante monetary returns, our estimation results suggest
that non-monetary factors play an even larger role in the decision to work in particular
occupations. Finally, our results also provide evidence of complementarities between majors
and occupations in terms of preferences, and possibly through the existence of differential
search frictions across majors.

A      Earnings 10 years out as an approximation of the
       present value of lifetime earnings
    We provide below some sufficient conditions under which earnings ten years after gradu-
ation can be used to approximate the present value of lifetime earnings, for any given major
and occupation.
Specifically, let w10 (respectively wt ) denote the earnings ten years out (respectively t years
out), β the annual discount factor and T the worklife duration (number of years). We define

(wt+1 = wt exp(ρ)), it follows that the approximation error can be written as:

assumptions, the earnings ten years after graduation are reasonably close to the present
value of lifetime earnings, weighted by the sum Tt=1 β t . The latter term does not vary

baseline occupation (see Equation(4.4) p.23 in the main text).

B      Occupational choice model: derivation of the likeli-
       hood
    We derive below the expression of the contribution to the likelihood for a given individual
i and major j. We omit the subscripts i and j in the following to ease the notational burden.
We first derive the likelihood in a simple case with 4 occupations such that the declared
probabilities are different from zero for occupations 1,2 and 3 but equal to zero for occupation
4, and the scale parameter γ is set equal to 1, before turning to the general case. We let
u2 := ∆ ln p2 − g (∆ ln w2 , ∆α2 , ∆δ2 , ψw ) and u3 := ∆ ln p3 − g (∆ ln w3 , ∆α3 , ∆δ3 , ψw ), and
ω4 := c∗ − g (∆ ln w4 , ∆α4 , ∆δ4 , ψw ). The contribution to the likelihood writes:

    After a change of variable (z := e−η1 (1 + e−u2 + e−u3 + e−ω4 )), we obtain:

where the integral on the right hand-side is the gamma function evaluated in 3 (Γ(3) = 2! =
2). It follows that the contribution to the likelihood writes:


                                                                                     2e−(u2 +u3 )

    It is straightforward to extend the derivation above to write the contribution to the
likelihood l corresponding to the most general case of an individual and major such that the
occupations with non-zero and zero declared probabilities are indexed by {1, 2, . . . , |K ∗ |} and
{|K ∗ | + 1, . . . , 6} respectively, denoting by |K ∗ | the number of occupations with non-zero
probabilities and after relabeling if necessary:
