                                            ABSTRACT

This paper argues that a linear statistical model with homoskedastic errors cannot capture the

nineteenth-century notion of a recurring cyclical pattern in key economic aggregates. A simple

nonlinear alternative is proposed and used to illustrate that the dynamic behavior of unemployment

seems to change over the business cycle, with the unemployment rate rising more quickly than it

falls. Furthermore, many but not all economic downturns are also accompanied by a dramatic change

in the dynamic behavior of short-term interest rates. It is suggested that these nonlinearities are most

naturally interpreted as resulting from short-run failures in the employment and credit markets, and

that understanding these short-run failures is the key to understanding the nature of the business

cycle.

1     What is the business cycle?

The term “cycle” is used to describe a process that moves sequentially between a series of

clearly identiÞable phases in a recurrent or periodic fashion. Economists of the nineteenth

and early twentieth centuries were persuaded that they saw such a pattern exhibited in the

overall level of economic activity, and enthusiastically sought to characterize the observed

regularities of what came to be known as the “business cycle.” The most systematic and still

enduring summaries of what seems to happen during the respective phases were provided

by Mitchell (1927, 1951) and Burns and Mitchell (1946).

    The expression “business cycle theory” remains in common usage today, even though,

in most of the modern models that wear the label, there in fact is no business cycle in the

sense just described. These are models of economic ßuctuations, to be sure, but they do

not exhibit clearly articulated phases through which the economy could be said to pass in a

recurrent pattern.

    In part this shift in the profession’s conception of what needs to be explained about

business ßuctuations reßects a desire to integrate the determinants of long-run economic

growth and the causes of short-run economic downturns within a single uniÞed theory of

aggregate economic performance.      Since improvements in overall productivity are widely

acknowledged to be one of the key factors driving long-run growth, and since such improve-

ments cannot reasonably be expected to occur at a constant rate over time, it is natural to

explore the possibility that variation over time in the rate of technological progress could be

a primary cause of variation over time in the level of economic activity. Brock and Mirman


                                              2
(1972) were the Þrst to incorporate stochastic variation in the rate of technical progress

into a neoclassical growth model, though they clearly intended this as a model of long-run

growth rather than a realistic description of short-run ßuctuations. Kydland and Prescott

(1982) later took the much bolder step of proposing that this class of models might explain

variations in economic activity at all frequencies, in what has come to be known as “real

business cycle models.”

   Although unifying growth and business cycle theory holds tremendous aesthetic appeal,

this particular solution is not without its detractors. Indeed, the reasons that Irving Fisher

gave in 1932 for rejecting such an approach have in the opinion of many yet to receive a

satisfying response from modern real business cycle theorists:


     “... in times of depression, is the soil less fertile? Not at all. Does it lack rain?

     Not at all. Are the mines exhausted? No, they can perhaps pour out even more

     than the old volume of ore, if anyone will buy. Are the factories, then, lamed in

     some way— down at the heel? No; machinery and invention may be at the very

     peak.” (Fisher, 1932, p. 5)


   Continuing along the lines of Fisher’s reasoning, the size of the population places an

obvious physical limit on how much a given nation can produce, and is certainly a key factor

responsible for an increase in aggregate output over time. But just as surely, a decrease in

population is not the cause of the decrease in employment that we observe in times when

the unemployment rate is shooting up dramatically.        There is in this respect an obvious

inherent asymmetry in ßuctuations in the number of workers employed— the measure must

                                              3
go up for diﬀerent reasons than it goes down. A parallel argument can be made in terms

of the capital stock, another key factor determining long-run growth which again places an

upper limit on how much a country can produce. Yet in times when we see all measures of

capacity utilization falling, the natural inference is that some forces other than the quantity

or quality of available manufacturing facilities account for the drop in aggregate output.

   If we agree that these three factors— technology, labor force, and the capital stock— are

the three main determinants of long-run economic growth, we might greet with considerable

skepticism the suggestion that the same three factors are in a parallel way responsible for

producing the drop in real GDP that we observe during a business downturn.

   The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the nineteenth-century economists were

on to something that their modern descendants may have forgotten. Is there really a business

cycle, or is the expression an unfortunate linguistic vestige of a less-informed era?    I will

argue that indeed there is a recurring pattern in the level of economic activity that needs

to be explained, but that a statistical characterization of this pattern requires a nonlinear

dynamic representation and calls for an asymmetric interpretation of the forces that cause

employment to rise and fall. I further observe that one element of this pattern has often

been a related cyclical behavior of interest rates.

   To the question, “Is the business cycle real?”, these Þndings suggest that yes, the busi-

ness cycle is real in the sense that it is a feature of the data that needs to be explained.

In the other meaning of the term “real,” however— the sense from which springs the label

“real business cycle,” namely, a cycle unrelated to monetary developments— the evidence ad-



                                               4
duced here for the importance of comovements between Þnancial and real variables suggests

that the cycle is not “real” at all, or at the least, not completely divorced from monetary

developments.




2         The behavior of unemployment.

Figure 1 plots the monthly unemployment rate in the U.S. from 1948:1 to 2004:3.1                   I would

suggest that someone looking at such a graph for the Þrst time would indeed be inclined

to identify a repeated sequence of ups and downs, with each of the obvious sharp upswings

in the unemployment rate occurring during periods that the National Bureau of Economic

Research has classiÞed as economic recessions (indicated by shaded regions on the graph).

        Although one’s eye is sympathetic to the claim that these data display a recurrent pattern,

it does not appear to be cyclical in the sense of exhibiting strict periodicity. For example, the

two consecutive unemployment peaks in 1958:7 and 1961:5 are separated by less than three

years, whereas those of 1982:11 and 1992:6 are separated by a decade. More formally, one

can look for any sort of periodic pattern by examining the spectrum of the unemployment

rate, an estimate of which is plotted in Figure 2 as a function of the period of the cycle.2              If

one tries to decompose the unemployment series in Figure 1 into a series of strictly periodic
    1
     This is the seasonally adjusted civilian unemployment rate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(http://stats.bls.gov).
    2
      This was calculated by smoothing the sample periodogram with a Bartlett window (e.g., Hamilton,
1994, eq. [6.3.15]) with lag q = 13, as calculated using the RATS ﬀt procedure with window(type=tent,
width=25). See the procedure hamp167.prg available at http://www.estima.com/procs_hamilton.shtml for
details. The resulting estimate ŝY (ωj ) for ωj = 2πj/T is plotted in Figure 2 for given j as a function of
T /j, which is the variable measured on the horizontal axis.



                                                     5
cycles, by far the most important of these are those with the longest period, as opposed to

something regularly repeating every 3 to 5 years.

      Let yt denote the unemployment rate. Consider an AR(2) representation of these data

with Student t innovations, obtained by maximizing the log likelihood function
                                                    T
                                                    X
                                           L(θ) =         lt (θ)
                                                    t=3
                                                               ·       ¸
                                                                u2
                               lt (θ) = k − [(ν + 1)/2] log 1 + t 2                                (1)
                                                               νσ

                                    ut = yt − c − φ1 yt−1 − φ2 yt−2                                (2)

                     k = log {Γ [(ν + 1)/2]} − log {Γ [ν/2]} − (1/2) log(σ 2 νπ)                   (3)

with respect to θ = (c, φ1 , φ2 , σ 2 , ν)0 subject to the constraints3 that σ 2 > 0 and ν > 0.

These maximum likelihood estimates (with asymptotic standard errors in parentheses) imply

that the unemployment rate yt for month t could be modeled as follows

                          yt = 0.060 + 1.117yt−1 − 0.128yt−2 + 0.158vt                             (4)
                                (0.028)   (0.037)         (0.037)     (0.007)


where vt is distributed Student t with 4.42 degrees of freedom, with the standard error for

the degrees-of-freedom parameter ν being estimated at 0.74. Using Student t innovations

instead of Normal increases the log likelihood by 52.04, a huge gain from estimating the

single parameter ν; (see Table 1).

      As further evidence against a cycle with regular periodicity, it is interesting to note that

the roots of the second-order diﬀerence equation in (4) are both positive and real, meaning

that this system does not exhibit any oscillatory behavior in response to a shock to vt .
  3
      See for example Hamilton (1994, Section 5.9) on numerical maximization subject to inequality con-
straints.

                                                    6
   Is the appearance of a repeated cycle in Figure 1 just a Þgment of our imagination,

then? Another interesting exercise is to simulate a time series realization from (4), which

is displayed in Figure 3. These simulated data have the same mean, variance, and serial

correlation as the real data in Figure 1, as of course they should. Even so, one has little of

the sense of a recurrent cycle in these simulated data that seemed compelling in the actual

data. If one were to label some of the episodes in this simulated data set as “recessions,”

where would they be?      Indeed, expression (4) characterizes the true process from which

these artiÞcial data were simulated. What in terms of the qualities of this data-generating

process would one characterize as a “business cycle?”       There are good and bad values of

the innovations vt , and perhaps we could make up some rule for categorizing a relatively

unlikely string of mostly negative innovations as a “recession.”      But any such rule would

be completely arbitrary, and tell us more about our imagination or quest for patterns and

labels than about anything in the objective reality. There is nothing qualitatively diﬀerent

about a value of vt that puts us within the arbitrary recession category and one that leaves

us just short of it.

   I would argue that this inability to deÞne a business cycle as a fundamental attribute of

the data-generating process (4) is in fact inherent in any time series model that describes yt

as a linear function of its lagged values plus an i.i.d. innovation. Even if the linear diﬀerence

equation did exhibit an oscillatory impulse-response function or imply more power in the

spectrum at periods of 3-5 years, it seems to be some other feature of the data in Figure 1

that constitutes the “business cycle.”



                                               7
   I would suggest instead that what we have in mind is that there is something in common

between the rapid run-ups in unemployment that occurred in each of the postwar recessions,

even though the length of time it takes for unemployment to spike up varies from episode

to episode, and the timing separating such events is irregular.      Indeed, the idea of look-

ing for commonality across recessions whose elapsed calendar time is diﬀerent for diﬀerent

episodes was precisely the methodology that Burns and Mitchell used to create their graphs

summarizing typical business cycle patterns. Stock (1987, 1988) showed that such a way

of thinking about data necessarily implies a nonlinear data-generating process. Friedman

(1969, p. 274) and DeLong and Summers (1986), among others, have forcefully advanced

the related proposition that asymmetry is the deÞning characteristic of business cycles. In

particular, the asymmetry commented on in Figure 1— that recessions are characterized by

an unusually rapid but nonetheless transient increase in the unemployment rate— has been

conÞrmed to be a statistically signiÞcant feature of these data in a number of recent quantita-

tive studies, including Montgomery, et. al. (1998), Rothman (1998), and van Dijk, Franses,

and Paap (2002).

   Suppose we try in a simple way to represent the asymmetry that the eye perceives in

Figure 1. One idea is that the intercept in equation (2) assumes diﬀerent values in diﬀerent

phases of the business cycle. Consider the following generalization of (2),


                               yt = cst + φ1 yt−1 + φ2 yt−2 + ut ,                         (5)


where st = 1 if the economy is in the normal growth state at date t, st = 2 if it is in a mild

recession, and st = 3 for a severe recession. Suppose that the transition between these three

                                               8
regimes follows a Markov chain, with pij = Pr(st = j|st−1 = i) another set of 9 parameters
                                                                                   P3
to be estimated subject to the constraints 0 ≤ pij ≤ 1 and                             j=1   pij = 1. Conditional on

the economy being in regime j at date t, the unemployment rate thus has conditional log

density given by
                                                                                      ·        ¸
                                                                                          u2jt
                       log f(yt |st = j, yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., y1 ) = k − [(ν + 1)/2] log 1 + 2
                                                                                          νσ

                                         ujt = yt − cj − φ1 yt−1 − φ2 yt−2

for k as in (3).

     The log likelihood for the observed data,

                                              T
                                              X
                                     L(θ) =         log f (yt |yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., y1 ; θ)
                                              t=3


can then be calculated as in Hamilton (1994, equation [22.4.7]) and maximized numerically

with respect to the population parameters θ = (c1 , c2 , c3 , φ1 , φ2 , σ, ν, p11 , p12 , p13 , p21 , p22 , p23 ,

p31 , p32 , p33 )0 .    The maximum likelihood estimates turn out to be at the boundaries such

that p13 = 0 and p31 = 0, that is, states 1 and 3 never follow each other. These maximum

likelihood estimates are reported in Table 2, where in order to calculate standard errors

from the second derivative matrix of the log likelihood, we went ahead and imposed the

constraint p13 = p31 = 0 so that there are just 4 free transition probabilities (p11 , p21 , p22 ,

and p32 ). The smoothed probabilities implied by the maximum likelihood estimates, Pr(st =

j|y1 , y2 , ..., yT ; θ̂), are plotted in Figure 4.

     Note that allowing this nonlinearity produces a further huge improvement in the log

likelihood and would easily be selected on the basis of the Schwarz criterion (again see Table

                                                             9
1).     Formal tests of the null hypothesis of no Markov-switching have been proposed by

Hansen (1992), Hamilton (1996), Garcia (1998), and Carrasco, Hu, and Ploberger (2004).

The latter have found the optimal test against the alternative of Markov-switching, which

we implement here for the special case where the alternative to (4) is a model with Markov-

switching in the intercept only as in (5); for details of the Carrasco, Hu, and Ploberger test

see the appendix. The test statistic on the U.S. employment data turns out to be 26.02,

whereas the 5% critical value is only 4.01, providing overwhelming evidence for representing

the data with the model described in Table 2 rather than (4).

      Consider some of the properties of the estimated Markov-switching model. The process

is stationary, allowing us to take the unconditional expectation of equation (5),

The ergodic probabilities can be calculated as in Hamilton (1994, equation [22.2.26]):

In other words, the economy spends about 80% of the time in the normal phase of the

business cycle. Substituting these unconditional probabilities into (6), the model implies an

expected unemployment rate of 5.9%, close to the postwar average.4                  If the economy is in

A typical expansion thus might last about 3 years. A mild recession often lasts less than

half a year, at which point it might enter the more severe phase for a few months, and then

spend another half year again at moderately high unemployment rates before coming back

down.

   Figure 5 displays the way in which this representation captures the asymmetry of the

business cycle discussed above. Suppose the economy is currently experiencing an unem-

ployment rate of 6% but is in the recovery phase of the cycle (st = 1). In the absence of

any new shocks (ut+j = 0 for all j), the dynamic behavior of the unemployment rate over

time would be given by


                           yt+j = 0.0605 + 0.8584yt+j−1 + 0.1217yt+j−2


for j = 1, 2, ... starting from yt = yt−1 = 6.0. The top panel of Figure 5 plots this path for

yt+j as a function of j. The unemployment rate falls quite gradually in this phase. If the

phase persisted indeÞnitely, the unemployment rate would eventually stabilize at a value of


                               0.0605/(1 − 0.8584 − 0.1217) = 3.04,
of the population mean that is equal by construction to the sample mean.



                                                    11
though it would take 30 years of expansion to get there; in the Þrst year of the expansion,

the unemployment rate would only drop 0.6%.

   By contrast, if the economy started with yt = 3.0 and entered the mild recession phase,

the unemployment rate would rise much more quickly than it fell, reaching 5.4% within a

year (see Panel B of Figure 5). And if the economy starts with unemployment at 6% and

enters the severe recession phase (Panel C), the rate would reach nearly 12% after a year.

   This asymmetry in unemployment dynamics is subtle in the statistical sense that the

baseline model (4) adequately captures most of the gross features of the data. But it seems

extremely important from an economic perspective. For once we agree that up and down

movements in the unemployment rate occur at diﬀerent speeds, the notion that they may

be caused by diﬀerent economic forces becomes much more appealing. Finding this kind of

nonlinearity using modern statistical methods could thereby be interpreted as exonerating

to some degree the assumptions of early students of the business cycle.          SpeciÞcally, it

suggests that there is a real event associated with the label of an “economic recession,”

which is measurable by objective statistical methods as a change in the dynamic behavior

of the unemployment rate. It further suggests that the key task for business cycle theorists

should not be to look for a uniÞcation between the explanation of short-run dynamics and

long-run growth, but rather to identify the factors that can result in a temporary failure of

the economy to utilize eﬃciently the available labor, capital, and technology.




                                             12
3         The behavior of interest rates.

I argued above that the business cycle is not an artiÞcial categorization existing only in the

imagination of economists but rather is an integral part of the real data-generating process.

In addition to believing that such patterns exist, early students of the business cycle also

diﬀered from their modern counterparts in the degree to which Þnancial factors were viewed

as a key part of the business cycle.         For example, Burton (1902) described the typical

business downturn in the following terms:


          “The usual signal for the beginning of a crisis is a conspicuous banking or mer-

          cantile failure, or the exposure of some fraudulent enterprise which attracts wide-

          spread attention. Money is hoarded. Credit is refused.” (Burton, 1902)


        As a Þrst look at some of the evidence that may have inspired such an opinion, consider

Figure 6, which plots the series on commercial paper rates in New York city compiled by

Macaulay (1938).5         These data behave very diﬀerently before and after the founding of

the U.S. Federal Reserve in 1913, a point to which we will want to return shortly.              But

Þrst consider the behavior of this series prior to 1913.        There is at least one asymmetry

that Figure 1 and Figure 6 have in common, induced per force by the fact that neither the

unemployment rate nor the nominal interest rate can ever go negative, but both can go and

occasionally have gone quite far above their usual levels. Notwithstanding, interest rates do

not display the same obvious pattern of ups and downs as the unemployment data in Figure
    5
     Taken from Macaulay (1938, Column 3, Table 10, pp. A142-161. Macaulay describes these as ”choice
60-90 day two name paper” up to 1923 and ”four to six month prime double and single name paper” from
1924 on.

                                                  13
1. Indeed, apart from seasonal ßuctuations stemming from the predominance of agriculture

in the economy over this period, such predictable swings might be diﬃcult to reconcile with

the view that asset markets function eﬃciently given investors’ ability to arbitrage between

securities of diﬀerent maturities.     Nevertheless, there are a number of interest-rate spikes

prior to 1913 that are quite dramatic visually and that have been delegated particular names

as important points of reference for economic historians, names such as the Crisis of 1857,

Crisis of 1873, or the Panic of 1893.

   As in the case of postwar unemployment rates, there is no obvious periodicity to the

occurrence of these interest rate spikes. Figure 7 plots the spectrum of interest rates over

the 1857:1 to 1913:12 period, which again is dominated by the lowest frequencies. There is

a noticeable local peak associated with cycles of a 12-month period, reßecting the tendency

of interest rates to be highest in the winter months when agricultural borrowing needs were

greatest.   But again there is no mass whatever for what are often described as “business

cycle frequencies,” namely cycles with periods of 3 to 5 years.

   For a baseline model, we estimated a slight generalization of the model in equations

(1)-(3) to allow for a possible seasonal pattern in interest rates, replacing equation (2) with


                                     ut = zt − φ1 zt−1 − φ2 zt−2                            (7)


                                     zt = yt − c − γ cos(πt/6)

for yt now the interest rate and t = 1 corresponding to the January 1857 observation. A

positive value of γ would reßect the tendency for interest rates to peak around December.

The likelihood was then maximized numerically over 1857:3 to 1913:12, resulting in the

                                                 14
estimates reported in Table 3. Once again allowing Student t innovations implies a huge

improvement in the log likelihood over a Gaussian speciÞcation (see Table 4).

     Apart from the seasonal cycle in agriculture, economic theory would lead us to expect

that changes in interest rates are much harder to forecast than the unemployment rate. A

Markov-switching speciÞcation related to that in (5) is to allow the variance rather than the

intercept to change with the regime, so that the conditional log density of the tth observation

is
                                                                             ·             ¸
                                                                                     u2
               log f (yt |st = j, yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., y1 ) = kj − [(ν + 1)/2] log 1 + t 2
                                                                                    νσ j

                   kj = log {Γ [(ν + 1)/2]} − log {Γ [ν/2]} − (1/2) log(σ 2j νπ)

where ut is again given by (7). Here we allow only two regimes, with the scale parameter

taking the value σ 1 in the low-variance regime and σ 2 in the high-variance regime.

     As seen in Table 4, allowing the possibility of changes in the variance parameter over

time again leads to a very big improvement in the Þt to the data. We can also again use

the Carasco, Hu, and Ploberger test, this time constructed for the alternative of a Markov-

switching variance, as described in the appendix. The test statistic is 63.34, which vastly

exceeds the 5% critical value of 3.68, and indeed exceeds the largest value (19.28) among

any of our 1000 Monte Carlo simulations.

     The maximum likelihood estimates are reported in Table 5. Regime 2 is characterized

by a variance of interest rate innovations that is thrice that for regime 1, with the ergodic

probabilities implying that the economy would spend about 80% of the time in the low-

variance regime.     Smoothed probabilistic inferences about when U.S. interest rates were


                                                   15
unusually volatile are graphed in the middle panel of Figure 8, and repeated in the bottom

graph for comparison with NBER-dated recessions (shown as shaded regions) over this pe-

riod. Those dates for which the smoothed probability of being in the high-variance regime,

Pr(st = 2|y1 , y2 , ..., yT ; θ̂), exceeds one-half are categorized in Table 6 as episodes of unusually

volatile interest rates for further comparison with the dates NBER has ascribed to economic

recessions.6    The correspondence between these two sets of dates is strong, but not perfect.

There are a half-dozen recessions in the 1880’s and early 1900’s when nothing much was

happening to interest rates, and one interest rate spike (in 1898) which comes in the middle

of an economic expansion. A long episode of interest rate volatility in the late 1860’s and

early 1870’s also correlates rather weakly with the recessions at those times. On the other

hand, there are a number of other recessions, notably those of 1857-58, 1860-61, 1893, and

1896, which match up perfectly with very dramatic shifts in the interest rate regime. The

suggestion thus seems strong that an important shift in the interest rate process is indeed

related to some but by no means all of the 19th-century economic downturns.

      The asymmetry found in unemployment dynamics— that unemployment rises above its

average rate more quickly than it falls below its average rate— seemed to suggest rather

directly that macroeconomic theorists should be looking for diﬀerent explanations as to why

employment rises and falls.       By contrast, the deÞciency of a homoskedastic linear model

as a description of 19th-century interest rate dynamics— that interest rates are much more

volatile at some times than others— would be consistent with any model that implies GARCH

eﬀects on interest rates.7         However, it does seem fair to describe this Þnding as implying

that, at least during some of the 19th-century recessions, interest rates were being inßuenced

by some forces that are not operating in usual times, or, perhaps more strongly, that the

Þnancial crises emphasized by early students of the business cycle are in some important

respects qualitatively diﬀerent from the factors governing normal interest rate ßuctuations.

       It is quite apparent from Figure 6 that the behavior of short-term interest rates changed

dramatically after the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, as both the seasonality and the sharp

spikes in interest rates were successfully eliminated.8                 However, a few broad surges in

interest rates after the founding of the Fed are certainly identiÞable in the post-Fed data.

These precede the economic downturn of 1920-21 and the Great Depression beginning in

1929, in addition to a minor spike coinciding with the worsening economic situation in

1931.9       This post-Fed correlation led many economists to conclude that the contribution

of liquidity crunches to economic downturns did not end with the founding of the Federal

Reserve.

       Indeed, there is some indication that this pattern is a characteristic of postwar business

cycles as well. The top panel of Figure 9 displays U.S. 6-month Treasury bill rates10 from

1958:12 to 2004:4 along with U.S. recessions as shaded areas. Again one’s eye is tempted

to see a recurrent tendency for the interest rate to surge upward prior to every postwar

recession, though the pattern is more convincing for some recessions than for others.

   Bansal and Zhou (2002), Ang and Bekaert (2002) and Dai, Singleton, and Yang (2003)

have used a Markov-switching framework to suggest that a connection between interest rate

volatility and economic recessions also characterizes postwar data. We applied the method

used to analyze 19th-century interest rates to postwar data, with two changes. First, the

term representing the agricultural seasonal was dropped. Second, we estimated the model

in diﬀerences rather than levels. The reason is that levels estimation results in one root that

is virtually unity, which would very rarely introduce numerical problems with maximizing

the log likelihood for simulated samples in the Monte Carlo calculation of the Carasco, Hu,

and Ploberger statistic (though results reported below are otherwise identical for estimation

in either levels or diﬀerences).

   Table 7 replicates the Þndings on our other two data sets: the data are far better described

with Student t as opposed to Normal innovations, and further allowing for Markov-switching

in the variance yields a further huge improvement in Þt.        Again the Carrasco, Hu, and

Ploberger statistic of 137.38 far exceeds the 95% critical value of 4.03 and indeed any value

in our 1000 Monte Carlo simulated samples.

   Maximum likelihood estimates are reported in Table 8. The standard deviation of the

innovation is four times as big in regime 2 compared to regime 1. The bottom panel of Figure

9 plots the smoothed probability that the economy was in the high-volatility regime for each

month. As in the 19th-century data, there appears to be a clear connection between interest

rate volatility and economic recessions, at least for the recessions of 1973-75, 1980, and 1981-

Yang’s (2003) conclusions from the volatility of the term structure.

    Nor is this pattern unique to the United States.      For example, Neumeyer and Perri

(2004) noted that domestic interest rate spikes preceded the strong economic downturns in

Mexico in 1994, Brazil and Argentina in 1995, and Korea and the Philippines in 1997, each

of which had important similarities with the Þnancial crises seen repeatedly in the United

States in the nineteenth century.


4     Conclusion.

We now return to the question posed in the title of this paper, “What’s real about the

business cycle?”       If an accurate statistical description of the dynamic behavior of key

economic magnitudes is a time-invariant linear model such as equation (4), then the correct

answer is, there is no such thing as a business cycle. In this case, we might as well stop

using the phrase “the business cycle,” inherited from a less-informed century, and continue

with our eﬀorts at trying to describe short-run economic ßuctuations as being governed by

the same factors that determine long-run economic growth.

    However, we’ve encountered substantial statistical evidence that there are some features

of both unemployment and interest-rate dynamics that are inconsistent with a time-invariant

linear speciÞcation.     Each of these series seems to exhibit diﬀerent dynamic behavior in

recessions and expansions.      The unemployment rate rises more quickly than it falls, and

this often occurs at the same time as rapid spikes up and then back down in short-term



                                              19
interest rates. If moving between such episodes is indeed what we mean by “the business

cycle,” then the correct answer to our question is, the business cycle is very much a real,

objectively measurable phenomenon, in which case keeping both the phrase as well as the

research program that the expression invites seems well worth while.

   The paper’s title is of course also a play on words, insofar as “real business cycle theory”

is derived from a class of models in which short-run economic ßuctuations are driven by

the same real (i.e., nonmonetary) factors that are responsible for long-run growth.       Our

Þndings cast some doubt on the claim that the business cycle is “real” in this sense. The

observation that the dynamics change over the course of the business cycle suggests instead

that the forces that cause employment to rise may be quite diﬀerent from those that cause it

to fall. Furthermore, the coincidence of this phenomena with large rapid moves in interest

rates suggests that something is disrupting the normal functioning of both labor and Þnancial

markets. It is diﬃcult to reconcile these facts with a world view in which Þnancial markets

play no role in economic ßuctuations.

   Figure 2. Estimated spectrum of U.S. monthly civilian unemployment rate, 1948:1-

2004:3, plotted as a function of period of the cycle in years.

   Figure 3. A simulated sample generated from equation (4).

   Figure 4. Smoothed probabilities for moderate recession regime (Pr(st = 2|y1 , y2 , ..., yT ; θ̂)

in second panel) and severe recession regime (Pr(st = 3|y1 , y2 , ..., yT ; θ̂) in third panel) for θ̂

the maximum likelihood estimates reported in Table 2. First panel reproduces the unem-

ployment data from Figure 1.

   Figure 5. Simulated time path for unemployment under three scenarios.                 First panel:

unemployment is initially at 6% and the economy remains in regime 1 with no further shocks.

Second panel: unemployment is initially at 3% and the economy remains in regime 2 with

no further shocks. Third panel: unemployment is initially at 6% and the economy remains

in regime 3 with no further shocks. Horizontal axis in each panel measures months from

the initial condition.
