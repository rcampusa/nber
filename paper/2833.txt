                                     ABSTRACT




     Lifetime   income   is   less variable than annual household income, since

the latter reflects transitoty shocks to wages, family status, and em-

ployment.   This implies that low-income households in one year have some

chance of being higher-income households in other years,              and significant-

ly affects the estimated distributional burden of excise taxes.               This

paper shows that household expenditures on gasoline,             alcohol,   and tobacco

as a share of total consumption (a proxy        for lifetime income) are much

more equally distributed than expenditures        as a share of annusl income.

From a longer-horizon perspective,       excise taxes on these goods         are

therefore   much less regressive than standard analyses suggest.

    Although theoretical papers have noted the potentially

important distinction hetween annual and lifetime tax burdens,

with one exception the lifetime perspective is absent in empiri-

cal studies of tax incidence.1    Calculations based on annual

income may provide particularly unreliable guidance on a central

tax policy issues of the early 1990s:     the incidence of excise

taxes.   Conventional wisdom holds that these taxes are regres-

sive, falling most heavily on the poorest households.    This has

long been one of the central objections to proposals for raising
excise taxes.     Nevertheless, the evidence for this view may

depend critically on the rime horizon in incidence studies.
Pechman (1985, p.51) writes thst "whether regressivity of [sales

and excise] taxes with respect to income would remain for

accounting periods longer than one year is not known. It seems

clear, however, that the regressivity shown at the lowest income
levels on the basis of annual figures would be moderated, if not

completely eliminated, over the longer period."     There is

relatively little systematic evidence, however, evaluating this
              2
conj ecture

     'The general equilibrium incidence model of Charles Ballard,
et ml. (1985),  as well the tax burden calculations of Joseph
Pechman (1985), allocate households to categories based on annual
income. The study which does consider lifetime issues, by James
Davies et si. (1984), finds that the choice of time interval can
has important effects on the estimated distribution of Canadian
taxes. Theoretical treatment of lifetime tax issues include
David Levhari and Eytan Sheshinski (1972) and 8. John Driffill
and Harvey Rosen (1983).

     2Two recent papers by Frank Sammartino (1988) and Richard
Kasten and Sammartino (1988) recognize the potential importance
of this annual income bias.  They compare expenditures on
particular commodities to total expenditures, and examine the
incidence of taxes on a number of products not discussed in this
      The present paper begins by documenting the unsurprising

proposition that household income measured over long horizons is
less variable than annual household income.     This implies that

low-income households in one year have some chance of being

higher-income households in other years.   Thus, even if the share

of income consumed by lowest income groups is higher than that

for higher-income groups, excise taxes or taxes on consumption

more generally may be less regressive than calculations based on

annual income suggest.   The second section explores the differen-

ces between the annual and lifetime incidence by considering the

incidence of excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol, and tobacco.        It

shows that expenditure on these itema as a share of total

consumption is much mote equally distributed than expenditure as
a share of annual income.   If households base their spending

plans on their expected lifetime income, then consumption

provides a more accurate measure of lifetime resources than does
annual income.    From a longer-horizon perspective, these taxes

are therefore much less regressive than is usually thought.

There is a brief conclusion.



I.   Do Lifetime and Annual Incidence Differ?

      Many studies provide detailed information on the tax burdens

facing households at different points in the annual income
distribution.    If households stay at the same position in the

income distribution over long periods of time,    then these

calculations provide teasonable indications of longer-term tax

burdens as well.        Data on incnme dynamics, however, suggest a

surprising degree of instability in the annual income distribu-
tion.

        Table   1   presents data on movements up and down the income
distribution by individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics

(PSID).     The entries are transition probabilities relating an

individual's location in the distribution in 1971 to the same

individual's position in 1978.        A randomly-chosen individual had

a 41% chance of being in the same income quintile in these two

years.     The chance that an individual in the lowest income

quintile in 1971 would be there again in 1978 was .54, sig-

nificantly higher than the one-in-three chance that an individual
near the middle of the income distribution would remain in the
same quintile.3

        Substantial instability in the income distribution is

confirmed by evidence from other studies using other data sets.

Frank Hanna (1948),        analyzing Wisconsin income data from the
1929-1935 period, finds markedly less inequality in the distribu-

tion of total income over the period than in the distribution of


     3Transition data may overstate the true incidence of
mobility since survey data on household income is subject to
measurement error. The magnitude of the overstatement may be
small, however. John Bound and Alan Krueger (1988) find that
only 15% of the cross-sectional variation in reported income in
the Current Population Survey is due to noise. Duncmn and Daniel
Hill (1985) report similarly encouraging results for the PSID.
Both studies also find important positive correlation between the
measurement errors for earnings in adjacent years (.43 in Duncan
and Hill), undermining the common claim that much of the year-to-
year variation in reported earnings is due to measurement error.

annual income.    Paul Taubman (1977) examines mobility in the

NBER-Thorndike/Hagen   data set, which teports earnings in 1969 and

1955 for a sample of 4600 men aged 18-26 in 1943.    This homogene-

ous   sample controls for lifecycle variation in earnings, but
Tauhman nevertheless finds that an individual's chance of falling

in the same earnings decile in 1955 and 1969 is only 22 percent.

 Lee Lillard (1977) uses the same data and estimates of the Gini

coefficient for annual income to be .28, significantly larger

than the estimate of .19 for the present value of lifetime
           4
esrntngs
       Since studies using annual income data find that the burden

of the U.S. tax system is roughly proportional to income except

at the top and bottom of the income distribution, mobility into

and out of these parts of the income distribution hss the largest
effect on incidence studies. Martha Hill's (1981) study of the

PSID sample finds that one third of the individuals who were in
                                                      Taubman's
poverty had not been in poverty the previous year.
results show less mobility:    39 percent of individuals in the

lowest-earning decile in 1955, and 44 percent of those in the



     4Compsrisons of the inequality in lifetime and annual
esrnings hinge critically on the assumed persistence of the
component of individual earnings that cannot be explained by
observsble individual attributes. Roger Gordon (1984) finds very
little difference between the interpersonal distribution of human
wealth and annual earnings, presumsbly because of differences in
his stochastic specification. A detsiled discussion of indivi-
dual wage histories and their random components is found in the
Report of the Consultant Panel on Social Security (1976), which
reports an autocortelation coefficient of approximately .50 for
an individual's wages at the beginning and end of a decade, after
correcting for economy-wide growth trends.

highest decile, were in the same decile again In 1969.
     Even modest mobility is sufficient to alter basic incidence

results, particularly regarding excise taxes.         Davies et al.

(1984) find that the average burden of Canadian sales and excise

taxes for the lowest income decile falls from 27% when annual

income is the benchmark to 15% with lifetime incidence (the

average across all groups is 13%)     .   For   the highest income

decile, the excise tax burden rises from 8.5% with annual
incidence to 12% with lifetime incidence.         For the progressive

corporate income tax, lifetime incidence reduces the burden on

top decile households from 10% to 5% and raises the burden on the
lowest decile from one to two percent.

     Focusing on lifetime incidence introduces two considerations
that annual incidence calculations omit.         First, lifetime
incidence incorporates predictable lifecycle patterns in earn-

ings, asset accumulation, and consumption, yielding more sensible
inferences with respect to the distribution of tax burdens.             For

example, consider the gasoline excise tax burden on two city-

dwelling households with no current gasoline expenditures, one a

young couple and the other two elderly pensioners.          While the

annual incidence framework might imply identical burdens on the

two households,   the lifetime approach correctly imputes a higher

burden to the younger couple because they are likely to move to

the suburbs and become substantial gasoline consumers in future

years.

     Second, lifetime incidence averages over many years,
                                  6

reducing the importance of variation in annual earnings due to

unemployment or changes in family status.     In practice this

effect is more important than the lifecycle effect in estimating

the distribution of excise tax burdens.     For many low-income

households, current income provides an unreliable indication of
lifetime economic status.5



IT.    Excise Tax Increases: Lifetime and Annual Incidence

       The current policy debate aurrounding excise taxes on

gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol provides an excellent illustration
of the differences between annual and lifetime incidence measur-

es.    Table 2 presents the share of gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol

expenditures in annual income (excluding in-kind transfers) and
in    annual consumption for households at various points in the

income and expenditure distribution.    Provided households adhere

to the basic tenets of the lifecycle-permanent income hypothesis

by setting consumption in relation to lifetime resources rather
than current income, total expenditure provides a better measure
                                                        6
of long-term household well-being than annual income.


     5Pechman (1985) attempts to correct for this problem in
measuring tax burdens on the lowest-income decile. His reported
tax burdens for the lowest decile (first through tenth
tiles) are based on households in the sixth through tenth
deciles

        follow standard practice, for example Pechman (1985), in
assuming that excise taxes are fully reflected in consumer
prices. The distribution of expenditures across households
therefore determines the incidence of the tax. The burden on
low-income or low-consumption households would be reduced if the
analysis recognized the indexed nature of most transfer payments,
which provides increased income in response to tax-induced price

    The results    in the upper panel of Table 2 show expenditures

on esch good ss a share of pretax        income and support the general

view that excise taxes are regressive.        Low-income households

spend a much higher fraction of their income on these commodities

then do higher income households.        For both gasoline and alcohol,

expenditures    as a fraction of income are more thmn five times

larger for the bottom quintile of the income distribution than
for the top quintile.      Tobacco tax burdens are even more uneven:

the income shares differ by a factor of ten.         These results

reflect a ratio of total expenditures        to income excluding in-kind

benefits of well above unity for low-income households.7
     A completely different pattern emerges when total expendi-

tures, rather     than annual   income, are used to calibrate    the

incidence of taxes on these commodities.         These data are reported

in the lower panel of Table 2, with households again divided into
                                                  as a basis for
quintiles but now using total expenditures
classification.      For the lowest consumption    quintile,   gasoline

and motor oil expenditures      account for 5.8% of total outlays,

slightly less than the shares for the three middle quintilem of
the consumption distribution.        For the highest quintile,     the


changes.

     7The statistics are based on quintile averages and conceal
important horizontal inequities in the consumption of these
goods.  Frank Sammartino (1987) reports that only 52 percent of
families with before-tax incomes of less than $5000 in 1985
purchased gasoline, compared with more than 99 percent of
families with incomes of more than $20,000. Gasoline expendi-
tures are therefore well ab-ove 15 percent of annual income for
some low-income households.   Similar issues arise on a smaller
scale for alcohol and tobacco purchases.
                                         8

expenditure    share for gasoline declines to 4.4%.        The divergence

scross different parts of the consumption          distribution   is much

smaller,    however,   than the variation in spending as a share of

income,     Alcohol expenditures display a similar compression,

varying only between 1.4 and 1.6 of total spending across
different groups.      For tobacco, however,      even the consumption

metric    the excise tax appears regressive:        the expenditure     share

of the least-well-off     quintile is three times that for the

highest expenditure     class.8

     The striking difference between distributional          burden that

emerges    from incidence calculations       in the annual and lifetime

frameworks could be due either to lifecycle variation in the

consumption-to-income ratio (C/Y), or to short-run fluctuations
in annual    income.   Table    3   addresses the relative importance of
these two factors by presenting the consumption/income ratio and

the fraction of expenditure          devoted to different taxed com-

modities by age group.         While there is some evidence of a

lifecycle pattern in consumption to income ratios, with young
households exhibiting higher average propensities          to consume than

older ones, the variation in C/Y across age groups is much

smaller than the variation across income groups in Tsble           2.     The

share of total expenditures         devoted to gasoline, alcohol, and
tobacco    is also quite stable across age groups.        Although the


     8Edgsr Browning and William Johnson (1979) also note that
expenditure shares on these goods do not vary a great deal, but
they stratify households by income rather thsn expenditures in
making these compmrisions.

using the consumption basis for incidence,                 tobacco     taxes appear

to be regressive since             the expenditure     share   is   approximately
three    times as large for those in the bottom consumption quintile

as for those       in the top quintile.           In every age group, the share

of expenditures devoted to tobacco declines with household
status.        The effects are weaker for both alcohol               and gasoline.

For alcohol,       especially among younger age groups the least-well-
off may devote twice as much of their total budget to alcohol as

their better-off counterparts.                 The expenditure share for

gasoline varies less.              For each of these commodities, however,

the variation in expenditure                shares is smaller than the variation

in expenditure          to income ratios suggested        by Table 2.      The

results may also understate                the burden on top-quintile consumers,

since they tend to be making transitory purchases                     of durable


     9Stratifying within age groups based on before-tax income
yields the same pattern of high C/Y ratios at low incomes, low
values at high incomes, that we observed in the entire population.

goods, and therefore overstate regressivity.
     The differences between incidence calculated from income and
from consumption have       implications beyond the analysis of excise
taxation.     In discussions    of the choice between consumption and

income taxes more generally,        a recurrent   issue is the regres-

sivity of consumption taxes due to the higher expenditure-income
ratio   at low income levels,       Classifying households by consump-
tion rather than income, however,          eliminates the apparent

disparity. The ratio of expenditures to before-tax,           in-kind

exclusive income for households in the lowest income quintile in
the 1984 Consumer Expenditure        Survey is 3.17.    For households in

higher quintiles,    the ratios are 1.3,       .98, .84, and .69 respec-

tively.     When classified by consumption quintiles,       however,   the

ratios are quite different.          From lowest consumption quintile to

highest,    they are .79,    .82,   .80, .82, and 1.05.  These calcula-

tions   suggest the need for further study on the lifetime burden

of consumption taxes.


ITT.    New Directions for Incidence Research
        Failure to distinguish between lifetime and annual in-
cidence overstates the degree of inequality in tax burdens

between groups, suggesting that progressive taxes are mote

progressive and regressive caxes more regressive than a lifetime
analysis would suggest.        The illustrative    calculations presented

here suggest that for studying the incidence           of excise taxes,

these biases may be substantial.
                                         ii

        Thesefindings suggest three research directions First,
stochastic models of the income distribution need to be linked
with more traditional iocidence approaches.    The rapid advance

in   computing   powor    in the last decade makes      it possible to

envision general equilibrium models of tax incidence where random
elements of household income are explicitly simulated.               Second,

further research     is   needed on the inequality of lifetime and
annual incomes.      The increasing availability of longitudinal

data, such as the fourteen year match of the Panel Survey of

Income Dynamics and the recently-released IRS taxpayer panel,
facilitates such work.        Finally,    the lifetime incidence     approach
with its emphasis on mobility draws attention to classes of

households with a conspicuous        j.g.cjt   of mobility.   Retired in-

dividuals, for example, may not experience the same variation in
income flows that younger households face. For the elderly, the
burden of some excise taxes may therefore be greater than for
ocher households with similar consumption, although Kasten and

Sammartino (1988) suggest this is not the case for the gasoline,

tobacco,   and alcohol excises.       Additional research is needed to

identify low-mobility groups and measure their tax burdens.
