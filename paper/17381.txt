                                             ABSTRACT

Detailed administrative data from a large and diverse community college are used to examine if academic
performance depends on whether students are the same race or ethnicity as their instructors. To identify
racial interactions and address many threats to internal validity we estimate models that include both
student and classroom fixed effects. Given the large sample sizes and computational complexity of
the 2-way fixed effects model we rely on numerical algorithms that exploit the particular structure
of the model’s normal equations. Although we find no evidence of endogenous sorting, we further
limit potential biases from sorting by focusing on students with restricted course enrollment options
due to low registration priorities, students not getting first section choices, and on courses with no
within-term or within-year racial variation in instructors. We find that the performance gap in terms
of class dropout rates, pass rates, and grade performance between white and underrepresented minority
students falls by 20-50 percent when taught by an underrepresented minority instructor. We also find
these interactions affect longer term outcomes such as subsequent course selection, retention, and degree
completion. Potential mechanisms for these positive interactions are examined.

1. Introduction

         The achievement gap between historically underrepresented minority students and

non-minority students is one of the most persistent and vexing problems of the

educational system in the United States. African-American, Latino and Native-American

students have substantially lower test scores, grades, high school completion rates,

college attendance rates, and college graduation rates than non-minority students.1 Fryer

and Levitt (2006)and Fryer (2011) document that, for African-Americans, achievement

gaps start to appear in elementary school and persist throughout primary and secondary

education, while Reardon and Galindo (2009)find that, for Hispanics-, achievement gaps

are already substantial at the start of kindergarten.2 The empirical evidence presented by

Fry (2002) and Arcidiacono et al. (2011) suggests that similar gaps exist at post-

secondary institutions. Ultimately these gaps translate into substantially lower completion

rates for African-Americans and Latinos compared to non-minorities. A major concern is

that, in spite of substantial publicity and some affirmative action, the gap has not shrunk

over the last two decades, which contrasts sharply with trends in other educational

disparities such as the gender gap.3 Such persistent disparities in educational attainment

may have major implications for income and wealth inequality across racial and ethnic

  Fryer and Levitt (2013) find no black/white gap in cognitive abilities at age 8 to 12 months. An extensive
literature examines the underlying causes of the black/white achievement gap among children and its
persistence even after controlling for a wide range of individual and family characteristics (e.g., see Jencks
and Phillips 1998). A few examples of recent explanations with empirical support include segregation
(Card and Rothstein 2007), attending schools with higher black enrollment shares and less teacher
experience (Hanushek and Rivkin 2008), permanent income disparities (Rothstein and Wozny 2011), lower
school quality (Fryer and Levitt 2004), and differences in social norms (Austen-Smith and Fryer, 2005).
For Hispanics, Reardon and Galindo (2009) find that the gaps in reading and math skills are largest for
Hispanic children where English is not spoken at home, but that these children also show the greatest
relative gains in the early years of schooling.

groups.4 It is therefore imperative to study the sources of the racial achievement gap and

to evaluate the effectiveness of potential policy interventions.

        A common, though hotly debated, policy prescription is to expand the

representation of minority instructors at all levels of the educational system. Indeed, there

is a general lack of minority instructors, especially at the post-secondary level: only 9.6

percent of all full-time instructional faculty at U.S. colleges are black, Latino or Native

American, while these groups comprise one-third of the college-age population and an

even higher percentage of children.5 As argued by many social scientists, this imposes

severe limits on the availability of role models, increases the likelihood of “stereotype

threats” and discrimination against minority students, and restricts exposure to instructors

with similar cultures and languages.

        In this paper we offer the first systematic empirical study of minority interactions

between students and instructors at the post-secondary education level. We test whether

underrepresented minority students experience significant achievement gains from being

taught by an underrepresented minority professor. "Underrepresented minority", which

we use interchangeably with "minority" below, includes African-Americans, Hispanics,

and Native Americans/Pacific Islanders, but not Asian-Americans.6 These questions are

examined using a novel and unique administrative dataset with detailed demographic

information on instructors as well as students from a large and ethnically diverse

community college. Our data contain comprehensive background information on

instructors and students for each class, students’ course-level academic outcomes, and

long-term outcomes such as majors, retention, degree completion, and transfers to 4-year

4
  Such arguments are made in e.g. Altonji and Blank (1999), Card (1999), and Jencks and Phillips (1998).

  This is the common definition used for "underrepresented minority" in California public higher education.

colleges. We are also able to match student-course-level data to administrative data on all

registration attempts and waitlists by students at the college, allowing us to examine

whether students get their first choice among sections.

        In addition to providing general evidence on the importance of social interactions

by race and ethnicity, our study is also the first to focus on the community college

system. The lack of previous research using data from community colleges is somewhat

surprising given that they enroll nearly half of all students attending public universities.

Since community colleges, in addition to providing workforce training, serve as an

important gateway to 4-year colleges, they can be seen as a crucial part of the post-

secondary educational system in the United States. In fact, in some states, including

California, nearly half of all students attending a 4-year college previously attended a

community college.7 With recent calls for major expansions in enrollments and provision

of 4-year transfer courses, one can expect that community colleges will gain further

importance.8 Policy interventions targeting community colleges are therefore likely to

have major effects on the educational system as a whole.

        It is well known that random assignment of students to classes does not occur at

community colleges or 4-year universities outside of the military post-secondary

educational system.9 We therefore employ several empirical strategies to rule out the

possibility that the estimates are driven by omitted variable biases, to explore the external

validity of our results, and to investigate the channels through which our estimated

  For example, President Obama has proposed an unprecedented funding increase for community colleges
that aims to boost graduates by 5 million students by 2020. In California, transfers from community
colleges to the California State University (CSU) system are projected to increase by 25 percent over the
next decade (California Postsecondary Education Commission 2010).

  Random assignment takes place at the U.S. Air Force Academy that provides undergraduate education for
officers in the U.S. Air Force (Carrell, Page, and West 2010).

                                                    3
reduced-form effects operate. Our basic empirical approach is built on a regression model

in which the parameter of interest is the differential effect between minority and non-

minority students of being assigned to a minority-instructor in the same class. This

answers the question of whether minority students experience gains relative to non-

minority students from being taught by minority instructors. The focus on estimation of

these interaction effects from panel data such as ours permits tremendous flexibility in

the types of specifications one can estimate. In particular, the explanatory variable of

interest varies both within student and within classroom, allowing us to estimate models

that simultaneously include student and classroom fixed effects. This eliminates biases

coming from student specific differences common across courses and classroom specific

differences common across classmates.10 Including classroom fixed effects leads to

standardizing grade outcomes, since we are only using within-classroom differences

among students who complete the same assignments, take the same exams, and are

subject to the same grading policies. Furthermore, our two-way fixed effects specification

with individual and class fixed effects controls for the possibility that minority and non-

minority students enroll in courses or subjects with more lenient grading policies. Given

the sample size – we observe over 30,000 students in nearly 21,000 classes – estimation

of this model by conventional algorithms is computationally infeasible. To address this

problem, we conduct the first application of an algorithm that has been applied to the

estimation of firm and worker fixed effects with large administrative data to the

estimation of student and teacher fixed effects.11


10
   Here and subsequently we use the term “class” or “classroom” to refer to a particular offering or section
of a course with a specific instructor during some term, such as "Principle of Microeconomics: ECON-
100". Hence, a "class" or "classroom" is uniquely defined by course title, section, and term.
11
   See for example Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) and Abowd, Creecy, and Kramarz (2002).

                                                      4
       While our empirical model addresses many of the potential threats to internal

validity, we cannot directly control for differential sorting across minority student groups

that may arise if, for example, highly motivated minority students systematically sort into

minority-taught classes while highly motivated non-minority students do not. However,

with an appropriate set of observable variables that is highly correlated with unobserved

student abilities, such as a student’s past academic performance, this hypothesis of

differential sorting is testable. Implementation of such a test using a rich set of

observables does not uncover any evidence of differential sorting. Nevertheless, we

exploit the institutional features at our community college to generate samples of students

in which the incidence of endogenous sorting of students to instructors is minimized. We

take advantage of the registration priority system at the community college and focus on

students with limited class enrollment choices. Given the intense competition for classes

created by negligible tuition, absence of admissions requirements, and desirable location

of the college, students with the lowest registration priority status have severely restricted

class enrollment choices. Registration attempt data confirm the limited choices of these

students (only 55 percent get their first section choice) and allow us to further refine the

sample. We also estimate our model from a sample of courses in which students have no

choice over instructor's race within a term or even academic year, thus ruling out the

possibility of sorting within that term or year by construction.

       We find that the minority achievement gap is smaller in classes taken with

minority instructors for several course outcome measures. Minority students obtain better

grades, are less likely to drop a course, are more likely to pass a course, and are more

likely to have a grade of at least a B. These gaps are reduced by 20-50percent with a



                                              5
minority instructor and translate into longer-run impacts on taking additional courses in

subjects, major choice, retention, and degrees. Effects on dropping a course in the first

few weeks, long-term outcomes, and performance in more objectively graded courses

such as those commonly using multiple-choice exams and math courses, suggest that

students are reacting to the race and ethnicity of the instructor rather than the other way

around. We find evidence of both positive role model effects, with minority students

performing better with minority instructors, and negative influences, with non-minority

students doing worse with minority instructors.

        Our paper is related to a number of studies, most notably Dee (2004, 2005, 2007)

and Ehrenberg, Goldhaber and Brewer (1995), that use data from the elementary and 8th

grade educational levels to estimate race and ethnicity interactions between students and

teachers. They find some evidence of positive student-teacher interactions by race and

gender. Our paper is also related to a small, but growing literature that focuses on gender

interactions between students and instructors at the post-secondary level. Similar to our

work, these studies rely increasingly on high-quality administrative student panel data

that can be matched to instructor-level data. They tend to conclude that female students

perform relatively better when matched to female instructors (e.g. Bettinger and Long

2005; Hoffmann and Oreopoulos 2009).12 A recent study by Carrell, Page, and West

(2010), which takes advantage of the random assignment of students to classrooms at the

U.S. Air Force Academy, also finds that female students perform better in math and

science courses with female instructors. None of these previous studies, however,


12
  A larger literature studies gender interactions at the primary or secondary school level. The findings are
generally mixed (see for example, Nixon and Robinson 1999, Ehrenberg, Goldhaber, and Brewer 1995,
Dee 2007, Holmlund and Sund 2005, Carrington, Tymms and Merrel 2008, Lahelma 2000, and Lavy and
Schlosser 2007).

examine the impact of an instructor’s minority status, race or ethnicity on student

outcomes at the post-secondary education level, due to not being able to obtain race

information on instructors and the lack of underrepresented minority faculty at more

selective colleges. This might be an important omission in the literature, as the effects of

minority faculty on minority students may be larger due to the sizeable racial

achievement gap and similarities in culture, language and economic backgrounds. In

addition, measures of racial inequality in education, income and other outcomes have not

decreased over the last two decades, in sharp contrast to corresponding measures of

gender inequality. Our data also allow us to explore interaction effects on a more

comprehensive set of course-level and long-term outcomes compared to previous studies.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 starts by providing some

institutional background, and then describes and summarizes the data. The next section

introduces our econometric framework. Section 4 presents evidence on student sorting

and the main results on racial interactions in educational outcomes. The final section

concludes.



2. Data

2.1 Institutional Background

       Our analysis is based on administrative data from De Anza College, a large

community college that is located in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is part of the

California Community College system, which is the largest higher educational system in

the United States with 110 colleges and 2.9 million students per year. De Anza College

has an average total enrolment of 22,000 students per year. It has a larger share of



                                             7
minority students than the nationally representative community college, reflecting the

diversity of Northern California. The College is on the quarter system, and the majority

of classes are restricted to 50 or fewer students. The tuition at De Anza College is $17 per

unit (roughly $850 per year in tuition and fees) with a large percentage of students

receiving fee waivers because of financial need. Similar to all community colleges in

California it has open enrolment – anyone with a high school diploma or equivalent is

automatically admitted.



2.2 Registration Priority System

        Open enrolment, very low tuition costs, mandated small class sizes, and its

location in the San Francisco Bay Area create intense competition for courses at De Anza

College. Because of the general excess demand for courses, the College has established a

strictly enforced registration priority system which determines the day on which students

are allowed to register over an eight-day period. Registration priority is determined by

whether the student is new, returning or continuing, the number of cumulative units

earned at De Anza College, and enrolment in special programs.13 It does not depend on

past academic performance. Incoming students and students who have taken a break

away from the college have the lowest priority status. Priority status improves for

continuing students by cumulative unit blocks.




13
  We remove students enrolled in special and often minority-student focused programs, such as SLAM,
STARS, and SSRC. These students receive special registration priority status even if they are new or
returning students.

                                                   8
         A student’s registration priority has a large impact on his or her choice of

classes.14 Conversations with college administrators revealed that students with a low

ranking on course-priority lists have severely limited choices in instructors. As a

consequence, for a particular course that has multiple class offerings these students

should be expected to have little control over the instructor with whom they are matched.

We confirm this anecdotal evidence by analyzing detailed registration attempt and wait-

list data from the college. We find that among students with a low registration priority,

only 54.9 percent of the course sections in which students first attempt to register result in

an actual enrolment, compared with approximately 74.5 percent for students with a

higher registration priority We also find higher probabilities of being placed on wait lists

for first registration attempts among low-registration priority students compared to

students with higher registration priorities (7.2 percent compared with 3.4 percent).



2.3 Data Set

         Matching several administrative datasets from the college, National Student

Clearinghouse data, and data from other sources, we are able to examine an extensive set

of course and long-term outcomes as well as detailed demographic characteristics for

every student registered at the community college from fall quarter of 2002 to spring

quarter of 2007. The data on course outcomes record grades, course credits, and course

dropout behaviour for every class offered by De Anza College over the five-year period.

We are able to match them to detailed data on demographic characteristics of instructors,

such as race, ethnicity, age, and gender for every class. To our knowledge, this is the first


14
  In personal conversations with college administrators we have learned that students often register for
classes as soon as they are allowed to through the system because of the intense competition for courses.

                                                     9
dataset that contains detailed information about instructors’ race together with student

class outcomes on the post-secondary education level. A student's registration priority

together with any of her registration attempts is recorded at the beginning of each

quarter.15 Hence, the course-level dataset allows us to match students to classes that

students enrolled in before their first day of the term, regardless of whether they

completed the class or not.

         Administrative data from the college provide information on majors together with

all associate and vocational degrees received through summer 2010 for each student

enrolled over the five-year period. We obtain data on an additional long-term outcome –

transfers to 4-year colleges – by linking National Student Clearinghouse data through

summer 2012 to all of the students enrolled during the five-year period.



2.4 Sample Restrictions and Summary Statistics

         We first exclude recreational courses, such as cooking, sports and photography,

orientation courses, and summer courses from our analysis. In the main sample we also

exclude courses that have an average enrolment per session of less than 15 students and

small academic departments to minimize computation without losing identification

power. To remove concerns about local community residents taking classes for

recreational purposes and to focus on the general college-age population, we exclude

students who are over 35 years old in the main sample. Only 2.4 percent of all student-

class observations are for small courses, 1.2 percent of observations are for courses from




15
  The registration attempt data record the exact date and time the registration attempt was made together
with the outcome, such as whether the attempt was successful or ended on a waitlist.

                                                    10
a small academic department, and 9.2 percent of observations are for older students. The

resulting sample consists of 446,239 student-class observations.

         Of the main sample, 29 percent of observations are from students with low

registration priority status and 10 percent of student/class observations are from entering

students (Panel A, Table 1). Another method of restricting choice among students is to

include course-term or course-year combinations for which different sections are taught

by different instructors, all of which share a particular minority status. Sixty-one percent

of student/class observations have no variation in underrepresented minority status within

quarters and 52 percent of student/class observations have no variation in

underrepresented minority status within academic-years. In terms of types of courses in

the main sample, we find that only 3 percent of student/class observations are in language

courses and 6 percent are in video-delivered classes. We also find that 26 percent of

observations are vocational courses, and 70 percent are courses that are transferable to

University of California (UC) or California State University (CSU) campuses, reflecting

the reputation of De Anza College of being a more academically oriented community

college. We conduct sensitivity analyses with all of these types of courses below.

         There are important differences in student outcomes across groups. White and

Asian students have the highest average outcomes (Panel B, Table 1). Hispanics, African-

American, and Native American, Pacific Islander and other non-white students are more

likely to drop classes, are less likely to pass classes, receive lower average grades, and are

less likely to receive a good grade (B or higher).16 For most outcomes, these differences


16
  Students have to drop a class by the end of the second week of the quarter to avoid paying for the class
and by the end of the third week to avoid getting a record of a grade. A GPA equivalent to a letter grade of
a B is commonly used as a minimum threshold for qualification for admission to the University of
California.

                                                     11
are large and statistically significant, documenting that the largest differences in

academic outcomes take place along the underrepresented minority-non-underrepresented

minority margin rather than along less aggregated measures of differences in race and

ethnicity. Aggregating up these statistics for the underrepresented minority group yields a

dropout rate of 28 percent. The average GPA is 2.6 (where 4.0 is equivalent to an A), and

57 percent of classes taken by students for letter grades receive a grade of B or higher. Of

all underrepresented minority students who finish classes, the total pass rate is 83.5

percent. There also exist racial and ethnic differences in long-term outcomes. African-

American, Latino and other underrepresented students have substantially lower retention

rates, are less likely to obtain a degree from the community college, and are less likely to

transfer to a 4-year college.

       Panel C of Table 1 displays the racial and ethnic composition of the student body

and instructors. White students comprise 28 percent of all students and Asians comprise

51 percent of students. Hispanic students represent the largest underrepresented minority

group with 14 percent of all students. African-American students comprise 4 percent of

students and Native American, Pacific Islanders, and other non-white students comprise 3

percent of students. Underrepresented minorities comprise 21 percent of the total student

body. The racial distribution of instructors at the college differs substantially from the

student distribution. 70 percent of instructors are white. In contrast, only 14 percent of

instructors are Asian and 6 percent of instructors are Hispanic. Interestingly, the

percentage of African-American instructors and Native American, Pacific Islander and

other non-white instructors are slightly higher than their representation in the student

body. The lack of minority instructors at De Anza College does not differ from the



                                            12
national pattern for all colleges. Roughly 10 percent of all college instructors are from

underrepresented minority groups (U.S. Department of Education 2010). At De Anza

College, 16 percent of instructors are from underrepresented minority groups.



3. Statistical Methodology

3.1 Basic Econometric Model

      We now turn to the description of the econometric models for the student outcome

variables, y ijkst , such as course dropout behaviour and grade. We index students by i ,

instructors by j , courses by k , sections by s , and term (i.e. quarter) by t . Let min_stud i

and min_inst j be indicator variables that are equal to one if student i and instructor j

belong to an underrepresented minority group, respectively, and let X ijkst and u ijkst be

vectors of observable and unobservable variables affecting outcomes. To test whether

minority students gain from being taught by a minority instructor, a natural starting point

is to consider the regression:

(1)              y ijkst   0   1 * min_inst   j    X' ijkst   u ijkst .

for a sample of only minority students. It is not our preferred specification because

average teaching abilities and grading standards of minority and non-minority instructors

in the sample may not be the same, and it is therefore helpful to specify an empirical

model that is estimated on the full sample which can allow for classroom fixed effects.

We thus estimate the relative student-instructor interaction effect,  3 , from the

regression:

                 yijkst   0   1 * min_inst j   2 * min_stud i

The parameter of interest is  3 and determines the difference in the minority-instructor

effect between minority and non-minority students. It thus measures the extent to which

minority gaps in the outcome variables depend on whether the students are assigned to a

minority or a non-minority instructor. The parameter,  3 , is consistently estimated if

cov u ijkst ; interact ij   0 , where interact ij = min_inst j * min_stud i . Correlations between

the interaction term and the unobserved component, however, may be caused by several

factors we discuss below. We therefore impose the following structure on the error u ijkst :

(3)              u ijkst   i   kst   ijkst .

where  i and        kst are student and classroom fixed effects, respectively. Dropping

student- and class-level variables from equation (2) that are multicollinear with either of

the fixed effects, we obtain our preferred empirical model:

(4)              yic   3 * min_stud i * min_inst c   i  c  u ic

where we have replaced the combination of the indices k , s , t by a classroom index c

and where we have indexed the minority-instructor dummy by c rather than j .

      The focus on the interaction term of students’ and instructors’ minority status allows

us to identify individual and classroom fixed effects, thereby overcoming many threats to

the internal validity of estimates that have plagued the literature on student-teacher

interactions. Importantly, our specification implicitly controls for instructor fixed effects

and minority-specific course fixed effects since a student can enrol only in one section

per course, and since each class is taught by exactly one instructor. The former controls

for the possibility that minority students take courses from instructors who have

systematically different grading policies from other instructors, while the latter controls


                                                     14
for selection by comparative advantage where minority students are drawn to courses that

are a particularly good match or in which minority instructors are relatively

overrepresented. A further advantage of including classroom fixed effects is that they

avoid the need to rely on data with standardized testing procedures across classrooms

since within the same classroom students are taking exactly the same tests. Unless

instructors discriminate against certain groups of students, consciously or subconsciously,

students within a class are subject to identical grading criteria.17 These issues are specific

examples of classroom level shocks (i.e. factors that are unobserved by the

econometrician, that vary at the classroom level, and that affect student performance). It

is therefore essential to only compare academic performances of minority and non-

minority students who enrol in the same class, which subjects them to the same class-

level shocks such as an instructor’s teaching performance or philosophy, the time of day,

or external disruptions. Finally, we include individual fixed effects  i in our regressions

to control for absolute sorting that takes place if students taking classes from minority

instructors are systematically different from those who do not, irrespective of their

minority background.

         While our specification addresses many of the potential threats to internal

validity, we cannot directly control for differential sorting across minority student groups

that may arise due to correlations between the unobserved component u ic and the

interaction term. Such correlations exist if for example highly motivated minority

students systematically sort into minority-taught classes, while highly motivated non-

17
   The possibility that student-instructor interactions may exist because instructors react to students rather
than vice versa is explored in detail in section 4.6. This issue may arise, however, even if tests are
standardized and if students are randomly assigned to instructors. It is thus not a matter of omitted variable
bias, but a matter of interpreting the reduced-form coefficient  3 correctly.

                                                      15
minority students systematically sort into non-minority-taught classes. In this case the

following inequality will apply:

        E u ic | min_stud i  1, min_inst c  1  E u ic | min_stud i  0, min_inst c  1
(5)
         E u ic | min_stud i  1, min_inst c  0   E u ic | min_stud i  0, min_inst c  0  .

The differences on each side of the inequality are “minority gaps” in unobserved

components. The inequality can be replaced by an equality only if these gaps do not

depend on the minority status of the instructor, which is the case if there are minority

gaps that persist across all classes, independent of instructor characteristics. This type of

gap is implicitly controlled for in our empirical model through the inclusion of individual

fixed effects and the estimation of what is essentially a difference-in-difference.

       The hypothesis of differential sorting is testable if one has access to some

measurable characteristics, x ic , that are highly correlated with u ic . Consider minority-

specific classroom averages of x ic , denoted X mc , where m  0,1 is an index equal to

one if the average is computed for minority-students and zero if it is computed for non-

minority students. Since a classroom is associated with exactly one instructor minority

status, these averages are the empirical counterparts of the conditional expectations in

equation (5). We can then test for differential sorting by estimating a difference-in-

difference model:

(6)     X mc   1 * min_inst c   2 *  m   3 * min_inst c *  m   mc
                                                                              .

where  m is a dummy variable equal to one if m  1 and zero otherwise, and  3 is an

empirical estimate of the difference-in-difference in equation (5), with the observable

measure, x ic , replacing the unobserved component, u ic . Hence,  3 quantifies the extent

to which minority gaps in an observable variable, x ic , vary across classes that are taught

                                                   16
by instructors of different minority groups. Clearly, an estimate of  3 is only helpful in

testing for differential sorting if x ic is strongly related to u ic . Given the richness of our

data, we are able to use several variables, such as past academic performance, age and

gender, as measureable characteristics to estimate a large set of “sorting regressions”

such as equation (6).

        By including classroom fixed effects we implicitly control for systematic

differences in subject or course choices and associated grading differences between

minority and non-minority students. Differential sorting thus is an issue if it takes place

across class offerings of a course, which may happen if there is unrestricted student

choice of classes and multiple sections offered for the same course in the same term. To

address these remaining concerns we estimate specifications in which the sample of

students and courses is chosen to minimize the possibility of differential sorting across

classes. We estimate equation (4) using a sample of students who have the lowest

registration priority status, samples that rule out variation in instructors’ minority status

across classes within course-term or course-year, and a sample of students who do not

obtain their first section of choice identified by the registration attempt data.

       We estimate this model for five different student course outcome variables. The

first four are a dummy variable for whether a student drops the course by the first three

weeks of the quarter, a dummy variable for whether a student passes the course

conditional on finishing it, a course grade variable that is normalized to have mean zero

and unit standard deviation within a course, and a dummy variable for whether the

student has a grade above a B-. All of these outcomes relate to a student’s academic

achievement in a particular course. Our data also allow an exploration of whether


                                              17
minority interactions are relevant for a student’s future curriculum. We therefore generate

a fifth outcome variable that records whether a student takes another course in the same

subject in the next quarter, which cannot be directly influenced by the instructor.

       In the main specifications, we identify the relative effect of an underrepresented

minority student being assigned to an underrepresented minority instructor (i.e. African-

American, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white).            This

specification implicitly assumes that underrepresented minority students are influenced

by any underrepresented minority instructor (e.g. Hispanics react equally whether

matched to a Hispanic or black instructor) and by a similar amount. The alternative case

of interaction effects only when a student is matched with a same race/ethnicity instructor

takes us in the other direction, assuming 1) no effect across minority types (e.g. no

interaction effect for Hispanic students matched to Black instructors or vice versa), and 2)

the performance gap from white and black students being assigned to a black instructor is

the same as that for Hispanic and black students assigned to a black instructor. As

discussed below, when we estimate a full set of interactions for each student type and

each instructor type we find evidence against both these assumptions, and therefore

estimate interaction effects with any minority instructor for our baseline results. Similar

results are obtained with the alternative specification and are displayed in Appendix

Table 3.



3.2 Estimation of Two-Way Fixed Effect Model for Course Outcomes

       Estimation of two-way fixed effects models with unbalanced panel data becomes

computationally infeasible with large data sets. With more than 30,000 students and over



                                             18
20,000 classrooms in our data, model parameters cannot be estimated directly by OLS.

Since our data set is a non-balanced panel, conventional within transformations are not

possible, either. We thus rely on recent advances in the estimation of firm-and worker

fixed effects from administrative data. The computational algorithms used to estimate

two-way fixed effects models with high-dimensional sets of dummy variables generally

rely on the fact that each individual only contributes to the identification of a subset of

the fixed effects.18 In our example, each student only contributes to the identification of

the classrooms she or he visits at one point. This implies that normal equations involve

block-diagonal (“sparse”) matrices whose inversion is much less difficult than the

inversion of non-sparse matrices. In practice, one performs a within-transformation in a

first step to eliminate individual fixed effects, and then solves the remaining normal

equations using matrix-inversion schemes that exploit the block-diagonal structure of the

remaining matrices.19



3.3 Bounds on Grades

         Estimation of the econometric models for grade outcomes is possible only for the

sample of students who complete the course. The propensity to finish a course might be

affected by the variable of interest – the minority-status interactions between students and

instructors within classrooms - as well. This creates a potential sample selection problem,

formally described by the following set of equations:

18
   The seminal paper in this literature is Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999). Refinements have been
developed by Abowd, Creezy and Kramarz (2002) and Andrews et al (2008). Cornelissen (2008) has
written a Stata-routine based on these algorithms.
19
   The literature estimating firm-and worker fixed effects also utilizes the fact that many workers never
change firms, thus not contributing to identification of any of the firm fixed effects. This can further
increase the speed of computation. In our example, we cannot apply this method since nearly all students
take more than one class in the data and thus contribute to the identification of at least some classroom
fixed effects.

                                                    19

                             grade                                     grade          grade            grade

            dropped ic   1              * min_stud i * min_inst c   i                 c               u ic
                                dropped                                        dropped          dropped             dropped
(8)

(9)        gradeic  1  droppedic  * gradeic* .

Equations (7) and (8) replicate equation (4) for the grade-outcome and the dropout-

variable, while equation (9) accounts for the potential selection bias. OLS-estimates of

the parameter of interest, 1 grade , are biased conditionally on individual fixed effects if

 1 dropped is significantly different from zero. Correcting for sample selection using a

Heckman-selection model is difficult in our case since any variable affecting dropout

behavior arguably also affects potential grades limiting our ability to find an exclusion

restriction. Furthermore, with the inclusion of classroom- and student fixed effects,

estimates from reduced-form Probit equations required for a Heckit-procedure are biased.

We thus estimate non-parametric bounds of 1 grade following Lee (2009).20

           In general, OLS-estimates are biased downward if minority students are less

likely to drop the course when the instructor belongs to the minority group as well, and if

the marginal students induced to stay come from the left tail of the grade distribution. The

estimates are instead biased upward if the marginal students come from the right tail of

the grade distribution. We can therefore estimate an upper (lower) bound of 1 grade when

applying OLS to a sample without the (  1 dropped *100)-percent worst (best) minority

students in classes taught by a minority instructor.

           We therefore apply the following procedure: In the first step we estimate equation

(8) for the dropout-variable. This provides us with an estimate of  1 dropped , the “minority


20
     See also Krueger and Whitmore (2002) and Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009) for a related application.

                                                          20
gap” in dropout behavior when the class is taught by a minority instructor. We then

                                                                
calculate the (  1 dropped *100) percentile ( 1   1dropped *100 percentile) of the minority-

student grade distribution for every class taught by a minority instructor and drop all

minority students with a final grade lower (higher) than this percentile. Since we are

focusing on selection due to the relative difference from having a minority instructor

between minority and non-minority students, we do not need to trim marginal non-

minority students. In the second step we use this restricted sample to estimate the same

equation as in the first step, but with final grade replacing the dropout variable as the

outcome. We also perform this algorithm by running the dropout-regressions course-by-

course, therefore providing us with course-specific estimates of  1 dropped . As Lee (2009)

shows, this procedure yields the tightest bounds on the parameter of interest if the

outcome variable is continuous. We thus compute the bounds only for the grade variable,

which is our only continuous outcome variable, while leaving the results for the discrete

outcome “Passed Course” uncorrected.21

         We interpret these bounds results as a robustness check rather than as the main

part of our analysis. By the logic of minority instructors serving as role-models, one may

expect that it is the lower-achieving minority students rather than the best students who

are at the margin of dropping a class and who are induced not to do so because they share

the minority status with their instructor. We test this assumption by estimating a version

of equation (4) for the course dropout variable that allows for an interaction between the



21
   Strictly speaking, this variable is not continuous, either. For our application, this can be problematic
because the grade distribution has mass-points at the lower and upper tail. Hence, if we trim the distribution
at the x%-percentile, we might drop more than x% of the student/grade observations. We solve this
problem by randomly drawing from the student/grade observations clustered at the mass-points in such a
way that exactly x% of the distribution is trimmed.

minority interaction and prior GPA and reject the hypothesis that the minority interaction

is stronger for those with a higher prior GPA.



3.4 Long-Term Outcome Models

        In addition to estimating minority instructor-student interactions effects on

subsequent subject course selection, we also examine effects on more aggregated

performance indicators: Retention at the community college, obtaining an associates or

vocational degree, and transferring to a 4-year college. As a consequence of aggregation

that generates only one observation per student we cannot include either classroom or

student fixed effects. Instead, we start with estimating a regression model for long-term

outcomes that includes a rich set of controls for student and instructor, year dummies for

the first term of enrolment, and the number of courses taken in the first term.22 This

specification is of the form of equation (2). In all regressions for aggregate outcomes we

focus on the student-instructor interactions for entering students, mainly because they are

automatically assigned to the lowest level on the registration priority list and have limited

information their first term, but also because results would be confounded by dynamic

accumulation effects otherwise.

        To further address endogeneity concerns, we estimate two additional models. In

the spirit of matching estimators, the first of these models include a set of fixed effects

for each set of courses taken in the first term. Since students taking the exact same set of

courses in their first term are assigned the same fixed effect we compare individuals that

“look very similar” with respect to their behaviour at college entry. Variation in having a

22
  We use age, gender, financial aid receipt, educational goals at the time of application, free and reduced
lunch rate of high school and private high school attendance as controls for student characteristics, and
instructor's full- vs. part-time status, gender and age as controls for instructor characteristics.

                                                    22
minority instructor would result from students taking these courses in different terms or

in some cases different sections.

         The second approach follows Bettinger and Long (2005) and uses the average

deviation in minority instructor shares from steady-state minority instructor shares by

department as an instrumental variable. This instrument is arguably driven by exogenous

variation from term to term (i.e. caused by sabbatical leaves, new hires, variability in the

temporary lecturer pool, retirements, and variability in the number of section offerings).

This variation is averaged across a student's course set and then used as an instrument for

whether the student has a minority instructor in the first term.23 We present estimates for

the three specifications for all long-term outcomes.



4. Results

4.1 Evidence against Sorting

         We use several strategies to rule out the possibility that our results are being

driven by unobserved classroom-specific selection. With the inclusion of classroom and

student fixed effects, the primary threat to validity arises from the possibility that classes

where minority students perform better relative to non-minority students than usual are

also classes with a minority instructor and that this effect is not due to the interaction

itself. We first investigate whether there is evidence of non-random sorting by minority

status using equation (6) for various background variables that are likely to be correlated

with the unobserved ability term. We focus on the interaction coefficient,  3 , measuring


23
  The instrumental variable is equal to the difference between the minority share of instructors in that term
and department and the minority share of instructors in that department over all years (i.e. the steady-state
minority instructor share for that department). For additional variation we follow Bettinger and Long
(2005) and define separate steady-state minority instructor shares for fall, winter and spring quarters.

                                                     23
the extent to which the minority-gap in the outcomes varies across classes taught by

minority and non-minority instructors and is thus an estimate of differential sorting.

         Results using several different student background variables are presented in

Table 2. Standard errors are clustered at the course-term-minority level.24 We use the

following four outcome variables, corresponding to the variable X mc in equation (6):

student age, gender, the cumulated number of courses, and the cumulated GPA prior to

enrolment. As past GPA and present GPA are highly correlated, we view the last variable

as a particularly good measure of a potential unobserved student component that might be

related to differential selection. In particular, if the minority-non-minority gap of

accumulated GPA prior to enrolment in the current course is different in classes that are

taught by minority instructors, our assumption of no differential sorting is most likely

violated.

         We do not find evidence of sorting: None of the estimates are statistically

significant at any conventional level. Furthermore, this insignificance is not driven by the

imprecision of our estimates. Rather, point estimates fluctuate considerably as we explore

the robustness of our estimates across sub-samples, indicating that we cannot detect any

systematic or robust sorting patterns in the data.25 Most importantly, minority gaps in

accumulated GPA prior to course enrolment – a variable that is most likely to be highly

correlated with unobserved student traits – do not depend on instructor race. In other

words, we do not find evidence that high ability minority students are more likely to take



24
   We obtain similar results when standard errors are instead clustered at the instructor level (see Appendix
Table 1). .
25
   We find that these results are robust with respect to the regression specification, the sample, and the type
of variation in instructor minority status across different class offerings of a course. See Fairlie, Hoffmann
and Oreopoulos (2011) for results.

                                                      24
minority-taught classes compared with high ability non-minority students. We interpret

this as strong evidence in favour of our working hypothesis of no differential sorting.



4.2 Main Results

         Estimates of the minority interactions between students and instructors for all five

course outcomes using the full sample and a subsample of students who are low on the

registration priority list are reported in Table 3. We also explore the sensitivity of results

with respect to the set of fixed effects included in the econometric models. As we move

along the columns, we increasingly restrict the variation used to identify our parameter of

interest. Results from our preferred specification described in equation (4) which includes

both student and classroom fixed effects are displayed in column (8) of the table. The

other specifications considered in the table include minority-specific time fixed effects

and a set of student and instructor controls (column 1), a specification that adds minority-

specific course fixed effects (column 2), a specification with minority-specific course-

time fixed effects (column 3), and specifications with student, classroom and instructor

fixed effects (columns 4 to 7, respectively). Standard errors are clustered by instructor.26

         There are significant minority interaction effects on student dropout behaviour

and grade performance that are robust with respect to the sample used and the set of fixed

effects included. Our main estimates indicate a reduction of the minority gap in course


26
    We follow Cameron and Miller's (2013) suggestion of adapting a conservative strategy by choosing
larger clusters. A natural choice is to cluster on the instructor level since this is the level of the treatment
variation in our interaction analysis. However, a potential problem with this strategy is that the majority of
the instructors in our sample teach multiple classes. As a consequence, standard errors clustered at the
instructor level depend directly on classroom fixed effects which are estimated with (small-sample) bias. It
is therefore plausible to assume that our standard errors are inflated. We have also estimated all
specifications with clustering standard errors at the classroom level. This reduces standard error estimates
slightly, but does not affect overall conclusions. We report these alternative results for our main
specifications in Appendix Table 2.

                                                       25
dropout behaviour when taught by a minority instructor by 2 to 3 percentage points and

in student grades by 5 percent of a standard deviation. These results are robust when

including instructor or classroom fixed effects or when using minority-course fixed

effects, implying that they are not being driven by grading differences across classes or

student sorting by comparative advantage into subjects and courses.27 Our baseline model

with both class and student fixed effects also indicates strong minority interaction effects

on the probability of passing a course among students and the probability of receiving a

grade of B or higher. All of these estimates imply large effects relative to the minority

base rates and the white-minority gaps in outcomes. Underrepresented minority students

are 1.2-2.8 percentage points more likely to pass classes relative to a minority base of 83

percent percent, 2.0-2.9 percent less likely to drop out of classes relative to minority base

of 29 percent, and 2.4-3.2 percentage points more likely to get a grade of B or higher

relative to a minority base of 55 percent in classes with underrepresented instructors. Our

evidence of interaction effects at the extensive margin, like remaining in a course, and at

the intensive margin, like grades within a course, suggests that students are influenced in

multiple ways from instructors' racial and ethnic composition. .

         The minority gap in the probability of continuing a subject in the following

quarter is significantly affected by the minority status of the instructor as well.28 This is


27
   The inclusion of course-minority fixed effects also helps condition out for possible minority interactions
from students having a comparative advantage in some subjects. Minority students may be better at some
of the subjects that minority instructors tend to teach. The inclusion of course-minority fixed effects control
for this possibility. Examining performance by subject directly, we find that minority students perform at a
lower level than non-minority students in all subjects. We also estimated the minority-non-minority grade
gap by the concentration of minority instructors in that subject and found no relationship (see Appendix
Figure 1).
28
   We investigate this further by estimating three sets of regression specifications related to choosing
college majors using the different sources of variation for identification discussed in Section 3.2. We
examine the minority instructor effect on 1) the first course/s taken in a subject, 2) choosing to major in that
subject and 3) taking any additional courses in that subject. We find evidence of positive effects of minority

                                                      26
an important outcome of interest because it cannot be directly manipulated by the

instructor and is thus more consistent with students reacting to instructors through, for

example, role model effects than through preferential grading (which we investigate in

more detail in Section 5).

         Estimates vary across columns somewhat more when we use the restricted sample

of low-registration priority students, however, estimates for all outcomes in our preferred

specification reported in column 8 indicate significant minority interactions at least at the

10 percent significance level (the only exception is that we lose statistical significance for

grades although the point estimate is very similar to the full sample). The lack of

sensitivity of estimates to the low-registration priority students provides further evidence

that is consistent with the lack of racial sorting across course offerings noted above. We

continue to report estimates from both samples throughout because of the trade-off

between restricting the sample to lessen concerns about potential sorting and using the

full sample to increase precision.

         Table 4 shows these results to hold generally when estimating our model for

detailed races rather than the aggregated minority group. While student fixed effects

absorb the interaction for one of the student groups – in our case “whites” - the classroom

fixed effects absorb the interaction for one of the instructor groups – again “whites”.

Thus, only 9 of the 16 race and ethnicity interactions are identified and all estimated

interaction effects are relative to outcomes for white students with alternative instructor

types. We present the P-value from F-tests for two hypotheses of major interest, namely

for the presence of an own-race interaction and for the presence of any race interaction.

instructors on minority students in majoring in that subject, taking any additional courses in that subject,
and the total number of additional courses in that subject. These results confirm the course-level results for
continuing a subject in the following quarter.

                                                      27
We find strong and robust evidence for own-race interactions. The positive interaction

estimates are not overly sensitive to whether we use the full sample or limit the sample to

low-registration priority students. We find positive interactions for all major racial groups

with African-American students experiencing particularly large and robust relative gains

from being taught by a same-race instructor. This is particularly noteworthy given that

African-American students and instructors account for only 4 percent and 6 percent of the

sample, respectively. We also find evidence that Hispanic student academic performance

improves from assignment to Black instructors, rather than a White instructors (but not

vice versa).



4.3 Robustness Checks and External Validity

       Although there is robust evidence against differential sorting, the fixed effects

control for most problems with selection, and limiting the sample to low-registration

priority students restricts choice, we address remaining concerns that unobserved

differences in student traits between minority and non-minority students vary across

classes based on the minority-status of the instructor. We experiment with three

specifications that further restrict the variation in instructor minority status within course-

time and across classrooms. Results for various subsamples are shown in Table 5, with

individual and class fixed effects included in all specifications.

       First we consider a specification that drops observations for which courses in the

same quarter are taught by both minority and non-minority instructors. Identification of

minority student-instructor interactions therefore comes only from across quarter

variation in instructor ethnicity or race. In the second of this set of regressions we further



                                              28
restrict the sample to exclude variation in instructor minority status within an academic

year for a given course. In this case, students would have to postpone taking a course for

an entire academic year to satisfy a potential racial preference in their instructor, which

may be very difficult given the required sequencing of courses and two-year enrolment

goals. The third specification focuses on a sample of students who failed to enrol in the

course section of their first choice. We construct this sample from our unique

administrative dataset that records all registration attempts by students and their order for

any section within a course in which a student attempts to enrol. As noted above, we find

that only 54.9 percent of low-registration priority students enrol in their first section

choice.

          We find a consistent pattern of significant minority interactions when using all

students which are similar to the estimates from the main sample. When relying on the

sample of students with a low registration priority our point estimates are consistent with

the evidence presented above. Although the estimates are imprecise for this sample, their

confidence intervals mostly contain the estimates from the full sample.

          Further robustness exercises that are estimated on other subgroups by type of

student and type of course are shown in Appendix Table 4. To summarize, first, we do

not find evidence that the minority interactions are gender specific. Both male and female

minority students perform relatively better with minority instructors compared to non-

minority instructors. Second, results are robust to the exclusion of language courses or

video-delivered courses.

          Panel B of Appendix Table 4 displays results that explore whether our findings

are driven by particular institutional features of community colleges relative to 4-year



                                             29
colleges. A first potential concern is students who have an “unstable” academic career

and periodically enrol in courses at community college. We therefore limit our sample of

students who are lowest on the registration priority list to those who enrol at the College

for the first time. This yields point estimates that are nearly identical to those obtained

from a sample of all low registration priority students, suggesting that our results are not

driven by more senior students who are frequently leaving and returning to the college.

The smaller sample size, however, leads to insignificance of our estimates.

       A second concern regarding external validity arises due to the types of courses

that are offered at community colleges. We therefore allow parameters to depend on

whether courses are vocational or not and whether they can be transferred to the

University of California and California State University systems. If anything we find that

transferable courses and non-vocational courses have larger minority interaction effects

for most outcomes.



4.4 Bounds analysis of interaction effects on grades

       Table 6 displays lower and upper bounds of the minority interaction effects when

using standardized grade outcomes as the dependent variable. We compute these bounds

following the procedure described in Section 3.3 and interpret them as a robustness

exercise. When using the full sample, estimates are bounded between 3.9 percent and 7.7

percent of a standard deviation in the course grade. The estimated lower and upper

bounds are all statistically significant at conventional levels. When using the sample of

low-priority students instead, the sample sizes decrease and the bounds widen. The

bounds are 2.7 percent and 8.2 percent of a standard deviation in the course grade.



                                            30
Standard errors increase by a factor 2, but the upper bounds are statistically significant.

Taken together, these results provide further evidence of a robust and quite substantial

minority interaction effect on grades, in addition to a substantial effect on the probability

of dropping a class.

       As argued above, we interpret our uncorrected estimates as representing a lower

bound of minority interactions, since those who are at the margin of dropping a class and

who are induced not to do so because they share the minority status with their instructor

are more likely to be from the lower part of the student ability distribution. This

monotonicity assumption can be tested by estimating a version of model (4) for the

course dropout variable that allows for an interaction between the minority interaction

and prior GPA. It is violated if the minority-interaction is stronger for those with a higher

prior GPA. The estimated minority-interactions are -0.023 (s.e. 0.015) and -0.037 (s.e.

0.025) for the full sample and the sample of low registration priority students,

respectively, while the corresponding triple-interactions with prior GPA are 0.0007 (s.e.

0.005) and 0.004 (s.e. 0.009) respectively. Since the minority effects are estimated to be

negative, their positive interactions with prior GPA thus are in accordance with our

hypothesis. However, these estimates are not significant, suggesting that differential

dropout behavior does not depend systematically on a student’s academic abilities.



4.5 Long-Term Outcomes

       Do the social interactions we find at the course level aggregate to affect longer-

term outcomes? We have shown that they do for subsequent course selection, but what

about other educational outcomes that are more directly correlated with labour market



                                             31
outcomes such retention, degree completion, and transferring to 4-year colleges? Table 7

reports estimates from three main regression specifications for these aggregate outcomes

that use different sources of identifying variation.     We estimate relative effects for

minority students on the share of minority instructors in the first term as described in

section 3.4.

       Examining longer term outcomes prevents the use of student or classroom fixed

effects, but we can condition on students taking the same set of courses in their first term.

We can also instrument instructor minority share in first term with deviations from trend

in the share of minority instructors teaching for any given course, in any given term. Our

earlier baseline results suggest conditioning on observable student background

characteristics leads to similar estimates than when using student fixed effects. So

perhaps our long-term estimated effects are reasonably unbiased.

       The first outcome examined is an indicator variable for whether the student

remains at the college over the next two quarters (a full academic year). The selection-

on-observables model reported in Column 1 suggests that raising the share of minority

instructors by one standard deviation (0.25) would increase the relative retention rate for

minorities by about 2.5 percentage points (relative to a minority base rate of 62 percent).

This change would close roughly one third of the white-minority gap in the retention rate.

We obtain a similar estimate when adding fixed effects for the set of courses a student

takes in the first term. When instrumenting instructor share with deviations from trend

we also estimate a statistically significant effect on retention, though larger and less

precise. The second outcome examined is whether a student obtains an associates or

vocational degree. A one standard deviation increase in the minority instructor share



                                             32
leads to roughly a 1.5 percentage point higher relative probability of receiving a degree

(relative to a minority base rate of 14 percent). Estimates from the IV model indicate

larger, but less precisely estimated effects. The evidence for effects on transferring to a 4-

year college, however, is mixed. We find a small and insignificant estimate in column

one, but negative and positive estimates in the remaining two specifications. When

estimating effects on transferring only to UC or Cal State campuses, we find smaller and

less significant estimates. Overall, the race or ethnicity of an instructor appears to exert

an important influence on the long-term outcomes of students in addition to short-term

effects on grades and other course outcomes.29



4.6 Mechanisms

         In this section, we further explore the candidate mechanisms driving the social

interactions we estimate above. One key question is whether our estimated effects are due

to students or instructors behaving differently. An obvious potential source of instructor

discrimination is through grading. Several pieces of evidence, however, point against this

explanation. First, we identified courses and departments that commonly use multiple

choice, true/false, matching and performance tests, and/or math courses over of

potentially more "subjective" essay-type tests, reports, presentations and class

participation by conducting an extensive examination of course syllabi and web pages,

course catalogues, and discussions with administrative staff and instructors. The use of

multiple choice, true/false and matching type exams are prevalent at the college, which

may be due in part to faculty having heavy teaching loads of 10-15 courses per academic

29
  These estimates are robust to alternative measures of the outcomes, having any minority instructor
instead of the minority share of instructors, using all courses instead of first term courses, using the first
observed term, and the included controls.

                                                       33
year. Appendix Table 5 shows that estimation of our model on this sample yields results

that are very similar to those documented above. As these courses are graded more

objectively, these results provide evidence in favour of interactions occurring from

students reacting to instructors rather than the opposite.

         Second, we have documented significant, robust, and sizable minority effects with

respect to course dropout behaviour. The minority gap in this outcome decreases by 2 to

3 percentage points if the class is taught by a minority instructor. The decision to drop

out of the class is made entirely by the student and must be made in the first three weeks

of a term, well before final grades are assigned by instructors. Third, we also find

evidence that race/ethnicity interactions affect longer term outcomes, such as taking

subsequent courses in the same subject, major choice, retention, and degree receipt.

Instructors have no direct effect through grading but possibly serve as role models or

generate interest and continuing studies in a subject.30 Fourth, when allowing minority

effects to vary across three age groups we find an absence of interaction effects for older

students (Appendix Table 5). This also goes against the theory of instructor-based

discrimination on the logic that race or ethnicity based discrimination should not depend

significantly on student age. Instead we find that our point estimates are the largest for

students who are younger than the median aged student. These results are inconsistent

with discrimination affecting all students of a certain race irrespective of age and are

more in line with the idea that young students react more to race of the instructor.31


30
   Estimates of minority-interactions for long-term outcome are not sensitive to controlling for first-term
grades suggesting that the indirect effect of obtaining a better grade in a course is not driving the positive
estimates.
31
   Although we do not find evidence of preferential grading by type of instructor, another explanation for
the interaction effects we estimate is that there exists a mechanical relationship whereby instructors'
grading distributions are correlated with their minority status. Bar and Zussman (2012) find evidence from
'an elite research university' that grade distributions correlate with instructor voting behavior, which in turn

                                                       34
         The above suggests that our interaction estimates are likely due to students

behaving differently in response to instructor type rather than vice versa. Appendix Table

5 explores whether there are particular student groups who may be especially likely to

gain from assignment to an instructor with the same minority status. Classifying students

by whether they receive financial aid, whether they went to a private school, whether

their high school had a high fraction of students who are eligible for a free-lunch

program, or whether they grew up in a poor or rich neighbourhood, and estimating

separate interactions for these groups, the results suggest that minority effects are fairly

homogeneous. While standard errors for some of the interactions are fairly large,

particularly those for small sub-populations, the point estimates are remarkably robust

across subsamples. In most cases the minority effects are highly significant for the larger

student group, and we cannot reject equality of the minority effects across more

advantaged and disadvantaged students. Thus, minority students from all economic

backgrounds appear to share the relative gains from assignment to a minority instructor.

         An important consideration for understanding these relative gains is whether they

occur due to minority students performing better with minority instructors or non-

minority students performing worse. The former may arise from instructors serving as

role models, inspiring underrepresented students.                  The latter may arise from group

favouritism, where non-minorities, consciously or subconsciously, find it difficult to

may correlate with race or ethnicity. Since minorities tend to score lower grades than non-minorities on
average, they systematically benefit from instructors that tend to compress grades towards the upper tail.
We tested for this possibility directly and found no evidence of grade distribution differences by minority
instructor status. The average grade given by a minority instructor across all courses is 2.86 compared with
2.85 for non-minority instructors. The standard deviation of grades is 1.20 for minority instructors and 1.15
for non-minority instructors. The robustness of our main results to including course-minority fixed effects
in regression specifications reported in Table 3 also suggest that this is not the case. Finally we also do not
find that minority instructors are clustered in fields in which grades are higher or there is less variance in
grades (see Appendix Figures 2 and 3, also see Appendix Table 7 for enrollments and instructor counts by
department).

                                                      35
learn from a minority instructor. Our baseline results with classroom fixed effects have

the advantage of conditioning on differences across classes and teaching styles, but they

restrict our analysis to minority interactions that are only relative to non-minorities.

However, to explore who benefits and who performs worse from different instructor

types, we need to estimate student-instructor interactions separately for each student type,

thus requiring the exclusion of instructor or classroom fixed effects. We also expand

minority status into five groups: white, African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native

American. Doing so allows us to estimate the full set of race/ethnic interactions to

determine which kinds of social interactions matter the most. Appendix Table 6 reports

each of these estimates of 1 in equation (1) after adding student and course fixed effects

as well as instructor characteristic controls. The coefficient is the effect from being

matched to an instructor of different type to a student's own race/ethnicity relative to

being matched to one of the same type.

       Appendix Table 6 shows evidence that students perform better with instructors of

the same race/ethnicity, both for minority or non-minority students. For example, white

students are 3.8 percentage points less likely to drop a course with a white instructor

compared to an African-American instructor, whereas African-American students are 4.6

percentage points less likely to drop with an African-American instructor compared to a

white instructor. This finding that whites do relatively worse with black instructors while

black students do relatively better with them suggests that the negative effects on whites

are not driven by overall instructor quality differences (since we also control for course




                                            36
fixed effects). The results also highlight challenges in determining a preferred instructor

allocation, since alternate allocations generate both student gains and losses.32

        Interestingly, we find robust negative effects on performance of white students

when being matched to non-white instructors for our other academic outcomes. The gains

for African-American students of being matched to an African-American instructor are

quite robust across samples and outcomes. We find less clear patterns for the other race-

and ethnicity groups, including Hispanics. That some ethnic groups appear to respond

less favourably when matched to instructors of their own type compared with the strong

relative effects for white students deserves mention. Dee (2007) and Hoffmann and

Oreopoulos (2009) observe similar patterns with respect to gender. In both studies, male

students generally perform worse academically with female instructors while female

students do as well with male or female instructors.

        One explanation for this behaviour is that students from high status groups react

more strongly to instructors from low-status groups, leading to a kind of self-fulfilling

discrimination. Social psychologists often describe social interactions in terms of "in-

group favouritism", where individuals that identify with each other tend to respond more

positively because they perceive they have similar beliefs or culture, and respond

negatively with others (Tajfel and Turner, 1979). Less attention has been given to the

moderating role that social status plays - the greater one's social status, the greater one's

tendency to display in-group favouritism (Sidanius et al., 1994). This may explain why

white students benefit more from being with white instructors compared to Hispanic

students with Hispanic instructors. The theory deserves more attention in future research.

social interactions in the context of student classroom allocation by gender.

5. Conclusion

       Using a unique administrative dataset that matches student course outcomes to

instructor's race, we estimate for the first time the importance of racial interactions

between instructors and students at the college level. The estimation of two-way fixed

effect models for a very large number of both students and classrooms over five years

addresses most concerns about potential biases in estimating racial interactions.

Remaining concerns about the internal validity of our estimates are addressed by taking

advantage of the severely restricted class enrolment options among low-registration

priority students at a very popular and class-rationed community college, by restricting

the variation in instructor minority status across classes within term or year, and by

examining students who do not enrol in the course section of first choice based on

registration attempt data. We find that minority students perform relatively better in

classes when instructors are of the same race or ethnicity. Underrepresented minority

students are 1.2-2.8 percentage points more likely to pass classes, 2.0-2.9 percent less

likely to drop out of classes, and 2.4-3.2 percentage points more likely to get a grade of B

or higher in classes with underrepresented instructors. All of these effects are large

relative to the minority base rates and the white-minority gaps. They represent 20-

50percent of the total gaps in classroom outcomes between white and underrepresented

minority students at the college. We also find relative effects on grades of roughly 5

percent of a standard deviation from being assigned an instructor of similar minority

status. Taken together with the large class dropout interaction effects, these impacts are




                                            38
notably larger than those found for gender interactions between students and instructors

at all levels of schooling.

        Using a compilation of data from several administrative sources we also examine

minority instructor impacts on long-term outcomes. We find evidence that an instructor's

race or ethnicity affects the likelihood of taking subsequent courses in the same subject

and majoring in the subject. The share of minority instructors in the first quarter also

affects a student's likelihood of retention and degree completion. The finding that our

classroom interaction effects appear to translate into consequential impacts on education

attainment is also noteworthy in suggesting race and ethnic influences may exist in other

settings and cumulatively matter in other ways.

        In examining courses that are more objectively graded such as those commonly

relying on multiple choice tests and math courses, we find similar estimated effects on

course outcomes. Taken together with the positive effects on long-term outcomes,

negative effects on drop out behaviour, and similar effects for minority students of all

ages, these results provide evidence that our positive estimates of minority interactions

are likely due to students reacting to instructors rather than the other way around. Further

evidence from the regression results suggests that these estimated positive minority

interactions are due to both positive influences, with minority students performing better

with minority instructors, and negative influences, with non-minority students doing

worse with minority instructors.

        Our results suggest that the academic achievement gap between white and

underrepresented     minority   college   students   would   decrease   by    hiring   more

underrepresented minority instructors. However, the desirability of this policy is



                                             39
complicated by the finding that students appear to react positively when matched to

instructors of a similar race or ethnicity but negatively when not. Hiring more instructors

of one type may also lead to greater student sorting and changes to classroom

composition, which may also impact academic achievement. A more detailed

understanding of heterogeneous effects from instructor assignment, therefore, is needed

before drawing recommendations for improving overall outcomes. The topic is ripe for

further research, especially in light of the recent debates and legislative changes over

affirmative action.

NOTES: This table displays results from regressions of the minority-specific average student outcomes in a classroom on an indicator equal to
one if the average is associated with minority students, an indicator if the class is taught by a minority instructor, the interaction between these two
variables, and a set of fixed effects. We only report the coefficient on the interaction term, to be interpreted as the extent to which minority students
sort into classrooms taught by minority instructors. Each cell is associated with a different regression. Students and instructors belong to the group
of "Underrepresented Minorities" if their race/ethnicity is Hispanic, African-American, or Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white.
Rows are defined by the subsample of students we consider. Outcomes used in the regressions vary across columns. *** Significant on 1%-level;
** Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-level. Standard errors are clustered by course-term-minority.

NOTES: This table displays results from our main outcome regressions. We report the coefficient of the interaction between student's and instructor's underrepresented
minority status. Each cell is associated with a different regression. Students and instructors belong to the group of "Underrepresented Minorities" if their race/ethnicity is
Hispanic, African-American, or Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white. Student controls include, gender, cumulated GPA and a 4th-order polynomial in age;
instructor controls include gender, a part-time indicator and a 4th-order polynomial in age. *** Significant on 1%-level; ** Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-level.
Standard errors are clustered by instructor.

NOTES: This table displays results from outcome regressions in which we allow for interactions between all observed student and instructor
races/ethnicities. We only show results for our preferred specification, which includes student and classroom fixed effects. We report the full set of 9
identified interactions for each regression. Since we include student and instructor fixed effects, all interactions involving white students or
instructors are unidentified. Same race/ethnicity interactions are shown in red along the diagonal. P-values for a F-test of the existence of same-
race/ethnicity interactions and for the existence of any race/ethnicity-interactions are also listed. *** Significant on 1%-level; ** Significant on 5%-

NOTES: This table shows uncorrected and sample-selection corrected estimates for the minority interaction when
grade is used as the outcome variable. Sample corrected estimates are non-parametric bounds as described in Lee
(2009) and implemented in Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2009). Lower (upper) bounds are computed under the
assumption that minority students induced to stay in a class come from the upper (lower) tail of the outcome
distribution . The fraction to be dropped come from first-stage dropout-regressions.The first two columns report results
when the trimming procedure relies on estimates of the minority interaction in dropout regressions that use the full
sample; the last two columns report results when the trimming procedure relies on estimates of the minority interaction
in dropout regressions we run for each course separately; in the latter case we need to replace student fixed effects by
student controls to achieve identification. *** Significant on 1%-level; ** Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-

NOTES: This table displays results from long-term outcome regressions. We report the coefficient of the
interaction between student's underrepresented minority status and instructor's underrepresented minority share.
Only courses taken in the first term of a student's academic career at the college are included in the
measurement of underrepresented minority instructor share. Each cell is associated with a different regression.
We explore the sensitivity with respect to the regression specification: column 1 reports the main specification,
column 2 reports estimates after including course set fixed effects for the initial set of courses taken by students
in the term, and column 3 reports estimates in which the deviation from steady state minority instructor share for
each department is used as an instrument for the minority instructor share. Controls included in all regressions
are student's age, age squared, gender, financial aid receipt, educational goals at the time of application, free
and reduced lunch rate of high school, private high school, year dummy for quarter of first term, number of
courses taken in that quarter, instructor's full-time status, and instructor's age. *** Significant on 1%-level; **

NOTES: This table displays results from regressions of the minority-specific average student outcomes in a classroom on an indicator equal to
one if the average is associated with minority students, an indicator if the class is taught by a minority instructor, the interaction between these two
variables, and a set of fixed effects. We only report the coefficient on the interaction term, to be interpreted as the extent to which minority students
sort into classrooms taught by minority instructors. Each cell is associated with a different regression. Students and instructors belong to the group
of "Underrepresented Minorities" if their race/ethnicity is Hispanic, African-American, or Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white.
Rows are defined by the subsample of students we consider. Outcomes used in the regressions vary across columns. *** Significant on 1%-level;
** Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-level. Standard errors are clustered by instructor.

NOTES: This table displays results from our main outcome regressions. We report the coefficient of the interaction between student's and instructor's underrepresented
minority status. Each cell is associated with a different regression. Students and instructors belong to the group of "Underrepresented Minorities" if their race/ethnicity is
Hispanic, African-American, or Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white. Student controls include, gender, cumulated GPA and a 4th-order polynomial in age;
instructor controls include gender, a part-time indicator and a 4th-order polynomial in age. *** Significant on 1%-level; ** Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-level.
Standard errors are clustered by classroom.

NOTES: This table displays results from our main outcome regressions when using an alternative definition of the student-instructor interaction. In particular, the interaction
variable is equal to one only if the student and instructor have the same racial/ethnic background in addition to belonging to an underrepresented minority group. We only
report the coefficient for this variable. Each cell is associated with a different regression. Students and instructors belong to the group of "Underrepresented Minorities" if
their race/ethnicity is Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white. Student controls include, gender, cumulated GPA and a 4th-order
polynomial in age; instructor controls include gender, a part-time indicator and a 4th-order polynomial in age. *** Significant on 1%-level; ** Significant on 5%-level; *
Significant on 10%-level. Standard errors are clustered by instructor.

NOTES: This table explores the heterogeneity of our results across different student groups and types of courses considered. We report the coefficient of the interaction between student's and instructor's underrepresented minority status. We
only report results for our preferred specification, which includes student and classroom fixed effects. Students and instructors belong to the group of "Underrepresented Minorities" if their race/ethnicity is Hispanic, African-American, or Native
American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white. *** Significant on 1%-level; ** Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-level. Standard errors are clustered by instructor.

NOTES: This table explores the heterogeneity of our results across different student groups. We report the coefficient on the interaction between student's and instructor's underrepresented minority status - referred to as "Minority Interaction". In
cases where we allow minority effects to vary across student groups we report the interaction between the main variable of interest and indicator variables that are equal to one if a student belongs to a certain subgroup. "Objectively Graded Courses"
include those courses and departments that commonly use multiple choice, true/false, and other objectively graded tests, and/or math courses. To find high schools with a high fraction of free lunch students we first compute the empirical distribution
of the school-level fraction of pupils who receive free lunch. We then define high schools to have "many free lunch students" if its fraction of free lunch students exceeds the 90%-percentile of the corresponding empirical distribution. Likewise, a
neighborhood is defined to be an “average income neighborhood” if its average income is contained in the 80% symmetric confidence interval of its distribution. We only report results for our preferred specification, which includes student and
classroom fixed effects. Students and instructors belong to the group of "Underrepresented Minorities" if their race/ethnicity is Hispanic, African-American, or Native American, Pacific Islander, or other non-white. *** Significant on 1%-level; **
Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-level. Standard errors are clustered by instructor.

NOTES: In this table we investigate in detail if students lose or gain from being taught by an instructor of a different race/ethnicity. Each cell reports the estimated coefficient from a different regression that
only uses one student group and two instructor groups. We only report results for our preferred specification, which includes student and classroom fixed effects. We compute the regression coefficients for a
sample of all students and a sample of students with a low standing on class enrollment lists. *** Significant on 1%-level; ** Significant on 5%-level; * Significant on 10%-level. Standard errors are clustered by
instructor.
