               THE CASE AGAINST TRYING TO STABILIZE THE DOLLAR


                                    ABSTRACT


     Better domestic economic policies in the 15 years since the collapse

of the Bretton Woods system would have prevented the extreme fluctuations

of the dollar's exchange value during those years.     The pursuit of policies

here and abroad that are appropriate for dbmestic growth in the future

should reduce the likelihood of such substantial exchange rate swings in

the years ahead.   But elevating exchange rate stability to a separate

goal of economic policy could have serious adverse consequences.     Trying

to achieve that goal would mesn diverting monetary and fiscal policies from

their customary roles and thereby, risking excessive inflation and unemploy-

ment and inadequate cspital formation.    Succeeding   in the efforts to achieve

dollar stability would mean harmful distortions in the balance of trade and

in the international   flow of capital.

         The Case Against Trying to Stabilize the Dollar

                         Martin Feldstein



     It is easy to understand why dollar stability has widespread

political appeal.   To businessmen, a fluctuating dollar means an

uncertain competitive environment.    Relatively small exchange
rate fluctuations can eliminate previously profitable markets at

home and abroad.    To consumers, a declining dollar can mean

inflation and a lower standard of living.    And looking beyond
economic self—interest, there is an atavistic nationalism that

confuses the dollar and the flag,    incorrectly regarding   a   strong
dollar as a measure of national virtue and a declining dollar as
an indication of national weakness.

     Despite the popular support for the notion of a stable

dollar, the analysis summarized in this short paper implies that
a stable dollar, if it could be achieved, would prevent desirable

adjustments and induce unwarranted ones.    The process of trying
to stabilize the dollar would require diverting monetary and

fiscal policies from their customary goals and thereby create

more inflation, more unemployment, or an inferior rate of capital
formation than would otherwise be possible.

    There is, of course, nothing wrong with dollar stability if

it happens to come about as a by—product of otherwise appropriate

economic policies. That is not the issue that economists have in

mind when they argue against trying to stabilize the dollar. The

real issue is whether a stable exchange value of the dollar

should be a separate target of economic policy and, to the extent
                                                   in order to
necessary, other policy goals should be sacrificed
achieve dollar stability.

     The appropriate exchange rate policy depends on the country

and its economic circumstances. A small country within Europe

that tiades a major share of its GNP with its neighbors may find

it appropriate to fix its exchange rate relative to its major

trading partners even though that requires sacrificing the

independence of its monetary policy and accepting German economic
                                                              a
hegemony. Alternatively, even without important trade links,

country may choose to tie its currency to that of a low inflation

country in order to achieve a monetary discipline and credibility
that would not otherwise be possible. In considering the

appropriate policy toward the dollar, it is important to
                                                           that
recognize that U.S. trade is only 10 to 15 percent of GNP,
we can control our inflation rate through our own domestic

monetary policy without an exchange rate anchor, and that the

United States will not permit our monetary policy to be made in

 Frankfurt or Tokyo.

     One final word of introduction is appropriate. Economists

 who oppose pursuing policies to stabilize the dollar are
sometimes accused of favoring inflation or other destabilizing

domestic policies. It is easy to understand the source of this

misunderstanding. The major swings of the dollar during the 15

years since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system can be
traced primarily to the pursuit and subsequent corrections of
                                                             the
inappropriate monetary and budget policies: the inflation of
1970s followed by the anti-inflationary monetary policy at the

beginning of the 1980s; the surge in actual and projected budget
deficits in the early 1980s followed by a gradual decline in

actual and projected budget deficits after 1985 (see Feldstein,

l988a). But the case against making dollar stability a separate

goal of national economic policy should not be confused with

condoning bad economic policies. Am economist can be a firm
advocate of sound domestic policies while still rejecting the

notion of dollar stability as a separate goal of economic policy.



I.   Capital Markets, Goods Markets and Exchange Rates
      Before looking at the consequences of trying to stabilize

the dollar by explicit policy manipulation, consider how exchange

rates naturally vary over time in response to supply and demand

conditions in financial markets and in the international markets

for goods and services.

      Consider first the role of international capital markets.

At any time there exist in each country desired levels of saving
                                                               If
and investment corresponding to prevailing interest rates.

there were no opportunity to invest or borrow abroad, each
                                  4

country's domestic interest rate would adjust to bring saving and
investment into balance.    With completely integrated world

capital markets, there would be a single world real interest rate
that balanced world—wide saving and investment while the

individual domestic saving and investment rates would in general

be unequal. In practice, capital markets are less than perfectly
integrated and real interest rates differ anong countries. It
nevertheless remains true that the saving rate in each country

will not in general be equal to the desired level of investment

at the interest rate prevailing in that country. If the desired

level of domestic saving exceeds domestic investment, there will

be a capital outflow; if desired saving is less than desired

investment, capital will flow into the country.1
     Since the capital flow is by definition equal to the current

account balance which in turn is equal to the sum of the trade

balance plus net international investment income, changing the

capital flow in or out of the country requires a change in the
trade balance.    And since the trade balance is a function of the

exchange rate, the only way in which a sustained change in the

capital flow can be brought about is by   a   change in the exchange

rate.

        Of course, conditions in the markets for goods and services

also affect the exchange rate.    Any shift in the supply or demand
for exports or imports (at given exchange rates) will alter the

exchange rate.     For example, if American consumers increase their
demand for foreign products at the existing dollar exchange rate
                                 5

(because of a shift in tastes or an improvement in the relative

quality of foreign products or a reduction in their foreign

currency prices), the value of the dollar will fall in order to
maintain the initial level of the trade surplus or deficit and

therefore the initial level of the international capital flow.

Thus shifts in forces that influence the demand and supply of

goods and services alter the exchange rate in a way that is

directly linked to the equilibrium capital flow.
     Since exchange rate changes play such a central role in

balancing the supply and demand in capital markets and in the
markets for goods and services, how can anyone believe that

exchange rates could remain constant? The textbook answer is that

exchange rate changes are not needed to achieve a capital flow
between two countries if the products of the two countries are

"perfect substitutes" (in the sense that the cross—price

elasticity of demand is infinite).   For example, an increased

desire to invest in one country would put Upward pressure oon its

local prices, thereby inducing an increase in net imports

sufficient to maintain the initial level of demand.   This

increase in imports automatically entails a capital inflow equal

to the desired increase in investment.
     This "purchasing power parity" theory of fixed exchange

rates is good textbook economics but only holds if the traded

goods are perfect substitutes.   Experience shows repeatedly that

the demand elasticities of similar products produced in different

countries are far from infinite even over rather long periods of
                                   6

time.    As the experience of the l980s confirms, imports end

exports are slow to respond to changes in relative prices and
therefore large departures of exchange rates from purchasing

power parity are required to achieve significant shifts in trade

balances, current account balances and capital flows.

      With all of this as background,     I can now consider the

effects of trying to stabilize the dollar.       I will begin by

examining the effects of a stable dollar, if it could somehow be

achieved, on trade and capital flows.      I will then turn to the

effects of trying to stabilize the exchange rate.



II.     Adverse Effects of Artificial Dollar Stability

        Although shifts in saving and investment and in the supply
and demand for internationally traded products night just happen
to keep the dollar stable, such a singular coincidence can be

ruled out as extremely unlikely.       In general, the dollar will

have to shift to achieve or maintain the desired net
international capital flow described in the previous section.

        It is important in this context to distinguish real and

nominal exchange rates.     Changes in nominal exchange rates are

simply the changes in exchange rates quoted in the market, while

changes in real exchange rates are those changes adjusted for
differences in inflation rates between the home and foreign

countries.     Although it is of course the real exchange rates that
influence patterns of trade and therefore the associated capital

flows, popular discussions and official pronouncements do not
                                7

make the distinction and therefore implicitly discuss the

stabilization of nominal exchange rates.   (See Feldstein, l988b)

     Whenever domestic inflation rates differ among countries the

nominal exchange rates must change just to maintain the initial

real exchange rates. The prices of tradable products in the

United States are currently increasing at about six percent a
                                                  is not

increasing at all.   Maintaining the real yen—dollar exchange rate

therefore requires the nominal dollar—yen exchange rate to

decline at a six percent annual rate. Failure of the nominal

dollar exchange rate to decline in this way would, all other
                                                       and a more
things equal, lead to an increasing U.S. trade deficit

rapid accumulation of debt to the rest of the world.
     Shifts in the nominal exchange rate that maintain a constant

real exchange rate may provide nothing more than a first

imported oil. Thus Japan, which imports all of its

      In addition to the. shifts of the exchange rate that are
                                   8

needed to balance differences in inflation rates and to offset

shifts in supply and demand in world product markets, the dollar

has to shift to permit changes in desired levels of domestic

saving and investment to be financed efficiently.     The most
obvious example of this in the 1980s was the dramatic decline in

the U.S. saving rate caused by the surge in the budget deficit.

Without an increased net capital inflow from the rest of the

world, the U.S. net investment in plant and equipment, housing
and inventories would have had to decline by approximately one

third.     In fact, the higher real U.S. interest rates attracted

capital from abroad, inducing a rise in the real value of the
dollar that caused an increased trade deficit that permitted the
increased net capital inflow,     Without the capital inflow, the

decline of U.S. saving would have caused a substantial

misallocation of worldwide investment with the productivity of

capital significantly higher in the U.S. than abroad. Although
the associated trade deficit had painful effects on some sectors
of the American economy,     the overall U.S. unemployment rate

declined and total GNP rose throughout the period of the

increasing trade deficit.


III.     Dangers of Trying to Stabilize the Dollar

       Trying to stabilize the dollar requires diverting monetary
and fiscal policies from their traditional roles.     The result of
such policy distortion can be a substantial sacrifice of the

traditional goals of price stability, high employment and an
                                   9

appropriate level of national capital accumulation.

     Although currency market intervention is the most obvious
tool of exchange rate manipulation, it is also the least

effective.     Experience continues to confirm that "sterilized
intervention" (i.e., the buying and selling of foreign currencies

with offsetting changes in government debt to keep the total

money supply unchanged) has little or no effect on exchange rates

(Obstfeld, 1988) and that any such effect is likely to last for

only a few days or at most a few weeks.     Some research suggests
that even the modest impact of sterilized intervention exists

only because financial markets interpret exchange market
intervention as a "signal" that the government is prepared to

shift monetary or fiscal policy to achieve the desired currency
shift.

     In contrast to the ineffectiveness of exchange market

intervention, changes in monetary policy can alter nominal

exchange rates in the long run and real exchange rates in the
nearer term.     Consider first the long term effects of monetary

policy on nominal exchange rates.      An increase in the U.S. money

supply eventually causes a corresponding rise in the U.S. price
level.   If the U.S. price level rises, a stable real exchange

rate requires a proportionate fall of the nominal value of the

dollar. This mechanism shows also how an expansionary monetary

policy that raises the U.S. domestic price level can stabilize


the nominal exchange rate when the real value of the dollar is
                                10

rising.
     It is important to emphasize, however, that the effect of an
                                                  rate is only
expansionary monetary policy on the real exchange

transitory. An expansionary monetary policy can temporarily
lower the real interest rate, causing the value of the dollar to

decline.   Since the prices of goods and services increase only

with a lag, the initial nominal decline of the dollar is
                                      Over time, however, the rise

     The experience in 1983 and 1984 illustrates the consequences
 of trying to use monetary policy to stabilize the nominal value

 of the dollar when its real value is being increased by

 fundamental real factors. At that time, increases in the current

 and projected budget deficits were raising the dollar's real

 value. The rising dollar induced substantial pressure on the U.S.

 dollar's value, no fiscal action was taken.   If the pressure had

 succeeded in inducing the U.S. administration to stabilize the

 dollar, the responsibility would have fallen to the Federal

 reduction of the nominal exchange rate. The
                                              important point is
 that after a temporary period the real
                                        exchange rate that
 influences trade would have been unaffected while the
                                                       progress of
 the early l9BOs in reducing inflation would have been
                                                       reversed.
     The futility and the danger of using
                                          monetary policy to
stabilize the dollar is not just
                                 hypothetical. In the spring of
1987 the Federal Reserve began a
                                 policy of restricting the money
supply and raising interest rates in order to support the value
of the dollar.   The two percentage point rise in interest rates
was one of the factors that precipitated the October stock
                                                            market
crash. Had the Fed not then
                              explicitly abandoned the goal of
supporting the dollar and allowed interest rates to decline, the
luuerican economy might well have slid into recession in 1988.

     Although neither exchange market intervention nor monetary

policy can have a sustained effect on the real value of the

dollar, budget and tax policies could in principle be used to
stabilize the real value of the dollar over a sustained
                                                        period of
time. As the experience in the early l980s
                                            demonstrated, fiscal
policies that reduce national saving raise real interest rates,

thereby increasing the attractiveness of dollar securities and

causing the dollar to rise.   The opposite is true when fiscal

policies increase the national saving rate.
     But it is difficult to imagine circumstances in which the
gain from using fiscal policy to stabilize the dollar would
outweigh the losses from an otherwise inappropriate fiscal
                                  12

policy.     At the present time, for example, the continued decline

of the    dollar could be delayed by fiscal actions that increase

exchange rate stabilization.


IV.   Conclusion

      Better domestic economic policies in the 15 years since the

collapse of the Bretton Woods system would have prevented the
extreme fluctuations of the dollar's exchange value during those

years. The pursuit of good policies here and abroad in the future
should reduce the likelihood of such substantial exchange rate

swings in the years ahead.      But elevating exchange rate stability

to a separate goal of economic policy would have serious adverse

consequences.      Trying to achieve that goal would mean diverting

monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and

thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and

inadequate capital formation.      And succeeding in the effort to

achieve dollar stability would mean harmful distortions in the

balance of trade and in the international flow of capital.

2. The price indices used to convert nominal exchange rates to

real exchange rates provide only a very imperfect measure of the

changes in actual price competitiveness because of the

impossibility of adequately reflecting changes in quality and the
introduction of new products. These measurement problems raise

serious doubts about any attempt to calculate purchasing power

parity exchange rates.
