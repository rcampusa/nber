               PRODUCTIVITY: EVIDENCE FROM A HUMAN RESOURCES SURVEY


                                     ABSTRACT

     Although economic models of training decisions are framed in terms of a
company's calculation of the costs and benefits of such training, empirical
work hss never been able to test this model directly on company behavior. This
paper utilizes a unique database to analyze the determinants of the variation
in formal training across businesses and the impact of such training on labor
productivity. Major findings are that large businesses, those introducing new
technology end those who rely on internal promotions to fill vacancies are more
likely to have formal training programs. Formal training is found to have a
positive effect on labor productivity.

I. Introduction

    According to a recent issue of Training Magazine, U.S. organizations

with fifty or more employees spent $32 billion on formal programs for

employee training and development. Although human resource mauagers

argue that training is critical for developing a productive workforce,

very little is known about how companies make decisions about budgets for

formal training and whether such training increases measured labor

productivity. Previous research by labor economists on employee training

has focused on the impact of training on the individual's success in the

labor market, i.e. how training raiaes the individual's wage and reduces

the probability of a layoff. Economists have also studied why eeployers

are more likely to train certain individuals than others, and, in partic-

ular, have shown that individuals who are expected to stay with the firm

are more likely to be the recipients of training. Hence, economic

research on training has been concerned with the impact of investments in

training on the distribution of earnings. Likewise, research on training

by industrial and organizational psychologists has been conducted at the

individual level, focusing on the impact of training on the employee's

cognitive skills, work effort, and morale.

     This paper is unique in that it focuses on the organization as the

unit of observation. Although economic models of training decisions are

framed in terms of a company's calculation of the coats and benefits of

such training, empirical work has never been able to test this model

directly on company behavior. Researchers have been forced to make

inferences about company behavior based on data on the careers of indi-

viduals. By utilizing a unique data base on human resource practices in

U.S. businesses, I am able to study the variation in the training effort
                                                                            2




across companies. A simple economic model is used to derive several

testable hypotheses about the variables that can explain why some busi-

nesses invest more in employee training than others. The role of firm

characteristics, such as technological change and firm size, as well as

characteristics of the company's industry, such as the extent of competi-

tion in the product market, are studied. The impact of formal training

programs on labor productivity is also analyzed.

     In the next section of the paper, the literature on employee train-

ing is summarized in order to show the types of data that have been

available to researchers who have previously studied the topic of employ-

ee training- In Part III, I describe the survey I am using and discuss

its strengths sod weaknesses relative to other databases that have been

used for the study of employee training. Fart IV specifies a simple

model that is tested with the survey data. In Part V, the impact of   -




training   of labor productivity is measured. Conclusions are provided in

Part VI-




II. Literature Review

     In this section of the paper, I suasaarize the literature that exists

on the subject of employee training and development. In preparing this

summary, I have reviewed work by economists and industrial psychologists

as well as the results of previous surveys of corporate training programs.


     A. Economists

     Econosists who study on-the-job training have primarily been inter-

ested in eDdelling who receives training and how it affects the individu-

al's growth in earnings over his working life. Examples of this litera-

ture are the studies by Mincer (19837 1987), Brown (1983), Lillard and
                                                                                3




ran (1986), Pergamit and Shack-Marques (1986), Barron et al, (1987, 1988)

and Lynch (1988). These studies use data from national surveys such as

the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the National Longitudinal Surveys,

the Current Population Survey and the Employment Opportunities Pilot

Project. Information on training from the first three data sets is

obtained directly from the individuals who are surveyed. For example, in

the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which was used by Mincer and Brown,

individusla are asked "On a job like yours, how long would it take the

average person to become fully qualified?" and "Are you learning skills

on the current job which could lead to a better job or promotion?" The

National Longitudinal Surveys, which were used by Mincer, Lillard and

Tan, and Lynch, contain a variety of training questions depending on the

particular cohort that was surveyed. For example, in çbe older IlLS

cohorts, the training questions are "Do you receive or use additional

training (other than schooling training) on your job?" and "What was the

longeat type of training you have had since the last interview?" The NIS

youth cohort, however, contains information on all training spells in the

respondents' working life and it is possible to separate company training

from apprenticeship training. The individuals in this survey were first

interviewed in 1978 when they were between the ages of 14 and 21 and have

been re-surveyed every year or two since that time. The January 1983

Current Population Survey, used by Lillard and Tan and Pergamit and

Shack-Marquez, contains the following question on training: "What train-

ing was needed to get the current or last job and what training is needed

to improve skills on the current job?" Finally, the 1980 Employment

Opportunitiea Pilot Project Dataset, used by Barron et al. •   is   unique in
that it surveys employers. The employers were asked to provide informa-

tion on the amount of on-the-job training provided their most recently

hired worker, as measured by the number of hours typically spent by

various personnel in training such an individual.

     The main findings of this research csn be summarized briefly.

Individuals who receive training are likely to be young, white males.

Host studies also find that the more educated individuals receive more

training than the less educated. Private sector training is found to

play a significant role in the wage determination and career patterns of

young workers; individuals with more training have significantly larger

wage growth and longar job tenure. The data from the EON' Survey also

show that individuals who received more training in their first three

months of employment have significantly faster productivity growth during

their firat two years with the employer.


     B. Industrial Psychologists

     Industrial psychologiata have studied the effects of employee

training utilizing experimental methods and case studies. They have

measured the effectiveness of training in one of four ways; (1) subjec-

tive learning (judgments of course participants or trainers); (2) objec-

tive learning (results on standardized tests); (3) subjective behavior

(changes in on-the-job behavior, sa perceived by course participants,

peers or aupervisors); and, least commonly of all, (4) objective results

(tangible indicators such as reduced costa1 improved quality or quantity

of output). An excellent survey of studies conducted by industrial

psychologists on the subject of managerial training is provided in Burke

and Day (1986). They review seventy articles that evaluated the effec-

tiveness of training programs for managerial or supervisory personnel in
                                                                            5




various companies. In all of these studies, the individual is the unit

of   observation and individuals who received training are compared to

those who were not in the training program. The comparisons are made on

the basis of scores on skill or knowledge tests, performance rankings,

ratings during role play, and survey ratings by subordinates. n1y a

handful of these studies evaluated training programs in terms of objec-

tive results. The best example of the latter type of study is the one

tonducted by James S. Russell et al (1985) in which 62 retail stores

belonging to the same international merchandising organization were the

units of observation. Russell etsl found that sales volume per employee

was positively and significantly correlated with the percentage of sales

personnel who received training in basic sales procedures and with the

sales personnel's perceptions of the emphasis given training in the

store.

        The main problem with these studies is that each one is limited to a

relatively small group of individuals (normally between 50 and 100) in

one company so that it is difficult to generalize the findings beyond the

company under study. Although the Russell article examines 62 companies,
they are in the same industry and belong to the same organization. In

her critique of the psychologicsl research, Ingols (2987) accuses the

researchers of minimal cross—referencing; "they do not look for common

themes across companies, but focus on the specific case at bend." She

concludes thst this line of research has left us with a limited and

fragmented knowledge about the role of training in corporations.


        C. Surveys of Corporate Training Progresis

        Information on investments in employee training csn also be obtained

frc)n   surveya that are conducted by vsrioua organizations. For example,
                                                                          6



each year1 Lakewood Research, a division of Lakewood Publications, the

publisher of Trainingjlajazine, conducta a survey of U.S. organizations

with 50 or more employees. Respondents are asked for information on the

amount their organization budgets for formal training, the number of

individuals who receive training during the year, and the number of hours

of training they receive. The information from approximately 2400

respondents is extrapolated by Lakewood Research to a universe of 230,000

brganizations and reported in aggregate figures only. For example, the

results of the 1987 survey, published in Nay 1988, indicate that $32

billion was budgeted for formal training that year with 38.8 million

workers scheduled to receive 1.2 billion hours of traioing. The survey

also described the types of training (e.g. managenent skills, technical

skills, clerical skills, sales skills, etc.) provided by the respondent

companies and showed how these differ across industries and size of firm.

    A second example of a corporate survey is the study prepared by The

Conference Board in 1975 (Lusterman, 1977). They surveyed 2800 companies

that had st least 500 employees and received usable responses form 610

firma. These data were then extrapolated to the universe of 7600 fines.

Information on per employee expenditures for formal in-house training,

tuition aid and other outside training was obtained. The main findings

of this study were that the companies spent an average of $60 per employ-

ee on the three types of training, $48 of which was spent on formal

in-house training; large companies spent more per employee than small

companies; and the share of the training budget attributed to formal

in-house training rose from 47% for the firms in the smallest size

category to 87% for the firms in the largest size category. Converting
                                                                                7




the 1975 expenditures to 1987 dollars would produce an expenditure of $93

per employee on formal in-house training.

     In 1985, The Conference Board surveyed 218 companies to obtain

information on changes in corporate education and training that had

occurred in the previous five years (Lusterman, 1985). While this new

report did not contain any cost information, it discussed how the train-

ing function had increased in importance at the surveyed companies. A

larger proportion of employees in all major job categories were involved

each year in formal training ss compared to five years earlier. The

companies reported that they were strengthening and widening the role of

corporate training departments and were using more sophisticated methods

to evaluate the need for and to assess the impact of employee training.

     A third example of a corporate survey is the one conducted by the

Battelle fluman   Affairs   Reaearch Center in 1987 (see Saari et al., 1988).

This group sent a mailed questionnaire to 100 U.s. companies randomly

selected from all private-for-profit companies having at least 1000

employees. While the response rate was excellent (61%), the survey only

collected data on management training. The information is in the form of

categorical variables such as the company's use of formal on-the-job

training, mentoring, job-rotation, training needs assessment and training

evaluation aystems. The survey also collected information on the reasons

companiea give for selecting various training program approaches (e.g.

external vs. internal), and the process used to select participants for

these programs. The major finding from this survey is that 89% of the

companies reported using formal training/education programs with usage of

this training being positively correlated with company size. In spite of
                                                                          8



the prevalence of formal training, there was limited evidence of syste-

matic evaluations of management training by the companies in this sample.


    D Summary
    As this literature review has revealed, what we know about employee

training is that it has positive career impacts on the individuals who

receive it, that U.S. companies spend a fair amount on formal training,

and that many case studies conclude that employee training is effective

in improving job performance. What, is lacking, however, is a clear

understanding of why some companies invest heavily in employee training

and others do not. To date, no one has been able to study the variation

in formal training across businesses, to describe the factors that

determine that variation, and to analyze the impact of formal training on

the organization's labor productivity; with the exception of the EOPP

survey, the focus has always been on variation in training across indi-

viduals. It is the purpose of the current research to shift the focus of

analysis to the company that is making the training decision.



Ill. The Columbia Business School Human Resources Survey

     In 1981, the Industrial Relations Research Center of the Columbia

Business School conducted a survey of human resources policies and

practices in American businesses. A questionnaire was sent to the

executives responsible for 7,765 business units during the time period

covering the fall of 1986 though the spring of 1987. The name and

address of the executive in charge of each unit was obtained from the

Compustat data files. Responses were received from 854 business units

(11 percent response rate), though useable data were received from only

493 business units (6.4 percent overall response rate). Although this
                                                                           9



response rate is low, it is not substantially different from the response

rates obtained by anelysts who conducted much less comprehensive surveys

of organizations' HR?1 policies (for example, see Hitt and Ireland, 1986).

The businesses in the Columbia survey are smaller than those used in the

Battelle survey. Fifty-percent of our businesses have fewer than 900

employees; twenty-five percent have fewer than 240 employees. Recall

that the Battelle survey only included businesses with at least 1000

employees and this may, in part, explain why their response rate was so

high. We did indeed have a better response rate from larger business

units. Responding business units tended to be: larger than nonrespondents

and reported significantly higher sales, operating income, capital

expenditures, assets, and equity than nonreapondenta. The industrial

distributions of the two groups were very similar.

     The survey instrument sent to COMPUSTAT business units elicited

detailed data pertaining to 1986 on organizations' HRH policies and

practices covering various occupational groups: (11 managers; (2) union-

ized and (3) nonunion professional and technical workers; (4) unionized

and (5) nonunion clerical workers; and (6) unionized and (7) nonunion

manufacturing and production workers. Information on training and

development, selection, evaluation and compensation policies, and commu-

nication and employee involvement policies was obtained for each of these

groups. In addition, the business units provided information about their

overall human resource planning.

     The data from the human resources survey have been merged with the

data on the COMPUSTAT files. Hence, for each of the business units in

the survey, we have information on capital expenditures, value of assets,

operating income, research and development expenditures, and net sales.
                                                                            10




Demographic characteristics of the business's employees are proxied by

the characteristics of the employees in the organization's industry and

geographic labor market, as reported in the Current Population Survey

data. In addition, for the business units in the manufacturing sector,

we have information on the following attributes of the business unit's

four-digit SIC category: concentration ratio, value of exports, value of

imports, value of the capital stock, value of inventories, value of

bhipments, total factor productivity, energy expenditures, and number of

employees. Data on these variables are evailsbls for the time period

1958—1984 inclusive.

     On the subject of employee training and development, the survey asks

several questiooa as they pertain to each of the seven occupational

groups.    The questions for each of these groups are:

     (1)    Does your business have a formal employee training and develop-

           ment program?

     (2) If yes, when was the program instituted?

     (3) If yes, who participates in decisions about the types of

            training and development program undertaken by your business?

     (4) What was the approximate cost of formal training and develop-

            ment programs per employee in your business last year?

     (5) What indicators are used to assess employee training and

            development (e.g. employee opinions, productivity on the job,

            cost-benefit analysis)?

As this list indicates, the only measure of amount of training is the

cost figure. Unlike the EOPP Survey, information on time spent by       -




supervisors   or others in training individuals or the amount of time it
                                                                          11




takes for a newly hired individual to become "trained", was not solicited.

A follow-up questionnaire is being prepared to obtain these data.

    Although the response rate in the Columbia survey is low relative to

those of the surveys of corporate training programs discussed in the

previous section, the Columbia survey clearly surpasses the others in

terms of the wealth of detail that is available on the company's human

resource policies and its economic characteristics. As I show in the

next section of the paper, these data are critical elements of a model of

corporate investments in employee training. The earlier studies that

utilized corporate surveys were not concerned with hypothesis testing

regarding variation in the training effort across businesses and, hence,

could conduct a less intensive data collection effort while concentrating

on maximizing sample size. The Columbia Business School Survey took an

alternative approach, namely, the need to collect a large amount of

information from each respondent in order to be able to systematically

study how and why human resource policies and practices differ across

American businesses.

    Table 1 reports mean values for training questions Cl), (3), and (4)

above for each of the seven occupational groups. Formal training pro-

grams are used in one-third to one-half of the businesses in our sample,

depending on the occupational group under study. These training programs

have been in existence longer for unionized employees than nonunionized

workers. Unfortunately, data on the cost of formal training per employee

were reported by a amall percentage of the businesses in the sample.

However, these data can be utilized to make a rough estimate of the total

amount that the average business spent on training. Assuming thst it had

the average number of employees in each employee category, the average
                                                                           12



business would have spent about $5.5 million on training in 1986.

Multiplying this figure by the number of businesses in the COMPUSTAT

files (including those without useable names and addresses for execu-

tives) would result in a total expenditure of $55 billion for 1986.1

       Table 2 provides information on the prevalence of formal training

programs across industry categories. The variable PCTTRAIN, defined as

the   percentage of occupations in each business for which a formal train-
ing program existed, is calculated, and mean values by industry are

reported. As Table 2 shows, the mean value of PCTTRAIN is .412, wiLh a

low of .083 in the entertainment services industry and a high of .635 in

the transportation industry. We also see that retail trade and the

finance and insurance industry have above average values for the training

index.

       As the data in Table I indicated, many companies with formal train-

ing programs did not respond to the question regarding the cost of formal

training per employee. Since this variable is particularly important for

measuring variation in training intensity across business, we need to

explore why some businesses answered this question and others did not.

In particular, the existence of selectivity bias must be considered.

Table 3 provides more detail on this issue by showing how the response

rate varied across occupation groups and across size categories where the

businesses are divided into four quartiles based on number of employees.

Each entry in Table 3 shows, for each occupation, the percentage of




     1Unlike the CO1WUSTAT "company" dataset, the COHPIJSTAT "buaineas-line"
data act does not include a weighting factor that would have enabled me
to calculate an estimate of the amount spent on training by the popula-
tion of U.S. businesses.
                                                                                  13




businesses with a formal training program that reported cost of training

for that program. The entries in parentheses show the percentage of

businesses with formal training programs for that occupation. The data

show no clear pattern. While the response rate initially rises with

size, it falls off for the very large businesses. Although these large

organizations are most likely to have formal training programs, they

either do not have or choose not to report information on cost of train-

Ing. The entries in Table S are highly correlated across occupations.

In other words, if a company reports training costs for one occupation,

it reporta it for the others as well. Indeed, the correlations across

occupations are all above .75, and, in many cases, exceed .9. This

suggests that firm characteristics aside from size may be important in

explaining the response rate.

     To test this hypothesis, I estimated a binary logit model on the

subset of firms that reported having a formal training program for the

particular occupation under study; the dependent variable equals one of

the businesses reported cost of training information, and equals zero if

it did not. Three categories of variables are used. The first describes

the economic characteristics of the business unit and includes SIZE -         the
number of employees, ROA -     return   on assets, calculated as the ratio of

met income to identifiable assets and CAPLAB -       the   capital-labor ratio,

calculated as the ratio of capital expenditures to the number of employ-

ees. The second category describes the business's human resource poli-

cies and includes Y'ItPGN -   the   year in which the training program was

instituted, and POLICY — an index measuring the degree of sophistication
of the business unit's human resource policies.2 The third category is a

set of industry dummies where the excluded category is finance, insurance

and real estate.3 The binary logit results are shown in Table 4 for

managers and the three nonunion occupations; sample sizes were to small

for the unionized occupational categories. There is no evidence in Table

4 of any systematic relationship between the business's economic charac-

teristics and the probability of reporting training cost information;

heither SIZE nor ROA have significant effects and CAPLAB is significant

in only one equation. Businesses with more sophisticated human resource

policies are not more likely to report cost information, and in one case,

are even less likely to report it. The year the training program was

instituted is significant in only one case. In sum, there is no obvious

explanation as to why some companies reported training costs and others

did not. My guess is that many respondents were not sure what costs

should be included in our definition and/or they were unable to readily

locate a cost measure for their organization.



IV. Determinants of Company Training Programs

     In this section of the paper, I show how a simple model can be

specified and estimated to explain the observed variation in the presence




     2The index is defined as follows. The organization receives one
point for escb yes answer to the following questions: (1) Does the
organization have a formsl written KEN plan? Does the organization
formally evaluate policies developed in the following 11KM areas:
(2) Work organization and job design? (3) Employee selection and staff-
ing? (4) Employee training and development? (5) Communication and
participation programs? (6) Performance appraisal? (7) Compensation?
(8) Union-management relations?   (9) Employee relations?

     3The industry variables are NONDUR - nondurable manufacturing, OUR —
durable manufacturing, TRANSP - transportation, WIITRADE - wholesale
                                                                                           Is


of   formal employee training programs across the busineases in our sample.


      A. A Basic Framework

      Using the assumption that the businesses in our sample are profit-

maximizers, we can derive several testable hypotheses about the determi-

nants of company training expenditures. The company's profits are

defined as grosa sales minus the wage bill, training expenditures, and

all other expenditures on inputs:


                   II = P II -
                          x      wL -   tL   -   rK


where P =    the   price of the the product X, X              the quantity of output

produced, w =      the   wage rate, L =      the   quantity of labor utilized, t =

training    expenditures per unit of labor, K = a composite index of all

other factors of production, and r =               the   per unit cost of this composite

index.

      Maximizing fl with respect to t,             training   expenditures per unit   of
labor, results in the following condition:


                   a x-
                   atLx
which simply states that the businesa will choose that level of t where

the marginal return from an additional dollar spent per worker on train-

ing just equals its marginal cost. According to the left-hand side of

equation (2), the marginal return from an additional dollar spent per

worker will be higher in those businesses where the average product of

labor is more sensitive to investments in training. Equation Cl) can be

modified to describe the company's maximization problem as one of maxi-

mizing the discounted flow of future profits. In this case, the marginal

return on a current expenditure on training will equal the discounted sum

of increases in the average product of labor over the expected working

life (T) of the company's employees:

                        k!)i. = 1
                              1



      We   can derive several hypotheses about the variation in per worker

training expenditures across businesses by considering what factors are

likely to lead to a greater sensitivity of the average product of labor

to training expenditures. First is the degree of technological change in

the firm. Companies that are introducing new technology have a greater

need to train their employees in order to implenent the technology and

reap its benefits. The productivity of labor in this type of company

will be more sensitive to training because the potential for learning is

greater. A second variable to study is the average tenure of the workers

in the company. As equation (3) indicates, the payoff from training is

higher in those companies where employees are likely to stay longer.

Third, the role of company size needs to be considered. As the litera-

ture review indicated, previous surveys have shown that large companies

spend wore per employee on formal training than small companies. If

tenure is longer, on average, in large companies than small ones, this

could explain the role of size. If this is not the case, then, according

to equation (2), the only way to explain the role of size is to argue

that labor productivity is more sensitive to training in large firms than
                                                                          17




in small ones. There-are two possible explanations. The first is based

on the argument that it is more difficult to monitor worker productivity

in large firms. According to this view, training is more critical in

large firms, than small firms, ceteris paribus, because workers are more

likely to shirk there. A second explanation relies on the notion of

public goods. Instead of expressing training expenditures as the product

of per worker expenditures and the number of workers, we could simply

Write total training expenditures, T. Then the marginal return from an

additional dollar spent on T will be greater in large firms because a one

dollar increase in T will increase the productivity of all workers.

While this is a somewhat extreme case, it is consistent with a perhaps

more realistic notion that there are "economies of scale" in the provi-

sion of training; one aupervisor can teach a class of trainees and each

trainee could learn as much as he would have in a private training

session. Finally, product competition should play a role in the firm's

calculation of the returns to training. For example, a company that is

facing tough competition from domestic competitors or from foreign

companies may increase its investments in employee training as a way of

improving product quality and lowering production cost.


    B. Empirical Specification

    The hypotheses discussed above are tested on the survey data using

the binary variable on the presence of a formal training program.4 The

data are stacked so that the number of observations equals the number of




     4Tbe training coat variable was also used and produced very poor
results. In light of the low response rate on this question and the
difficulty that companies may have had in interpreting it, the poor
results are not surprising.
                                                                                18




companies multiplied by the number of occupation groups in the company.

The equation that is estimated is;


                  TR..   a0 + aj FIRFL    +   a2 OCCV.   -   + O OCCDIJN.
                    13                3              13                 1


where TR.. equals one if business j has a formal training program for

occupation i, and zero otherwise; FIRM. is a vector of characteristica

describing the firm such as size, technological change, industry dummies,

industry characteristics, and the extent of human resource planning in

the company; OCCV.. is a vector of variables describing the business's

human resource practices that are specific to the occupation; and OCCDU1I.

is a vector of occupation dummies. As equation (4) is specified, the

coefficients on the variables in OCCV. are constrained to be the same
                                     1
across all occupations but the equation will also be estimated without

this restriction.

        The variables in the vector FIRMJ      are measured as follows. First

the degree of technological change in the business is measured in several

ways.     I use the ratio of R&1   expenditures    to sales (RDRATIO) and the

ratio of capital expenditures to the number of employees in the business

(CAPLAB)      These two variables are calculated from the COMPUSTAT files.

The extent of technological change in the business's industry is also

proxied by the average education level of workers in that industry. As

Bartel and Lichtenberg (1987) have shown, industries undergoing techno-

logical change increase their demand for educated workers because educa-

tion increases an individual's ability to learn new things and to adapt

to environmental changes. Hence, we would expect that businesses in

industries with highly educated workers are more likely to be introducing

new technology, and, as the model showed, will therefore be more likely
 to invest in employee training and development.5 The average education

 of workers in the company's three-digit SIC industry (ETHiC) is calculated

 from the 1983 Current Population Survey. The size of the business is

obtained directly from the survey responses to the questions regarding

number of workers in each occupational category (SIZE). When this was

unavailable, information on the number of employees was obtained from the

COMPUSTAT files. In order to control for variation in the importance of

human resource policies to business strategy, a variable measuring the

extent of human resource planning in areas other than employee training

in the organization was calculated from the survey. This variable,

called KRPOLICY, is similar to POLICY defined in footnote 1; the only

exception is the deletion of the response to the question on training.

Information on product competition in the business's industry is only

available for the businesses in the manufacturing sector and refers to

the four-digit SIC category of which the business is a member. Two

variables are used to measure product competition. The first, the

concentration ratio in the industry (CRATIO), is a measure of the extent

of domestic competition, There are two problems with this variable.

First, the latest date for which it is available is 1982, and, second, it

can be argued that even in industries with high concentration ratios, the

degree of competition among the leaders in the industry can be very

intense. In the absence of these problems, CRATIO should have a negative

coefficient. The second variable, the ratio of net imports (imports




     5Education can also have a direct effect on formal training, rather
than simply working indirectly through technological change. Since more
educated individuals are better learnera, the marginal return on a dollar
spent on training will be higher for these people.
                                                                            20




minus exports) to the industry's total value of shipments (ILfESHARE), is

used   to measure the degree of foreign competition that the domestic firms

face. The coefficient on IMPSHARE    should    be positive if employee train-

ing is used as a device to improve productivity and competitiveness

relative to foreign producers.

       Two variables are included in 0CCV.. The average tenure of
                                          ii
employees in each occupation was not available on the survey, but was

kroxied   by the response to the following question: "To the best of your
knowledge,   about what percentage of your nonentry level jobs have been

filled from internal sources in recent years?" This variable (INTPROM)

should be highly correlated with average tenure, since businesses that

rely on internal promotions will have long tenure employees compared to

businesses that hire from the outside. The variation in the extent to

which    the businesses screen job candidates for different occupations may
also play a role in the decision to train. Presumably, organizations
that benefit from trained workers will screen applicants more carefully
in order to reduce training costs.- A variable measuring whether or not

job candidates are required to take a written or other formal test of

skill (SCREEN)    is used and is expected to be   positively correlated with

training.

        The occupation dummies are defined as UPROF -- unionized profession-

al and technical, NIJEROF --   nonunion professional and technical, UCLER --

unionized clerical, NIJCLER -- nonunion   clerical, UNIt --   unionized




         their analysis of the EQPP data, Barron et sl (1987) found a
significant positive correlation between screening of applicants and
intensity of training.
                                                                          21




manufacturing and production workers, and NUMFG --    nonunion manufacturing

and production. The excluded category is managers.


       C. fleaults

       Table 5 contains the results of estimating a binary logit model

where the dependent variable equals one if the business reported that it

had a formal training and development program for the particular occupa-

tional group, and zero otherwise. In Column (1), businesses in all

industries are included, while Columns (2) and (3) include only those in

manufacturing. The predictions of the model are generally confirmed.

Two of the three indicators of technological change, LCAFLAB and RDRATIO,

are   positive and significant in all three columns. EDUC is positive but

insignificant possibly because it refers to the industry group to which

the business belongs and is therefore not specific to the business

itself. The size of the business, LSIZE, is always positive and signifi-

cant. Whether this is due to the "shirking" problem or to economies of

scale in the provision of training unfortunately cannot be determined.7

The other firm   characteristics,   CRATIO and IMPSHARE, also have the

expected signs in the manufacturing sector; formal training programs are

more likely to be used as product market competition increases, as

measured by either a decrease in CRATTO or an increase in IMPSHARE.

       The occupation related variables, INTPROFI and SCREEN, also have the

predicted signs. Training programs are more likely to be usçd as average




     TSince the dependent variable refers to forsial training only, the
impact of firm size on informal training can not be ascertained.
ilaber (1989) provides evidence based on wage growth patterns in the
Survey of Income and Program Participation that individuals who work in
small firms are more likely to receive informal training than individuals
                                                                          22




tenure, as proxied by INTPRON, increases, and as screening intensity

increases. The occupation dummy variables themselves are also signifi-

cant, indicating greater reliance on formal training for managers as

compared to the other groups. Table 6 shows the interactions of INTPROM

and SCREEN with the occupation dummies. The effect of tenure on the

probability of a formal training program is strongest for managers.

According to the model, this implies that a business's calculation of the

returns on formal training is more closely related to tenure when train-

ing managers as compared to the other occupation groups. Screening and

training are also more highly correlated for managers as compared to all

other groups except unionized professionals.8



V-   The Effect of Training on Labor Productivity


     A. Empirical Specification

     In order to measure the impact of formal employee training on labor

productivity, I assume that the production functions for the businesses

in the survey can be represented by a Cobb-Douglas function and that

there are two inputs in the production process, capital, K, and "effec-

tive labor", EL. Effective labor is the amount of labor services that




in large firms. Whether this finding would be supported by data collect-
ed from businesses in my sample is the subject of future research,

         is possible to estimate a fixed effects model by including a set
of business dummy variables in equation (4). The fixed effects model
only includes the variables in OCCV.. and the occupation dummies since
the variables in PIRN. are perfectlFcorrelated with the business
dummies. When this mdel was estimated, the coefficients on INTEROM and
SCREEN decreased in magnitude but remained significant, and the pattern
of the coefficients on the occupation dummies followed the one shown in
Table 5.
                                                                         23



are actually supplied by the workers that the company employs. Let the

number of workers employed be represented by the variable, R, or reported

labor. Then the effective labor input is given by:


                                  EL =   R(1+t)

where t is an index of the amount of training that each worker receives.

According to equation (5), workers that receive more training provide more

"effective labor" input to the firm. The production function can be

written as:


                                  Q = AIêEL''


or substituting equation (5) into (6), results in:


                                  Q =    AK(R(itt))

in the data I observe output per worker, or Q/R, which is written in

equation (7) as:


                                  Q/R =   AJCR''1(i+t)

Taking logarithms of both sides of equation (7) gives the equation

that will be estimated:


                in (Q/R) =   in   A + 1nX + ('j-i)ln R +


assuming that t is a small number.

     Equation (8) is estimated across all of the businesses in the survey

and each businesa is treated as an observation. The dependent variable

                                                                      is the
is calculated as sales per worker, K ia capital expenditures and R

number of employees. In order to measure the extent of training in the
                                                                           24




organization, two variables were calculated from the survey. The first,

?CTTRAIN, is the percentage of occupations in the business for which

formal training is conducted. If training programs exist for all of the

occupations in the business, this variable equals one; if there are no

formal training programs, the variable equals zero; if there are training

programs for some occupations and not others, the variable takes on a

value between zero and one.9 The second variable that is used is based

bn questions posed to those companies that had training programs regard-

ing how they evaluate the success of their programs. The compsnies were

asked to indicate what indicators are used to assess employee training;

one of the indicators was productivity on the job. For each compaoy, I

calculated the percentage of occupations for which a formal trainiog

program existed and the company assessed that program based on an indica-

tor of productivity on the job. This variable is called ASSESSPRD. It

seems likely that ASSESSPRD should have s stronger effect on labor

productivity than PCTTRAIN   since   companies that sre assessing productivi-

ty effects will likely be designing their training programs with produc-

tivity impacts in mind.

     The otber variables that are included in the labor productivity

equation are the percentage of employees in the business that are union-

ized, (PCUNION), the average job tenure of all employees, calculated as

an average of the proxy for tenure used in the previous analysis, (INTPRON),




         alternative variable is the percentage of employees for whom the
business provides a formal training program. Unfortunately, about
one-quarter of the businesses did not provide complete data on the number
of employees in each occupation category (even when they provided data on
the human resource policies applicable to each occupation) so utilizing
this variable would have substantially reduced the sample size.
                                                                          25




the percentage of occupations for which job candidates are required to

take a formal test based on the occupation responses to the variable

SCREEN, the extent of human resource planning in the organization (RRPLCY),

and a vector of industry dummy variables.


     B. Results

     The results of estimating equation (8) are shown in Table 7. In

columns (1) through (3), training is measured by PCTTRAIN, and in

columns (2) through (4), training is measured by ASSESSPRD. According to

equation (8), the coefficient on LGKEXP is the elasticity of output with

respect to capital while the elasticity of output with respect to labor

is obtained by adding one to the coefficient on LSIZE. In addition, the

specification in equation (8) indicates that the coefficient on the

training variable should not be significantly different from the labor

elasticity.

     In equations (1) and (3), the effect of training on labor produc-

tivity is estimated without controlling for any of the other human

resource policy variables such as INTPRO!1, SCREEN and HRPLCY. Both

training variables have positive and significant effects using a one

tailed test. In columns (2) and (4), INTPROM, SCREEN and HRPLCT are

included in the equation and neither of the training variables remains

aignificant. Tenure (as meaaured by INTPRDtI) and skill testing of

applicants (SCREEN) have positive and significant effects on labor

productivity. In columns (3) and (6), SCREEN is deleted but INTPROM and

IIRPLCT are kept in the equation. The training measure ASSESSPRD becomes

aignificant again, and the coefficient on PCTFRAIN recovers almost to ita

original magnitude and significance level. Since busineaaea that train
also rely more heavily on skill testing of job applicants and the screen-

ing of applicants contributes significantly to raising labor productivity1

the results in columns (2) and (5) show that this relationship swamps the

independent effect of training on productivity. Although companies that

train also have lower turnover which enhances labor productivity, unlike

the effect of screening1 this does not eliminate the effect of training

on productivity ss shown in columns (2) and (5).
•
     In terms of the other variables in equation (8), the elasticity of

output with respect to capital is estimated to be .50 and the elasticity

of output with respect to labor is .38.10 Unionization has a positive

effect in all equations and the effect is significant when tenure is

deleted. Finally, when the equations were estimated restricting the

coefficient on the training variable to equal one plus the coefficient on

LSIZE, the hypothesis regarding the restriction could not be rejected at

the 5 percent level of significance.


TI. Conclusions

     This paper has utilized corporate survey data to study employee

training and development. The review of previous research showed that

most studies of training rely on data provided by individuals and there-

fore focus on the variation in training across individuals and its

impacts on their career advancement. Although economic models of train-

ing decisions are framed in terms of a company's calculation of the costs




     101n a stepwise regression analysis, LSIZE and LKflP were the first
variables to enter the equation, with coefficients of -.526 and .446,
respectively, implying a scale factor of .92.
                                                                          27




and benefits of such training, empirical work has never been able to test

this model directly on company behavior.

     The econometric analysis of the deterwinants of the variation in

training across the businesses in the sample showed that the predictions

of the profit-maximization model were borne out. For example, large

businesses, those introducing new technology, and those with a high

proportion of internal promotions were more likely to have formal train-

ing programs. In addition, the extent of product competition in the

business's industry had the expected sign. Formal training was found to

have a positive effect on labor productivity, especially in those busi-

nesses that evaluated their training programs based oP productivity

indicators. An important finding is that the increase in productivity

attributable to training is largely due to the fact that businesses that

train rely heavily on screening of joh applicants which significantly

enhances labor productivity.

     How does this analysis contribute to the debate on the market's

ability to provide "enough" formal training for employed adults? On the

one hand, we can argue that the companies in this sample are providing

the right amount of formal training because we observe their behavior to

be consistent with the predictions of the profit-maximization model.

These companies provide formal training when it is in their best inter-

ests to do so, and we find that this training raises labor productivity.

Alternatively, we saw that only one-third to one-half of the businesses

have formal training programs for various occupation groups. If the goal

is to insure that virtually all American workers have the opportunity to

participate in formal training programs at the work site, this statistic

suggests that there is mot enough training. In order to induce American
                                                                          28



businesses to provide more formal training, public policymakers would

need to create the right incentives; policy changes that increase the

perceived marginal return or reduce the marginal cost (e.g. training

vouchers) of providing such training would be required. But it seems

nore reasonable to argue that employers themselves have better informa-

tion regarding labor market conditions, the market for their goods and

services, and the potential benefits of new technology, all of which are

used to judge the potential benefits from additional investments in

training. Employers who consistently underinvest in training should

eventually succumb to the superior productivity of competitors who invest

more.
