          Money and the Consumption Goods Market in China



                                 ABSTRACT




This paper studies the relations between money and other macroeconomic
variables as well as excess demand in the consumption goods market for the
                                       recognise the endogeneity of money in
case of China, 1954—83. We explicitly
the CPE and do not impose (but instead test) some common restrictive
assumptions; we assess the extent of aggregate excess demand (supply) in a
macroeconomic disequilibrium model; and we allow at the macro level for the
possible coexistence of micro markets in different states of excess demand or
supply (shortages or slacks). We find bidirectional causality between money
and income; that M0 behaves
                            in a manner more suited to building simple,
conventional models  than does M2; and that there has been a mixed pattern of
excess supplies and demands over the three decades.

1. Introduction

     As Chow (l985a) and Peebles (1983) have stressed, basic monetary and

macroeconomic data for China are now available for a sufficiently long period

to permit serious quantitative analysis. Pioneering work of this kind is

already appearing, taking into account some of the special characteristics of

the Chinese economy (Chow, 1985b; Feltenstein and Farhidian, 1986; Feltenstein

et al., 1986).

     It is not surprising that this work has to deal with questions of

macroeconomic disequilibrium familiar from the recent literature on East

European centrally planned economies (CPEs). We report here some preliminary

results on money and the consumption goods market in a framework with several

distinctive characteristics: we explicitly recognize the endogeneity of money

in the CPE and do not impose some common restrictive assumptions, we assess

the extent of aggregate excess demand (supply) in a macroeconomic

disequilibrium model, and we allow at the macro level for the possible

coexistence of micro markets in different states of excess demand or supply

(shortages and slacks).

     We emphasize that this is an initial, exploratory effort. The work on

money and on the consumption goods market is not yet fully integrated. Nor

have we yet been able to deploy the full array of available tests for the

specifications we have tried. Nevertheless, we find the results suggestive

and promising, and we believe they raise questions which should be addressed

by further work.
2.   The dnd for monet

     Disequilibrium macroeconomics typically assumes both that the money

stock is exogenous and   the   demand for money is purely an asset demand,

unaffected by transaction requirements. These assumptions seem to hold

particularly well for CPEs. In the absence of a bond market, money balances

at the end of the period may be identified with forced saving.

     Kornai (1982) goes much further and does not even consider money in

his model because, he argues, it is not a budget constraint for firms,

while for households only real income and real consumption matter.

According to Kornai, "a semi—monetized economy in which prices and money do

not genuinely influence the macrovariables of production, investment and

employment cannot properly be described in terms of its money being stable

or inflated, or price increases being repressed or permitted".

     We disagree with this statement, and we shall also query the

exogeneity of the money stock in both its narrower and broader definition.

Price and interest rate shocks as well as changes in expectations about

future constraints on the consumption and labour markets might affect the

demand for money. On the other hand money holdings might affect future

consumer decisions. An unstable demand for money could cause problems for

the planners (see Portes, 1983).

     The definition of money in a planned economy is still a controversial

issue. Since cash is used only for retail sales, wages    and   state purchases

of agricultural products, we identify two monetary circuits: one where cash

plays the role of means of exchange and another, restricted to government

and production units, where every payment is made by bank transfer.

Enterprises and production units in general can keep just    a   limited amount

of cash for unpredictable transactions.




                                   3
      The literature stresses the cash circuit, generally looking for

 inflationary pressures on the consumption market. Currency is held by

 households and, in limited amount, by agricultural production units and

enterprises.

     Households can save income in only two forms of assets: cash and

saving deposits; there is no bond market. It is worth noting that in China

in 1977 (before the economic reform), currency was 5O? of the money stock

 (defined as     currency plus saving deposits). Only after 1979 did saving

deposits increase considerably, reaching 6O of the money stock by 1982.

About 82 of the money stock was held by households (Naughton, 1986) and

the remaining by agricultural units and enterprises: this percentage has

remained very stable over time.

     As in other CPEs, before 1984, China had a monobank system: the

People's Bank (PB) functioned both as central bank and as commercial bank

and firmly controlled all the other banks. The Agricultural Bank (AB) and

the Construction Bank had to keep at the central bank some reserves in

proportion to their deposits, but apparently the proportion was not fixed,

nor did the authorities admit to using them as reserve requirement. There

was and still is no discounting operation; therefore the central bank has

virtually no means of controlling the money stock, except by changes in the

interest rate on savings deposits in order to reduce the currency in

circulation.

    Currency is put' in circulation by the central bank through other

banks, state enterprises (directly) and government units, and it is

withdrawn through the same institutions. 8O of the currency outflow is due

to wage payments (42) and state procurement of agricultural products

(32). On the other hand, retail sales account for 7O? of the cash inflow

(People's Bank of China, 1983).




                                  4
       In this kind of financial system, the mechanistic multiplier approach

does not work properly; even if banks keep cash as reserve asset and we

think of households having a fixed desired ratio in which they hold

currency and bank deposits, the multiplier effect is limited to that part

of bank loans    which are cash loans.
       The central     bank determines the money stock on the basis of the credit

plan used jointly with the cash plan (see Bortolani and Santorum, 1984).

The balance of the People's Bank is something like the following:

                                  People's Bank balance sheet

ASSETS                                                          LIABILITIES

Loans to enterprises                                   Enterprises'deposits
Loans to government                                    Government deposits
Loans to non—state sector                              Saving deposits
(private and agric. units)                             Currency
Reserves (gold and foreign                             Other banks reserves
exchange)                                              Agricultural bank reserves




       Cash   loans only produce changes in currency. The People's Bank cannot
control   total credit directly, since it is primarily determined by the

economic plan and the government budget. Let us ignore for the moment loans

to the non—state sector and the AS reserves, and as a further

simplification assume fixed bank reserves.

       Under a flow of fund analysis, changes in the money stock result as

follows

       4CU (4LE +             —          +           — 4SD
                       ALG)       (ADE       4D)
       4CU                    +           —            — 4SD
                                              4D0)
                 SEBR                    PSBR

where:

CU =   currency;   L     loans and U            deposits; subscripts E and G are

respectively for enterprises and government units; SD =                  saving   deposits;




                                                   5
 SEBR =   State   enterprises' net borrowing requirement; PSBR   public sector

net borrowing requirement.

Thus

       SEBR + PSBR > 4SD       -     4CU > 0

       Both SEBR and PSBR are determined by the economic plan. The central

bank has no power over them; it can just ensure that the borrowing

requirement does not exceed the p1an targets.

       Only cash loans will produce changes in the money stock, since any

other kind of loan is counterbalanced by a corresponding change in

enterprise or government deposits. Cash loans are mainly for wage payments

and purchases of agricultural products. They depend on the plan, the

enterprises' economic performance (since bonuses have been introduced) and

the unpredictable agricultural production. Interest rates on these loans

did not have any incentive effects on enterprises or government units until

perhaps 1985, when production units' performance became important and

interest on loans finally became greater than the corresponding interest

rate on deposits.

       Now consider the complete balance sheet. The rural sector is very

important: we can reasonably suppose that nearly half of the currency in

circulation is in rural areas, where production units keep cash for

payments to members of the brigade and purchases of various inputs, and

peasants are paid just once or twice a year (even if only part of their

income is in cash).

       Unfortunately, the process of money creation in rural areas is not

clear. The rural credit cooperatives (RCC) contributed in recent years to a

very large savings deposit increase, lending on the other hand less than

one—third of the money they collected. The RCC deposit nearly all the

collected savings (e.g. 70 in 1982) at the AL The AB, in its turn,




                                      6
deposits at the PB a high ratio of its total deposits. This reserve is what

in the balance sheet published by the PB is called "rural areas deposits".

How it is determined (a fixed ratio? of which items?) is virtually unknown.

     Loans to the non—state sector should counter—balance savings deposits,

giving a measure of the non—state sector net borrowing requirement (NSBR).

Loans to the private sector are particularly important (both in size and

effects) since the introduction of the responsibility system in agriculture

and the growth of the free market. Since 1979—80 people need and hold cash

as working capital. Therefore the flow of funds     identity should   be read as:

           = SRBR + PSBR + NSBR

where NSBR =           4SD; here SD includes AB deposits at the PB. Thus
               41'NS
     4CU > 0     when SEBR +PSBR > —    NSBR.

     The   substance is unchanged, but in this perspective, since NSBR is     a

variable particularly difficult to control, both total credit control and
interest—rate   policy acquire great importance when the central bank has an

M0 target. This is one reason why the question of exogeneity of          (or M2)

is itself so important.

     Before starting any experiment in general model building for the

demand for money in China, we conducted two different investigations: first

we looked for causality relationships among     such   key variables as the money

stock (both in its narrower,M0, and broader, t42, definitions), disposable

income and prices; second, we have estimated a well—specified equation for

the money stock and tested the restrictions of price homogeneity, income

homogeneity, nominal and real adjustment. The choice of the data series, so

relevant for the construction of the statistical model, is explained in the

Data Appendix.

     We stress that we have had to use annual data, which preclude any

short—run investigation. The sample used is 1954—83 (30 observations); in
 evaluating the reported diagnostics, some attention should be paid to the

limited number of degrees of freedom available.

     For the purpose of investigating causality and lag ordering among the

main variables we have carried out Granger causality tests (Granger 1969)

and the Cooley—Leroy test (Cooley—Leroy 1985). In Table 1 and 2, we report

the results for money and real income interrelations; they are from the

only well-defined model we were able to build. The tests we use are

properly valid only in the context of a statistical model that has passed

appropriate tests of its underlying assumptions (see Spanos, 1986), and we

were unable to arrive at such a model for the relation between money and

money income.

      Using nominal income as a regressor we encountered autocorrelation

and misspecification, while the price series is strongly non—stationary,

which fundamentally affects the results of the Granger test. Regressing

money on prices, however, we did get a relatively well—defined model, for

which the results suggest that prices do not cause money (in both its

definitions).

     Considering Tables 1 and 2, we see that for M2, both the Granger test

and the Cooley—Leroy test are conclusive: P42 causes real income and real

income causes P42, revealing as expected a bidirectional causality among the

two variables.

     There are some doubts, however, about the results relative to M0: even

if a certain degree of independence with respect to real income appears in

the Granger test and predeterminedness (but not strict exogeneity in the

Cooley—Leroy sense) is revealed, the income coefficients in equation (1) in

Table I are quite big in their face value and seem to pick up a sort of

cycle (as might reflect a control or adjustment rule), while in equation

(5), Table 2, the assumption of normality is very close to being rejected.




                                8
We stress that these tests are not proper exogeneity tests; exogeneity can

be tested only inside a well—defined simultaneous model, involving the

specification of equations for each variable, and referring just to that

particular model and the data series used (see e.g. Engle, Hendry and

Richard, 1983). Nevertheless, our results do cast substantial doubt on

whether either M0 or M2 (especially the latter) could reasonably be viewed

as exogenous.

       As a second step, we carried out a less informal test of the

hypotheses of income homogeneity, price homogeneity, nominal adjustment and

real adjustment, using a quite general specification of the money stock

equation, in the form proposed by Hwang Rae—Shin (1985).

       According to Hwang, we can estimate the equation

(1) iu =       +                                        +
                   /iimt 1 + /32(Pt_Pt_l) ÷ /3,y +
where all variables are in logs, and a is the real money stock, P is the

retail sales price index, y is the real disposable income and H is the

nominal interest rate on one year saving deposits. We can then test the

following linear restrictions upon the p1s

H1: nominal adjustment                       + P2 = 0

112: real adjustment                   p2 = 0

H1: linear homogeneity in P p = 0

114: linear homogeneity in y p + p,                 1

       As a way to avoid the possibility that the lag coefficients were

significant just because of the distinct temporal structure exhibited by

both      and M2, we have estimated first

(2) m PO+PL*1t_l+P2Yt+P)Yt_l*P4Pt4P;Pt_l+PRt+P7Rt_l
then testing whether                  (He) for M0 and p,=p=0 (H1) for M2. H is not

rejected for K0, while HI is rejected for 142: in particular 9G is different

from zero.




                                         9
        According to the results in Table 3, we cannot reject the hypotheses

of income homogeneity and price homogeneity with respect to M0. For

however, since we reject H0:             all four hypotheses are rejected against

the more general model (2). Again, M0 behaves in a manner more suitable to

building simple, conventional models than does M2. It is worth noting that

we could not reject the hypotheses of real adjustment and price homogeneity

conditional on p3=O. This is a clear warning about imposing unwarranted

restrictions on the lag structure of the variables, since we could end up

with biased homogeneity tests and, in general, with models that are

essentially not well defined.

        The information collected from the tests above should then be used for

the construction of a more general model, with the main purpose of

questioning the degree of exogeneity of M0 with respect to other major

variables and the possibility of using         as an instrument of economic

policy.

     A broader model should also take into account the disequilibria on the

consumption goods market. In particular, when we estimate M2, since

households do not have any alternative investment to money balances and

saving deposits, we are actually estimating a saving function, in a

logarithmic form and under the implicit constraint

          =
              c + St
which   implies equilibrium on the consumption market and no forced saving.

As we discover in Section 4, this should eventually be removed when dealing

with a planned economy, without going to the other extreme by imposing the

equally unwarranted constraint of continuous excess demand.




                                    10
3. Virtual Prices

    Our discussion of money in Section 2 did not explicitly model the

possibility that with centrally controlled prices, the goods market might be

in excess demand or excess supply at the aggregate level or in individual

micro markets, and that the specification of money demand functions should be

modified accordingly. Similarly, Chow (1985b) estimates a permanent income

hypothesis without allowing for disequilibria of this kind.          Feltenstein and

Farhidian (1986 —        hereafter   F—F) and Feltenstein, Lebow and van Wijnbergen

(1986 —      hereafter   F—L—W) have sought to relax this assumption, the former in

estimating the supply of and demand for money in China, the latter in

estimating savings functions for the Chinese household sector.

        F—F specify money supply and money demand equations and estimate them

separately. In the latter, they suppose that prices are fixed exogenously and

that if there are resulting aggregate—level disequilibria, there exists a

'virtual price level' which would cause consumers to hold voluntarily the

amount of money they do actually hold given current official prices and

possible shortages/surpluses.

        Their chosen specification of this relationship is simply that the

virtual price index stands in constant loglinear relation to the official

price index, so the inflation rate of the former is a constant multiple of the

official inflation rate. In the course of estimating the modified demand for

money function (adjusted for the virtual price level), this constant multiple

 is estimated by scanning over a grid of values to find that which maximizes

the equation likelihood function. The result, on data from 1955—81, was that

 the virtual rate of inflation was 2.5 times that of the official rate of

 inflation (the associated estimate of the true income elasticity of demand for

 real   balances   was 1.37).

        The virtual price inflation rates so calculated are shown as FPI in our

 Table   4   below, together with other indices of market tension - we shall




                                              11
  discuss these jointly. Here we make only two points.        First, whereas the F—F

 model includes a money supply equation in which wages and agricultural

 procurement payments (along with government deficits) determine the money
 supply -   just   as they form almost all of the income variable in the money

 demand equation -     the   equations are estimated separately, and results and

 simulations are discussed as if the government set the money supply

 exogenously. Second, the F—F specification, though perhaps necessarily crude,

 has the objectionable feature that it never permits that open inflation might

 eliminate excess demand. On the contrary, open inflation is in effect

 automatically magnified to show even more simultaneous repressed inflation.

      This objection applies to the related work of F—L—W.       They test various

 savings functions using a similar virtual price index to deflate nominal

 savings, then to include a real interest rate. The construction of the

 virtual price index is here backed by a theoretical derivation from an

 intertemporal. model with goods rationing. The index derived relates the ratio

 of the virtual and actual price levels inversely to the velocity of money.

 Different estimates give different values for the elasticity, and we have

chosen that from the equation which appears to give the best results on

statistical criteria. The corresponding annual inflation rates are shown in

Table 4 as WPI. The use of this index related to velocity as an indicator of

tensions on the consumption goods market provides an appropriate transition to

the final section of this paper.



4. The Consumption Goods Market

     The theory and measurement of macroeconomic disequilibrjnm in CPEs, with

primary attention to the consumption goods market, are surveyed in Fortes

(1986). Our own approach, applied to the East European economies, is set out

in several papers cited individually in the References below. Despite the

caution of Peebles (1983), we thought it worthwhile using similar techniques




                                         12
on the Chinese data now available, simply to see whether one could establish

empirical regularities and obtain results not obviously inconsistent with

prior information.

    Portes and Winter (1980       hereafter P—W) estimated a 'canonical'

disequilibrium model (Quandt, 1982), without a price or plan adjustment

equation, for the consumption goods markets of four East European CPEs. There

are equations representing the aggregate demand for and supply of consumption

goods as well as the 'minimum condition' requiring that actual consumption

equal the minimum of supply and demand. The demand function was a simple

transformation of the Houthakker—Taylor savings function; the supply function

was a somewhat ad hoc representation of planners' behaviour, justified from

the CPE literature. The three equations are estimated jointly using maximum

likelihood methods. The particular specifications are discussed extensively

in P—W and other references cited, and we shall simply state them below,

without wishing to defend them with excessive vigour. Note that although plan

variables play an important role in our analysis, we do not have independent

data on plans in China, like those used by Portes et al. (1987) for Poland, so

we cannot add a plan adjustment equation like theirs, and we must use a

constructed series for plan variables as in the original P—W paper.

     Following criticism by Kornai (1980, 1982) of any such aggregative

macroeconometric work on CPEs, in which both 'shortages and slacks' (excess

demands   and   supplies) might coexist at the micro level, Burkett (1986) sought

to implement Kornai's implied research proposal. P—W had themselves

anticipated the criticism with a heuristic 'smoothing by aggregation'

argument, but Burkett rightly recognized that this had to be tested

empirically against Kornai's assertion. He developed an ingenious method to

take account of simultaneous micro—level excess demands and supplies while

using aggregate data, rather than going to the explicit submarkets model, as

we may do in future work (Martin, 1986). Burkett applied his method to the




                                        13
East European countries studied by Portes and associates, using the same

specification of demand and supply function for consumption goods. The model

arrives at a simple equation with an additive error term:



(7) C (l/2)(ax ÷ py) -             (i/2)[(ax   py)2 4i2(ax)(py)}2 + u
where for our purposes here we may write

(8) CD ax =            +           +
                a1Sl       a2DYD       a3YDl

The variables are defined as follows:

C =          observed consumption
CD =         household desired expenditure on consumption goods and services in
             the current period

CS =         supply   of consumption goods and services in the current period

Si =         household saving in the previous period
DYD =        change in disposable income, previous to current period
YDi          disposable income in. the previous period

CT           fitted second—order exponential time trend in C

CYX          (CT/MIPT)(NMP-NMPT)

NMPT =       fitted   second—order exponential time trend in national income

RNFA         deviation of household net financial assets from second—order
             exponential time trend

IFX =        (IT/NMPT)(NMP—NMPT)

IT =        fitted    second—order exponential time trend in investment

        Burkett estimates the single equation (7), with the minor modification

that his representation of /Jy = CS omits the fourth term. In Burkett's model,

it can be shown that a test of the hypothesis that i             U   is a test of the

aggregative discrete switching model used by P—W, which can be written

    We have estimated both the P-W and the Burkett models for China over the

period 1954—l983. The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5. They appear to be

remarkably good. All estimated coefficients satisfy the a priori sign

restrictions (and lie in prescribed intervals, where required), and they are

quite well determined. In each case, we report estimates with and without the

constraint p1   = 1;   this was imposed by Portes et al. (1987) but not by

Burkett. We also report estimates with the constraint a3 =            I,    imposed by

Burkett but not by Portes et al.; and with both coefficients constrained. On

the whole, likelihood ratio tests reject the restriction p1                1 and accept


a3 = 1; but some other features of the constrained estimates are preferable.
The implied household and planners' behaviour is reasonable and very similar

to that shown in the earlier work on Eastern Europe. Moreover, in the Burkett

test of P—W, the estimated -i    is   tiny and insignificantly different from zero,

so that we can accept the P—W discrete switching model.            Its coefficient

estimates are in fact quite close to those found with the Burkett technique.

     So much for the technical background. The economically interesting

output is in Table 6. Here we find comparisons of various indicators of

tension on the consumption goods market: the official rate of inflation P1,

the F—F virtual price rate of inflation FPI, the F—L—W virtual price rate of

inflation WPI Burkett's index of relative shortage BSH, and the P—W index of

percentage excess demand PWXD. We have added for comparison the index of

percentage shortage calculated by Naughton (1986), using quite different

methods and data.

     Recall that Burkett's index BSH measures the shortage only, without

netting out slack, and is therefore non—negative by definition. In that

light, the only apparent inconsistencies between ESH and the P—W index of

 excess demand appear     in 1963 and   possibly 1965—6 and 1972—3; in 1963, the P—W

estimates   show excess supply and      the   Burkett index shows shortage, while in
 the other periods, P—W show excess demand         and Burkett   shows no shortages.



                                              15
Lest it be thought that P—W or Burkett tend systematically to underestimate

excess demand, note that Naughton shows much more excess supply than either.

     Thus the picture these measures give is fairly consistent. It suggests

excess demand in 1956—58, 1960, 1964, 1967, 1971, 1976, and 1980—83. There is

a clear relation with the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, the

stormy year of Mao's death, and the economic reforms. The price indices are

much more erratic. One must conjecture that in years like 1961—62, for

example, the open inflation was sufficient to eliminate excess demand within

the period. Conversely, in 1964 deflation may have created excess demand. In

any case, none of these indices suggests that excess demand dominated the

entire period — and   fl   suggest significant excess demand under the recent
reforms.

Saving deposits and currency are from Byrd (1983) and the Statistical

Yearbook.

The chosen rate of interest is the one—year saving deposit interest

rate, taken from Hsiao (1971), from Byrd (1983) and, for recent years,

from the BBC Bulletin Suimnar of World Broadcasts, Part 3, The Far East.

   is equal to currency.

   is equal to currency plus personal savings deposits.

Disposable income (at current prices) has been constructed adding

current year changes in net financial assets to personal consumption.

Real income is this series deflated by retail price index.
