                                             ABSTRACT

We present and describe a new dataset of capital control restrictions on both inflows and outflows
of ten categories of assets for 100 countries over the period 1995 to 2013. Building on the data first
presented in Martin Schindler (2009), and other datasets based on the analysis of the IMF’s Annual
Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, this dataset includes additional asset
categories, more countries, and a longer time period. We discuss the manner in which we translate
the information in the AREAER into a usable data set. We also characterize the data with respect
to the prevalence of controls across asset categories, the correlation of controls across asset categories
and between controls on inflows and controls on outflows, the aggregation of the separate categories
into broader indicators, and the comparison of our dataset with other indicators of capital controls.

I.        Introduction

          International capital flows are central to international macroeconomics. The

interaction between the monetary and exchange rate policies of a country depends

upon its stance towards capital mobility, as described by the policy trilemma. The

ability of a government and its citizens to borrow and lend abroad allows domestic

investment to diverge from domestic savings, which can promote economic efficiency

and growth. International portfolio diversification is a potentially important means

by which individuals can smooth consumption and undertake risky investments

that would otherwise be unattractive. On a less salutary note, international capital

flows are also blamed as an important vector through which economic disturbances

are spread across countries, or as a means by which investors prompt a sudden stop

that causes an economy to crash.

          This range of potential outcomes from the international trade in assets has

contributed to varying attitudes towards capital flows, as well as towards capital

controls. Controversies over international capital flows have a long history. For

example, in 1920 J.M. Keynes wrote elegiacally of a pre-war time when a person

could “…adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any

quarter of the world...” (The Economic Consequences of the Peace, Chapter II). But

he took a very different tone in a 1933 speech in Dublin when he stated “… let goods

be home-spun whenever it is reasonable and conveniently possible and, above all,

let finance be national.”1

                                                1
        Keynes’ negative view of international capital flows in the midst of the Great

Depression echoes through time in more contemporary calls for capital controls,

especially in the wake of the recent current economic and financial crisis. Capital

controls were pervasive during the Bretton Woods era. These controls were reduced

or eliminated beginning in the late 1970s, and, increasingly, in the 1980s and

1990s. The title of Rudiger Dornbusch’s 1998 article “Capital Controls: An Idea

Whose Time is Gone” reflects a broad consensus at that time. But attitudes began

to shift in response to the economic crises in the late 1990s (Dani Rodrik (1998),

Jagdish Bhagwati (1998)). These changes were far from a fringe view; in 2002,

Kenneth Rogoff, then serving as the Chief Economist and Director of Research of

the IMF, wrote in the Fund’s publication Finance and Development “These days

everyone agrees that a more eclectic approach to capital account liberalization is

required.”

        The Great Recession has spurred a further reevaluation of the appropriate

role of capital controls. Countries as diverse as Brazil and Switzerland considered

(and in the case of Brazil, implemented) controls on inflows in the face of currency

appreciation, while Iceland introduced controls on outflows at the time of its crisis.

A number of recent IMF staff studies and policy papers accept the use of capital

controls as part of a country’s “policy toolkit” under certain circumstances, a shift

that The Economist magazine dubbed “The Reformation.”2 Even stronger calls for a

greater role for capital controls include Olivier Jeanne, Arvind Subramanian and

John Williamson (2012) and Hélène Rey (2013). Some of these policy prescriptions

are consistent with a new branch of theoretical research in which capital controls

contribute to financial stability and macroeconomic management.3 The empirical

research of others, however, emphasizes the ineffectiveness and potential costs of

capital controls.4

       The evolving nature of the debate on capital controls, and the policy

prescriptions that follow, suggest that further careful empirical analysis is needed.

One challenge facing empirical researchers in this area concerns the availability of

indicators of capital controls. Some empirical research addresses this challenge by

considering the experience of a specific country.5 But broader, cross-country

analyses require panel data reflecting the experience of a range of countries. While

a number of panel data sets exist, those with broad time and/or country coverage

are typically hampered by a lack of granularity (for example, Menzie Chinn and

Hiro Ito (2006), Dennis Quinn (1997)), often providing little information beyond a

broad index of “capital account openness,” while others with finer granularity have

been more limited in terms of sample coverage (such as Martin Schindler (2009),

Jacques Miniane (2004), and Natalia Tamirisa (1999)).6

       In this paper, we introduce a new data set based on the methodology in

Schindler (2009), but including more countries, more asset categories and more

years. In particular, the new data set reports the presence or absence of capital

controls, on an annual basis, for 100 countries over the period 1995 to 2013. As

discussed in greater detail below, this data set revises, extends, and widens the

data set originally developed by Schindler (2009), and later expanded by Klein

(2012) and Fernandez et.al. (2014). The wide set of countries in this data set, and

its coverage of a period when there have been changing policies, makes it a

potentially important resource for research and policy.7

       In particular, a distinguishing and important feature of these data is that the

information on capital controls is disaggregated both by whether the controls are on

inflows or outflows, and by ten different categories of assets. This allows for a more

detailed analysis of capital controls, including an examination of the co-movements

of controls on different types of assets, and on the co-movements of controls on

inflows and outflows, as well as the construction of aggregate measures of controls

that are well targeted to the specific nature of the topic being studied. Variations of

such aggregate measures across time serve as one indicator of the intensity of the

application of restrictions on international capital movements.

measures.

      The next section of the paper discusses the methods used to develop this data

set from annual information published by the IMF. This is followed by a section in

which we discuss some statistics of our disaggregated data set, including the

correlation across categories of assets and directions of transactions (that is,

controls on inflows or on outflows). The next section discusses issues related to

aggregating the asset categories and also compares an aggregated index of our data

with two aggregate indicators that are commonly used in panel estimation, those

first introduced in Quinn (1997) and in Chinn and Ito (2006). We offer some

concluding comments in Section V.

II.     Constructing the Capital Control Indicators

        Cross-country time series of capital controls typically draw from the IMF’s

Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER).8

The capital control measures presented in this paper are also based on the de jure

information from this source.9 There was a fundamental change in the reporting on

capital controls beginning with the 1996 volume of the AREAER (providing

information for conditions in 1995) when it began including more detailed

information both across a disaggregated set of assets and by distinguishing between

controls on outflows and controls on inflows; thus our data series begin in 1995 and,

currently, includes data through 2013.10 In this section we describe the data set we

have constructed and discuss the methods we have taken to translate the narrative

in the annual volumes to a panel data set.

        The present work revises, extends, and widens the data set originally

developed by Schindler (2009), and later expanded by Klein (2012) and Fernandez

et.al. (2014). Schindler’s dataset covers 91 countries over the period 1995 to 2005,

and considers restrictions on inflows and outflows over six asset categories, namely,

8
 The early works that use the AREAER to create panel data sets of capital controls include Vittorio
Grilli and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti (1995), Quinn (1997), and Chinn and Ito (2006).

9That is, the measures capture legal restrictions, but not whether or to what extent they are
enforced. One difficulty in trying to construct empirically-based de facto indicators of capital account
restrictions is that there is not a clear benchmark of the gross capital flows consistent with free
capital mobility. Furthermore, de facto indicators based on the equalization of rates of return would
assume efficient markets, and require making assumptions about investors’ expectations and
preferences as well as the correlations of asset returns with other measures of risk.
10
  There is very limited coverage for the years 1995 and 1996 for one category of assets, controls on
bonds with maturity of greater than one year, and so the data series for this asset begins in 1997.


                                                   6
equity, bonds, money market, collective investment, financial credit, and foreign

direct investment. Klein (2012) extends Schindler’s dataset to include the period

2006 to 2010 but limits the coverage to 44 countries and restrictions on inflows.

Fernandez et.al. (2014) further extend the dataset until the year 2011 for the

original 91 countries in Schindler (2009). They also consider restrictions on capital

inflows and outflows.

       The dataset discussed in this paper extends currently available data in three

dimensions; asset categories, countries, and sample period. The four new asset

categories are derivatives, commercial credit, financial guarantees, and real estate.

Derivatives are of particular interest, given their increasing role in international

transactions (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2007). The nine new countries were

selected through a population-based criterion, bringing the total number of

countries to 100.11 The sample period of has been extended to cover the period 1995

to 2013.

       This paper also provides the specific set of rules used for coding the narrative

in the AREAER reports in order to generate the data. These rules are explained in

detail below, and in even greater detail in a technical appendix. The rules build on

those used by Schindler (2009). We clarify the rules, and provide explicit criteria, in

order to facilitate future updates of the data set. These rules are also used to revise

some of the observations in Schindler’s original data set in order to ensure a

 The nine added countries were those with the largest populations in 2012 (according to the World
Development Indicators) that were not in the original Schindler data set, but were included in the
AREAER. These countries are Algeria, Colombia, Ethiopia, Iran, Myanmar, Nigeria, Poland,
Ukraine and Vietnam.

harmonization of those data with the new observations included in this expanded

dataset.12

          The AREAER reports the presence of rules and regulations for international

transactions by asset categories. The ten asset categories in our data set allow us to

capture a large proportion of global cross-national asset holdings. The categories,

with their two-letter abbreviations, are:13

          1. Money market instruments, which includes securities with an original
             maturity of one year or less, in addition to short-term instruments like
             certificates of deposit and bills of exchange, among others. [mm]

          2. Bonds or other debt securities with an original maturity of more than one
             year. [bo]

          3. Equity, shares or other securities of a participating nature, excluding
             those investments for the purpose of acquiring a lasting economic interest
             which are addressed as foreign direct investment. [eq]

          4. Collective investment securities such as mutual funds and investment
             trusts. [ci]

          5. Financial credit and credits other than commercial credits granted by all
             residents, including banks, to nonresidents, or vice versa. [fc]

          6. Derivatives, which includes operations in rights, warrants, financial
             options and futures, secondary market operations in other financial
             claims, swaps of bonds and other debt securities, and foreign exchange
             without any other underlying transaction. [de]

          7. Commercial Credits for operations directly linked with international trade
             transactions or with the rendering of international services. [cc]


12
  Specifically, whenever a discrepancy arose in a particular asset/country category between
Schindler’s original data set and ours in 2005 (the last year of Schindler’s dataset), the data was
revised for that category in that year and backwards until no discrepancy was detected. If there was
no discrepancy in 2005 then there was no revision backwards for that country/asset subcategory. In
total, only 145 observations (less than one percent of the original dataset) was modified. These
observations are listed in the master data file.
13
     Where applicable, the notation follows that in Schindler (2009).

                                                     8
      8. Guarantees, Sureties and Financial Back-Up Facilities provided by
         residents to nonresidents, and vice versa, which includes securities
         pledged for payment or performance of a contract—such as warrants,
         performance bonds, and standby letters of credit—and financial backup
         facilities that are credit facilities used as a guarantee for independent
         financial operations. [gs]

      9. Real Estate transactions representing the acquisition of real estate not
         associated with direct investment, including, for example, investments of
         a purely financial nature in real estate or the acquisition of real estate for
         personal use.[re]

      10. Direct investment accounts for transactions made for the purpose of
          establishing lasting economic relations both abroad by residents and
          domestically by nonresidents. [di]


      The AREAER distinguishes across types of transactions according to the

residency of the buyer or the seller, and whether the transaction represents a

purchase or a sale or issuance. For five asset categories, Money Market, Bonds,

Equities, Collective Investments and Derivatives, there are four categories of

transactions controls: two categories of controls on inflows, including Purchase

Locally by Non-Residents [plbn] and Sale or Issue Abroad by Residents [siar]; and

two categories of controls on outflows, which are Purchase Abroad by Residents

[pabr] and Sale or Issue Locally by Non-Residents [siar]. The Real Estate category

includes the inflow transaction category plbn and the outflow control transaction

categories pabr and Sale Locally by Non-Residents [slbn]. There is only a broader

classification of inflow controls or outflow controls for the three categories of

Financial Credits [fci and fco], Commercial Credits [cci and cco], and Guarantees,

Sureties and Financial Backup Facilities [gsi and gso]. Direct Investment includes

the categories of controls on inflows [dii], controls on outflows [dio], and controls on

the Liquidation of Direct Investment [ldi] which captures controls on capital inflows

or outflows from the liquidation of direct investment abroad or domestically. Thus,

in its most disaggregated format, our data set provides information on 32

transaction categories. Table 1 summarizes this.

        We use the narrative description in the AREAER to determine whether or

not there are restrictions on international transactions, with a 1 representing the

presence of a restriction and a 0 representing no restriction.14 This requires a set of

rules on interpreting the information presented in these narratives. We formulated

rules consistent with those used for the original Schindler (2009) data set,

elaborating them when further clarification is warranted. The key points of these

rules are:15

(i)     The annual information from the AREAER reports comes with three
        columns; the first listing the asset subcategory, the second containing a YES
        (that is, a restriction is in place), a NO, or no entry, and the third including
        narrative information. When coding each subcategory we first look at the
        information in both columns two and three of the reports and follow these
        criteria:
            i. If there is no narrative information in the third column we code on the
        basis of the information in the second column where we assign a 0 for NO and
        a 1 for YES.
            ii. If there is information in the third column we code based on the
            narrative information in that column.

14
  The AREAER narrative is limited to either n.r. or n.a. in about 2.8 percent of the cases in our data.
The entry n.a. is used by the IMF “when it is unclear whether a particular category or measure
exists – because pertinent information is not available at the time of publication.” (IMF 2011) The
entry n.r. is used when “members have provided the IMF staff with information that a category or an
item is not regulated.” In addition, our dataset has the category d.n.e. that represents “does not
exist” to document the cases where there is no information whatsoever, but this appears only 15
times in the entire data set (0.03 percent of the dataset). The data set available on line retains the
n.r., n.a., and d.n.e. entries, but in the statistics presented in this paper we set to missing an entry
with any of these three classifications.
15
  A more detailed description of our rules and guiding principles is contained in the technical
appendix.

                                                  11
(ii)    A control is deemed to be in place when the narrative information alludes to a
        transaction explicitly requiring “authorization,” “approval,” “permission,” or
        “clearance” from a public institution. However, a requirement of “reporting,”
        “registration,” or “notification” is not counted as constituting a control.

(iii)   A quantity restriction on any investment (e.g. in the form of “ceiling”) is coded
        as a control. In addition, an explicit allusion to a restriction for “prudential”
        considerations is deemed to be a control.

(iv)    Restrictions on a particular asset that prevent capital flows from and into
        specific countries on the basis of political or national security reasons are not
        considered capital controls.

(v)     When there is a restriction specifically for transactions for only one sector
        (except the financial system or for pension funds) and/or when that
        restriction is for an area reserved for state control (such as defense, security,
        central banking, etc.) that restriction is not categorized as a capital control.
        If, on the other hand, the restriction does not specify which areas other than
        defense are reserved for state control, then the restriction is categorized as
        control. Restrictions are counted as a capital control if they cover more than
        one sector in which private entrepreneurship is common, and these
        restrictions are deemed to have a macroeconomic impact.


        There are a variety of ways to aggregate these data series in order to obtain a

smaller set of indicators than the full set of 32 categories presented in Table 1. The

most basic aggregation is to have indicators of inflow controls and outflow controls

for the ten asset categories. This does not require any aggregation for the asset

categories of Commercial Credits, Financial Credits or Guaranties, Sureties and

Financial Backup Facilities since the data set only includes their inflow (cci, fci and

gsi) and outflow (cco, fco and gso) categories, and the value of each of these

indicators will be either 0 or 1. We do not aggregate the Direct Investment on

Inflows, Outflows and Controls on Liquidation of Direct Investment in this paper,

but keep the three categories separate, denoting them as dii, dio, and ldi, all of

                                            12
which will have values of either 0 or 1. In the case of Real Estate, there is only one

inflow category (which we denote rei), but there would need to be an aggregation of

re_pabr and re_slbn to obtain a single, aggregate outflow category (which we call

reo).

        The aggregation scheme that we follow to obtain a single outflow category for

Real Estate, as well as both an inflow indicator and an outflow indicator for the

other five asset categories that each have two inflow and outflow categories, is to

construct indices that represent the average of the inflow or outflow indicators. For

each of these eleven asset categories, the aggregate inflow index is the average of

the 0 or 1 in Purchased Locally by Nonresidents and Sale or Issue Abroad by

Residents, and the aggregate outflow index is the average of the 0 or 1 in Purchased

Abroad by Residents and Sale or Issue Locally by Non-Residents (or, for Real

Estate, Sale Locally by Non-Residents). Thus the values of mmi, mmo, boi, boo, eqi,

eqo, cii, cio, dei, deo and reo will be 0, ½ or 1.16 For these categories, one could

interpret an entry of 1 as representing greater intensity of controls than an entry of

½.



III.    Characteristics of the Capital Control Indicators

        In this section, we present some characteristics of the capital control data.

We begin by considering the properties of inflow and outflow controls for the ten

asset categories. We then discuss aggregating these series into broader indicators

16
 When there is a missing value in one of the two inflow or outflow subcategories (see footnote 12),
we score the aggregate inflow or outflow entry with the value taken by the remaining subcategory.


                                                 13
that reflect the average level of controls for the full set of assets, or for subsets

consisting of two or more categories. We conclude this section with an estimation of

the correlation between our broad capital control indicator and two other popular

indicators of aggregate capital controls.

        The data set covers 100 countries over the period 1995 to 2013. The list of

countries, by World Bank Income Group, is presented in Table 2. As shown in that

table, there are 42 high income countries, 32 upper middle income countries, 18

lower middle income countries, and 8 low income countries.

       This table also includes Klein’s (2012) classification of a country as Open,

Gate or Wall. There will be further discussion of this classification below, but the

basic point is that an Open country has virtually no capital controls on any asset

category over the sample period, a Wall country has pervasive controls across all, or

almost all, categories of assets and a Gate country uses capital controls episodically.

       We begin by considering the prevalence of controls, by asset/direction

categories (where direction refers to whether the control is on inflows or outflows).

The detailed nature of our data set permits an examination of differences across

these categories. These differences could be important because the effects of policies

may vary depending upon whether controls are targeted towards inflows or outflows

of particular classes of assets. Broad indicators of capital controls that do not

distinguish across asset categories, or even between controls on inflows and controls

on outflows, will mask potentially important variations in the types of controls.

Note: Following Klein (2012), “Open” (“Walls”) countries have, on average, capital controls on less than 10
percent (more than 70 percent) of their transactions subcategories over the sample period and do not have any
years in which controls are on more than 20 percent (less than 60 percent) of their transaction subcategories.
“Gate” countries are neither Walls nor Open.
         Figure 1 shows the prevalence of controls across 20 asset/direction categories

In this figure, no distinction is made between a value of ½ and 1, rather each are


                                                         15
treated equally as a control. The prevalence of controls ranges from 18 percent of

observations (for liquidation of direct investment), to 25 percent (for inflow controls

on Guarantees, Sureties and Financial Backup Facilities) to 50 percent or greater

(for inflow controls on Real Estate and outflow controls on Money Market

Instruments, Bonds, Equities, Collective Investments, and Derivatives). The figure

also demonstrates that, but for Real Estate and Direct Investment, there is a higher

prevalence of controls on outflows than on inflows.

The first set of columns shows the average control values (0, ½ or 1) for those eleven



                                             16
asset/direction categories that have two components for inflows or outflows, and the

second set of columns shows the number of cases where controls are absent or

present for the ten asset/direction categories that have only one component each for

inflows and outflows. The final row of the second column shows that overall, 40

percent of the observations represent cases in which there are capital controls. For

the asset/direction categories that can take the value 0, ½ or 1, there are more

observations of 1 than of ½ (the difference is 26% of the observations versus 20%).

       The detailed nature of our data set enables us to consider, along with

differences in the prevalence of controls across asset/direction categories, the




                                                17
correlation of controls across these categories.17 This is of interest for a number of

reasons, including how governments choose to pair controls across asset categories

or between those on inflows and those on outflows, and whether such pairings

strengthens the overall effect of these policies. Table 4 presents correlations across

the ten asset categories that are listed in its rows and columns. The diagonal cells

of the table show the correlation between inflows and outflows for each asset

category; for example the correlation between mmi and mmo is 0.78 and the

correlation between eqi and eqo is 0.72. The upper triangular cells of the table show

the correlations across asset categories for inflow controls; for example, the

correlation between eqi and cii is 0.70. The lower triangular cells of the table show

the correlations across asset categories for outflow controls; for example, the

correlation between gso and cco is 0.74. The 100 entries in this table are color

coded, with red cells representing correlations between 0.80 and 1.00, green cells

representing correlations between 0.60 and 0.69, turquoise cells representing

correlations between 0.40 and 0.59, yellow cells representing correlations between

0.20 and 0.39, and no color highlighting for cells with correlations less than 0.20.

  The correlations are across all observations, that is, across all pairs x(t), y(t), where x and y
represent asset/direction categories and t represents the time period. Correlations will be missing if
the variance of an indicator is zero, but, in practice, there are relatively few instances of this, even
among the Open and Walls categories. Zero variances would be more prevalent if we first calculated
correlations for each country, that is the correlation of x(i,t) and y(i,t) where i represents a country,
and then take the average of these correlations across countries to calculate the overall correlation.

       The table shows that the correlation between inflow controls and outflow

controls for a given asset tends to be high. The highest correlation between inflow

and outflow controls is for Derivatives (86 percent) and the lowest is for Direct

Investment (37 percent) and Real Estate (30 percent). This result echoes that

obtained by Fernandez, et.al. (2014) who show that the cyclical components of

capital controls on inflows and outflows are positively correlated. The correlation

between asset categories, for both inflow controls and outflow controls, is highest

among Money Market Instruments, Bonds, Equities, Collective Investments, and

Derivatives. The lowest correlations are found for inflow controls between Real

Estate and each of the other nine categories of assets. More broadly, the

correlations are higher among the asset categories for outflow controls than for

inflow controls.

       Countries that had almost no controls for any category over the entire sample

period, as well as countries that had controls on virtually all assets in every year,

will contribute to larger values of the correlations in Table 4. We call these Open


                                                 19
countries and Wall countries, respectively, following Klein (2012). In particular, the

36 countries in the Open category (which includes 24 of the 42 High Income

countries) each had capital controls on less than 15 percent of their asset/direction

categories over the sample period and had no year in which capital controls were in

place on more than 25 percent of the categories. The 16 countries in the Wall

category (which includes 11 of the 26 Lower Middle Income and Low Income

countries) each had controls on at least 70 percent of their asset / transaction

categories and had no year in which capital controls were in place on less than 60

percent of the categories. The 48 countries that are neither Open nor Wall are

classified as Gate countries. As mentioned above, Table 1 notes the classification of

each country in terms of these three categories.

       Table 5A presents the correlations across asset/direction categories for the 48

Gate countries and Table 5B presents these correlations for the 52 Open and Wall

countries. As expected, the correlations for the Gate countries are lower than those

of the other countries, with only one greater than 80 percent (red cell) and 40 less

than 40 percent (yellow cells, and cells without highlighting). In contrast, all the

correlations in Table 5B among outflows are greater than 80 percent, and the

majority of those among inflows (but for correlations with real estate) greater than

60 percent, with a fifth of the inflow restriction correlations greater than 80 percent.

      Correlations in controls for the subset of Gate countries are a better indicator

of the manner in which countries pair controls used episodically than the

correlations for the full set of countries. The highest correlations for the Gate

countries are those between outflow controls on Money Market Instruments, Bonds,

Equities, Collective Investments and Derivatives. The lowest correlations are those

for inflow controls with Commercial Credits, and Real Estate. These patterns of

correlations will inform our decisions of which asset categories to use when

constructing aggregate capital control indices, which is the topic of the next section.



IV.   Aggregate Indicators

      The correlations presented in Tables 4 and 5 are based on disaggregated

asset/direction categories (with averages used for the categories that have two

components for either inflows or outflows). In many instances it may be desirable to

have a more aggregated indicator. For instance, one might be interested in

studying the intensity with which capital controls are applied. By tracking

variations across asset categories, directions of transactions, and time, aggregate

indices capture a form of intensity of restrictions on capital movements across

borders. Indeed, Fernández, et.al. (2014) show that an aggregate index of controls

on capital inflows captures well the evolution of actual tax rates on capital inflows

in the emblematic case of Brazil in the late 2000s. In this section we present a

number of aggregate indicators, and use them to demonstrate some characteristics

of the capital control data.



                                          22
        An aggregate of the capital control indicators is important for presenting the

evolution of capital controls over time; a graph of the 32 disaggregated capital

control categories would be hopelessly muddled. Therefore, we first calculate two

broad indicator of the stance of each country towards capital controls, one as the

average value controls on inflows for the 10 asset categories in each year,




and another as the controls on outflows,




where             represents controls on inflows of the jth asset category (e.g. Money

Market Instruments, Bonds, etc.) for the ith country in year t, and              is the

comparable control on outflows of the jth asset category for the ith country in year t.

We cannot plot the evolution for all 100 countries, however, so we take the average

value for each of the four income groups; High, Upper Middle, Lower Middle and

Low. Figures 2a and 2b present the plots of these four aggregate series for controls

on inflows and controls on outflows, respectively.

        Figures 2a and 2b show that, on average, the capital control index is

inversely related to income. Specifically, the left axis in each figure is for the High

Income group, and its midpoint is about 0.15 in Figure 2a and 0.17 in Figure 2b

while midpoints of the right axes, which pertain to the other three groups, is about

0.53 and 0.60, respectively. This difference is not surprising, given the relatively

large proportion of High Income countries that are classified as Open, and the

relatively higher proportion of countries in the other three groups that are classified

as Gate or Wall countries. This is also consistent with the findings of Fernandez,

et.al. (2014), who found an inverse relation between capital controls and income

levels, although their findings came from a more limited sample in terms of assets,

countries and years.

      Another distinction across the income groups is the pattern of average capital

controls over time. The High Income group of countries has a large decrease in its

average from about 0.20 for inflows and 0.22 for outflows in the first years of the

sample period to less than 0.10 in 2008 for inflows and 0.12 in 2004 for outflows

before rising again in the subsequent years. The Low Income countries as a group

also see a large decline in their average inflow and outflow controls in the first years

of the sample period, and then an increase, especially in average controls on

outflows. The range of the averages across time for both inflow controls and outflow

controls for the two Middle Income groups is lower than the other groups, and the

averages themselves are lower than the Low Income group but more than twice as

high as those for the High Income group.

      The aggregate indicators used to generate Figures 2a and 2b show some

differences between controls on inflows and controls on outflows. We further

consider the relationship between inflow controls and outflow controls by

calculating, for each country, its average controls on inflows and outflows over the

full sample period, KCINFLOWi and KCOUTFLOWi, respectively. These are defined as

                            The two panels of this figure show a somewhat higher prevalence of outflow

                  controls than of inflow controls, consistent with the statistics in Table 3 and Figure

                  1. Figure 3 illustrates that the difference in the prevalence of inflow and outflow

                                                                                          26
controls is more pronounced for the Medium and Lower Income countries than for

the High Income countries. The two panels of Figure 3 also show that there is a

relatively high correlation of inflow and outflow controls on a country-by-country

basis (for both sets of countries, the correlation is about 0.8). This is necessarily the

case for the 36 Open countries and, to a somewhat lesser extent, for the 16 Wall

countries.

      Figures 2 and 3 use aggregates either across sets of countries for each year,

or across time for each country. In some cases we may want to take advantage of

the detailed nature of the data set and have an aggregate indicator based on a

subset of assets; for example, Klein and Shambaugh (forthcoming) use an indicator

that includes only Money Market Instruments and Bonds in their analysis of

interest parity as well as another one that includes those asset categories plus

Equities, Collective Investment and Financial Credits.

      More generally, with any aggregate we would want to consider the benefit of

having a single measure against the cost of masking information by combining

possibly disparate series. An aggregate indicator will be more representative of its

constituent series if the series are more highly correlated with each other. For

example, an aggregate indicator averaging the inflow and outflow series for

Derivatives is more representative of its two constituent parts than one that

averages the inflow and outflow indicators of Real Estate since the correlation of the

former is 0.86 and that of the latter is 0.30. Likewise, an aggregate of the outflow

controls for Money Market Instruments, Bonds, Equities and Collective



                                           27
Investments would be one that is relatively representative of each of these separate

categories since each of the six pairwise correlations are greater than 80 percent,

while the broadening of this aggregate to include controls on Commercial Credits

would be less representative since the correlations of that category with the other

four ranges from 55 percent to 64 percent.

       We begin by examining the correlation between the average of inflows and

outflows of a single asset with that of an average of an aggregate of the inflows and

outflows of the other nine assets. Table 6 presents this set of ten statistics. The

table shows that controls on Real Estate, Commercial Credits, Direct Investment,

and Guarantees, Sureties, and Financial Backup Facilities are least correlated with

the aggregate of the respective nine remaining categories while the correlation of

Money Market Instruments, Collective Investments, Derivatives and Equities are

most highly correlated.

Entries represent the correlations between an aggregate 9-Asset Capital Flow Measure (both
inflow and outflow controls) that exclude the asset category in listed in the column head, and
that excluded asset.


       We next consider a set of nested aggregate indicators that differ by the

number of component assets (again, each asset series represents the average of

inflow and outflow controls). All ten assets are included in the broadest indicator,

KC10i,t, which is the average of the inflow and outflow indicators above,



                                                 28
The series KC9i,t excludes direct investment, both because it is less correlated with

the other assets than almost any other series and because controls on direct

investment often reflect non-economic considerations. The series KC5i,t includes

Money Market Instruments, Bonds, Equities, Collective Investments, and

Derivatives, five series that are relatively highly correlated. The narrowest

category, KC2i,t, includes only controls on fixed income assets, Money Market

Instruments and Bonds.

      Table 7 presents the correlations across these categories for the full set of

countries (the six upper triangular elements of the table) and the Gate countries

only (the six lower triangular elements) for these four aggregate indicators. The

correlations are very high for the full set of countries, with a range from 0.924 (for

the correlation between KC10 and KC2) to 0.995 (for the correlation between KC9

and KC10). The correlations among these aggregates for the Gate countries are,

naturally, lower than the respective correlations for the full set of countries, and

there is also a greater range of values. For example, the correlation between the

two-asset and ten-asset indicators is 0.873. In contrast, the difference in the

correlation of the two-asset and five-asset indicators between the full sample (0.971)

and the sample of Gate countries (0.953) is not nearly as large. Thus, there could be

differences in the estimated effect of capital controls in an analysis in which the

identification depends upon the pattern of controls for Gates countries.

       We conclude this section by considering the relationship between the average

for each country of our broadest indicator of capital controls, KC10i and the average,

over the same time periods, of two popular measures of aggregate capital controls

that have been used in empirical research. The index developed by Dennis Quinn

(first published in Quinn (1997)) attempts to capture the intensity of enforcement of

controls on both the capital account and the current account. As in the present

study, Quinn derives an index of capital controls from the narrative portion of the

AREAER reports. To assess the severity of the restrictions on capital flows, Quinn’s

index uses a five-point scale at the granular level. However, his index does not

distinguish between capital controls on inflows and capital controls on outflows.

For purposes of comparison to our aggregate index, in the analysis below we convert

his capital account index to the range [0,1] in which, as with our index, larger

values represent more restrictions on capital account transactions. The Chinn-Ito

index (first presented in Chinn and Ito (2006)) takes the first principal component of

the AREAER summary binary codings of controls relating to current account


                                               30
transactions, capital account transactions, the existence of multiple exchange rates,

and the requirements of surrendering export proceeds. As with the Quinn index, we

convert this index to one with the range [0,1] in which larger values represent more

restrictions, to facilitate comparison with our index.

       We regress the average value for each country of each of these two indices

over the sample period on the average value for each country of our broad indicator

of capital account controls, KC10i.18 These estimates, with the standard errors

given in parentheses, are




Plots of the regression lines, and the scatter plots of the points, are presented in the

two panels of Figure 4. We identify the country associated with each point for

which the absolute value of the regression error is greater than 0.25 for the

regression for the Quinn indicator, and 0.20 for the Chinn-Ito regression.

       In both of these regressions, the coefficient on KC10i is significantly different

from zero at very high levels of confidence. But the more relevant test is whether

these coefficients are significantly different from 1. The t-statistic for this test in

the regression with the Chinn-Ito indicator is 1.71 and the t-statistic for the Quinn

regression is 7.21. Thus, the null hypothesis that the coefficients equal 1 can be

  The average values of KC10i used in the regressions are calculated using annual data only for
those countries that have data for the Quinn and the Chinn-Ito indices in the respective years (the
averages KC10i are different for the Quinn and Chinn-Ito regressions since these two indices have
different country coverage in each year). The sample period used to calculate these averages is 1995
to 2012.

V.    Conclusions

      The role that capital controls should play in countries’ macroeconomic

toolkits remains one of the most hotly contested issues in discussions over the

international monetary system. The shift among some policymakers and

researchers towards a greater acceptance of these rules and regulations in the wake

of the economic and financial turmoil of the past few years contrasts with the views

of other that many of these policies are ineffective and cause unintended

consequences. Properly addressing the continuing controversies surrounding this

topic requires careful, high-quality theoretical and empirical research.

      We contribute to this debate by making available a new data set, described in

this paper, which will enable more detailed and wider-ranging empirical

investigations of capital controls and their effects. In this paper we have illustrated

and explained the data construction. We also present some of the basic properties

of the granular data as well as those of aggregates built up from the individual data

series. Our hope is that this data set proves useful in moving forward our

understanding of this important topic.
