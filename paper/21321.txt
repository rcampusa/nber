                                             ABSTRACT

We estimate demand for residential broadband using high-frequency data from subscribers facing
a three-part tariff. The three-part tariff makes data usage during the billing cycle a dynamic problem;
thus, generating variation in the (shadow) price of usage. We provide evidence that subscribers respond
to this variation, and use their dynamic decisions to estimate a flexible distribution of willingness to
pay for different plan characteristics. Using the estimates, we simulate demand under alternative pricing
and find that usage-based pricing eliminates low-value traffic. Furthermore, we show that the costs
associated with investment in fiber-optic networks are likely recoverable in some markets, but that
there is a large gap between social and private incentives to invest.

1     Introduction

The telecommunications sector is undergoing major changes and is the focus of several important
public policy debates. A driving force behind these changes is the growing importance of data
services and the proliferation of online activities, especially the popularity of (over the top) video
providers such as Netflix and YouTube. Cable companies, which once mainly delivered video,
are shifting their focus to broadband services. The same is true for cellular carriers, whose
networks are increasingly used to deliver data. Traditional telecomm companies are trying to
keep up with this trend and offering their version of data delivery services.1 In this paper, we
contribute an important ingredient for studying the economics of this industry: demand for
residential broadband. In particular, we estimate demand using a unique dataset and (shadow)
price variation created by usage-based pricing. We demonstrate the implications of the demand
estimates by computing consumers’ plan choices and usage when faced with a variety of contracts
including unlimited plans and high speed fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP) options.
    In order to estimate demand for residential broadband we rely on two sources of variation.
We use variation in prices and attributes of the plans subscribers choose, but more importantly
we rely on variation created by three-part tariff plans we observe. Subscribers pay a monthly fee,
which provides them a monthly data allowance. If they exceed the allowance they pay a price
per Gigabyte (GB). When facing a three-part tariff plan, the marginal price paid for usage is
zero until the subscriber exceeds their allowance. However, a forward-looking subscriber realizes
that the shadow price of usage depends on how many days are left in the billing cycle and the
fraction of the allowance already used. To exploit this variation, we build a dynamic model of
utility-maximizing subscribers’ inter-temporal decision making throughout a billing cycle.

    At the core of the paper is a dataset that we secured from an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
The data include information on hour-by-hour Internet usage for roughly 55,000 subscribers
facing different price schedules. We also know plan-specific variables (speed, prices, etc.) for the
plan the household is subscribed to and for the alternatives not chosen. The ISP has in place
three-part tariff plans in addition to subscribers who are grandfathered in to unlimited plans.
    Using these data we provide descriptive evidence that consumers respond to variation in the
   1
     Major public policy discussions in this sector include the proposed merger between two of the largest cable
and broadband providers in the US, Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the proposed merger between ATT and
DirecTV, which claim, in public filing with the FCC, that the merger will generate synergies between ATT’s
broadband abilities and DirecTV’s video. Both these mergers are currently being evaluated by the DOJ and FCC.
A third proposed merger, between Sprint and T-Mobile, was canceled but was rumored to be driven by incentives
to invest in next generation wireless technology that will deliver faster data delivery services. Other policy issues
facing the FCC and Congress are the equal treatment of content on the Internet (so called net neutrality) and
encouragement of municipal broadband networks.

shadow price of usage. We then estimate a (finite horizon) dynamic choice model, by adapting
the techniques of Ackerberg (2009), Bajari et al. (2007) and Fox et al. (2011). Specifically,
we solve the dynamic problem for a large number of subscriber types, once for each type. We
then estimate the distribution over these types by matching moments recovered from the data
to those predicted by a weighted average of the optimal behavior of the types.
    The estimates allow us to quantify several aspects of consumer demand for broadband. First,
we find that consumers’ willingness-to-pay for a one Megabit per second (Mb/s) increase in
connection speed is between $0 to $5 per month, with an average of $2.03. Second, we find that
the average consumer’s willingness-to-pay for a one GB increase in usage allowance is $0.36 per
month, which suggests that marginal content has relatively low value. However, at a price of zero
and with average download speed, we find the average subscriber’s usage would average about
66 GB per month and consumer surplus would average nearly $165 per month.
    To demonstrate the implications of the demand estimates, we calculate usage and welfare
under several alternative menus of plans. We find that usage-based pricing is effective in lowering
usage, without reducing consumer welfare significantly, because it mostly removes content with
relatively low value. Generally, usage-based pricing shifts surplus from consumers to providers.
The magnitude, as well as the effect on total welfare, depends on how the prices of the unlimited
plans are set.2
    Next we evaluate adoption, usage and welfare when consumers are presented with an unlim-
ited plan and a one Gigabit per second (Gb/s) connection. We find that surplus generated from
usage is substantial. Yet at a fee of $70, which is what Google charges for Google Fiber in Kansas
City, the ISP captures only a small portion of this surplus, generating a gap between private and
social benefits from investment. Using cost estimates from Kirjner and Parameswaran (2013), we
estimate it takes 27 months to recover the capital expenditures from a social perspective, relative
to typical cable offerings, and only 12 months relative to not having any broadband service. On
the other hand, a typical ISP that upgrades to Gigabit speeds would recover these costs only
after about 149 months. The exact recovery time depends on the competitive environment, but
    2
      Usage-based pricing has been proposed as one way to manage congestion in the current bandwidth-intensive
environment. The term typically refers to non-linear pricing based on the quantity of usage and not the type, or
content, of usage, which is at the heart of the net-neutrality debate. Usage-based pricing is popular for broadband
service outside the US, and for cellular plans in the US. However, usage-based pricing has generated a policy
discussion in the US when proposed as the standard for pricing broadband service (OIAC 2013). Much of the
debate on the usage and welfare implications of usage-based pricing has been theoretical (Mackie-Mason and Varian
1995; Bauer and Wildman 2012; Odlyzko et al. 2012), and has not been informed by data. See De Fontenay et al.
(1990) for a discussion of similar issues with telecommunications services in the 1980s. Another way to manage
congestion is setting peak-load prices and giving users incentives to shift usage to off peak times. Without a
change in some of the major applications that currently require real-time streaming, this strategy is unlikely to be
effective.



                                                         2
the general point – that there is a large gap between social and private incentives to invest – is
quite robust.

        Our paper is related to a literature that studies demand for broadband service. Varian (2002)
and Edell and Varaiya (2002) run experiments, where users face varying prices for different
allowances and speeds. Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) use data on individuals’ time spent on the
Internet and earnings to estimate consumer benefit from residential broadband, assuming an
hour spent on the Internet is an hour of forgone wages. Lambrecht et al. (2007) use monthly
consumption data from a German ISP to study the role of uncertainty in consumers’ selection of
usage-based plans. Several additional papers (Dutz et al. 2009; Rosston et al. 2010; Greenstein
and McDevitt 2011) estimate the economic value of broadband internet using plan choice data.
Hitt and Tambe (2007) show that broadband adoption increases internet usage by 1,300 minutes
per month, suggesting a strong preference for content that requires high bandwidth.
        The modeling in this paper is related to several literatures. First, is a literature that focuses
on estimating demand in dynamic settings (Crawford and Shum, 2005; Hartmann, 2006, Hendel
and Nevo, 2006a; Gowrisankaran and Rysman, 2012; and others). Like our analysis, Yao et al.
(2012) exploits intra-month (weekly) variation in the shadow price of usage under three-part
tariffs to identify consumers’ discount factors. Second, is a literature studying incentives in labor
contracts where a nonlinear compensation structure based on performance during a fixed period
of time makes the worker’s decision regarding the optimal level of effort a dynamic one, in much
the same way usage is under a three-part tariff (e.g. Copeland and Monnet (2009), Chung et al.
(2010), and Misra and Nair (2011), Einav at al (forthcoming)). Finally, our paper is related to
a literature that examines if consumers are forward-looking (Aron-Dine et al. (2012), Chevalier
and Goolsbee (2009), Grubb (2015), Grubb and Osborne (2015), and Hendel and Nevo (2006b)).


2        Data

The data come from a North American ISP that offers several plans. Features of a plan include
maximum download speed, an access fee, usage allowance (if any), and overage price per GB of
data (if any).3 Unlimited plans, where subscribers do not face overage prices, are only available to
subscribers who previously had them. Usage in GBs is recorded for both uploads and downloads,
but for billing purposes, and consequently our purposes, the direction of the traffic is ignored.
For each subscriber, we observe usage at the monthly level from May 1st , 2011 to May 31st , 2012,
and for 15-minute intervals during May 10th to June 30th , 2012. We also know the plan chosen

        Subscribers are not on long-term contracts, only incurring a disconnection fee if service is canceled.

2.1      Sample and Descriptive Statistics

The sample includes 54,801 subscribers in four different markets served by the ISP. The residents
of these four markets had per-capita income of $47,592 in 2011, relative to $45,222 for residents
in all US metropolitan markets.

       The data demonstrate a sharp increase in usage. The median subscriber more than doubles
usage, from 9 GBs in May 2011 to over 20 GBs in May 2012, an increase equivalent to four
high-definition movies. The average subscriber’s usage increases from 23 to over 40 GBs. There
is substantial heterogeneity in usage: the 25th percentile household used less than 6 GB per
month in May 2012, while the 75th percentile consumed almost 9 times as much. During this
period, approximately 39% of aggregate traffic is online video, 35% is web traffic, 14% is peer-
to-peer activities, and the remainder is largely comprised of gaming activities, software updates,
and cloud-based and music-streaming services. These and other patterns are presented in the
Appendix.

day. Peak usage occurs 10pm-11pm, when the average user consumes over 4.5 GBs each month.
This is almost six times the amount of traffic generated during 5am-6am. Throughout the day,
approximately 90% of the usage is for download. Aggregating usage (uploads and downloads) to
a daily level results in 1,644,030 subscriber-day observations.
    Table 1 reports summary statistics on monthly usage and plan characteristics for May-June
2012 billing cycle. These statistics highlight how allowances and overage prices curtail usage. An
average subscriber to an unlimited plan pays $44.33 for a month of service, enjoys a maximum
download speed of 6.40 Mb/s and uses just over 50 GB. In contrast, an average subscriber to a
usage-based plan pays nearly $30 more per month to enjoy faster download speed (14.68 Mb/s),
but uses under 44 GB. The median subscriber to an unlimited plan pays about $1.68 per GB,
less than 60% of what a usage-based subscriber pays.

    Our data use agreement prevents us from disclosing the actual plan features, but we can
show an approximate relative ranking of the plan features and costs. For each plan, Figure 1
presents how the total cost of subscribing to a plan changes with monthly usage. Each plan is
also labeled with a relative speed ranking, with the slowest plan normalized to 1. The presence
of low-cost, low-speed, and unlimited-usage grandfathered plans allows us to better characterize
the shape of the utility function by observing a marginal price for usage equal to zero.

Note: These statistics reflect usage by subscribers to a single ISP, in four markets during May 2011-June 2012.
Usage is based upon Internet Protocol Detail Record (IPDR) data, captured in 15-minute intervals and aggregated
to the monthly level. Overage statistics reflect only those subscribers incurring positive overage charges. A
subscriber is said to be on a dominated plan if there was an alternative that would have yielded a lower cost and
with download speed that is no lower. Means and medians are at the subscriber level.


plans with usage-based pricing. During June 2012, about ten percent of subscribers on plans
with usage-based pricing exceed their allowance. This is important, as our identification strategy
relies on having enough subscribers with a positive probability of incurring overage charges during
the month. On average, subscribers use slightly less than half of their usage allowance, and of
those that go over, the median amount over the allowance is 17 GBs. In the Appendix we provide
the distribution of the fraction of allowance used.
       Previous work has studied whether consumers make what look like suboptimal choices ex-
post in a variety of settings.5 In our data, it is not obvious that subscribers systemically make
mistakes. One way to measure these mistakes is to ask how many subscribers could switch to a
plan that costs less and is no slower. Using this definition, if we look at the complete billing cycle
(June 2012) in isolation, we find that 7.24% of subscribers used a dominated plan. However,
the frequency of this type of mistake goes down to 0.13% if we ask how many subscribers could
have paid less and used service that is no slower during the 13 months from May 2011 to May
2012. This is a weak test of the optimality of plan choice since, as we see in Figure 1, speed
and allowance are positively correlated. So, for example, if we see a consumer use little of their
allowance we cannot be certain whether they have a high willingness to pay for additional speed
or if they chose a sub-optimal plan.
   5
    In particular, some research has highlighted what seem like suboptimal choice made by by consumers facing
non-linear pricing, similar to ours, in cell phone usage (Grubb and Osborne 2015) and health care (Abaluck and
Gruber 2011; Handel 2013). On the other hand, several papers (e.g., Miravete 2003; Economides et al 2008;
Goettler and Clay 2011; Kecham et al 2012) highlight circumstances where individuals make choices that are
rational ex post.

2.2     Are Subscribers Forward Looking?

We now examine whether consumers in our data are forward looking. This is interesting for two
reasons. First, the evidence we provide adds to a growing literature demonstrating consumers are
forward-looking when making economic choices. Second, our identification relies on consumers
responding to changes in the shadow price of usage over a billing cycle. It is therefore useful to
know that consumers are indeed responding to this variation before proceeding to the model.
    Our data are from an ISP that allows subscribers to carefully track their usage, by receiving
text messages and emails at regular intervals after they exceed one-half of their allowance. Con-
sumers may also log into the provider’s web site at any time. We therefore have confidence that
subscribers are aware of cumulative usage during the month.

    If subscribers are forward looking, we expect certain patterns in usage throughout a billing
cycle. The heaviest-volume subscribers who know they have high probability of exceeding their
allowance should behave as though the shadow price is equal to the overage price: there should
be little change in average usage throughout the billing cycle. Similarly, for subscribers with only
a small probability of exceeding their allowance, behavior should not vary throughout the billing
cycle. The only exception would be a small increase in usage towards the end of the billing cycle
when the probability of exceeding the usage allowance approaches zero. For subscribers between
these two extremes, usage should vary significantly depending on both the day in the billing
cycle and a subscriber’s cumulative usage up until that day.

    To test whether consumers respond to the price variation introduced by past usage within a
billing cycle, we estimate the following regression

Note: This table presents OLS estimates of Equation (1) using 1,644,030 subscriber-day observations. The

variables for the days of the week and a time trend to account for any organic growth in usage
over the course of the billing cycle. Since different households have different billing dates we
can separate time trends and demand shocks on certain days from the dynamics of our model.
We also include subscriber fixed effects, µj , to remove persistent forms of heterogeneity across
subscribers.
    The estimates of Equation (1) are reported in Table 3. Each cell reports the estimate for
the coefficient on the interaction between the indicators in the respective row and column. The
patterns in the table are consistent with forward-looking behavior: at each point in the billing
cycle current usage is lower the closer the consumer is to the allowance (and hence the shadow
price is higher). Furthermore, subscribers who are near the allowance early in the billing cycle
reduce usage less than subscribers near the allowance later in the billing cycle (i.e., coefficients
decrease monotonically from left to right within rows four and five of Table 3). This is consistent
with consumers near the allowance later in the billing cycle reducing usage proportionally more,
relative to their own mean, than consumers nearing the allowance early in the billing cycle. For
subscribers well below the allowance late in the billing cycle, we observe a small increase in usage,
consistent with these subscribers becoming confident that they will not exceed the allowance.

    In addition to the within-month variation in price, subscribers also encounter a change in


                                                           8
the shadow price when their usage allowance is refreshed at the beginning of a new billing cycle.
A forward-looking subscriber near the allowance at the end of a billing cycle knows that the
shadow price decreases at the beginning of the next billing cycle. Conversely, a subscriber well
below the allowance likely experiences an increase in the shadow price as the new billing cycle
begins. Subscribers well over the allowance at the end of the billing cycle, who expect to go over
the allowance again next month, should behave as though the price always equals the overage
price and not respond at all.

Note: This figure presents how the percentage change in usage from the last day of a billing cycle to the first day

       For most subscribers, we observe at least one day of usage beyond the full billing cycle used
for the rest of our analysis, allowing for a test of whether subscribers respond to this across-month
price variation. To do so, we first calculate the percentage change in usage from the final day of
the billing cycle (t = 30) to the first day of the next billing cycle (t = 31) for each subscriber,
cjk(30) −cjk(31)
    cjk(30)      .   We then calculate the mean percentage change for groups of subscribers that used
                                                                                                             C30

Subscribers facing a price increase at the beginning of the next month consume relatively more
at the end of the current month, while those expecting a price decrease consume relatively less.
We observe little change in usage for those well above the allowance in the current month.6
       Collectively, our results provide support for the hypothesis that subscribers are forward look-
ing. Consumers are responsive, in an economically meaningful way, to variation in the shadow

price of usage both within and across billing cycles.


3     Model

We model the subscriber’s problem in two stages. The subscriber first chooses a plan anticipating
future demand for content, and then chooses usage given the chosen plan.

3.1    Utility From Content

Subscribers derive utility from content and a numeraire good. To consume content, each sub-
scriber chooses a plan, indexed by k. Each plan is characterized by the speed content is delivered,
sk , by a usage allowance, C k , by a fixed fee Fk that pays for all consumption up to the usage
allowance and by an overage price, pk per GB of usage in excess of the allowance. For any plan,
the number of days in the billing cycle is T .
    Utility from content is additively separable over all days in the billing cycle.7 Let consumption
of content on day t of the billing cycle be ct and the consumption of the numeraire good on day
t be yt . The utility for a subscriber of type h on plan k is given by
                                                        !                   
                                                 c1−β
                                                   t
                                                      h
                                                                      κ2h
                      uh (ct , yt , υt ; k) = υt          − ct κ1h +           + yt .
                                                 1 − βh              ln(sk )

The first term captures the subscriber’s gross utility from usage. Quickly declining marginal
utility seems natural: a subscriber’s first e-mail sent, her favorite website to check, her first
Netix/Youtube video, etc., should bring significantly more marginal utility than subsequent
usage. The specification – where the curvature of the utility function can vary from log (βh → 1)
to linear (βh = 0) – permits an interpretation based on a close link to price elasticity of demand.
The utility from consumption is scaled by a time-varying shock, υt , which captures randomness
in utility from consumption. The shock is observed by the subscriber only in period t. For type h,
each υt is independently and identically distributed LN(µh , σh ), truncated at point υh to exclude
the top 0.5% of the distribution. For simplicity, we denote type h′ s distribution of υt as Gh ,
and refer to µh and σh as the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. A more general
model would relax the iid assumptions in a variety of ways. For example, the distribution could
vary by day of the week, exhibit serial correlation or be more “lumpy” (to account for different
usage generated, say, by email and movies). However, as we show in the Appendix, it seems like
none of these are a major concern in our data.
  7
    In this way, we assume content with a similar marginal utility is generated each day or constantly refreshed.
This may not be the case for a subscriber who has not previously had access to the internet.




                                                       10
    The second term captures the subscriber’s non-price cost of consuming online content. Marginal
                            κ2h
cost is constant, at κ1h + ln(s k)
                                   . The parameter κ1h > 0 captures the consumer’s opportunity cost
                               κ2h
of content. The ratio         ln(sk ) ,    where κ2h > 0 is the subscriber’s preference for speed, captures the
waiting cost of transferring content. This specification implies that the subscriber has a satia-
tion point absent overage charges, which is important for explaining why consumers on unlimited
plans consume a finite amount of content.8 Our specification assumes that the cost of consuming
content is linear, but the marginal utility is convex. Alternatively, we could allow for curvature
in cost. However, it is not clear how the data would separate these two and it seems to us that
a linear cost, reflecting time cost, and declining marginal utility is the natural assumption.
    The vector of parameters, (βh , κ1h , κ2h , µh , σh ), describes a subscriber of type h. Conditional
on choosing plan k, this subscriber’s problem is
                                     T
                                     X
                    max                    E [uh (ct , yt , υt ; k)]
                  {c1 ,...,cT }
                                     t=1
                                                                                      T
                                                                                      X                 T
                                                                                                        X
                  s.t. Fk + pk M ax{CT − C k , 0} + YT ≤ I, CT =                            ct , YT =         yt .
                                                                                      j=1               j=1

We do not discount future utility since we model daily decisions, over a finite and short horizon.
Uncertainty involves the realizations of υt . We assume that wealth, I, is large enough so that it
does not constrain consumption of content.

3.2    Optimal Usage

We now solve for the optimal usage implied by the model. Denote the unused allowance at the
beginning of period t, for a subscriber on plan k, as C kt ≡ M ax{C k − Ct−1 , 0}. Similarly, denote
period-t overage as Otk (ct ) ≡ M ax{ct − C kt , 0}.
    In the terminal period (T ) of a billing cycle, there are no intertemporal tradeoffs. The
subscriber solves a static utility maximization problem, given cumulative usage up until period
T , CT −1 , and the realization of the preference shock, υT . For a subscriber well below the
allowance (i.e., C kT is high) and without a high draw of υT , it is optimal to consume content
                                  ∂uh (ct ,yt ,υt ;k)
up to the point where                   ∂ct             = 0. If marginal utility at ct = C kT is positive but below pk ,
then it is optimal to consume exactly the remaining allowance. For a subscriber who is already
above the allowance (i.e., C kT = 0) or who draws a high υT , it is optimal to consume up to the
               ∂uh (ct ,yt ,υt ;k)
point where          ∂ct              = pk . Denoting this optimal level of consumption by c∗hkT (CT −1 , υT ),
   8
     The data come from a period when the network of this ISP was overly-provisioned. Therefore, we assume that
the usage decision does not depend on concerns over congestion in the network.

affects the next period’s state, so the optimal policy function for a subscriber incorporates this.

3.3        Plan Choice

Subscribers select plans before observing any utility shocks. Specifically, entering the first period
with C0 = 0, the subscriber selects plan k ∈ {1, ..., K} to maximize expected utility. The
subscriber may also choose no plan at all, k = 0. Formally, the plan choice is given by

                                      kh∗ = arg max {E [Vhk1 (0)] − Fk }
                                            k∈{0,1,...,K}

where the value E [Vh01 (0)] and the fixed access fee F0 for k = 0, the outside option, are nor-
malized to 0. Note, that we assume that there is no error, so consumers choose the plan that is
optimal. This assumption is motivated by the finding above that consumers seem to make few
choices that ex-post are clearly mistakes.9


4        Estimation and Identification

We estimate the parameters of the model using a method of moments approach similar to the
two-step algorithms proposed by Ackerberg (2009), Bajari et al. (2007), and Fox et al. (2011).
First, we solve the dynamic program for a wide variety of subscriber types. Second, we estimate
a weight for each of the types by matching the weighted average of optimal behavior, calculated
in the first stage, to the equivalent moments observed in the data. This yields an estimated
distribution of types. In this section we outline the main steps and provide more details and
sensitivity analysis in the Appendix.
        In step 1 of the estimation we solve the dynamic program for 16,807 types (seven points of
support for each of the five parameters), where each type is defined by a value of the parameter
vector (βh , κ1h , κ2h , µh , σh ). For a plan, k, and subscriber type, h, we solve the finite-horizon
dynamic program described in the previous section recursively, starting at the end of each billing
cycle. To do so, we discretize the state space. Because the subscriber does not know υt prior to
period t, we can integrate over its support and the solution to the dynamic programming problem
for each type of subscriber can be characterized by the expected value functions, E [Vhkt (Ct−1 )],
and policy functions, E [c∗hkt (Ct−1 )]. Having solved the dynamic program for a subscriber of type
h, we generate the transition process for the state vector implied by the solution.
        In step 2 of the estimation we choose a weight for each subscriber type to match moments
we recover from the data to the (weighted) average of the behavior predicted by the model.
    9
        In the Appendix we show how we can generalize the model along several dimensions.

                                     k   θ is a weighted average of the equivalent type-specific
moments predicted by the model, and Vb −1 is a weighting matrix. Note that type weights, θh ,
are chosen to match the moments for each plan, and they sum up to 1 for each plan. After the
estimation we rescale the weights by the probability that each plan is chosen, and therefore we
also match the share of each plan in the data.
       In choosing which moments to match we focus on two considerations: identification and
computational ease. Estimation is much simpler if the moments are linear in the weights.10 We
therefore choose the following two sets of moments. First, we use the mean usage at each state
 P
 H
    E [c∗hkt (Ct−1 )] γhkt (Ct−1 )θh , where E [c∗hkt (Ct−1 )] is the mean usage of type h in time t given
h=1
plan k and past usage of Ct−1 , and γhkt (Ct−1 ) is the probability that this type reaches the state.
Note that the average is taken across all types on the plan, not just those that arrive at the state
with positive probability, which keeps the moment linear in the parameters. The second set of
                                                          PH
moments is the mass of subscribers at a particular state,     γhkt (Ct−1 )θh , which like the first
                                                                      h=1
set of moments, is easy to calculate and linear in the weights.

       We calculate standard errors using a block-resampling methodology (Lahiri 2003). Specifi-
cally, we sample the data by consumer with replacement, keeping all 30 days for each of 54,801
consumers drawn, which results in 1,000 samples of size 1,644,030. For each sample, we re-
calculate the moments and then re-estimate the weights. We calculate standard errors for subse-
quent statistics and counterfactual analyses by repeating the calculation using the 1,000 different
estimates of the weights.
       The estimation procedure recovers the weights of each type by choosing the mixture of types
that best matches the data. The data we use to identify the parameters includes plan choice and
usage. The logic of identification follows in some ways that of Bayesian estimation. The selection
of the boundaries of the initial grid amounts to putting a uniform prior on the distribution of
types over the grid (and zero probability elsewhere). Plan selection – specifically, the share of
consumers who choose each plan – provides information on the type distribution. In the model,
each type has an optimal plan, so plan selection splits the type space into distinct groups but
  10
    As pointed out by Bajari et al. (2007) and Fox et al. (2011), least squares minimization subject to linear
constraints, and over a bounded support, is a well-defined convex optimization problem. Even though the opti-
mization is over a potentially large number of weights, it is quick and easy to program as long as the moments are
linear in the weights.

does not provide any information about the relative importance of types within a group. In
other words, it puts a weight on each group of types equal to the share of the plan that group
chooses. As the number of plans increases, and the attributes and prices of the plans vary, the
type distribution can be recovered.
   The usage moments allow us to distribute the weight among types within a group who choose
each plan. Since the objective function is linear in the weights, the intuition for how the weights
are identified is similar to that of a linear regression: the weights are identified as long as the
behavior predicted by different types is not collinear over all the moments and all states used
in estimation. Thus, the key to identification is to understand how each parameter impacts the
variation in predicted behavior across moments and states.

   We rely on two types of usage variation. The first is variation in mean usage across different
states (i.e., day in the billing cycle and fraction of allowance used). The second is variation
in higher-order moments of the usage distribution. Rather than calculating a variety of such
moments, we focus on the cumulative distribution of usage, which efficiently summarizes the
information in the higher-order moments. Note that the first set of moments we use are the
unconditional mean usage, i.e., taking into account usage conditional on getting to a state and
the probability of reaching that state.

   Each parameter impacts behavior in these states in a different way. For example, roughly
speaking, the parameter µh determines average usage across days for each type. To see this,
consider Equation (2), but fix βh = 1 and assume that the shadow price does not vary with the
parameters. In this case average consumption is given by

                                                       E(υt )
                                   E [c∗hkt ] =          κ2h        .
                                                  κ1h + ln(s k)
                                                                + pe

An increase in the average of the shocks impacts usage in all states. On the other hand, changes
in the disutility of consuming content, κ1h and κ2h , have a different effect for different shadow
prices. With βh 6= 1 and with the shadow price varying with the parameters, the same idea holds:
the change in mean usage across states is affected in a different way by the different parameters.
   In addition to variation in average usage across states, we also rely on changes to higher-order
moments of usage. A change in σh impacts the variance of usage and therefore the likelihood
of reaching certain states. Other parameters also impact the probability of reaching certain
states. For example, while different combinations of the curvature parameter βh and the disutility
parameters, κ1h and κ2h , may imply similar average usage, these parameters affect higher-order
moments differently. In the absence of overage prices, a high-curvature, low-disutility subscriber
could have similar average usage as a low-curvature, high-disutility subscriber. But the latter

Note: Figure 3(a) presents the joint distribution of the utility curvature parameter, βh , and the mean of shocks,

subscriber is relatively less sensitive to movements in the shadow price than the former. Hence,
mean usage across states and the probability of reaching states will be different.

    The nonlinearity of the parameters makes it hard to precisely define what variation in the
data identifies each parameter. However, loosely speaking, plan selection is critical for pinning
down κ2h . The mean usage across all states pins down µh and the variance in usage across
all states pins down σh . Finally, βh and κ1h are identified from the variation in usage across
states with different shadow prices. In the Appendix we further demonstrate how types behave
differently by looking at the behavior of the types we estimate.
    To demonstrate the importance of plan selection and the usage moments in pinning down the
distribution of types, we present below the estimated distribution when we only use plan choice
and when we use both plan choice and usage.

We estimate a weight greater than 0.01% (θh > 0.0001) for 53 types. The most common type
accounts for 28% of the total mass, the top 5 types account for 65%, the top 10 for 78% and the

$8.10/GB, and average daily consumption (in absence of overages) would be about 29 GB and
gross willingness-to-pay would be about $72.74.
       Figure 3 demonstrates the importance of plan selection and information on usage (during the
billing cycle) for identifying the distribution of types. As we noted above, in the model, each
type has an optimal plan, so plan selection splits the type space into distinct groups but does
not provide any information about the relative importance of types within a group. Figure 3(a)
presents the joint distribution of the utility curvature, βh , and the mean of the distribution of
random shocks, µh , if only plan selection information is used. That is, if we put equal weight
on each of the types within a group (so that the weights sum up to the share of the plan), and
then integrate over the other parameters to recover the joint distribution of βh and µh . Figure
3(b) presents our estimates of the joint distribution when we use both plan choice and usage
information, as we discuss above. The two distributions look very different, suggesting that the
usage moments are crucial source of information.13

    The estimated joint distribution in Figure 3(b) is highly irregular and looks quite different
from a normal distribution. For the highest-volume subscribers (high µh ), there is substantial
variation in the elasticity of demand. In fact, for high-µh subscribers, the distribution of βh is
clearly multi-peaked (unconditional on values of other parameters). The majority of high-volume
subscribers have highly elastic demand, a value of βh less than or equal to 0.3, including the most
common type of subscriber. Most of the remainder of the high-µh subscribers have less elastic
demand, or a value of βh greater than or equal to 0.7. The distribution of the other parameters is
similarly iregular and multi-peaked. For example, a relatively small group of individuals places
high value on increased connection speeds (high κ2h ), but the majority of high-µh subscribers
have a relatively low preference for speed.

    Overall, our model fits the data quite well. For all plans, the correlation between the empirical
moments and the fitted moments is very high. The model also does well fitting patterns in the
data that were not explicitly matched during estimation. For example, one might be concerned
that bandwidth-intensive activities, like online video and cloud-based services, will generate a
lumpiness in usage that our log-normal distribution cannot capture. To address this, we calculate
in the data, and simulate from the model, the ratio of daily consumption to a consumer’s mean
usage over a month. In the model, this ratio will vary both because of variation in the state
and because of random draws to the consumption shocks, υt . We therefore simulate usage
predicted by the model 1,000 times for each consumer type over a 30 day period, perform the
same calculation for each of the simulations, and then aggregate across types accounting for the
relative mass of each. Figure 4 presents the distribution of this ratio for the data and the model
simulations. Overall the model matches the data quite well, which both provides a goodness of
fit measure and shows that our model can deal with whatever lumpiness in usage is in the data.

    To demonstrate the implications of the estimated type distribution, Figure 5 shows the dis-
tribution of willingness to pay to increase the usage allowance by one GB on the first day of
                       dE[Vhk1 (0)]

                                      (in panel (a)), and speed by one Mb/s for the entire billing cycle,
dE[Vhk1 (0)]
   dsk       ,   (in panel (b)). Figure 5(a) shows that approximately eighty percent of subscribers
have a positive probability of incurring overage charges and would be willing to pay to increase
their allowance if given the opportunity. The average (median) willingness to pay for a one GB
increase is $0.36 ($0.09), and the distribution is left-skewed with a small number of subscribers
who are willing to pay substantial amounts. Figure 5(b) shows there is substantial variation in
the preference for speed across consumers. The willingness to pay to improve speed by one Mb/s
ranges from nearly zero to just over $5, the average is $2.02 and the median is $2.48.
    To further visualize what our estimates imply for demand, we consider subscriber behavior

                under a linear tariff. Suppose the ISP eliminates access fees and instead sets a price p per GB, and
                offers just one download speed s. Because there is no fixed fee, every subscriber type consumes
                something under this plan. Conditional on υt , a subscriber of type h chooses consumption
                according to Equation (2), with sk = s and pek (ct , Ct−1 ) = p. Taking expectations over Gh for
                each type, and averaging across subscriber types, expected daily demand for content is then

                We calculate expected demand for five different speeds: (1) 2 Mb/s, a relatively slow speed by
                most standards; (2) 14.68 Mb/s, the average speed for subscribers in our data; (3) 50 Mb/s, a
                mid-tier speed offered currently; (4) 100 Mb/s, a top-tier speed offered currently; and (5) 1,024
                Mb/s, the highest speed currently offered in North America. We present expected demand for
                prices of 0 to $5 per GB.

                    For the average speed in our data, subscribers facing a zero price would consume an average
                of 2.20 GB per day, or roughly 66 GB per month. This usage is significantly reduced as the
                price increases. At a price of just $1 per GB usage is cut by half, and at $5 per GB usage is
                more than 10 times lower. The impact of speed can be seen by comparisons across columns. At
                a price of zero, expected usage at a speed of 2 Mb/s is more than 60% lower than usage at the

average speed in our data, while at speed of 1,024 expected usage more than doubles. Demand
is much less price sensitive at lower speeds, since waiting costs form a much greater part of the
subscriber’s overall costs from consuming content, reducing the effect of price.
    The relatively modest increase in usage with large increases in speed is intuitive and provides
a reality check on our estimates. The applications used by the average consumer in 2012 do
not require speeds that are substantially above the average speed in the data. Therefore, the
significantly higher speeds do not induce much higher usage on average. However, even with
2012 applications these estimates demonstrate that current usage is limited by offered connection
speeds. As the average user adopts more bandwidth-intensive applications, the volume of Internet
traffic is likely to increase following investment in high-speed next-generation networks.


6     Implications for Managing Internet Traffic

To illustrate the implications of our estimates, we conduct several exercises to study different
solutions proposed to managing the growth in Internet traffic.

6.1    The Impact of Usage-Based Pricing

We consider the impact of usage-based pricing (UBP) on usage, subscriber welfare, and the
ISP’s costs and revenues by comparing behavior under UBP, to consumers’ plan and usage
choices predicted by the demand model in various counterfactual settings. The analysis is not an
equilibrium analysis, since we do not solve for the optimal offering of plans in the counterfactual
setting. Instead, we use the model to simulate consumer behavior in a variety of settings.
    The results are presented in Table 5. In column (1) we present the results when consumers
face the UBP plans in the data, where we use the model to allocate the consumers who were
on unlimited grandfathered plans to UBP plans (and calculate their usage). In column (2) we

examine the case when consumers face the same set of plans except that allowances are unlimited
(and monthly fees are held constant). Not surprisingly, since the marginal price of usage is zero
and monthly fees are unchanged, usage increases substantially as does consumer welfare. The
ISP’s revenue decreases mainly because consumers select cheaper plans that previously had a
lower allowance but now differ only in speed. The sum of consumer surplus and revenue is slightly
lower than column (1), and since costs are higher (due to increased usage), total surplus is lower.
Relative to identical unlimited plans, UBP increases total welfare, but mainly shifts surplus from
consumers to the ISP.

       In column (2) we hold constant the prices of plans, the speeds, and the number of plans. It
is therefore likely that we overstate the surplus lost by subscribers and the revenue gains to the
ISP from UBP. We explore two ways to relax this assumption. In column (3) we present results
when consumers face a typical set of unlimited plans offered by a US cable provider in 2012.14
Interestingly, the results are very similar to those from column (2).
       Next, in column (4), we return to the set of plans we see in the data but calculate the fees
that maximize revenue associated with unlimited service. The ISP significantly raises fixed fees,
collecting an average fee of $64.3, excluding about 7% of those who would subscribe under UBP
plans. The effect is as expected, consumer surplus decreases relative to column (2) due to the
higher fees, and ISP revenues increase. As in the case of column (2), UBP shifts surplus to
  14
    In particular, the monthly fixed fees for the plans are $34.99, $47.99, $59.99 and $79.99 with speeds of 8, 12,
15 and 18 Mb/s.


                                                         21
the ISP. However, unlike the results of column (2), where the direction of the effect relative
to UBP is known in advance, here consumer surplus could be higher or lower when UBP is
introduced. Unlimited plans have lower marginal prices but the fixed fees are likely higher, and
more importantly could change the speed of the chosen plan and therefore impact usage. The
results in Table (5) show that on net consumer surplus is lower with UBP.15 The calculation in
column (4) might be over estimating the ability of the ISP to raise prices because we do not allow
for entry or for a competitive response. To check this we explored introducing a DSL option,
which is slower than the plans in the data, or introducing a telecomm with a fiber-to-the-node
technology (such as ATT’s U-verse). The results (not presented in the table) only strengthen
the patterns we observe: UBP generally shifts surplus from consumers to the ISP.

6.2    Economic Viability of Next-Generation Networks

We now evaluate the economic viability of 1 Gb/s networks. This type of speed can be provided
by next-generation high-speed broadband networks, such as FTTP, which has been proposed by,
among others, Google.16 DOCSIS 3.1 for cable-broadband networks is expected to be capable of
similar performance.
    As in the previous section, our analysis is not an equilibrium analysis: we do not have a
supply model to determine the price of the FTTP plan. Furthermore, the speed is a significant
extrapolation from what we see in the sample, and we (explicitly) hold the availability of content
constant. One could imagine that if fast speeds become widely available, content and consumers’
willingness to pay for speed will change accordingly. This increase would make our estimates of
the willingness to pay for FTTP an increasingly conservative lower bound.

    The results are presented in Table 6. In column (1) we display adoption and usage when
FTTP is offered for free. This provides a benchmark of consumer surplus generated by the
availability of a fast connection. The higher speed does indeed generate substantial surplus.
However, due to a declining marginal value of speed implied by our utility function, speeds of
more than 10 times those offered by the typical cable plans, imply only 2 times the surplus.
    In column (2) we evaluate usage and adoption when a fee of $70 is charged, which is what
Google charges in Kansas City for Google Fiber. At this fee, but with no alternatives, over 95%
of households in our population, of broadband users, are predicted to adopt FTTP and as a result
usage decreases only slightly relative to a fee of zero. The next four columns examine the effect
  15
     In a working paper version of this paper we provided the consumer welfare numbers by types and showed that
some consumers were better off under UBP. Indeed, the net result aggregating across consumers can be sensitive
to the exact estimates.

of alternative broadband offerings and different prices. In columns (3) and (4), the fee for FTTP
is still $70, but either cable or U-verse options are introduced.17 Adoption rates of FTTP fall
significantly to roughly two thirds, with usage and speed being lower because some consumers
choose the alternative plans. In the last two columns, when the FTTP provider charges revenue-
maximizing fees, adoption of FTTP, usage and speeds fall even further. The optimal FTTP fee
in Columns (5) and (6) are $106.4 and $134.4, respectively.

    To address how long it will take to return the cost of investment in FTTP, we draw on esti-
mates of the capital costs associated with the fiber network built in Kansas City by Google Fiber
(Kirjner and Parameswaran (2013)).18 If we compare FTTP to no availability of broadband at
all, then from a social welfare point of view, using the estimates from column (1) suggests that
these capital costs can be recovered in approximately 12 months ($3,284/$279.4). If, alterna-
tively, broadband is offered with typical cable options, column (3) of Table 5, then the social
costs are recovered in approximately 27 months ($3,284/($279.4-$113.5-$44.8)). From the ISP’s

      The cable offerings are similar to those available in Kansas City, prices of $29.99, $39.99, $49.99, $59.99, at
speeds of 3, 25, 50, 105 Mb/s. U-verse offering are $29.95, $34.95, $44.95, $64.95 for speeds of 3, 6, 18, 45.
   18
      The authors estimate that it will cost $84 million dollars to “pass” 149,000 homes, or approximately $564 per
household. To actually connect each home, the authors estimate it will cost an additional $464 per subscriber.
If one assumes a 20% penetration rate for the service, this equates to capital costs of $3,284 (5*$564+$464) per
household served.

perspective, the time to recover the capital costs is much higher. For example, for an existing
cable service it will take approximately 149 months ($3,284/($66.8 - $44.8)) to recover the in-
vestment cost if the revenue from FTTP, priced at $70, is compared to the revenue of a typical
US cable plan (column (3) of Table 5). The exact number is sensitive to what we assume about
competition before and after FTTP is introduced and whether we consider a new entrant or an
existing ISP. However, the general point – that there is a large gap between social and private
incentives to invest – is quite robust.


7    Conclusion

We estimate demand for residential broadband service using plan choices and high-frequency
usage data. The three-part tariff plans make the usage problem dynamic and generate variation
in the shadow price of usage. We show that consumers respond to this variation. Next we use
the variation in shadow price to estimate a dynamic choice model and then use the estimates
to evaluate the usage and welfare implications of two alternatives proposed to dealing with
growth in Internet usage: usage-based pricing and high-speed next-generation networks. Our
results suggest that usage-based pricing is an effective means to remove low-value traffic from
the Internet. We find that FTTP generates significant consumer surplus but that there is a large
gap between the private and social incentives for investment in such networks. This suggests
that without subsidization these investments will come much later than is socially optimal.
    There are several issues that our model does not address, and that we leave for future research.
First, network congestion, which is argued to be a driver of the move towards usage-based
pricing, was not necessary to model because the ISP providing our data operated an overly-
provisioned network. An interesting question for future research is to measure the size and
impact of congestion externalities among subscribers. Second, our analysis, because of data
limitations, focused on GBs but not on the type of content viewed. In future work we hope to
have more detailed data on the actual content, which coupled with information on TV viewing
would let us explore several questions on how consumers actually use broadband. Finally, our
analysis aggregated to the daily level. However, as we noted, usage is significantly higher during
peak periods. This suggests that a natural way to deal with congestion is to introduce peak-load
pricing. To be effective, this will require changes in popular applications, such as Netflix. We
leave it to future work to explore substitution between peak and non-peak periods, which is key
to the effectiveness of peak-load pricing.

Appendix
    In this Appendix, we present further analysis and results that were not included in the text
due to space considerations. First, we discuss the model: we present analysis to motivate the
modeling assumptions used in the paper and discuss ways to enrich the model. Second, we provide
greater detail regarding the estimation and further analysis of identification. Finally, we present
additional results including descriptive evidence on the importance of consumer heterogeneity
and details on the estimated type distribution.


1    Extensions of the Model

Day-of-Week Dependence

    If a consumer’s online habits vary by the day of week, the distribution of the preference
shocks should include a day-of-week component (which would violate the iid assumption). In
principle, this can easily be dealt with by adding an additional state variable that captures the
day of the week. Table 7 presents average daily usage by day of week. We find no consistent
and statistically-significant difference across days. To check that the lack of day-specific demand
is not driven by some odd behavior in our data we also look at two other operators for roughly
the same time period. The results for these operators also exhibit little difference in the level of
activity across days, suggesting that it is not necessary to add day of week to the state vector.19

Note: This table presents average daily usage during the May-June 2012 billing cycle.




Transferability of Content Across Days

    Another violation of the iid assumptions would occur if subscribers postpone consumption
from one day to another. The end of one billing cycle, and the beginning of the next, presents
  19
     Note that any variation by day of week is separately identified from patterns in usage across the month due
to usage-based pricing, since consumers have staggered billing cycles.


                                                      28
the best opportunity to find evidence that subscribers have postponed consumption of content
until a later time. Content is most likely to be postponed when a subscriber knows that the
usage allowance is refreshed, and they don’t have to postpone consumption by more than a few
days. Thus, if we find little evidence of content being transferred at the end of the billing cycle
in these situations, it suggests that transfer of content across days is unlikely to occur elsewhere.
    To look for evidence of content being transferred across billing cycles, we enrich the end-
of-month analysis from the main text. First, for each day and every consumer, we calculate
the percentage deviation in daily usage from the consumer’s own mean. We then classify con-
sumers into groups based upon their cumulative usage at the end of the billing cycle: light

groups, we calculate the average percentage deviation over each of the last five days of the billing
cycle and the first five days of the next billing cycle. Figure 6 presents the results of these calcu-
lations. If content was being transferred to the next billing cycle we would expect to see a higher
than average usage on the first few days, especially for the heavy users. We observe no evidence
of content being transferred across billing cycles for those consumers near the allowance.

is identical to the results presented in the main text. The results for the 2-day (3-day) window
are similar, but rather than the difference in usage on the first and last days of the billing cycle
being used in the calculation, average usage on the last two (three) and first two (three) days of
the billing cycle are used. The results are similar with the only noticeable difference occurring
for those subscribers well over the allowance by the end of the month. However, this variation is
largely due to the very small number of subscribers who substantially exceed their allowance.

Note: This figure presents how the percentage difference between average usage during the last days of a billing
cycle and average usage during the first days of the next varies with the proportion of the allowance consumed by
a subscriber at the end of the billing cycle. The figure presents results using a one, two, and three day window for
calculating the averages.




Serial Correlation

    To examine the possibility of serial correlation in the realizations of the preference shock we
cannot simply look at serial correlation in usage since our model predicts that (positive) serial
correlation will arise through the shadow price faced by a subscriber. We therefore examine
whether serial correlation in usage varies with how close a consumer is to the allowance. Serial
correlation due to correlation in the shadow price predicts that closeness to the allowance will
impact serial correlation. Under the alternative, of serial correlation in the preference shock, this
will not be the case.20
  20
     Note that the across-month analysis largely rules out negative serial correlation, or mean reversion, as the
explanation for our results, so we do not discuss it further here.

The median correlation is 0.151 and average correlation coefficient is 0.176.
     To identify those consumers most likely to exhibit positive serial correlation in their usage
we regress the estimate of ρj on the fraction of the allowance used by the subscriber at the end
                         CjT
of the billing cycle,    Cjk
                               . The results are presented in the first column of Table 8. We find
that consumers near their allowance by the end of a billing cycle exhibit more serial correlation
compared to those who use a small portion of their allowance. The second column of Table 8
presents the results when we add a quadratic term to allow for nonlinearities in the relationship.
We also find that the quadratic term has a negative sign, which suggests a diminishing effect, such
that those well over the allowance exhibit less serial correlation. While this effect is statistically
significant, it is quite small in magnitude.


Lumpiness of Usage
     It can be argued that Internet consumption is increasingly “lumpy” as a larger proportion
of traffic consists of either bandwidth-intensive cloud-based services (e.g. iTunes, Dropbox, etc)
or online video offerings (e.g., Netflix, YouTube, etc). For these types of content, consumption
often involves a single download or upload of substantial size. One could argue that a continuous
distribution like the log-normal cannot replicate the usage patterns in the data because of the
lumpiness. However, as we show in Figure 4, in the main text, the model estimates successfully


                                                         31
replicate the variation from day to day in a subscriber’s usage.


Additional Price Sensitivity

   There are at least a couple of other ways we could add additional price sensitivity into the
model. First, the marginal, or shadow, price of usage in the model is given by
                                           
                                            pk                          if Otk (ct ) > 0
                      pek (ct , Ct−1 ) =
                                            ρ1 dE[Vhk(t+1(Ct−1 +ct )]   if Otk (ct ) = 0 .
                                                         dct


We restrict ρ1 to equal one for the analysis in the main text. Namely, at each point in the billing
cycle, either the subscriber is making marginal decisions on usage facing the overage price, pk ,
or fully internalizing the impact of current usage decisions on the possibility of overages, such
                                     dE[Vhk(t+1 (Ct−1 +ct )]
that the perceived price equals               dct            .   By allowing ρ1 to differ from 1 we allow for
consumers who do not fully internalize the impact of current usage until overages are actually
incurred, or overreact to the possibility of overages.
   We estimate ρ1 in a way similar to the other five parameters by using three points of support
for ρ1 (0.5, 1, and 1.5).21 These points of support for ρ1 permit for subscribers who (i) respond
more to actual overages than to changes in the shadow price (ρ1 = 0.5), (ii) fully internalize the
impact of usage on the possibility of overages (ρ1 = 1), and (iii) overreact to the possibility of
incurring overage charges (ρ1 = 1.5). The parameter ρ1 is identified by behavior just before and
just after the allowance is exceeded. If there is no change right around the allowance then usage
is consistent with ρ1 = 1. On the other hand, a difference in behavior just before and just after
the allowance is reached is consistent with ρ1 different from 1.
   Our estimate of the marginal distribution of ρ1 provides support for the assumption in the
main text. Specifically, we estimate that 91.1% of subscribers have ρ1 equal to one, while 3.1%
equal 0.5 and 5.9% equal 1.5. Most importantly, we find that this small number of subscribers
with ρ1 different from one has little implication for our counterfactual results.
   An alternative way to introduce additional price sensitivity is by adding a coefficient in front
of the last term in the utility from content: the utility from the numeraire. In the text, we
normalize the marginal utility from yt to 1, which means that, as we discuss above, the price
sensitivity is captured by βh . A more general model would multiply yt by a coefficient. We did
not explore estimating this coefficient, as it is not clear that is identified in our data.


  21
     We only use usage-based plans for this estimation due to the absence of overages for the grandfathered
unlimited plans.


                                                         32
Plan Choice Model

    Our model of plan choice assumes that consumers choose the plan that maximizes the dynamic
value and that there are no errors in plan selection. We can relax this assumption, by assuming
that each type of subscriber maximizes ρ2 E [Vhk0 (0)] − Fk + ǫhk , where ǫhk are iid extreme value
shocks and ρ2 is a parameter that scales the error shock and the expected utility from the plan.

    We could also extend the plan choice model by letting the utility that the subscriber maxi-
mizes be E [Vhk0 (0)] − ρ3 Fk , (or ρ2 E [Vhk0 (0)] − ρ3 Fk + ǫhk if we want to include the extension of
the previous paragraph). Note that ρ3 , the price coefficient will pick up the relative importance
of price of the plan and the expected value from usage. For a fully rational consumer ρ3 = 1.


2     Econometric Details
2.1   Step 1: Solving the Model

As we describe in the main text, in the first step of the estimation algorithm we solve the dynamic
problem for a large number of types, once for each type, and store the optimal policy.
    For a plan, k, and subscriber type, h, we solve the finite-horizon dynamic program recursively.
To do so, we discretize the Ct state to a grid of 2,000 points with spacing of size, ∆ck GBs,
for each plan, k. The step size, ∆ck , is plan specific and non-decreasing in the plan’s usage
allowance, allowing for a denser state space on plans with lower usage allowances where usage
is typically lower. The maximum consumption is set at five times the allowance for usage-based
plans, and one Terabyte for unlimited plans, which is high enough to capture all usage in our
data. Time is naturally discrete (t = 1, 2, ..., 30 over a billing cycle with T = 30 days) for our
daily data. These discretizations leave υt as the only continuous state variable. Because the
subscriber does not know υt prior to period t, we can integrate it out and the solution to the
dynamic programming problem for each type of subscriber can be characterized by the expected
value functions, E [Vhkt (Ct−1 )], and policy functions, E [c∗hkt (Ct−1 )]. To perform the numerical
integration over the bounded support of υt , [0, υ], we use adaptive Simpson quadrature.
    Having solved the dynamic program for a subscriber of type h, we generate the transition
process for the state vector implied by the solution. The transition probabilities between the
60,000 possible states (2000*30) are implicitly defined by threshold values for υt . For example,
consider a subscriber of type h on plan k, that has consumed Ct−1 prior to period t. The thresh-
old, υt (z), is defined as the value of υt that makes a subscriber indifferent between consuming z
units of content of size ∆ck and z + 1 units, such that the marginal utility (net of any overage




                                                  33
charges) of an additional unit of consumption

                        uh ((z + 1)∆ck , yt , υt (z); k) − uh (z∆ck , yt , υt (z); k)

is equated to the loss in the net present value of future utility

                   E[Vhk(t+1) (Ct−1 + (z + 1)∆ck )] − E[Vhk(t+1) (Ct−1 + z∆ck )].

These thresholds, along with all subscribers’ initial condition, (C0 = 0), define the transition
process between states. For each subscriber type h and plan k, we characterize this transition
process by the cdf of cumulative consumption that it generates,

                                      Γhkt(C) = P (Ct−1 < C) ,

the proportion of subscribers that have consumed less than C through period t of the billing
cycle. Due to the discretized state space, Γhkt(C) is a step function.

2.2   Step 2: Estimation

The second step of our estimation approach matches empirical moments we recover from the
data to those predicted by our model by choosing weights for each subscriber type.

   As we describe in the main text, our estimates of the weights are chosen to maximize the
                                          b −1 , would ideally be the variance covariance matrix
objective function. The weighting matrix, V
   b dat
of m k , ensuring that more variable moments receive less weight. This choice of weighting
matrix in our application is problematic. Specifically, since our approach relies on state-specific
moments, which are aggregated across a large number of types, the variance of the moments
can be quite small. These very low variance moments cause numerical instability during the
                                                                b −1 equal to the identity matrix.
optimization of the objective function. For this reason, we set V
   The richness of the data, along with the low dimensionality of the state space, (Ct−1 , t),
allows a flexible approach for recovering moments from the data to match with the model.
   To recover the cumulative distribution of Ct−1 for each day t and plan k, we use a smooth
version of a simple Kaplan-Meier estimator,
                                                Nk
                                                X              
                                  b kt (C) = 1
                                  Γ                1 Ci(t−1) < C .
                                             Nk
                                                   i=1

                                                                              b kt (C) ∈ [0, 1],
We estimate these moments for each k and t, considering values of C such that Γ
ensuring that we fit the tails of the usage distribution. We use a normal kernel with an adaptive
bandwidth to smooth the empirical cdf.

    We recover the moments of usage at each state by estimating a smooth surface using a
nearest-neighbor approach. Consider a point in the state space, (Ct−1 , t). A neighbor is an
observation in the data for which the subscriber is t days into the billing cycle and cumulative
consumption up until day t is within five percent of Ct−1 . Denote the number of neighbors by
Nkt (Ct−1 ). Then, we estimate the conditional (on reaching the state) mean at (Ct−1 , t) using
                                                                                                                Nkt (Ct−1 )

where i ∈ {1....Nkt (Ct−1 }) indexes the set of nearest neighbors. If Nkt (Ct−1 ) > 500, we use
those 500 neighbors nearest to Ct−1 . Note that this gives us the average usage conditional on a
subscriber arriving at the state. To recover the unconditional mean, we multiply E b [c∗ (Ct−1 )]
                                                                                                                                              kt
by the probability of observing a subscriber at state (Ct−1 , t), recovered from the estimated cdf
of cumulative consumption.
    We estimate both moments at the same set of state space points used when numerically
solving the dynamic programming problem for each subscriber type. This results in 120,000
moments for each plan of the 8 plans, or 8 ∗ 120, 000 = 960, 000 moments in total.

2.3       Identification: Plan Selection and Usage

In this subsection we provide additional results to demonstrate the relative importance of plan
selection and usage. In particular, in Figure 8 we present the marginal distribution of all five
parameters using only plan selection, in the left graphs, and both usage and plan selection in the
right graphs. The results confirm that usage information is driving much of the results.

2.4       Identification: Variation in Behavior Across Types

To demonstrate the differences in behavior between types we look at the heterogeneity in behav-
iors within a particular plan. In Figures 9 and 10, we plot the model’s predicted behavior for
the four types with the greatest estimated weights on a particular usage-based plan. Figure 9
plots the cdf of cumulative consumption on the final day of the billing cycle, CT , for each of the
types. Figure 10 plots expected usage on the last day of the billing cycle, conditional on each
possible level of cumulative consumption on the previous days, CT −1 .22 The functions in this
Figure highlight price sensitivity, through the change in expected usage as the fraction of the
                      CT −1
allowance used,        Ck
                            ,                                        increases. This price sensitivity also reveals information about variation
in usage. A subscriber whose cumulative usage is well below the allowance, but whose expected

Note: This figure presents the derivative of the cdf of cumulative consumption on the last day of the billing
cycle, CT , with respect to each of the type-specific parameters, µ, κ1 , and β, for the most common type,
(µ = 1.00, σ = 0.60, κ1 = 2.63, κ2 = 0.50, β = 0.33).


    Figures 9 and 10 make clear that variation in the parameters induces substantially different
behaviors even within a group of types that prefer the same plan. For example, type A, with
parameters (µ = 1.00, σ = 0.85, κ1 = 2.63, κ2 = 13.25, β = 0.24), typically has low usage with oc-
casionally very high usage (think of this user as one that will occasionally watch online video).
Type B, with parameters (µ = 1.00, σ = 0.60, κ1 = 2.63, κ2 = 0.5, β = 0.33), has typical high us-
age, a greater probability of reaching high cumulative consumption states, and a quite high usage
elasticity. This type can be considered as someone who regularly watches online video. In con-
trast, type C, characterized by the the vector (µ = 1.25, σ = 0.73, κ1 = 0.50, κ2 = 13.25, β = 0.68)
has a very low probability of reaching high cumulative consumption states and a relatively low
usage elasticity. This type seems to mainly use the broadband connection for applications that
are less data intensive, such as web surfing, and seems to choose this plan for the greater speed.

    To further isolate the role that each parameter has in determining type-specific behavior,
and the moments used in estimation, we consider how perturbations of the parameter vector are
reflected in the particular moments we consider. We consider the most common type in our data,
(µ = 1.00, σ = 0.60, κ1 = 2.63, κ2 = 0.50, β = 0.33), accounting for over 28% of the population.

Note: This figure presents the derivative of expected consumption conditional on reaching a state on the last day
of the billing cycle, c∗T (CT −1 ), with respect to each of the type-specific parameters, µ, κ1 , and β, for the most
common type, (µ = 1.00, σ = 0.60, κ1 = 2.63, κ2 = 0.50, β = 0.33).


    For each of the parameters, perturbations result in quite different behavioral responses. An
increase in µ results the entire distribution of cumulative consumption shifting to the right, i.e.,
the cdf is lower at each point, particularly at low cumulative consumption states. Conversely, an
increase in κ1 shifts the entire distribution to the left, i.e., the cdf is greater at each point, although
relatively similarly across the entire distribution. The most interesting response comes when β
is increased, which results in a more concentrated distribution, i.e., the frequency of very low
and very high cumulative consumption states are reduced. Figure 12 shows that perturbations
of each of the parameters has a differing effect on expected consumption conditional on reaching
a particular cumulative consumption state. Again, κ1 has a moderate and similar effect on
expected consumption regardless of the state. An increase in β results in decreased usage at all
states while an increase in µ results in increased usage at all states. The absolute value of these
changes is smallest near the usage allowance.

2.5    Grid Density

Our estimates presented in the main text form a densely-populated grid of types. Specifically,
for each of the five parameters, we consider seven points of support for a total of 16,807 types.
Given the available data and our approach, which searches for an optimal mixture of types to
match state-specific moments from each plan, we find that we cannot increase the density of the
grid without severe multicollinearity problems (i.e., types behave too similarly at all states). Yet,
it is of interest to understand how sparse the grid of types can be and still adequately match the
observed behavior, since in more complex settings with a higher-dimensional parameter vector,
it may be impossible to solve for such a dense grid.

Note: The table presents the 20 types that receive the highest weight, when we estimate the model on a coarser

    To show that our approach performs well even when the density of the grid of types is
substantially reduced, we take a straightforward approach. For each parameter, we consider the
same range of support (minimum and maximum unchanged), but remove every other point of
support. This leaves four points of support along each dimension for a total of 1,024 types (45 ).
We then follow the same steps to estimate weights for each type. We find that 36 types get


                                                         40
positive weight. The top-5 types account for 62% of the mass, the top-10 account for 75%, and
the top-20 for 92%. We present the estimated weights for the top-20 types in Table 9.

Note: This table presents the expected daily usage averaged across all subscriber types when facing a linear tariff
when we estimate the model on a coarser grid. It is meant to demonstrate the sensitivity to the choice of grid.


    Despite the differences between the estimates, we find the implications of the type distribution
for overall demand are rather similar. To visualize this, Table 10 presents average daily usage
under the same set of linear tariffs as Table 4. The largest differences in predicted daily usage
occur for the lowest speeds, while the predictions for higher speeds are quite similar. The
similarity of the results gives us confidence that our approach can be applied in more complex
and higher-dimensional problems, where a less-dense grid of types is necessary.


3     Additional Results
3.1    Descriptive Statistics of Consumer Heterogeneity

Consumers in our data exhibit a wide range of behaviors. To demonstrate this, we first present the
substantial variation in usage across subscribers, and how it has changed over time. Second, we
present the variation in the fraction of the allowance used by subscribers. Both these dimensions
of usage motivate our need for a rich distribution of consumer heterogeneity.

    Table 11 presents usage statistics in May 2011 and May 2012, along with the corresponding
year-on-year growth rates. The median subscriber’s usage more than doubles, from 8.99 GBs in
May 2011 to 20.27 GBs in May 2012. This increase of over 11 GB per month is equivalent to
about eleven additional standard-definition movies or four additional high-definition movies. The
average subscriber’s usage increases more in absolute terms, from 23.08 GBs to 40.29 GBs, but
less in percentage terms. Growth in absolute terms is monotonically higher for more intensive
users, but in percentage terms is monotonically higher for less-intensive users.

cycle. The average share of the allowance used is approximately 49%. For those subscribers
exceeding their allowance, the median overage is 17 GBs and the corresponding charge is $51.19.

3.2    Estimated Type Distribution

Our flexible econometric approach yields a discrete distribution of types, which is difficult to
describe concisely. For this reason, details were omitted from the main text, but we provide
them here.
    Table 12 presents descriptive statistics for the type distribution, and highlights the importance
of the flexibility of our econometric approach. We find a substantial range of heterogeneity for
each of the parameters characterizing a type. There are also noticeable differences in the median
and means, which highlight the skewness of the distribution along each dimension. In particular,
the mean for the curvature parameter, β, is more than 50% greater than the median.
    To further visualize the heterogeneity among types, Table 13 presents the 20 types with the
largest estimated weights, which account for 90% of the mass for the overall distribution.
