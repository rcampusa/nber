                                     ABSTRACT




This paper shows that international policy coordination is not

counterproductive in a world where the incentive to run beggar-thy-
neighbor policies internationally arises from the inefficiency that

characterizes, within each country, the interaction between policymakers
and private agents.         The domestic inefficiency arises from the presence

of nominal contracts that give central banks the power to affect real
variables.        In this setting we show that international cooperation

belongs to central banks' dominant strategy.              The paper is motivated by

a common and misleading interpretation of a paper by Rogoff [1985],

namely that international cooperation may be counterproductive in the

presence of a domestic inefficiency.

1   .   Introduction
          There are two well known results in game theory,   relating to the

optimality of cooperative strategies. The first stetes that when all
players cooperate, their welfare is higher than in the absence of

cooperation. The seco        states that when only some players in a game

cooperate, all players may be worse off than in a situation where nobody

cooperates. When considered from the viewpoint of international policy
coordination, the latter result suggests that cooperation among the

monetary authorities of different countries may be suboptimal if

cooperation cannot be extended to the game that takes place within each

country between the authorities and private agents (see Rogoff [1985]).
This paper questions the above intuition by making the simple point that

in a one-stage game with three players,      in which one player must move

before the others, cooperation among the remaining two is still their
dominant strategy,      even when the player who moves first fails to

cooperate.
          The sequential character of the game is not crucial for the result:

it may occurr even when the three players decide simultaneously.

However, sequential games are important because the interaction between
policymakers and private agents is often cast in a sequential framework.
Consider for example the result, due to Barro and Gordon [1983], that

policymakers incentive to move output away from the natural rate may
produce an inefficient outcome: this can only occur if policymakers have
not only the incentive, but also the power to affect real variables. To

explain why they should have such a power, one has to appeal to nominal
                                      2


contracts.1      The existence of contracts makes the game sequential.
Consider now a two—country world with nominal wage contracts: once wages

are set in each country, the two central banks can decide whether to

form a coalition or not to cooperate. Since there are only two players,

cooperation is unambiguously superior.      Thus,   at the time when contracts

are signed, wage—setters will anticipate not only the power and the
incentive that central banks have to affect real wages ex-post, but also

their Incentive to cooperate internationally.        International cooperation

thus belongs to the (unique)    subgame perfect equilibrium outcome of the
game.    We prove this result in section   3.

        This paper is motivated by a common and misleading interpretation

of a paper by Rogoff [1985], namely that international cooperation may
be counterproductive in the presence of a domestic inefficiency. Rogoff

computes an outcome in which central banks cooperate, and wage—setters
expect them to cooperate, and one in which central banks do not

cooperate and are expected not to cooperate. Comparing the two outcomes
is misleading, because the case where central banks do not cooperate is

not a (subgame perfect) equilibrium of the sequential game.        The

appropriate comparisons must be restricted to equilibrium outcomes.
        It remains true, however, that the cooperative outcome,   although an

equilibrium, may not be optimal——in the sense that it may be Pareto—
dominated by the non-cooperative outcome. This remark would seem to

provide an argument in favor of designing "institutions" that make
countries' commitment not to cooperate credible—-for example cancelling

    asymmetries, the optimal policy would consist in making information
    freely available. See Fischer [1986].
routine OECD or G-n meetings. The argument is similar to the view that,

in a closed economy, central banks' discretion should be restricted by

law.    We discuss this issue in section   '4.   There we show that preventing

international cooperation may be suboptimal in a world subject to

stochastic shocks.
       We conclude that one has to look for explanations other than

nominal contracts to argue that international cooperation may be

counterproductive. One possible direction is asymmetric information, as
in Bean [19861.2     Another is to raise the number of players——for example

considering the presence of a fiscal and a monetary authority within
each country, or increasing the number of countries.



2.   Monetary Policy Interactions in a Two—Country World
     The basic structure of our example is a two-country model with six
decision-makers: a representative firm, a union, and a central banker in

each of the two countries. This model has been used by Canzoneri and

Henderson [19881 and, in a different framework, by Giavazzi and
Giovannini [1988a];    it is similar to that analyzed by Rogoff [19851——in

fact it has the same reduced form.     The model is laid out in Table    1




Lower case letters indicate variables expressed in logs and in

deviations from equilibrium. Upper case letters indicate the level of
the same variables.     The two countries are symmetric, and in each

countr: tomestic labor is the only factor of production.        The technology

     This explanation, however, is open to the same criticism that applies
     to motivations of the time-consistency problem based on information
     asymmetries, rather than on the assumed existence of nominal
     contracts. See the previous footnote.

Domestic and foreign money are the only assets,                                        and are non—traded:

money demand (equations (3) and (3')) is simply a function of the level
of income.

        Equations (5), and (5'),                  (6), and (6'),                    (7), and (7') describe the
                                              5


objectives of the players in each country.              Firms maximize one period

profits,        and unions aim at stabilizing employment around its natural

rate,    (n=n*=O).3 Central banks have two objectives: they minimize the
fluctuations of the domestic CPI (defined in equations (4) and (4'))

and of the deviation of domestic employment from a target,             k,   that

exceeds the natural rate.             This assumes that the natural rate of output

lies within the                     s production possibility frontier, for example

because of the presence of distortions or externalities. The

inefficiency of the natural rate of output is the motivation of the game
that takes place between the union and the central bank inside each

country, and among central bankers internationally. If the natural
rates of output were socially optimal,             central bankers would have no

incentive to affect real variables, and both games would vanish.

        The "rules of the game" are as follows.
1)   The game is sequential.            tn period 0 unions set nominal wages for

period     1.     When period   1    comes, firms choose output and employment,     and

central bankers set the money stock.              The existence of nominal contracts

gives central         bankers the power to affect real variables ex-post.          The

realization of the productivity shock is known to firms and central

hankers before they make their decisions, but is unknown to unions: the

expectation of x when unions set wages is equal to 0. Hence, unions
maximize the expected value of equations (6) and (6'): wages are set in

period 0 based on the expectation of the price level that will prevail
in period        1.   With rational expectations, unions anticipate that



     The main point of the paper remains valid if unions also care about
     fluctuations of the domestic CPI.
equilibrium prices in period          1   whi   be the outcome of the game involving
the domestic and the foreign central bank.

2) Firms are passive players in the game: given wages and the

realization of the productivity shock, firms compute their profit—

maximizing demand of labor taking monetary policy (that is the price
level) as given.       This is equivalent to assuming an infinite number of

competitive firms in each country, whose aggregate strategy consists in
                                4
maximizing (5) and (5      ).       From (1) and       (1   ), we have:




(8)                        n   = —(1/s)(w—p) — x/s
                             * =            *
                                            *
(8    )                    n     —(1/a)(w —p — xis )




3) Central bankers set the money stock given the domestic nominal wage

and the reaction function of domestic firms.                  The equilibrium of the
international game between the two cenfrel banks can be cooperative or
non cooperative. We define cooperation as the outcome of a Nash

bargaining process assuming that central banks can committ themselves to
the cooperative strategy,

          The above "rules of the game" simplify the structure of the problem

by restricting the number of strategic interactions among the players in
the game to only two: one between the union and the central bank in each

country, and one between the central banks of the two countries. We
rule out other possible interactions since they would make the

equilibrium too difficult to compute analytically. Notice,                  for example,




 This assumption implies that all outcomes of the game must belong to
 the firms' reaction functions,
                                               7


 that firms do not use foreign output as a factor of production;
                                                                 given
 wages,   employment only depends on the domestic price level, so that
 unions do not have to take into account what happens abroad.
      To provide a simple and stronger proof of our main result we

proceed as follows.         ie start from a non stochastic world with no

productivity shocks.         Later we allow for stochastic productivity
shocks.

3.a A non-atochastic world

        In period   0,   when they set wages, unions ignore the policy regime
that will prevail in period        1 .   It   is straightforward to show that
maximization of the unions        expected payoffs implies the following wage—
setting rules:


(9)                      w=p e                     w

     The wage is equal to the expected price level. This expectation is

computed anticipating the international policy regime that will prevail
in period   1.   Given wages, central banks will decide whether to

cooperate or not to cooperate and will choose the optimal level of the

money stock accordingly. The anticipation of this choice determines the



 Rogoff [1985] shows that in the absence of real shocks, international
 cooperation is unambiguously counterproductive. The comparison
 between the two regimes becomes ambiguous in the presence of real
 disturbances.

first the case of non cooperation.                     Each central bank sets the money

stock taking the partners money stock as given. Therefore, each

cooperative equilibrium in period                 I    is:

        If instead the two central banks agree to cooperate and to form a

coalition, they will determine their optimal policy by maximizing a
joint objective function.          We define the cooperative equilibrium as the
outcome of a Nash bargaining problem,          and we compute it by maximizing

the product of the gains from agreement:8

                :::B(mm
where V°8 and V°8, defined in equations (14) and (14'), are the payoffs
in the absence of international cooperation. Because the two countries

are symmetric, the solution of this problem is such that m = m*, and is

thus easy to compute.       For any given level of wages, the cooperative
equilibrium in period   1    is:



(16)                    n    =     (ok-aw)/(o+m2)

(17)                    q* =      o(rxk+w*)/(o+e2)

 The Nash bargaining solution has recently been discussed and clarified
 by Binmore, Rubinstein and Wolinski [1986], Rochet [1986]. An
 application to an international policy game is contained in Bean
 [1986].  We compute the cooperative equilibrium assuming that central
 banks can sign binding agreements to cooperate. No cooperative
 agreement could instead he signed between the union and the central
 bank within each country, because central banks and unions make their
 decision at different times. Cooperative agreements would also be
 impossible if we assumed that the union were a fictitious agent whose
 strategy derives from aggregating the strategies of an infinite number
 of atomistic agents.  Carraro [1985, 1988] discusses the
 of the sequential character of the one—stage game when theimplications
                                                             game is
 repeated.

     The comparison of V cB and V B (V B and V B respectively) proves
the following result:

Proposition      1:       Each central bank achieves a larger payoff in the

presence of international cooperation, whatever the wage set by the
domestic union in period              0.

Proof:    It is possible to write:



                                                         o2 +a(m+8)2              2 +0

where the term in square brackets can easily be shown to be positive.

Hence, VCB > V°B whatever w,   In the same way, it is possible to show

that v*CB > v*0B whatever wi'.  International cooperation is the central

banks     dominant strategy in period                1,    independently of the wage set by
unions    in period 0.          Thus cooperation is the only subgame perfect

equilibrium of the game.                  To compute this equilibrium we must turn to

the behavior of unions in period 0.                       Before doing so we note that

international cooperation implies the following values for the two money
stocks:
                                                  12

(23')            q* = m*e +      a(m*_m*e)     +


where m and m* are defined in              (20) and (20'), The optimal wage is:



(24)                        w=wt       =ak/a


Substituting equation (24) in equations (18) yields the subgame perfect
equilibrium of the sequential game, and the central banks' payoffs that

are, respectively:


(25)                        n =   n*   = 0

       The result that the equilibrium where the two ceotral banks

cooperate is the only aubgame perfect equilibrium of the sequential game
can also be shown in the following way.                           Let the unions choose between

      and w0 in period 0, where wc is the wage when unions expect

international cooperation in period                 1   ,       and w0 is   the wage when they

expect    that   central    banks will   not cooperate. Let mc and m0 denote the

central banks        strategy in the presence and absence of international

cooperation respectively.           The game can be described by the following

decision tree:

                                   2,1    1,0           4,0         3,1

where the numbers indicate the ranking assigned to the different payoffs

by the central bank and the union respectively. As previously shown, mc
is a dominant strategy for the central bank whatever w.                             Anticipating

this outcome, the union maximizes its payoff setting the wage equal to
wc.      The sequence (wc, mc) is the only subgame perfect euilibrium.

Notice that the sequence (w°,m°) would yield the following outcome:
                                             14

(30)                    V8        Vt8


The sequence (w0m0) Pareto-dominates the sequence (wc,mc).                  However,

the outcome (28)—(29)   is not a subgame perfect equilibrium and can only

he achieved if central banks can sign in period 0 a binding agreement
not to cooperate. If this were possible,               however, central banks could

commit themselves to even better strategies.               In particular,   they   could

achieve the Pareto optimum by precommitting to set              mm*0.9




  The sequential character of the game is not crucial for the result
  that cooperation belongs to central banks' dominant strategy.   The
  same result holds when the four players decide simultaneously, and the
  two central banks set the money stock taking nominal wages as given.
  In the specific model used in this paper, the subgame perfect
  equilibrium of the sequential game and the Nash equilibrium of the
  game in which all players decide simultaneously coincide.   This is due
  to the particular form of the unions' loss function. If we modify
  this loss function (for instance including the domestic CPI among the
  unions' targets), the two equilibria would not coincide, sltough it
  would still be true that cooperation belongs to central banks'
  dominsnt strategy.

3.b A stochastic world

        We now compute the subgame perfect equilibrium of the international

policy game allowing for stochastic real shocks.                            In the presence of a

common productivity shock,                  x,   in the two countries, the reduced form of

the model in period        1   is:

        Central   bankers maximize their payoff function given domestic wages

and the above constraints. We consider again two regimes: cooperation
and non cooperation.           In the case of non cooperation, the outcome of the

game and the payoffs of central banks are respectively:


(33)                           n       =    [ak-(m+8)(w+x)J/[a+m(m+8))

                                                                             V°8

        If the two central banks decide to cooperate and form a coalition,

the Nash bargaining outcome and the central banks'                           payoffs are instead:

        The comparison of the central banks' payoffs in the two regimes
proves the following result:

Proposition    2:   Each central bank achieves a larger payoff in the

presence of international cooperation, whatever the wage set by the
domestic union in period zero, and whatever the productivity shock

occurring in period      1.

 For example, following a positive realization of x (i.e. when output is
 negatively affected by the productivity shock), employment falls and the
 CPI    rises.
     Notice however that, contrary to the deterministic
                                                        case, even if
central banks could precommitt not to cooperate, the
                                                     resulting
equilibrium would no longer be unambiguously superior to the
                                                             cooperative
outcome (45)-(46).  If, in period 0, central banks committ
                                                           themselves
not to cooperate, the equilibrium outcome
                                          of the game and the central
banks' payofs are respectively:

     It is easy to show that employment is
                                           higher when unions expect
central banks to cooperate, and central
                                        banks indeed cooperate, than in
                                              19


the case where unions expect central banks not to cooperate, and they do

not cooperate.     In contrast,       the CPI is lower in this latter case.              The

welfare comparison therefore depends on central banks                    preferences.
Some algebra shows that VCC8 >         OO          iff:



(52)            xe[2(n+a2)(o+s(+e))ak - xome(m+efl/A + B < 0


where A     e(o+s2)(a+8)[o+c(e+e)]2, and B                   2k2B(2m+8)/m2(m+8).

The non cooperative outcome is unambiguously superior to the cooperative
outcome only if the productivity shock is contained in an interval that
                               10
lies in a neighborhood of x=0.
       For x relatively large,        the extensive form of the game can be

written as:

4. Concluding remarks

       The paper has studied international policy coordination in a world

where the incentive to run beggar—thy—neighbor policies arises from the

inefficiency that characterizes, within each country, the interaction
between wage—setters and the central hank.       We have shown that if

central banks can decide, period by period, and after having observed

wages and real shocks, whether or not to form international coalitions,
the only subgame perfect equilibrium is the cooperative equilibrium.

However, if real shocks are "small",       the equilibrium outcome is

dominated by the outcome that would obtain if central banks could

precommitt not to form coalitions.        If one wished to interpret this
result as suggestive of whether central banks should be prevented from

forming international coalitions, the choice would depend on the
variance of real shocks, relative to the inefficiency associated with
central banks' incentive to affect real variables es—post.       The

condition is:



(53)             var(x) <   (o)k2


   As in the deterministic case, the result that cooperation is the
   dominant strategy in the second stage of the game is robust with
   respect to different specifications of unions' loss functions, and
   holds even when the players decide simultaneously. In the latter
   case, however, the presence of a stochastic shock would be
   irrelevant. The assumption that unions do not observe the shock
   makes the presence of stochastic disturbances relevant and justifies
   the sequential structure of the game.

where:




the smaller is the incentive to be 'time—inconsistent——i.e. the larger

are k and a——the smaller is the range of shocks for which a

precommitment not to cooperate is optimal.   If the probability of large

real shocks is high, restricting central banks from forming

international coalitions would yield Pareto-inferior outc.unes.    But even

if such probability were sufficiently small, the optimal rule would not

prevent central banks from forming international coalitions, but would
restrict their ability to create surprise inflation.   The bottom line is
that international cooperation is either unavoidable, because it is the

only suhgame perfect equilibrium in the absence of precommitment, or

irrelevant, because the "optimal" precommitment eliminates the need for
international cooperation.
     We conclude that one has to look for explanations other than

nominal contracts to argue that international policy coordination may be

counterproductive. One direction is to increase the number of players
in the game.   Suppose that two authorities coexist in each country: a
fiscal and a monetary authority.   If fiscal and monetary policy

decisions are simultaneous, non cooperation between the two domestic

authorities may render international cooperation among central bankers

counterproductive. This would not be true if fiscal policy, like
nominal wages, were set before monetary policy.   The same argument would
hold if we dropped the assumption of competitive firms.   In
                                   97


oligopolistic markets   firms can form coalitions that may be threatened

by other players in the game.   Finally,   international cooperation may be

counterproductive in a world with many countries of similar size if only
a subset of countries agrees to cooperate. In all these cases the

general result stated in the Introduction can be applied: the outcome of
a game when only a subset of players    cooperate may be dominated by the
non cooperative outcome.
