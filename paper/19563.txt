                                              ABSTRACT

Most private sector workers with employer-provided health insurance have a strong incentive to continue
working until Medicare eligibility in order to maintain group health coverage. However, most government
employees have access to retiree health coverage, which allows them access to group health coverage
even if they retire before Medicare eligibility. We study the impact of retiree health coverage on the
probability of stopping work among public sector workers between the ages of 55 and 64. We find
that, for state and local government employees, retiree health coverage raises the probability of stopping
work by 5.1 percentage points (around 28 percent) between ages 60 and 64. However, we find no evidence
that retiree health coverage influences state and local employees’ decisions to stop work at ages 55-59,
or that such coverage has an effect on the probability of stopping work for federal and military employees.

    I.       Introduction

         Public sector budgets have come under increasing pressure in recent years, mainly due to

the escalating cost of providing pension and health benefits to retirees. This financial burden is

exacerbated by the fact that many public sector pension plans contain strong incentives to retire

early, often well before age 65. In addition, public sector employers usually provide employees

with retiree health insurance, which allows former employees who meet certain age and service

requirements to participate in a group health plan. Retiree health insurance can facilitate early

retirement, thereby enhancing the effects of the retirement incentives in pension plans. As group

health insurance is typically available only through employment, most individuals with

employer-provided health coverage have an incentive to delay retirement until Medicare

eligibility – at age 65 – in order to maintain health care coverage.1 According to the Kaiser

Family Foundation (2013), among large firms providing employer-sponsored coverage, just over

a quarter also provide retiree coverage, and that fraction has fallen sharply over time. However,

workers who are eligible for retiree health coverage – including most public sector employees –

can maintain group coverage even if they retire before Medicare eligibility.

         In this paper, we examine the impact of retiree health coverage on the retirement

decisions of public sector employees.2 Because retirement is difficult to measure directly, in our

empirical analysis, we use exit from a career job as a proxy for retirement. That is, we study

whether generous retiree health insurance is associated with an increased pre-Medicare job exit

rate among public sector employees with 5 or more years of job tenure. We model the

probability of stopping work at ages 55-64 as a function of the generosity of retiree health

1
  In principle, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) allows workers to retire at age 63½
by giving them the right to them to buy into their former employer’s group health plan. However, while COBRA
gives workers access to group rates, it typically does not include an employer contribution.

  Retiree health coverage may also reduce the need to save for retirement. A related paper (Clark and Mitchell 2013)
examines the impact of retiree health coverage on the saving decisions of public sector workers.

                                                                                                                   1
coverage, as well as controls for demographics, health, job characteristics, work history, and

pension plan retirement incentives. We focus on the decision to stop work before the age of 65

because retiree health coverage is most valuable for retirees in this group. Typically, a public

sector retiree health plan is the primary payer for pre-Medicare eligible retirees. When a retiree

becomes eligible for Medicare, however, he or she is required to enroll in Medicare, relying on

the retiree health plan only as a secondary payer (Clark and Morrill 2010).

       To preview our results, we find that retiree health coverage raises the probability of

stopping work for state and local employees by 5.1 percentage points (around 28 percent)

between the ages of 60 and 64. This effect is somewhat larger than for private sector employees.

We find no evidence that retiree health coverage influences decision to stop work for federal and

military employees. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a link between retiree health coverage

and stopping work for public sector employees aged 55-59.

       In the near future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will allow all individuals to purchase

group health insurance on state-run exchanges. In addition, many individuals will receive

subsidies towards their health insurance purchases. Because the exchanges make group health

insurance available outside of employment, the ACA effectively provides all individuals with

retiree health insurance. Thus, both public and private employers offering retiree health

coverage will find that the compensation packages they offer are less attractive to workers. In

response, we might expect to see state and local governments increase monetary compensation

for their employees while dropping retiree health coverage.

       The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a summary of the

prior research on retiree health insurance and retirement and an overview of public sector retiree

health plans. Section III describes our data and methodology. Section IV presents our results.



                                                                                                     2
Section V discusses the policy implications of our results in light of the ACA. Section VI

concludes.



   II.       Prior Research on Health Insurance and Retirement

         The vast majority of public sector workers are covered by retiree health plans, which

allow them to purchase group health insurance after retirement. A number of studies have

examined the provisions of these plans. Federal employees continue to participate in the Federal

Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program when they retire (U.S. Office of Personnel

Management 2013), and retirees receive the same employer contribution as current employees.

The FEHB program provides access to a range of different health plans, and in most cases, the

federal government contributes either 72 percent of the overall weighted average premium, or 75

percent of premium of the chosen plan, whichever is smaller. At the state and local levels, the

provisions of public sector retiree health plans – for example, employer contributions, co-pays,

and deductibles – vary considerably (see e.g., Clark and Morrill 2010; GAO 2007; Clark,

Morrill, and Riche 2011). Within each public sector health plan, deductibles, co-pays, and the

employer contribution rate are often adjusted from year to year depending on health care costs

and the plan’s finances. In recent years, many plans have become less generous along these

dimensions (see e.g., Franzel and Brown 2012).

         In principle, the availability of retiree health coverage makes it easier for workers to

retire prior to Medicare eligibility. Thus, we would expect to observe higher job exit rates or

lower labor force participation among retiree-health eligible workers in their late 50s and early

60s. Indeed, prior studies of retiree health coverage have found such a relationship. These studies

typically take one of three approaches. The first approach is to use a structural life cycle model to



                                                                                                    3
simulate retirement behavior both with and without retiree health coverage. Studies taking this

approach include Blau and Gilleskie (2006, 2008), Gustman and Steinmeier (1994), Lumsdaine

Stock and Wise (1996), and French and Jones (2011). A second approach is to use micro-data to

directly estimate the impact of retiree health coverage on retirement. This is the approach taken

by Blau and Gilleskie (2001), Kapur and Rogowski (2011), Marton and Woodbury (2007),

Karoly and Rogowski (1994), Robinson and Clark (2010), Strumpf (2010), Madrian (1994),

Mulvey and Nyce (2004), Marton and Woodbury (2013), Leiserson (2013), and Nyce et al.

(2013). These studies typically find larger effects than those based on structural models. Finally,

Gruber and Madrian (1995) adopt a third approach based on aggregate state-level data. During

the 1970s and 1980s, a number of states, as well as the federal government, adopted

“continuation of coverage” requirements that allowed workers to continue to participate in their

employers’ group health plans after leaving employment. Using variation in these laws across

states and time, they find that continuation of coverage requirements reduced the labor force

participation rate of pre-Medicare workers.

       These earlier studies focus primarily on the retirement behavior of private sector workers.

While some public sector workers may have been included in the samples analyzed, they are not

the focus of the analysis and most likely constitute a small fraction of the sample. One exception

is Leiserson (2013), who finds that eligibility for retiree health insurance increases the

probability of job exit for Pennsylvania state employees. Studies that focus on public sector

workers are valuable in light of the large role that retiree health insurance plays in public sector

budget shortfalls. Our paper contributes in this area by studying the relationship between retiree

health insurance and job exit decisions for a broad sample of public sector workers.




                                                                                                       4
          Retiree health insurance may have a stronger effect for public sector workers because

these individuals also have access to relatively generous defined benefit (DB) pensions. On the

other hand, the value of public sector retiree health insurance may be diminished by the

uncertainty surrounding the finances of these programs. Public sector retiree health plans have

accrued large unfunded liabilities in recent years. For example, a recent survey of 61 cities’

retiree health plans reveals total liabilities of $126 billion with assets of only $8 billion (Pew

Charitable Trusts 2013). For state governments, another recent study reports unfunded liabilities

of $627 billion for fiscal year 2010 (Pew Center on the States 2012). In response to these

shortfalls, a number of public sector employers have made changes to their retiree health plans,

making them less generous. And, a survey of state retiree health plan administrators suggests that

these individuals expect further tightening of eligibility requirements and reductions employer

contributions in the future (Clark and Morrill 2010). This uncertainty about future benefits is

likely to reduce the responsiveness of retirement decisions to retiree health coverage.



   III.      Data and Methodology

          We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in our analysis. The HRS is a

biennial panel survey that is intended to be representative of older Americans. We restrict our

sample to four cohorts in the HRS: the original HRS group that entered the survey in 1992, the

War Baby and the Children of Depression groups that entered the survey in 1998, and the Early

Baby Boomer group that entered the survey in 2004. For each of these groups, we define the

baseline year as the year in which the group entered the survey. We drop all individuals who do

not respond to the survey, or who respond via a proxy, in the baseline wave. We also drop

individuals with less than 5 years of service on their current job as of the baseline wave.



                                                                                                     5
Individuals with 5 or more years of service are more likely to be eligible for retiree health

insurance. Moreover, these individuals can be considered career employees, for whom stopping

work is more likely to represent retirement rather than a job change.

         Most of the variables used in our analysis – including demographic information, work

history, net wealth, self-reported health, earnings, employer and retiree health coverage, pension

coverage, occupation, and industry – come from the RAND version of the HRS, and they are

collected at the respondent’s baseline wave. Earnings and wealth are converted to 2004 dollars

using the consumer price index (CPI) in the respondent’s baseline interview year.3 Net wealth

includes checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, bonds, stocks, mutual funds,

IRAs, Keogh accounts, housing, vehicles, businesses, and any other savings less debt. This value

is Winsorized at the 0.5 percent level to avoid influential outliers. To track job exits, we also use

information on work status (whether an individual is doing any work for pay) and age in

subsequent interviews. We merge information from the raw HRS on current and prior public

sector employment. In particular, we define an individual as a current state or local employee if

the individual is working for a state or local government as of the baseline interview. We employ

a similar definition to identify current federal and military employees.4 Remaining employees are

divided into two groups: private sector employees (who report no prior public sector

employment) and private sector employees with a public past (who report prior public sector

employment). We drop individuals who cannot be classified into these employment categories

due to missing data.

  We use the CPI Research Series Using Current Methods (CPI-U-RS), available at
http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiursfe1978_2012.pdf.
4
  A few individuals report multiple kinds of public employment – e.g., state/local and federal. We classify
individuals as federal employees if they report any current federal employment, as state/local employees if they
report current state/local but not federal employment, and as military if they report current military but not current
federal or state/local employment.

                                                                                                                         6
        Individuals are classified into several categories according to their retiree health

insurance and employer health insurance coverage in the baseline wave:

        (1) Individuals with no employer health insurance

        (2) Individuals with employer health insurance but no retiree health insurance

        (3) Private sector employees with employer and retiree health insurance

        (4) Federal or military employees with employer and retiree health insurance

        (5) State or local employees with employer and retiree health insurance

We drop all individuals who cannot be classified into one of these five groups due to missing

information. Theory predicts that individuals in groups (3)-(5) should have a higher departure

rate than individuals in group (2).

        In estimating the impact of retiree health coverage on retirement, it is important to control

properly for retirement incentives in employer-sponsored pension plans. Failing to do so may

inflate the measured impact of retiree health coverage on retirement. More generous pension

coverage is likely to be correlated with the presence of retiree health coverage, and to induce

early retirement through the wealth effect. Our measure of net wealth described above does not

include employer-sponsored pension wealth. However, data on pension wealth are available as a

researcher-contributed supplement to the HRS (Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai 2012). This

dataset includes a measure of total pension wealth, including defined contribution (DC) wealth

and the expected present value of DB wealth, for each respondent. The measure is based on

individuals’ self-reports of pension wealth and expected pension income in the HRS, and it

covers both current and previous jobs.5 We match each respondent to his or her pension wealth,

converted to 2004 dollars using the CPI in the baseline wave interview year.


5
 Pension wealth includes DC plan balances from the respondent’s current and prior jobs, the present value of
anticipated benefits from the respondent’s most important DB plan on the current job (prorated to the time of

                                                                                                                7
         In addition to the possible wealth effect of pensions, individuals who participate in

defined benefit pensions often face strong early retirement incentives resulting from the pattern

of benefit accrual. A drop in pension accrual is equivalent to a cut in wages and creates an

incentive to retire. Ideally, we would want to control for the change in defined benefit pension

wealth from continuing to work at any particular age.6 In the absence of such a measure, we

utilize an alternative approach. Typically, DB plans allow individuals to collect an actuarially

reduced benefit at the early retirement age and a “full” retirement benefit at the normal

retirement age. As discussed by Kotlikoff and Wise (1987), DB plans often incentivize job exit

at the early retirement age, and the incentive to leave grows even stronger at the normal

retirement age. The raw HRS data include self-reports of early and normal retirement ages for

respondents’ DB plans. We use the self-reports that are made in the baseline wave to determine

the retirement incentives an individual is likely to face at any given age following the baseline

wave.7

         Another issue of concern is the possibility of selection on unobservables into jobs that

offer retiree health coverage. For example, individuals with a stronger preference for leisure

(who tend to retire earlier) may select into certain jobs, and these jobs may tend to offer retiree

health coverage as employees are more likely to value it (see French and Jones 2011). While it is

not possible to fully address this concern within the constraints of our data, excluding individuals

with less than 5 years of service minimizes the chances that the individuals in our dataset


interview), and the present value of anticipated benefits from DB plans in prior jobs. We replaced the pension
wealth values for a handful of individuals in our sample with revised values provided by the creators of the pension
wealth dataset.
6
  Blau and Gilleskie (2008) are able to construct such a measure for the HRS by matching individuals to restricted
employer-provided pension plan information. However, we do not have access to these data.
7
  For some individuals, the reported early retirement age is above the normal retirement age. In these instances, we
set the early retirement age equal to the normal retirement age. If the early retirement age is missing and the normal
retirement age is not, we again set the early retirement age equal to the normal retirement age. In either case, we are
implicitly assuming that early retirement is unavailable.

                                                                                                                      8
explicitly chose their jobs because of the retiree health coverage. Individuals who are more than

5 years away from retirement are less likely to think about retiree health coverage in evaluating

their compensation package.

         We perform our main analysis at the person-wave level, and we use person-wave

observations in which the respondent’s age is between 55 and 64. As we cannot directly observe

retirement, the dependent variable in our analysis is an indicator for stopping work. It takes on

the value of zero if the respondent was working for pay in the previous wave and continues to

work for pay in the current wave. It takes on the value of 1 if the respondent was working for

pay in the previous wave and is no longer working for pay in the current wave. It is missing in

all other cases. We utilize only the first job exit for each respondent, dropping all subsequent

observations for a respondent after this occurs. Obviously stopping work does not always imply

retirement, as individuals may restart work later. However, we would expect it to be highly

correlated with retirement among the subset of people with at least 5 years of job tenure; that is,

departure from a career job in one’s late 50s or early 60s is highly likely to imply retirement.8

For each person-wave observation with a current age between 55 and 59, we construct a set of

DB pension status indicators that assign each person-year observation to one of the following

categories:9



8
  Job tenure is based on a respondent’s job in the baseline wave. It is possible for an individual to switch jobs
between the baseline wave and a future wave, while remaining employed at the time of interview in all intervening
waves. If this occurs, our dependent variable would register a job exit when the individual leaves the new job, rather
than the job held in the baseline wave. However, we would expect such occurrences to be relatively rare.
9
  The 1992 and 1998 waves of the HRS allow individuals to report information for up to three current employer-
sponsored retirement plans (either DB or DC). The 2004 wave allows individuals to report information for up to four
plans. The RAND HRS contains a relatively clean indicator for whether each reported plan is a DB, DC, or
combination plan. We code an individual as not covered by a DB pension if none of the reported plans are DB or
combination plans. We code an individual as eligible for a full retirement if he or she has reached the normal
retirement age for any of the plans that are coded as DB or combination plans. We code an individual as eligible for
an early retirement if he or she is not eligible for a full retirement benefit and has reached the early retirement age
for any of the plans that are coded as DB or combination plans. We code an individual as ineligible if he or she has
not reached the early eligibility age in any of the plans that are coded as DB or combination plans. Finally, we

                                                                                                                     9
        (1) Individual is not covered by a DB pension on the current job in the baseline wave.

        (2) Individual is covered by a DB pension on the current job in the baseline wave, but is

             not eligible for an early retirement benefit.

        (3) Individual is covered by a DB pension on the current job in the baseline wave, and is

             eligible for an early, but not full, retirement benefit.

        (4) Individual is covered by a DB pension on the current job in the baseline wave, and is

             eligible for a full retirement benefit.

Relative to group (1), we would expect to see higher departure rates among individuals in groups

(3) and (4) as a result of the retirement incentives in DB plans.

        Table 1 shows summary statistics for all the variables used in our analysis (except for the

occupational and industrial categories), for both the full sample and for public sector employees.

Compared to the full sample, public sector employees are more likely to be female and nonwhite,

and to have a college degree. They are more likely to have employer-provided health insurance,

retiree health insurance, and a defined benefit pension. Public sector employees tend to have

greater pension wealth and lower total (non-pension) assets. They are less likely to report fair or

poor health status. Finally, their earnings and years of service are slightly higher than those of

private sector workers.

        We estimate logit models in which the dependent variable is our indicator for stopping

work. The key independent variables are a set of indicators for employer and retiree health

coverage, as defined earlier. We would expect the effect of retiree health to vary with age. For

example, one might expect retiree health coverage to have a stronger effect at age 62, when

individuals become eligible to claim a Social Security benefit. Ideally, we would want to interact


construct a separate indicator for individuals who report DB or combination plan coverage but have an
undetermined eligibility status due to missing information.

                                                                                                        10
the retiree health indicators with a set of single-year age dummies, allowing their effects to vary

with age in the most flexible way possible. However, the number of public sector employees

with retiree health coverage at each single year of age is quite small. For state and local

employees, there are typically less than 350 observations at each age, and for federal and military

employees, there are typically fewer than 100 observations at each age. Thus, we cannot expect

to estimate, with a satisfactory degree of precision, the impact of public sector retiree health

insurance at each single year of age. To address this problem, we construct two broad age

dummies – one indicating an age between 55 and 59, and another indicating an age between 60

and 64. We interact these broad age dummies with the retiree health coverage indicators. We

also control for gender, race and ethnicity, education, marital status, number of children, fair or

poor self-reported health status, pension wealth, defined benefit pension status interacted with

the broad age dummies, a set of occupation dummies (based on the broad occupation categories

in the restricted HRS), a set of industry dummies, earnings and its square, years of service and its

square, total assets and its square, and a set of wave dummies. In our first set of regressions, we

include all person-wave observations. Next, we estimate the same set of regressions using only

observations on public sector employees. We cluster standard errors at the household level

throughout.

           Table 2 shows the effect of retiree health coverage at ages 55-59, and at ages 60-64, for

all employees. The coefficients reported in this table are marginal effects.10 The first two

columns report results for a specification with no controls for personal and job characteristics, or

for pension wealth and status. That is, the only independent variables are the retiree health

coverage indicators interacted with broad age dummies. The second two columns report the

results for a specification that includes controls for personal and job characteristics, but no

controls for pension wealth and DB pension status. Finally, the last two columns include all

controls, including personal and job characteristics, pension wealth, and DB pension status. For

this specification, we also report the coefficients on DB pension status. The last two rows of the

table show the job exit rate at each age for the omitted categories of health insurance and DB

status – that is, for individuals with employer-provided health insurance and no retiree coverage,

and for individuals with no DB coverage.

       The results in the final two columns (our preferred specification with all the controls)

suggest that retiree health coverage is associated with a significantly greater probability of

stopping work at ages 60-64 for both state and local, and private sector employees. However,

there is no evidence that retiree health coverage influences the job exit decisions of federal or

military employees. The lack of a statistically significant effect for this group may be due to the

small number of observations on federal and military employees. To be more specific, for state

and local employees, retiree health coverage raises the probability of stopping work by 5.1

percentage points (around 28 percent) at ages 60-64. This effect is somewhat larger than for

private sector employees. Among private sector employees, retiree health coverage raises the job

exit rate by 3.3 percentage points (around 18 percent) at ages 60-64. However, we find little

evidence that retiree health coverage has an effect on the retirement decisions of either public or

private sector employees at ages 55-59. (The effect of retiree health coverage is insignificant for

public sector employees and only significant at the 10 percent level for private sector

employees.) Interestingly, a lack of employer provided health insurance increases the probability



                                                                                                    12
of stopping work (by 3.7 percentage points) at ages 55-59. This result is not surprising.

Individuals who lack employer-provided coverage are similar to those with retiree coverage in

the sense that they are not waiting for Medicare to retire.

        Comparing the results in the last two columns of the table with those in the first four

columns indicates the importance of controlling for pension wealth and incentives. Controlling

for pension wealth and DB pension status reduces the measured effect of retiree health coverage

at ages 60-64 by about 1.5 percentage points for private sector employees and by almost 3

percentage points for state and local employees. In addition, it reduces the statistical significance

of retiree health coverage among the younger age group. The coefficients on the DB status

indicators in the last two columns have the expected signs. Eligibility for an early retirement

significantly raises the probability of stopping work among the older age group. Eligibility for a

full retirement has an even stronger effect in both the younger and older age groups. Finally,

being ineligible for benefits reduces the probability of stopping work. That is not surprising.

Compared to the omitted group of individuals with no DB coverage, those with DB coverage

who are ineligible for benefits may be incentivized to work longer to continue to accrue, and to

qualify for, benefits.

        Table 3 presents the results from estimating the same model with single-year age

categories, rather than the broad age categories in Table 2. For state and local employees, the

effects of retiree health coverage appear to be concentrated at ages 61 and 64. For private sector

employees, they appear to be concentrated at age 60. However, we would not give too much

weight to these single-year age effects. As discussed in the previous section, the small number of

observations in each age-by-retiree health coverage cell does not allow us to estimate the single-

year age coefficients with much precision. We note, however, that the signs of the coefficients on



                                                                                                   13
retiree health coverage are positive at almost all ages. This outcome is unlikely if the true values

of these coefficients are all zero.

         Table 4 presents the same results as the last two columns of Table 2, but using only

observations on public sector employees. Because many of the occupational and industrial

categories are sparse for this subsample, we exclude these controls from the regression. The

results for state and local workers are similar to those in Table 2, suggesting that retiree health

coverage raises the probability of stopping work by 5.3 percentage points (around 29 percent) at

ages 60-64, but has no statistically significant effect at ages 55-59. Again, there is no evidence

that retiree health coverage raises the probability of stopping work for federal and military

employees, possibly due to the small number of observations in this category. One caveat applies

to the results in this table. The fact that the vast majority of public sector employees are covered

by retiree health insurance raises some questions about the composition of the comparison group

with no retiree health coverage. These individuals may be part-time employees or contractors, or

they may simply be unaware that they have retiree health coverage. In the latter case, one might

expect these workers to behave as though they did not have retiree health coverage.



    V.      Policy Implications

         The labor supply faced by employers, both in terms of the quality and quantity of labor

offered in the market, depends on the overall attractiveness of the jobs that they offer. This

attractiveness, in turn, depends on an entire vector of job attributes. Certainly, at the top of the

list is the compensation offered, but compensation includes both salary and benefits, with

benefits including retirement plans, health insurance, retiree health insurance, and other

considerations such as vacation accruals. Job attractiveness also depends on such things as



                                                                                                       14
working conditions and job security. Traditionally, public sector jobs feature strong benefit

packages including defined benefit pensions, job security, and good health insurance coverage.

We have focused here on retiree health programs, which are nearly universal for public sector

workers, but which have become increasingly uncommon in the private sector.

       The fact that public sector jobs offer relatively strong benefit packages allows them to

offer somewhat lower salaries and still compete in the overall job attractiveness that determines

labor supply. To simplify, public sector employment is characterized by high job security, strong

retirement (pension) and health benefits, and lower salary levels than are commonplace for jobs

with similar human capital requirements. People sort themselves out by their own tastes for job

security and benefits. In particular, individuals who are more risk averse and have lower rates of

time preference are more likely to appreciate the characteristics of state and local employment.

       The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 will alter the equilibrium between state and

local employment and comparable private sector labor markets. By weakening the link between

employment and health insurance, the ACA reduces or eliminates the value of one of the key

benefits in the public sector employment package – the retiree health insurance benefit. The

reason that the value is reduced or eliminated is that workers will get this benefit or a similar

benefit whether they work in this sector or not. Public sector jobs will become relatively less

attractive unless employers adjust some other dimension of the employment package,

presumably salary levels. We elaborate on these changes below.

       The ACA of 2010 breaks the connection between employment and health insurance for

many Americans, including, in particular, those who retire early before becoming eligible for

Medicare at 65. Beginning in 2014, every American will be able to buy health insurance through

state-based exchanges. These purchases will be subsidized on a sliding scale for anyone whose



                                                                                                    15
income is below 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). The subsidies cover the majority

of Americans, including most people who retire in their 50s and 60s. To give an example of the

income levels that qualify for subsidies, note that the FPL in 2013 is $11,490 for single people

and $15,510 for married couples. Since the subsidies extend up to 400 percent of the FPL, that

means in 2014 they will extend to $46,879 for single individuals and $63,280 for married

couples, assuming a two-percent cost of living adjustment in the FPL for 2014. The sliding scale

of subsidies for health insurance purchases made through the state exchanges is shown in Table

5. These premiums apply to the purchase of the second lowest cost offering in the “silver plan

category.” The silver plan category is a set of plans which cover approximately 70 percent of the

total cost of medical care.

       The net effect of offering subsidized health insurance through the exchanges is similar for

many Americans to offering retiree health insurance independent of work history. Consider a

60-year old single woman who decides to retire. Assume that she has worked in the private

sector for a company that did not offer retiree health benefits. However, if she has retirement

income of 250 percent of the 2014 FPL for single individuals (about $29,300 which may come

from either 401(k) withdrawals or a defined benefit pension plan), then she can obtain health

insurance through the exchange for 8.05% of her income, $2,490 per year or $207.53 per month.

This premium is well under half the cost of the insurance, so this is a heavily subsidized policy.

If her retirement income were instead only $23,440 (two times the FPL), then her premium cost

would be 6.3 percent of her income, or $123 per month. In either case, this woman effectively

has a very generous retiree health insurance package through the ACA initiated health exchange

system. When such coverage becomes universal in 2014, this will reduce or eliminate the value




                                                                                                   16
of retiree health benefits for state and local jobs. Relative to private sector employment, public

sector jobs will no longer have better benefits, at least in this one dimension.

         Public sector employers will have a couple of choices in how to respond to the ACA. If

they do nothing, their labor supply pool will deteriorate in terms of the size and quality of the

applicant pool. Public sector jobs will simply become less attractive relative to their private

sector counterparts. Governments could respond by raising salaries to restore their net

attractiveness in the labor market. They might decide to eliminate retiree health benefits and use

the money saved to finance the higher salaries. In fact, it would seem inefficient for

governments to spend money on retiree health benefits when similar policies are available

universally on the exchanges created by the ACA. The point here is not to predict exactly what

the governments will do, but simply to point out that the ACA will reduce the net attractiveness

of public sector jobs and unless there is a compensating adjustment, the quality of public sector

workers will suffer in the long run.



   VI.      Conclusions

    This paper adds to the evidence that employer-sponsored retiree health insurance programs

lead to higher job exit rates among 60-64 year olds. In this sense, the results of this paper are

generally consistent with our earlier findings on employers in the private sector (Nyce et. al.

2013). There are several data limitations in the current paper. First, very few public sector

workers do not have retiree health benefits, making it more difficult to estimate the effect of

coverage within this group. Second, our measures of the retirement incentives in public sector

defined benefit pension plans are not as detailed as one would like. Finally, we are unable to

control fully for possible selection into jobs that offer retiree health coverage based on



                                                                                                    17
unobservable characteristics. Overall, however, we find the evidence convincing that retiree

health plans have a significant and large impact on the probability of stopping work between

ages 60 and 64 in both the private and public sectors.

    Given the growing evidence that retiree health programs lead to earlier retirement, it is

interesting to note that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 offers what amounts to universal

retiree health. Under the ACA, beginning in 2014, all retirees under 65 will be able to purchase

group health coverage through the state-based exchanges, and those purchases will be subsidized

for all whose income in retirement is below 400 percent of the official poverty standard. The

research on retiree health programs, including this paper, suggests that the ACA will lead to

earlier retirements, particularly for those in the private sector who currently do not have access to

group health insurance in retirement before age 65.

    The second ramification of the ACA is that it worsens the competitiveness of state and local

public sector jobs relative to private sector jobs without retiree health benefits. It does so by

making one of the benefits of public employment universally available. Our speculation is that

many state and local employers will drop retiree health benefits as a result. It makes little sense

to continue paying for something that many employees can get anyway (through the exchanges).

However, dropping retiree health benefits will not necessarily improve the budget pressures on

state and local governments, as the ACA worsens the relative attractiveness of state and local

jobs. In order to restore the overall attractiveness of these jobs and therefore maintain the quality

and quantity of applicant pools, some other job attribute – most likely salary – will have to be

improved.
