                                           ABSTRACT

Living wage campaigns have succeeded in about 100 jurisdictions in the United States but have also

been unsuccessful in numerous cities. These unsuccessful campaigns provide a better control group

or counterfactual for estimating the effects of living wage laws than the broader set of all cities

without a law, and also permit the separate estimation of the effects of living wage laws and living

wage campaigns. We find that living wage laws raise wages of low-wage workers but reduce

employment among the least-skilled, especially when the laws cover business assistance recipients

or are accompanied by similar laws in nearby cities.

1. Introduction

        The number of cities, counties, and school districts with living wage ordinances across the United

States has swelled to nearly 100. Living wage laws have three central features. First, they impose a wage

floor that is higher—and often much higher—than traditional federal and state minimum wages. Second,

living wage levels are often explicitly pegged to the wage level needed for a family with one full-time,

year-round worker to reach the federal poverty line. Typical living wage levels as of December 2002

(when our sample period ends) were $8.17 (Los Angeles), $9.05 (Detroit), and $10.25 (Boston). Third,

coverage by living wage ordinances is highly restricted. Frequently, cities impose wage floors only on

companies under contract (generally including non-profits) with the city. Other cities also impose the

wage floor on companies receiving business assistance from the city, in almost every case in addition to

coverage of city contractors. Finally, a much smaller number of cities also require that municipal

employees receive a legislated living wage. Previous estimates have found that living wage laws increase

the wages of low-wage workers. On the flip side, however, there are negative employment effects on

workers at the low end of the skill distribution (Neumark and Adams [1] and [2]; Adams and Neumark

[3]).

        In most cases, living wage laws were preceded by vigorous living wage campaigns. In fact, many

cities in the United States that do not have living wage laws have experienced campaigns to try to get

living wage legislation enacted. In some cities living wage campaigns took things quite far before

ultimately failing or being derailed because of a court ruling, state legislative action, a negative city

council vote, a mayoral veto, or even non-enforcement following enactment. Although living wage

campaigns vary in magnitude and intensity, it typically takes a considerable effort for a living wage

campaign to reach the point where it fails or is derailed for one of the reasons just given. In addition, the

strongest campaigns often entail some degree of organization and mobilization among low-wage workers

and their advocates, and heightened public discussion of the plight of low-wage workers. A prime

example is provided by the case of the Los Angeles living wage movement, which overlapped with the




                                                       1
“Justice for Janitors” campaign.1 Thus, the momentum for change that begins with a living wage

movement might ultimately result in changes in wage setting norms and firm behavior, even if no

legislation ultimately results. Wages might be increased in response to public pressure or the greater

organizing of low-skill labor. This, however, may in turn lead to lower employment as individual

employers respond to the higher wages.

        Aside from this substantive interest in the impact of living wage campaigns, the cities that

experience vigorous but unsuccessful living wage campaigns provide a potentially valuable source of

information for obtaining more compelling estimates of the effects of living wage laws than we have

obtained in our previous research. First, as is standard in the types of difference-in-differences estimation

strategies that we have used, the control group for the statistical experiment involved in estimating the

effects of living wage laws is the set of cities in which a living wage law has never passed. But this

approach only reliably uncovers the causal effects of living wage laws if the ceteris paribus assumption

holds—that is, if all else is equal in the treatment and control groups except for the passage of the living

wage law. While this is likely to hold if living wage laws and campaigns arise randomly, and if living

campaigns either have no independent effect or always succeed, neither of these conditions is likely to

hold in practice. If living wages are passed in cities that are undergoing changes in outcomes for low-

wage or low-skill workers—perhaps because cities endogenously choose to enact living wages based in

part on these changes, or living wage campaigns arise in part in response to them—then the overall set of

cities not passing living wage laws may not serve as an adequate control group. Second, if living wage

campaigns generate some of their own effects, then it is only the experience of cities that enact (and

enforce) living wage laws relative to the experiences of cities with failed or derailed living wage

campaigns that reveal the effects of living wage laws that are independent of the effects of living wage

campaigns.

campaigns.


                                                         2
        For both of these reasons, this paper pursues the strategy of using the narrower set of cities with

failed or derailed living wage campaigns as the control group for estimating the effects of living wage

laws. Clearly these cities are not identical to cities with living wages, because ultimately a living wage

law was not enacted. But they seem likely to be far more similar in terms of whatever underlying changes

may have been associated with a vigorous living wage campaign arising, in which case they provide a

better counterfactual for estimating the independent effects of living wage laws. In addition, the cities

with failed or derailed living wage campaigns can be used to obtain independent estimates of the effects

of living wage campaigns per se, based on comparisons to cities with no campaigns.

        Although this paper is specifically concerned with the effects of living wage laws, it also

addresses the more general issue of the estimation of the effects of policy changes. In innumerable

contexts, researchers estimating the effects of policy changes on outcomes have to grapple with questions

of different underlying trends in jurisdictions where the policy changes were and were not enacted, or in

periods before or after the policy change, which may confound estimation of the effects of the policy

change. A few examples are the effects of affirmative action (Smith and Welch [6]), workers’

compensation deregulation (Thomason et al. [7]), minimum wages (Burkhauser et al. [8]), and welfare

reform (Bitler et al. [9]). But accounting for trend differences typically requires some form of functional

form restriction—such as different trends in the treatment and control group that are restricted to be

linear. For example, in the context of panel data over time on geographic regions such as cities or states,

and a single discrete policy change that “turns on” at some point during the sample period, we cannot

include separate time dummy variables for the treatment and control groups, since these would be

perfectly collinear with the policy change. An alternative approach is to identify a group that is

unaffected by the policy change but reflects the same underlying trends as the affected group, leading to a

difference-in-difference-in-differences estimator (Gruber [10]); but this approach often requires strong

assumptions pertaining to the absence of an effect on the group introduced to provide a third level of

differencing. In contrast, the approach taken in this paper uses variation induced by the policy change




                                                     3
succeeding in some regions and nearly succeeding in other regions to obtain a better control group.2,3

There may, of course, be contexts in which such an approach is not available. But where it is available, it

seems a potentially better way of estimating effects of policy changes, and, at a minimum, a way of

assessing the robustness of results obtained using more conventional methods.

2. Living Wage Laws, Previous Research, and Motivation for Using Failed or Derailed Campaigns
as Controls

         Information on the living wage laws covering cities large enough for us to analyze reliably is

reported in Table 1. Like minimum wages, the central goal of living wages is to raise incomes of low-

wage workers so as to reduce poverty. Thus, in our view, the key research question with regard to living

wages is whether they help low-wage workers and low-income families. This question has been at the

core of our research on living wages (Neumark and Adams [1] and [2]; Adams and Neumark [3]), as well

as other work following up on this research.4 Several findings emerged from these studies. First, among

those in the lowest decile of their city’s wage distribution, living wages appear to have a detectable effect

on wages. Second, those in the lowest decile of their city’s skill distribution are less likely to be

employed after their city passes a living wage ordinance. Third, the net effect of these laws is to reduce

poverty rates. Finally, some features of living wage laws and the cities that pass them seem to be of

considerable consequence for the magnitude (and hence also the statistical significance) of the estimated

effects. Specifically, the laws that cover firms receiving financial assistance from the city lead to larger

and more statistically significant effects on low-wage and low-skill workers. In addition, legislation in

cities where laws are also in effect in nearby jurisdictions leads to stronger effects. In contrast, cities

  The approach has some parallels to research by DiNardo and Lee [11] estimating the effects of unionization on
establishment closure by comparing establishments in which union representation elections just succeeded to those
where they just failed. Because DiNardo and Lee have measures of election results along a continuum, they can
implement this as a regression discontinuity design. In our case, living wage campaigns fail for a variety of reasons
and not always as a result of a vote, so these methods cannot be implemented formally.
3
  Note that we can still allow for different linear trends (or some other functional form) in the treatment and the
alternative control group, as we do in this paper, but this problem should be less important, because the underlying
changes should be more similar in the two groups.

  For a general overview, see Lundberg et al. [12].

where laws only cover contractors and where their law is the only one in the vicinity do not experience

significant effects from living wage legislation (Adams and Neumark [13]).

         In our other work we have suggested that the larger effects of business assistance living wage

laws may arise because of extended coverage, and because there are fewer avenues for mitigating the

costs (and therefore the effects) of living wage laws for employers covered under business assistance

provisions. For example, contractor-only laws typically require that employers pay the mandated wage

only for work done as part of the contract, allowing employers to mitigate the costs of complying with

living wage laws by reallocating their higher-wage labor to the contract work and their lower wage labor

to the non-contract work, and even reducing wages on non-contract work; in contrast, an establishment

created with the help of business assistance from a city would appear to have no choice but to pay all

employees no less than the mandated living wage for all of their work. Similarly, laws in nearby

jurisdictions may amplify the effects of any city’s living wage law. For example, consider an employer

who has business with multiple cities. If a small share of the business is covered by a living wage law,

because only one of the cities with which the employer has contracts is covered, then there will be more

scope for mitigating the effects of a living wage law. But if nearby cities have living wage laws, more of

the employer’s work is likely to be covered by such laws and therefore the employer would have less

scope for reducing wages on other work done by its employees, and also less scope for shifting business

away from the city that imposes the living wage law.5

         One striking feature of our findings, though, is the large magnitudes of the effects of living wage

laws that we find. For example, in our first paper estimating living wage effects (Neumark and Adams

[1]), for the bottom decile of the wage distribution the estimated wage effects of living wage laws overall

yield an elasticity of wages with respect to the living wage of approximately 0.05-0.07. This estimate is

much larger than would be expected based on the apparently limited coverage of workers by most living

wage laws. For example, as noted in Neumark and Adams [1], an upper bound for the fraction of workers

5
  Another potential reason for stronger effects of laws in nearby cities is that our data geographically identify
respondents by place of residence rather than place of work. If laws exist in two municipalities, it increases the
chances that a resident in either city will be covered by a living wage law.


                                                           5
in the lower decile of the wage distribution that is covered by the contractor provisions of living wage

laws is 0.025. Since we would expect a maximum wage elasticity of one for affected workers, the largest

effects we should expect are approximately equal to the proportion of workers who are likely to be

affected by the living wage, giving us an upper bound elasticity of wages in this decile with respect to the

living wage of 0.025 (and an expected elasticity that is likely much lower), in contrast to the figures just

cited. A similar argument could be made regarding the magnitudes of the employment effects that we

find.

        One potential explanation of these large effects is that the apparent effects of living wage laws

that we find may reflect not only the impact of these laws, but also the effects of campaigns resulting

from organizing low-wage workers, public debate, etc. That is, the momentum for change that begins

with a living wage movement might ultimately result in changes in wage setting norms and firm behavior

(and also lower employment as individual employers respond to the higher wages), independent of the

legislation. In contrast, the direct effects of living wage laws may be more modest.

        Our analysis in this paper using cities with failed or derailed living wage campaigns to construct

counterfactuals for successful living wage laws helps to assess this argument. If living wage movements

are accompanied by increased organizing of low-wage workers and increased focus of public debate on

the problems of workers at the bottom of the wage distribution, then including many cities without a

strong movement in the control group may overstate the direct effects of the legislation. By narrowing

our control group to those cities with living wage campaigns, we remove from the control group those

cities that experienced neither a living wage law nor a living wage campaign, and hence can avoid

confounding the effects of living wage laws and living wage campaigns. This approach is explained in

more detail in the next section, where we also discuss more general motivations for exploiting the

information provided by failed or derailed living wage campaigns.

        Information on proposed living wage ordinances that failed or were derailed is summarized in

Table 2. The reasons for failure vary. State legislation in Louisiana and Utah explicitly prevented living

wage ordinances from being enforced in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Provo, and Salt Lake City. In St.

Louis, a law was passed but ultimately never enforced due a judicial decision. These five cities together

may represent a better control group, as campaigns were halted by an outside legislative or judicial body,

rather than a failure at the city level. Another advantage of this narrower control group is that there is a

clear end of the campaign in these cities, as it is unlikely that a major campaign would resume amidst the

judicial or legislative opposition, and indeed none appears to have resumed. Therefore, we can look at

wages and employment before the law was passed and after it was nullified, which presents a clear

counterfactual to those cities that pass legislation. On the other hand, in only two of these five cities–New

Orleans and St. Louis–were the laws passed at the city level prior to being nullified, raising the possibility

that the other three cities were less similar to cities where living wages passed than were cities where a

campaign almost succeeded at the city level. In addition, this control group is limited because it contains

only five cities, and the campaigns in these five cities ended in a relatively narrow time span (2001-2002).

The five campaigns, labeled group A in Table 2, will be referred to as derailed campaigns throughout the

paper.

         Another group of cities had campaigns that progressed to the point where a decision was reached

at the city level, but no legislation was ultimately enacted. Some reached a vote in city council and failed.

Some fell victim to a mayoral veto. The ultimate failure of these campaigns to result in legislation

suggests that they might have been weaker campaigns, but they still typically entailed increases in low-

wage organizing and community activity, paralleling cities in which living wage laws passed.6 Thus,

along with the cities in group A in Table 2, whose campaigns were derailed, these cities with campaigns

that failed at the city-level may also be candidates for a reliable control group, and may be necessary

because the set of derailed living wage campaigns is so small. This second set of potential control cities,

labeled group B in Table 2, will be referred to as failed campaigns throughout the paper.

         By employing control groups in which the “background” effects of living wage campaigns are

better held constant, the true effects of provisions of the laws actually implemented can be more reliably

6
 Note that the vast majority of living wage campaigns never get as far as one of the outcomes classified as failure in
Table 2. For example, in California, there are about 20 jurisdictions in which living wages have passed, and nearly
as many in which campaigns arose but did not get to the point of a formal vote on a proposal or ballot initiative.

identified. In the process, we can also speak to the question of whether campaigns to pass living wage

laws have any detectable effects on wages and employment on their own, apart from any legislation that

may result.

3. Data and Methods

3.1 Data

         To conduct this analysis, we require information on living wage laws, living wage campaigns,

and labor market outcomes for workers in cities both in a period before laws were passed (or failed or

were derailed) and after. The information on living wage laws and campaigns that we use was already

reported in Tables 1 and 2. The data on labor market outcomes and other worker-related characteristics

come from the CPS monthly Outgoing Rotation Group files (ORGs) extending from January 1996

through December 2002.7 Because cities cannot be identified in the ORG files for a period in 1995,

coupled with the fact that most living wage laws came into effect in 1996 or after, we restrict the sample

to begin in 1996.8 In these files, residents of all MSAs, encompassing all large- and medium-sized cities

in the United States, can be identified.

         The CPS has some disadvantages and some advantages for studying the effects of living wages

and their accompanying living wage campaigns. First, the correspondence between cities and MSAs is

imperfect. However, because covered employers may employ workers who do not live in the city, we do

not necessarily want to restrict attention to city residents. Moreover, the CPS identifies where workers

live, rather than where they work, and many suburban residents work in the city. However, if living wage

laws affect city residents most strongly, our estimates might understate somewhat the impact of living


7
  The CPS is a stratified random sample based on sampling units within strata. However, the sampling units made
up of the most populous areas (including large- and medium-sized metropolitan areas) are in strata by themselves, so
that these areas are always sampled, and, by design, sampling units are self-representing. That is, the sampling unit
covering an MSA is intended to be representative of the population of that MSA, not that MSA plus other sampling
units in the strata. Finally, the households sampled within each sampling unit are chosen to be representative of the
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the sampling unit. As a result, we can use the CPS to construct
representative wage and skill distributions for the MSAs. In a small number of cases, though, outlying counties are
excluded from the CPS sampling frame for an MSA, in which case the data are representative of the remainder of
the MSA. (See U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [14]; U.S. Bureau of the Census [15])
8
  Specifically, for part of 1995 MSA codes are unavailable in the ORGs due to phasing in of a new CPS sample
based on the 1990 Census.


                                                         8
wage laws on city residents. On the other hand, there are numerous small cities within MSAs that have

living wage laws paralleling those in the main cities in the MSA. 9,10

         A related concern is that the CPS contains virtually no information on one’s employer.

Therefore, it is not possible to identify covered and uncovered workers. Instead, all we can identify is the

MSA in which a worker lives and the type of law prevailing there. Obviously, CPS data are not useful in

exploring the microeconomic effects of living wages at the firm or establishment level–i.e., questions

such as whether firms engage in substitution away from low-wage labor, how much wages are increased

for their lowest-wage workers, how employment responds, whether turnover falls, etc.11 On the other

hand, the CPS data are very useful (and perhaps the best data available at present) for addressing policy

questions regarding the effects of living wages on low-wage workers, because they permit us to estimate

the net effects (including indirect or perhaps “general equilibrium” effects) of living wage laws on

workers in the cities where they are passed, relative to other cities. The goal of this paper is to explore the

interpretation and validity of evidence of such net effects on wages and employment in cities enacting

living wage laws.

3.2 Basic Methods

         We first discuss the basic approach that follows our earlier work, and then go on to explain the

added information we can get from exploiting cities with failed and derailed living wage campaigns, and

how we use the data to do so. To study wage effects, our basic approach uses a standard difference-in-

differences approach to estimate the effects of living wage laws on workers in the bottom 10th of each




9
  See http://www.epiononline.org/lw_proposal_map.cfm. Note that Table 1 does not list living wages in smaller
cities. For expositional ease, from this point on we often refer to cities rather than MSAs.
10
   As this discussion highlights, there is clearly an important challenge for empirical research on living wages to try
to better isolate effects on covered workers. However, we believe that the distinction between workers employed by
firms that are or are not covered, discussed next, is by far the most important distinction.
11
   Such questions are best addressed using direct survey data on covered employers (and ideally a control group of
uncovered or unaffected employers), as has begun to occur in some recent research (e.g., Brenner [16] and Fairris
[17]).


                                                          9
city’s wage distribution in each month.12 Pooling data across months, we estimate the following

regression

         (1)       ln(wpijst) =   + Xijst +        ln(wminjst’) + max[ln(wlivjst’),ln(wminjst’)]

                             +    YYt   +   M Ms   +   CCj   + T+   LW   T LWjs +   ijst   .

         This specification requires some explanation. wp is the hourly wage for individuals below the

10th centile of the wage distribution.13 The subscripts ‘i’, ‘j’, ‘s’, and ‘t’ denote individual, city, month,

and year.      is a random error term. X is a vector of individual characteristics (age, sex, race, education,

and marital status), wmin is the higher of the federal or state minimum wage,14 and wliv is the higher of the

living wage or the minimum wage. Y, M, and C are vectors of year, month, and city (MSA) dummy

variables. T is linear time trend; by interacting it with a time-invariant variable LW indicating whether a

city ever imposes a living wage law in the sample period, we allow cities with and without living wage

laws to have different time trends, as discussed in more detail below.15 When cities have very few

observations for a given month, determining whether a worker falls in the bottom 10th of the distribution

is unreliable. We therefore restrict our sample for each analysis to city-month cells with at least 25

observations, although many have far more observations.

         We always restrict attention to living wages (and minimum wages) at a lag of 12 months (t’),

because our past work has found that living wage effects become strong and statistically significant about



12
   For the estimation of wage effects, we restrict our sample to workers with an hourly wage greater than one dollar
and less than or equal to 100 dollars. We also limit the sample to those between the ages of 16 and 70, inclusive.
The latter restriction is also applied to the employment analysis.
13
   The regressions should therefore be interpreted as effects on a conditional mean rather than a population
regression function, since our sample is limited to low-wage workers. However, we have verified in previous work
that our approach is robust to specifications that do not truncate the sample. Specifically, our results were similar
using a specification where city-months are the unit of analysis and the 10th centile of the wage distribution in the
city month is the dependent variable. Also, when we estimated a quantile regression on the entire wage distribution
(appropriately leaving out the controls for worker characteristics in the X vector), the evidence was similar. See
Adams and Neumark [3] for more details.
14
   In the few cases of MSAs that straddle states with different minimum wages in some years (Davenport-Quad
Cities, Philadelphia, Portland, and Providence), we use a weighted average of the minimum wages in the two states,
weighting by the shares of the MSA population in each state (averaged over the months of 1996).
15
   LW is not included on its own (i.e., not interacted with T) because it is captured in the city dummy variables. The
time trend in the cities without a living wage law (LW=0) is actually more flexible, and is captured in the year and
month dummy variables.


                                                               10
a year after passage, and that little generality is lost by simply focusing on the 12-month lag.16 Living

wage effects may arise with a lag because cities take some time to communicate and establish procedures

for living wage compliance and enforcement (Sander and Lokey [18]). In addition, contracts only

become subject to living wage provisions once they are renewed, although some effects of living wage

laws can become operative prior to renewal of contracts.

           The living wage variable that multiplies is specified as the maximum of the (logs of the) living

wage and the minimum wage. It is potentially important to control for minimum wages separately,

because many cities with living wages are in states with high minimum wages, and we want to estimate

the independent effects of living wages. The specification of the living wage effect imposes the minimum

as the wage floor in the absence of a living wage. However, because living wages may have different

effects from minimum wages, and because the effects of wage floors may differ in the narrower sectors to

which living wages apply, the coefficient is allowed to differ from that of the standard minimum wage

floor. If living wages boost the wages of low-wage workers, we would expect to find positive estimates

of when we are looking at workers at the low end of the wage distribution.

           The year and month dummy variables control for common changes across cities in the sample

that could otherwise be confounded with living wage effects, since living wages are typically enacted

later in the sample period. The city dummy variables control for the possibility that living wage laws are

passed in cities with either particularly high or low wages, which would again confound the estimation of

their effects. Thus, this specification identifies an effect of the living wage when the dependent variable

changes differentially in cities that pass living wage laws (or increase their living wage) relative to cities

that do not pass living wage laws–a difference-in-differences research design.

           The difference-in-differences strategy is predicated on the assumption that absent the living wage,

and aside from differences captured in the other control variables, the treatment and control groups are

comparable. Note, though, that explicit controls for local labor market conditions are not included.

While local labor market conditions can surely matter, they are also potentially endogenous if, for

16
     The results are also not sensitive to using a contemporaneous minimum wage variable instead.


                                                          11
example, living wages cause some job loss. Fixed differences in economic conditions between the

treatment and control groups are captured in the city dummy variables, and the year and month dummy

variables capture changes in economic conditions common to all cities. However, a potential problem

arises if economic conditions are changing differentially by location. For this reason, to capture some

dimensions of differing changes in economic conditions across cities, equation (1) also includes

differential linear time trends for cities that do and do not pass living wage laws over the sample period.

The difference in the trend for cities passing living wage laws is captured in the term                     LW   T LWjs.17 While

these trends do not capture every possible variation in local economic conditions, they capture systematic

differences between the different groups of cities in the rates of change of wages and employment.

         We use the same basic empirical framework to study employment, with only two differences.

First, we estimate linear probability models for individual employment status. Second, whereas the wage

analysis is done only for those employed and with a wage, the employment analysis is of course done for

workers and non-workers. Because we cannot classify non-working individuals based on their position in

the wage distribution, we instead impute wages for everyone and group individuals based on their

position in the distribution of imputed wages, or “skills.”18

         Both the wage and employment specifications can be augmented to allow for differences in

effects of living wage laws based on certain characteristics of the laws. We estimate these separate

effects from specifications of the form

         (2)      ln(wpijst) =   + Xijst +        ln(wminjst’) +   1   max[ln(wlivjst’) L1,ln(wminjst’)]

                                 +   2   max[ln(wlivjst’) L2,ln(wminjst’)] +    YYt   +   M Ms   +   CCj   + T


17
   We also experimented with allowing nonlinear trends by adding quadratic terms in T, but the results were very
similar to those we report. A referee suggested allowing for different trends before and after a living wage is passed.
The suggestion amounts to asking whether there is an effect not only of the living wage, but of how many years the
living wage has been in effect. This is something one might, in principle, be able to identify reliably with a very
long time-series for each city, but not with the short time-series that we have available for each city.
18
   We do this in a simple manner, estimating a standard log wage regression with year and month controls, and using
predicted log wages from the estimated regression to construct an imputed wage distribution for the MSA-month
cell. Of course, the market wages faced by those who choose not to work may be lower than those faced by
observationally-equivalent individuals who choose to work; this is the standard sample selection problem. We have
verified that reducing the imputed wages of the non-workers by five percent and ten percent leads to results that are
qualitatively similar.


                                                              12
                                    +   1,LW   T LWjs L1 +   2,LW   T LWjs L2 +   ijst.


           What is different in this specification is the interactions with L1 and L2, which are dummy

variables for the two different types of living wage laws under consideration. In this paper, we will

consider two features of laws that will require this method of delineation. For some specifications, L1

will indicate laws with business assistance provisions and L2 will indicate laws that only cover contractors

(as well as the couple of smaller cities that cover only municipal employees). For others, L1 will indicate

laws passed where a nearby city also has a law while L2 will indicate laws passed where the city has the

only law in the vicinity. As noted above, these two features of living wage legislation were found in

previous studies to have a strong influence on whether living wage laws had a detectable effect (Adams

and Neumark [13]). We now have two variables with the max of the logs of the living and minimum

wages, interacting them with the dummy variables L1 and L2, respectively. The interaction occurs inside

the max operator so that in the absence of a living wage the floor is the minimum wage, rather than zero.

The parameters      1   and   2   then capture the differences in the effects of wage floors generated by living

wages, allowing these to differ depending on the type of living wage law. In addition, we add separate

interactions between the time trend, the indicator for a living wage law, and L1 and L2, which allow the

cities with different types of living wage laws to have different underlying trends, for the reasons outlined

above.19

3.3 Extending the Analysis to Failed and Derailed Living Wage Campaigns

         In this paper, we extend this approach to exploit additional information provided by failed and

derailed living wage campaigns. There are two principal motivations for this extension. First, in the

difference-in-differences strategy outlined above, the control group for the statistical experiment involved

in estimating the effects of living wage laws is the set of cities in which a living wage law is never passed.

Implicitly it might appear that the pre-living wage observations in cities that eventually pass living wage

laws (in the sample period) also serve as controls. But the difference-in-differences strategy identifies the


19
 The L1 and L2 variables in the max operators should have ‘t’ subscripts in the case of nearby cities having living
wages, as this classification sometimes changes over time.


                                                               13
living wage effect from the difference between changes in wages and employment in the living wage

cities pre- and post-living wages, compared to changes over comparable periods in the cities that never

pass living wages, so the non-living wage cities provide the control group for this second level of

differencing. Of course, as explained above, in the statistical model the city dummy variables account for

fixed differences in wage and employment levels across cities, and the differential trends account for

different trends in the two sets of cities. But the latter feature of the models only “works” to the extent

that these differential trends are present for the entire sample period, which in the living wage cities

means both before and after a living wage law is passed. If living wages are passed in cities that are

contemporaneously undergoing changes in outcomes for low-wage or low-skill workers—perhaps

because cities endogenously choose to enact living wages, because living wage campaigns are in part

generated in response to these changes, or because of the effects of campaigns—then the overall set of

cities not passing living wage laws may not serve as an adequate control group.

        What we would like, instead, is a control group of cities in which whatever changes may have

coincided with the passage of living wage laws also occurred. A natural set of candidates for such a

control group is the cities in which there was a living wage campaign, but it failed or was derailed for one

of the reasons outlined earlier. Clearly these cities are not identical to the living wage cities, because

ultimately a living wage law was not enacted. But they seem likely to be far more similar in terms of

whatever underlying changes may have been associated with a living wage campaign arising. Below, we

discuss some of the issues involved in implementing this empirically.

        The second motivation arises because, as noted earlier, the evidence on wage and employment

effects of living wage laws that we have found in our past research tends to suggest effects that are larger

than expected, especially if one thinks in terms of coverage of city contractors, which is by all estimates

quite narrow (see Neumark and Adams [1]). Part of the explanation may be that we are picking up more

than just the direct effects of legislated living wage laws, and instead are also detecting the broader effects

of the organizing of low-wage labor, public debate, and strengthening of community organizations that

are spurred by living wage campaigns. Because of this, we are interested in comparing the effects of


                                                      14
successful living wage campaigns to failed and derailed living wage campaigns, to see how much of the

effects of living wage laws that are actually implemented are in fact independent effects of these laws,

rather than effects of the campaigns that would arise regardless of whether the campaign succeeded. By

comparing the failed and derailed campaigns to the more standard control group, we can ask what effects

living wage campaigns, per se, have on low-wage or low-skill workers.

        To answer these questions, we have to modify our approach in a couple of ways. First, and most

simply, in estimating equations (1) and (2) we restrict the sample to cities that either successfully passed a

living wage law or had a failed or derailed living wage campaign (groups A and B in Table 2). This

approach uses the latter cities as the control group in the simplest possible way. We also conduct the

analyses for a control group limited to just the group of cities with derailed campaigns (group A from

Table 2). Although this removes from the analysis many of the cities in group B that had strong

campaigns, it leaves us with a control group of cities in which campaigns only ended because of an

outside decision by a legislative or judicial body, rather than—strictly speaking—a failed campaign. On

the other hand, the group of cities with derailed campaigns includes only five cities in three states, and as

noted earlier in three of the five cities a living wage law was pre-empted by the state legislature, so this

group poses some limitations.

        While we begin this analysis with a simple approach, better estimates can be obtained if we

compare the changes in cities that successfully passed living wage laws with changes occurring in the

cities with failed and derailed campaigns in an appropriate “before-and-after” period, rather than

essentially averaging over changes in these control cities for the entire sample period. That is, we

probably obtain the most reliable difference-in-differences estimates if we correctly align the before-and-

after periods in the cities with successful campaigns with the counterfactual before-and-after period in the

cities where campaigns failed or were derailed.

        One challenge to implementing this approach is that we do not have a specific living wage level

to assign to the cities in which the living wage campaign failed or was derailed. Therefore, as a

preliminary step, we use versions of equations (1) and (2) in which we substitute a dummy for enactment


                                                      15
of a living wage law for the continuous measure of the living wage. Letting DLW be a dummy variable

equal to one when the living wage law is in effect, then equation (2), for example, becomes

         (3)     ln(wpijst) =       + Xijst +    ln(wminjst’) +      1   DLWjst’ L1

                                +    2   DLWjst’ L2 +     YYt   +    M Ms   +   CCj   + T

                                +    1,LW   T LWjs L1 +    2,LW     T LWjs L2 +       ijst,


with the obvious corresponding change in equation (1) that we do not spell out here. The main difference

between equations (2) and (3) is in the interpretation of the estimates of                    1   and   2.   These parameters now

capture the percentage changes in wages that result from the living wage laws on average, without regard

to the actual level of the living wage. While this specification therefore discards information, it is the

only way we are able to estimate comparable effects of actual living wage laws in the treatment group and

corresponding “potential” living wage laws in the restricted control group of cities with failed or derailed

living wage campaigns. We also report estimates of these specifications for the full sample, to provide a

comparison with the results using the continuous living wage variable.

        After verifying that moving to a dummy variable specification does nothing to substantively

change the results, we move to the analysis that attempts to align the before-and-after periods in the cities

with successful campaigns with the counterfactual before-and-after periods in the cities where campaigns

failed or were derailed. To try to accomplish this, we take from an external source (see Table 2) the best

estimate of the date the living wage campaign ended. There are unambiguous dates on which votes

failed, laws were blocked, etc. For campaigns that failed at the city level due to a city council vote or

mayoral veto, however, campaigns may restart, perhaps due to a change in the composition of city council

or a change in mayor. Thus, our results that use information on the timing of living wage campaigns

should be interpreted with this in mind. In contrast, for the cities in group A of Table 2 there is a clear

end to these campaigns as a result of some exogenous decision by a judge or legislative body. As noted

earlier, however, it only consists of five cities in three states. Thus, we still likely need to rely on the

results using the larger control group of cities with either failed or derailed campaigns.

        Then, given these dates, corresponding to the actual passage of a living wage law in the cities


                                                                16
where a living wage law successfully passed we define the “treatment” of a failed or derailed living wage

campaign as occurring at the ending date of the campaigns for these cities. It may seem odd to specify as

the beginning of the treatment period the date at which the living wage campaign ended. But the

presumption is that there was a living wage campaign in all of these cities—irrespective of whether the

living wage law was ultimately enacted—so that there is no need to specify the “treatment” of the living

wage campaign leading up to the final outcome. Instead, what we do by including a variable capturing

the end of the living wage campaign is to simply “line up” the before-and-after observations in the

subsample of cities with failed and derailed campaigns in the same way as the observations are lined up in

the subsample of cities that pass living wage laws. The difference between the living wage “effect” in the

two sets of cities is then the independent effect of the living wage laws.

         We then proceed to the final step by augmenting the equation to let DLW instead be a dummy

variable indicating that a living wage campaign has ended, and then interacting this variable with two

indicators: S for successful campaigns, and F for failed or derailed campaigns, as in



         (4)      ln(wpijst) =   + Xijst +      ln(wminjst’) +       1   DLWjst’ S jst’ L1 +       2   DLWjst’ S jst’ L2

                                 + ’ DLWjst’ F jst’ +    YYt     +       M Ms   +   CCj   + T+         1,LW   T DLWjs S L1

                                 +   2,LW   T DLWjs S L2 +       3       T DLWjs F +       ijst.


The last three interaction terms now allow for different trends where there are successful or unsuccessful

campaigns, and where campaigns are successful, trends are allowed to differ by the type of law that

results. Again, there is an obvious version of this equation that corresponds to equation (1), not spelled

out here. These specifications are estimated for the full sample.20

         Returning to the main issues involved in developing this specification, (                         1   − ’) and (   2   − ’) in

equation (4) capture the effects of enacted living wages (of the two types captured by L1 and L2), relative

to failed or derailed living wage campaigns. The parameters correspond to the difference-in-differences

20
  For the regression analyses where we focus only on the derailed campaigns (group A in Table 2), however, we
drop cities from group B in Table 2 completely from the analysis, rather than including them in the broader control
group.


                                                            17
estimates of the effects of living wage laws using the failed and derailed living wage campaigns as the

control group, which we suggest best identify the effects of living wage laws. What ’ captures is the

“effect” of unsuccessful living wage campaigns, or how wages and employment in the cities with failed

or derailed campaigns deviate from the group of cities with no living wage campaigns in the period after

the campaign ends. For this latter analysis, the necessity of “dating” the failure or derailment of living

wage campaigns is obvious.

4. Empirical Results

4.1 Baseline Estimates

        In Table 3, we begin by presenting some of the basic results from our earlier research assessing

the impact of living wage laws. In the top panel, we use the same control group we have used in our

previous studies—cities that have not passed a living wage law during the sample period. This control

group can include cities with strong movements that may result in living wage laws in the future, cities

with weak movements, cities with movements that were derailed (group A in Table 2), cities with

movements that failed at the city level (group B), and cities without any living wage activity at all.

        The overall wage effects in column (1) suggest that living wage laws do have an impact on

wages. The point estimate is 3.95, implying an elasticity of about 0.04 (given that the estimates in Table

3 are multiplied by 100). Although this estimate falls short of statistical significance, sharper statistical

results emerge when we draw distinctions among different features of living wage laws. In particular,

when we estimate separate effects for business assistance and contractor-only living wage laws, we find a

significant impact only of business assistance laws. As shown in column (2), the estimated elasticity for

business assistance laws is 0.07, significant at the ten-percent level. Similarly, when we estimate separate

effects for laws that are passed in a city with a neighboring city that also has a living wage law, the

estimated elasticity is 0.09 and is significant at the five-percent level. As noted earlier, there are several

reasons why one might suspect that these two features have the strongest impact. Business assistance

provisions cover firms accepting financial assistance from the city and are normally passed in addition to

provisions covering contractors, thus making it more likely that workers will be covered by these broader


                                                      18
laws. Moreover, firms bound by business assistance provisions have less scope for mitigating the costs

associated with the wage requirements. The same is true for laws passed in cities whose neighbors also

have living wage laws, as neighboring living wage laws make it more difficult to shift business to areas

not covered by a living wage law.21

         The estimated employment effects of the living wage laws using the full control group appear in

the top panel of columns (4)-(6). The estimated overall impact of living wage laws is given by the point

estimate of –5.25. This implies an employment elasticity of −0.12, which is calculated by dividing the

point estimate of the 5.25 percentage point reduction in employment for a one-unit increase in the log

living wage (or a 100 percent increase) by the percentage of the bottom decile of the skill distribution that

is employed (43.51). This employment estimate is statistically significant at the five-percent level. The

effects are also stronger in those cities where the effects on wages were stronger—cities whose laws have

business assistance provisions or with nearby cities that also have legislation—and weaker and

statistically insignificant for the other cities. The employment results for business assistance laws and

laws where nearby jurisdictions also have legislation imply elasticities of −0.17 and −0.23, respectively.22

4.2 Restricting the Control Group to Cities with Failed and Derailed Living Wage Campaigns

         We begin the analysis that exploits unsuccessful living wage campaigns in the middle panel of

Table 3, restricting the control group for the difference-in-differences estimation to cities with failed or

derailed living wage campaigns (both groups A and B from Table 2), and applying equations (1) and (2)

to this restricted sample. What is notable from this approach is the similarity of the estimates to those in

the first panel. The elasticity of wages with respect to living wages generally is near 0.04 and falls short

of significance at conventional levels. The employment effect remains negative and statistically



21
   In Adams and Neumark [13], we show that these two features of living wage laws tend to coincide, and it is
difficult empirically to determine whether one or the other is more important as an explanation of what underlies the
stronger living wage effect.
22
   In Neumark and Adams [1], we estimated wage effects for the bottom decile of the skill distribution (imputed
from individual characteristics) and presented similar findings to those presented in this paper, which use the bottom
decile of the actual wage distribution. In Adams and Neumark [3], we examined whether there are any effects
further up in the wage and skill distribution and found no significant effects. This is expected given that the wage
floor does not directly affect these workers.


                                                         19
significant at the five-percent level. When we separate the effect of the business assistance laws and the

contractor-only laws, we also arrive at similar estimates to the top panel. The estimated wage effect for

business assistance living wage laws declines only slightly, although combined with the higher standard

error is no longer statistically significant at the ten-percent level. When we separate the effects of laws

with nearby legislation and laws without nearby legislation, there is little change in the estimates, with an

elasticity of 0.08 estimated for living wage laws when there are living wage laws in neighboring cities,

and the estimated effect remains significant at the five-percent level. The employment effects are similar

to those using the larger control group, whatever distinctions we draw among living wage laws. As with

the overall effects, the effects for business assistance living wage laws and living wage laws accompanied

by similar laws in neighboring cities remain statistically significant in the middle column when the

control group is restricted to cities with failed or derailed campaigns. In the bottom panel of Table 3, we

further restrict the control group to only those cities with derailed campaigns. There is virtually no

change in either the wage or employment results. This suggests that it is the laws and not anything about

the campaigns that generate the wage and employment effects that we observe.

4.3 Refinements: Aligning Successful and Unsuccessful Living Wage Campaigns and Estimating the
Effects of Campaigns

        As explained in Section 3, a limitation of the estimates in the bottom two panels of Table 3 is that

they may not go far enough in using the subsample of cities with failed or derailed living wage campaigns

as a control group. Instead, we next turn to the analysis using the estimated dates at which the living

wage campaigns in the control cities failed or were derailed, to establish greater comparability with the

enactment of living wages in the treatment cities.

        To begin this analysis, in the top panel of Table 4 we examine the consequences solely of moving

to the specification where we identify the effect of the living wage through the dummy variable DLW

(from equation (3)) rather than the continuous measure of the living wage. The overall wage results, in

column (1), are similar to the results using the continuous measure that appear in Table 3. The passage of

a living wage, on average, increases wages of the bottom decile of the wage distribution by 1.68 percent



                                                     20
when compared with all other cities, 1.52 percent when compared to set of cities with failed and derailed

living wage campaigns, and 1.34 percent when compared only to the set of cities with derailed

campaigns. The estimates in columns (2) and (3) again show that living wage effects on wages are

sharper when there is a business assistance provision, or when a nearby city has a living wage law, with

the estimated effects, as in Table 3, increasing by a factor somewhat less than two.

         To compare these to the estimates in Table 3, it is useful to compute elasticities, which we can do

by applying the estimated coefficients to the average living wage differential in the sample. This average

is 60.5 percent overall, 66.7 percent for the business assistance living wage laws, and 66.3 percent for

living wage laws accompanied by similar laws in nearby cities, implying wage elasticities of 0.03, 0.05,

and 0.05 respectively when we use all other cities as the control group (0.03, 0.04, and 0.04 using the

more restrictive control group in the middle panel, and 0.02, 0.04, and 0.03 using the most restrictive

control group in the bottom panel). Note, though, that these estimated wage effects tend not to be

statistically significant, unlike in Table 3; this is a natural consequence of discarding the information on

living wage levels.

         The employment effects, on the other hand, are not only similar to the results in Table 3, but

remain statistically significant. For example, when compared with all cities, a living wage law lowers the

employment rate of the less-skilled by 2.34 percentage points, which implies an elasticity of about

−0.09.23 The employment results using the alternative control group of cities with failed and derailed (or

just derailed) living wage campaigns are similar. Separating the effects by those laws with and without

business assistance provisions, as well as by whether a nearby city has a living wage law, again yields

similar effects.

         As with the wage effects, the estimated employment elasticities tend to be a little smaller (in

absolute value) in Table 4. Aside from ignoring overall variation in the levels of living wages first

implemented, the specifications used in Table 4 also ignore effects that result from subsequent increases


23
  The 2.34 percentage point decline in the employment rate represents a 5.4 percent decline in the 43.51 percent
employment rate for this group, which is then scaled by the average 60.5 percent overall increase in the living wage.


                                                         21
in living wages due to indexation to federal poverty guidelines or the CPI, which have been shown to

have disproportionately larger effects in Neumark and Adams [1]. Even so, they are similar enough to

suggest that we can use this approach in an acceptable way to estimate more finely the different impacts

of successful and failed or derailed living wage campaigns.

        Table 5 reports the results from estimating equation (4), and the corresponding equation that does

not distinguish by type of living wage law. Specification 1 simply looks at the effects of successful and

failed or derailed campaigns without distinguishing types of living wage laws, while specifications 2 and

3 draw the distinctions based on business assistance provisions and living wage laws in nearby cities,

respectively. In column (1), the first row for each specification reports the estimated wage “effect”

corresponding to failed or derailed campaigns, and the following rows report the corresponding

parameters for successful campaigns; for specifications 2 and 3, referring back to equation (4), these are

the parameters ’ (for unsuccessful campaigns) and            1   and   2   (for successful campaigns). Column (1’)

then reports the differences between these coefficient estimates—in the case of specifications 2 and 3, the

estimates of (   1   − ’) and (   2   − ’)—which provide the difference-in-differences estimates in which we are

most interested. This analysis is also repeated using just derailed campaigns, and the results appear in

columns (2) and (2’). Columns (3), (3’), (4), and (4’) present the employment results in a similar fashion.

        As noted earlier, we report all effects lagged by 12 months. For the effects of the living wage

laws, there is a clear justification for looking at effects lagged by 12 months. For the unsuccessful

campaigns, this is less obvious. A living wage campaign likely gains momentum as time goes on and

perhaps continues to exert some influence after a law passes or fails. The point at which we would expect

to begin to see an effect is uncertain. One of the questions in which we are most interested in, however, is

whether the effects of living wage laws that we have detected reflect the effects of the laws themselves or

just the effects of living wage campaigns. Thus, the most natural way to use the unsuccessful campaigns

as a control group is to examine whether the time pattern of effects of living wage laws differs from those

of living wage campaigns. As a consequence, for unsuccessful campaigns we use the same lag as for

successful ones.


                                                           22
        The difference-in-differences estimate of the wage effect in column (1’), for living wage laws

overall, is 2.62, which falls short of statistical significance at conventional levels. Recall that this

estimate gives the average effect of a living wage law relative to the experience in cities in which the

living campaign failed or was derailed. In specifications 2 and 3, the estimates indicate stronger effects of

both business assistance living wage laws and living wage laws accompanied by those in nearby cities.

Again, the estimates go up by a factor somewhat below two, and for both types of living wage laws, the

estimates indicate wage increases of about four percent in the bottom decile of the wage distribution. The

effect is nearly statistically significant at the ten-percent level in the case of business assistance cities but

falls farther short of statistical significance in the case of laws where nearby cities also have legislation.

Also, as before, the estimated effects of other types of living wage laws (without business assistance

provisions, or geographically isolated), are insignificantly different from zero. The results are similar but

the point estimates a bit smaller in columns (2) and (2’) where we restrict our attention only to the cities

with derailed campaigns. Interestingly, the standard errors are generally a bit smaller, despite using a

more restricted control group.

        The employment effects are similar in some respects. In columns (3) and (3’), when we look at

the effects of both failed and derailed campaigns, the differential effect in cities that pass living wage laws

is negative and statistically significant at the five-percent level, with the representative living wage law

reducing employment by 3.6 percentage points. The estimates are stronger for business assistance living

wage laws, and living wage laws accompanied by laws in nearby cities. In columns (4) and (4’), when

attention is limited to just those cities with derailed campaigns, the differential effect for cities passing

laws becomes smaller, with the representative living wage law reducing employment by 1.7 percentage

points. Even for business assistance laws and legislation accompanied by laws in nearby cities, the

differential effect is no longer statistically significant. This is largely due to the now negative (although

non-significant) employment estimate in the first row for each specification corresponding to failed or

derailed campaigns, and the considerably larger standard errors of those estimates using the narrower

control group when we look at employment.


                                                       23
        Together, the evidence in columns (1’) (2’), (3’), and (4’) of Table 5 establishes what we view as

our best evidence on the effects of living wage laws. The estimates in columns (1’) and (3’) tell a clear

story. What is interesting about these estimates, which are identified relative to the changes that occurred

in cities with failed or derailed living wage campaigns in the period when living wages would probably

have been implemented in these latter cities had the campaigns been successful, is that they are if

anything stronger than the estimates in Table 4. Further information along these lines is provided in the

estimates reported in columns (1) and (3) of Table 5. These estimates suggest that the “effects”

corresponding to failed or derailed living wage campaigns are, if anything, the opposite sign of the

estimated effects of successful campaigns (i.e., negative wage effects and positive employment effects),

although these estimates are insignificant.

        The estimates in columns (2’) and (4’) are not as clear. We use the control group of cities where

campaigns ended due to outside legislative or judicial action, which could be preferable, and the estimates

do suggest a differential effect of the laws themselves compared with the control group, but the effects are

weaker and not statistically significant. We cannot be certain, but this may reflect the five cities with

derailed campaigns not providing enough data to draw a reliable conclusion. Finally, we remind the

reader that the derailed campaigns do not unambiguously represent a better control group, because in only

two of the five cities in this group was a living wage law passed before it was nullified.

        In all cases, though, the estimated effects of unsuccessful living wage campaigns—given in the

first row for each specification—never give any indication that these have any effects. In every case the

estimate is smaller than the standard error, and in almost every case (the one exception is in column (4))

the estimates are the opposite sign to the estimated effects of successful living wage campaigns.

        Taken together, the evidence suggests that it is the actual living wage laws, rather than the effects

of living campaigns per se, that generate the estimated wage and employment effects that we find. That

is, for a living wage movement to ultimately have a detectable effect on the wages or employment of low-

wage or low-skill workers, it appears that it must culminate in legislation that is passed by the city and

subsequently enforced. This evidence on the effects of enacted living wage laws relative to living wage


                                                     24
campaigns suggests that it is not necessarily anything about living wage campaigns themselves that

explains the large living wage impacts that we find, whether considering living wage laws in general, or

the stronger effects we find for particular types of living wage laws. Rather, the effects appear to be

driven by the wage floors and other provisions established by the living wage legislation that is enacted.

5. Conclusions

        This paper exploits the experiences of cities with living wage campaigns that were ultimately

unsuccessful to construct more compelling counterfactuals with which to estimate the effects of living

wage laws. Some campaigns were unsuccessful because they were derailed due to state legislation or a

court ruling. Others failed due a negative city council vote or a mayoral veto.

        Specifically, the cities with unsuccessful living wage campaigns offer three advantages relative to

earlier research. First, these cities arguably provide a better control group for comparison with the cities

that passed living wage laws, as underlying changes in low-wage labor markets that may have been

associated with living wage laws are more likely to have been similar in cities where living wage

campaigns arose. Second, the cities with failed or derailed living wage campaigns allow us to estimate

the effects of living wages more directly, by netting out the possible consequences of changes that

accompany living wage campaigns, stemming from influences such as increased organizing among low-

wage workers and increased public focus on their conditions and wages. With respect to both of these

points, it might be expected that smaller living wage effects on wages and employment would result,

compared with evidence based on comparisons with the broader set of cities that simply did not pass

living wage laws—irrespective of whether a living wage campaign occurred. And third, our approach

yields estimates of the effects of living wage campaigns themselves.

        The results confirm the findings of positive wage effects and negative employment effects of

enacted living wages on low-wage, low-skill workers. In fact, the findings are generally very similar to

the previous results using a broader control group. The evidence also suggests that there is no detectable

impact of living wage campaigns themselves, apart from the legislation that results.




                                                     25
         The robustness of the findings to narrowing the control group to cities with failed or derailed

living wage campaigns suggests that the more basic panel data research design recovers unbiased

estimates of the effects of living wage laws. Recall that this seemed a particularly important question to

explore in the context of living wages because others have argued that the rather large effects we have

found may be partly attributable to the effects of campaigns; that is, some skepticism has been directed

toward our estimates precisely on the basis of the type of argument we address in this paper. More

generally, in empirical analyses of this type that identify effects of policies from variation in policies over

geographical areas and time, there is a legitimate concern that the policy variation may be endogenous, so

that apparent effects of the policy are in fact a reflection of changes that drove the policy variation, rather

than the other way around. The robustness of the estimates of living wage effects that we find therefore

suggests a couple of conclusions. First, the wage and employment effects we find are in fact not

attributable to the effects of living wage campaigns, but rather to the effects of the laws themselves; in

that sense, our analysis solidifies the existing findings. Nor are they likely attributable to endogeneity of

the locations where living wage laws arise. Finally, in this particular context the reason we do not find a

different answer using the control group of failed and derailed campaigns is that the usual toolkit applied

in panel data contexts, including fixed city and year effects, and city-specific time trends, turns out to do

enough to capture the important differences between the treatment and control group.24

         The findings have some implications for the evolving literature on living wages. First, as just

noted, the relatively large effects of living wages that we have found receive further confirmation from

this paper, suggesting that the question of why these effects appear larger than expected based on factors

such as contractor coverage continues to merit investigation. In our view, one promising avenue of

research that may prove informative is the development of research using firm-level data to gain better

24
   To confirm this, we estimated the specifications in Table 3, with the alternative control groups, leaving out the
time trends, the city dummy variables, and then both. This often led to much greater sensitivity of the results to
using the narrower control group. For example, focusing on the wage effects reported in column (1) of Table 3, the
range of estimates based on the three control groups is 0.17. If we omit the trend terms, the range grows to 2.93, and
if we omit the trends and city dummy variables, it grows to 6.69. For the employment effects in column (4) of Table
3, the range of estimates is 0.29. Without the trends this grows to 1.07, and without the trends and city dummy
variables to 5.37.

insight into the behavioral responses of firms to legislation (Brenner [16] and Fairris [17]). As for living

wage movements, the evidence in this paper does not point to discernable impacts of living wage

campaigns per se. At the same time, our approach to this question represents a first stab; a particular

limitation arises from the difficulty of trying to “date” when the effects of derailed living wage campaigns

would have arisen. In addition, more study of the development and dynamics of living wage

campaigns—including why they arise and why they succeed or fail—would likely prove insightful, and

might point to some sources of variation in whether or not living wage campaigns have more persistent

effects, as well as possible differences among living wage campaigns that result in different types of

living wage laws.

This table was compiled using information from the Employment Policies Institute
(http://www.epionline.org/lw_proposal_map.cfm and http://www.epf.org/factsheets/adopted.asp). It includes the
cities that are large enough to be included in the empirical analysis, specifically those for which there are at least
25 observations for some months in the sample period. There are also many cases of smaller cities within
metropolitan areas encompassing these larger cities that have living wages, often quite similar to those in the
larger city. The date the living wage was enacted is identified by the first complete month the ordinance was
effective, when that information is available. Otherwise, the date at which the ordinance was passed is assumed to
be the effective date. In the “coverage” column, C indicates the contractors are covered, B indicates that business
assistance recipients are covered, and M indicates that municipal employees are covered. Some cities impose a
higher living wage if health insurance is not provided. The lower wage floor is reported in the table and used in
the analysis; in previous work, we verified that results are very similar using the higher wage floor (Neumark and
Adams [2]).

This table was compiled using information from http://www.epionline.org/livingwage/index.cfm. The dates that the
campaigns ended are estimates. For many cities, campaign activity may have resumed. For these cities, we restrict
attention to when the first campaign ended. Not all of the cities shown in the table are large enough to be included in the
analysis. (See notes to Table 1.) A city with one asterisk (*) made the sample cut for the employment analysis only. A city
with two asterisks (**) made the cut for both the wage and employment analyses. A city with no asterisk did not make the
sample.

Reported are the estimated effects of the living wage on the log wage (employment) of individuals in the bottom
decile of the wage (predicted wage) distribution in the MSA-month cell. Estimates of the effects on employment
are from linear probability models. All estimates are multiplied by 100. Observations for which allocated
information is required to construct the dependent variable in the CPS are dropped. The estimations include
controls for year, month, MSA, education, age, marital status, race, gender, and the minimum wage at the same
lag as the living wage variable. The living wage and minimum wage are measured in logs. Reported standard
errors (in parentheses) are robust to non-independence (and heteroscedasticity) within city cells, following the
suggestions in Bertrand et al. [19]. See Table 2 for a list of those cities with derailed campaigns (group A) and
failed campaigns (group B).
