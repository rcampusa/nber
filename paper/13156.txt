                                              ABSTRACT

Using a unique longitudinal representative survey of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing businesses
in the United States during the 1990's, I examine the incidence and intensity of organizational innovation
and the factors associated with investments in organizational innovation. Past profits tend to be positively
associated with organizational innovation. Employers with a more external focus and broader networks
to learn about best practices (as proxied by exports, benchmarking, and being part of a multi-establishment
firm) are more likely to invest in organizational innovation. Investments in human capital, information
technology, R&D, and physical capital appear to be complementary with investments in organizational
innovation. In addition, non-unionized manufacturing plants are more likely to have invested more
broadly and intensely in organizational innovation.

1. Introduction

        The sustained growth in productivity in the United States that began in the mid

1990s continues to surprise and confound economists. Between 1995 and 2006

productivity for nonfarm businesses grew at 2.7 percent and productivity in

manufacturing grew at 4 percent per year. This increase in productivity, more than a full

percentage point above its average annual growth rate for the period 1970-1995, has been

labeled by some as the advent of a “New Economy.” How long this trend will last is the

subject of much speculation, with economists such as Janet Yellen (2005), President of

the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh (2004)

projecting that we are now on track to maintain a trend rate of productivity growth of

around 2.5 percent per year.

        Skeptics of the New Economy phenomenon argue that the growth in productivity

through 2005 is simply the result of employers’ uncertainty due to rising oil prices and

geo-political concerns. These factors make employers push their incumbent workers

harder since they are reluctant to hire even though profitability is high. Therefore, once

these concerns disappear, there should be a marked increase in hiring and a subsequent

fall in productivity growth. Whether you believe this is a permanent change in the

growth rate of the productivity of the U.S. or just a temporary phenomenon has

significant implications for monetary policy. It is therefore very important to try to

understand the underlying dynamics of productivity growth in order to predict its

sustainability.

        The rise in productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s through the first

half of this decade has been attributed in large part to investments in information and
                                                                                             4

communication technology. However, a careful examination of the various studies that

have attempted to disentangle the contributions of capital deepening, labor quality and

total factor productivity to average labor productivity suggests that even after accounting

for capital deepening, total factor productivity growth has been a very important

determinant of the growth of average labor productivity. Capital deepening contributes

almost sixty percent of the growth in average labor productivity but total factor

productivity contributes thirty seven percent according to Jorgenson, Ho and Stiroh’s

(2004) decomposition. Total factor productivity is something of a black box but some of

the usual suspects include technology, managerial practices, and measurement error.

Jorgenson, Ho and Stiroh (2004) further decompose TFP into IT and non-IT components

and conclude that the non-IT components are increasingly important for productivity

growth post 1995. In Black and Lynch (2004, 2005) we argue that an additional critical

component of TFP is workplace human resource management practices or organizational

innovation. We find that during the 1990s changes in organizational innovation may

have accounted for as much as 30 percent of output growth in U.S. manufacturing.

       While there have been an increasing number of empirical studies that suggest a

significant positive association between labor productivity and organizational innovation

there has been relatively little research on why some firms decide to invest in

organizational innovation and others do not. To address this gap in the literature I use a

unique representative survey of US businesses over the 1990s to examine the patterns of

adoption of organizational innovation (both incidence and intensity) and factors

associated with higher incidence and intensity of organizational innovation. Past profits

tend to be positively associated with organizational innovation. Employers with a more
                                                                                              5

external focus and broader networks to learn about best practices (as proxied by exports,

benchmarking, being part of a multi-establishment firm) are more likely to invest in

organizational innovation. Firm investments in human capital, information technology,

R&D, and more generally in physical capital appear to be complementary and precede

investments in organizational innovation. In addition, non-unionized manufacturing

plants are more likely to have invested more broadly and intensely in organizational

innovation.

       The next two sections of the paper present a working definition of organizational

innovation and summarize the theoretical and empirical literature on the adoption and

diffusion of workplace practices and organizational innovation. Section 4 provides some

background discussion on the unique data that are used for this study and section 5

presents empirical findings on the incidence and diffusion of organizational innovation.

Section 5 examines not only the patterns of incidence and diffusion over the 1990s but

also the factors associated with such adoption and diffusion. The final section of the

paper considers the implications of the main findings of the paper for our understanding

of future productivity growth trends.



2. A Working Definition of Organizational Innovation

       The challenge with studying organizational innovation (or for that matter any

other type of intangible asset) is that there is no clear definition of what organizational

innovation is, how to measure it, or how to best quantify its contribution to output (either

current or future). Unlike physical capital, the value of organizational capital (and its

change) does not appear on the balance sheet of a firm, and when firms undertake
                                                                                           6

substantial organizational change or re-engineering this is typically treated as

“consumption” rather than an increase in the assets of a firm.

       Since the 1990s the European Union has been conducting every 4 years the

Community Innovation Survey (CIS) to monitor Europe’s progress in the area of

innovation. In 2004 the European Statistical Agency EUROSTAT began supplementing

its questions on product and process innovation in the CIS with questions on

organizational innovation. In the CIS organizational innovation is broadly defined as

changes in firm structure or management methods that are intended to improve a firm’s

use of knowledge, the quality of goods and services, or the efficiency of work flows. In

Black and Lynch (2005) we propose a more specific working definition of organizational

innovation for U.S. firms that includes the following components – workforce training,

employee voice, work design (including the use of cross-functional production

processes), and shared rewards. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all

dimensions of organizational innovation, rather a range of practices that have been found

to significantly enhance the productive capacity of a firm.

       Workforce training is most commonly undertaken to improve a firm’s use of

knowledge, quality of goods and services and the efficiency of work flows. As new

technology is introduced, training demands of a firm are likely to rise. In addition, as

team work becomes more important workers need to acquire additional skills to help

them function in a more interactive group environment. How one measures training

investments is critical for examining its impact on economic outcomes such as

productivity. Simple incidence measures such as yes and no answers to the question

whether a firm conducts any formal training programs for employees are unlikely to
                                                                                             7

capture adequately organizational innovation. Instead measures such as the proportion of

workers trained, hours of training, and types of training programs offered do a better job

of capturing the intensity of training investments by employers.

       The ability to tap into knowledge of non-managerial workers is an important

feature of organizational innovation. This can be done by measuring a second component

of organizational innovation -- “employee voice”. By this I mean those organizational

structures that give workers, especially non-managerial workers, input into the decision-

making associated with the design of the production process and greater autonomy and

discretion in the structure of their work. Traditional forms of work organization are very

task-specific; each production worker has a specific task to complete, and once they learn

how to accomplish the task, there is little independent thought involved. However, newer

forms of organization involve giving employees, specifically non-managerial workers,

more input into the production process and greater opportunities to improve efficiency.

The argument that worker voice can increase productivity is consistent with the

theoretical discussion presented in Freeman and Lazear (1995). In empirical work

researchers have included as measures of this dimension of organizational innovation

items such as whether or not a workplace is unionized, whether the firm has a works

council, the proportion of workers meeting on a regular basis to discuss workplace issues,

the use of total quality management systems, and the proportion of workers in self-

managed teams.

       In Black and Lynch (2005) we discuss a third component of organizational

innovation -- work design, that includes the use of cross-functional production processes

that result in more decentralized and flexible allocation of labor in the firm. Examples
                                                                                             8

include reengineering efforts that may involve changing the occupational structure of the

workplace (including increasing the number of technical workers), the number of workers

per supervisor, the number of levels of management within the firm, the existence and

diffusion of job rotation, and job share arrangements. We also include in this component

methods by which firms monitor their practices relative to others such as benchmarking.

       Finally, while it is not a type of organizational innovation per se, shared rewards

such as profit sharing and stock options play an important role in organizational

innovation. These types of payments can realign workers’ interests towards those of

shareholders. When workers are asked to come forward with ideas that would improve

the production process but may also put their own jobs at risk, they must be given an

incentive to do this. This can take the form of increased pay and/or more employment (as

opposed to job) security. Boning, Ichniowski, and Shaw (2001) have found strong

evidence of complementarities between employee voice and incentive pay. Kandel and

Lazear (1992) argue that introducing a profit-sharing plan for all workers in a firm may

have little or no impact on productivity unless it is linked with other workplace practices.

So while incentive based pay in the form of shared rewards is not organizational

innovation per se, it may act as glue that holds organizational innovation together.

       Theoretically organizational innovation is best thought of as a continuous

variable. However, there is no single measure that empirically will capture the full extent

of organizational innovation within a firm. It is not surprising, therefore, that researchers

have used a wide array of indicators to capture organizational innovation. Some have

simply counted up the number of particular workplace practices while others have used

factor analysis to construct indices of organizational innovation. However, just adding up
                                                                                                      9

practices may miss important synergies in organizational innovation as Milgrom and

Roberts (1995) have argued. Athey and Stern (1998) discuss how the existence of

complementarity in workplace practices implies that the adoption of one practice has

externalities for the adoption of other practices. In addition, if practices are adopted in

clusters, then some combinations of practices may occur only infrequently making it

difficult, empirically, to precisely estimate the impact of each practice on outcomes such

as productivity.

        Although there is no consensus on how to operationalize the measurement of

organizational innovation, there are numerous studies that have established a significant

relationship between various measures of such innovation and performance (see

Ichniowski and Shaw (2003) for a thorough review of this literature). Most of the studies

using data from intra-industry studies and nationally representative surveys1 conclude

that the adoption of a coherent system of new human resource management practices

such as flexible job definitions, cross-training, and work teams, along with extensive

reliance on incentive pay, results in substantially higher levels of productivity than more

traditional human resource management practices. Many of these studies have also found

evidence of the existence of synergies among workplace practices: the total impact is

greater than the sum of the parts.

        In spite of the large impact organizational innovation appears to have on

productivity, we need to ask: if this is so good why isn’t everyone doing it or doing more

of it? Moreover, have we really captured the impact of organizational innovation on

surveys of firms includes Black and Lynch (2001, 2004), Bartel (1994), Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt

productivity or is there something we have missed about the firms that adopt

organizational innovation that is really driving the economic outcomes we are interested

in? Understanding the adoption and diffusion of organizational innovation, therefore, is

critical for our ability to predict the sustainability of productivity gains obtained through

this type of innovation.


3.     Factors Associated with Organizational Innovation

       There have been very few studies that have examined the range of factors

associated with the adoption and diffusion of organizational innovation. Some

exceptions include Osterman (1994) and Blasi and Kruse 2006 using nationally

representative data on U.S. employers, and Ichniowski and Shaw (1995), Pil and

MacDuffie (1996), Nickell, Nicolitsas and Patterson (2001), and Chi, Freeman and

Kleiner (2007) using survey data on much smaller samples of employers that were

restricted to specific geographic locations or industrial sectors. The only dimension of

organizational innovation where there has been relatively more analysis of the factors

associated with adoption and diffusion is employer provided training. As summarized in

Lynch (1994) and Lynch and Black (1998) investments in worker training are higher in

larger firms and businesses that have also invested in physical capital and human capital.

       Osterman (1994), Ichniowski and Shaw (1995) (for the steel industry) and Chi,

Freeman and Kleiner (for a small panel of manufacturing firms close to Minneapolis) all

found that younger businesses were more likely to adopt workplace innovations. Younger

firms have not had time to build up entrenched management and practices that would be

threatened by the adoption or diffusion of organizational innovation. In addition, Osterman

(1994) and Chi et. al. (2007) found that small businesses and those with business
                                                                                                  11

strategies that focused on giving employees more autonomy or who believed that they

had a responsibility for employee welfare were more likely to introduce employee

involvement programs, have a total quality management program or quality circles, or

use teams.

        Institutionally unions have traditionally been the primary channel for worker

voice. The presence of a union in an organization that wants to undertake more

organizational innovation can be very beneficial. Workers in unionized businesses may

be more willing to participate in employee involvement programs since they feel the

union will protect their overall employment security. However, Freeman and Rogers

(1999) found that workers’ desire to unionize decreases if the firm they are employed in has in

place employee involvement programs so that they feel they have some voice in the firm. In

addition, unions may view the introduction of alternative channels for worker voice as a

challenge to their authority and a way to limit their power and influence. So the

relationship between unionization and work practices that increase employee

involvement in decision making is not clear a priori. Chi et. al. (2007) and Ichniowski

and Shaw (1995) find a negative association between unionization and likelihood of

introducing an employee involvement program whereas Osterman (1994) finds no

impact. Interestingly Chi et. al. (2007) find that once introduced, unionized firms are less

likely to terminate such programs. Most studies of the adoption of workplace innovations

have not had data on past profitability of the business. However, Pil and MacDuffie

(1996) in their international study of the auto industry find some weak support for the

hypothesis that worst performing plants are more likely to introduce workplace

reorganization. Nickell et. al. (2001) also find evidence for a small sample of U.K. firms

in the 1980s that businesses are more likely to invest more in reorganization when the
                                                                                            12

real output price or productivity is declining. Declining performance may be due to

increased competition both domestically and internationally. Osterman (1994) and Blasi

and Kruse (2006) (using data from the same survey used in this paper) find that firms in

industries with higher exports more likely to innovate. However the Blasi Kruse (2006)

analysis is done only at the industry group level and includes a limited number of other

controls – firm size and union status.

       Finally, some of the changes we see in work design are associated with the

introduction and diffusion of information technologies within the firm. For example,

email facilitates greater communication between and across workers, both managerial

and non-managerial. Brynjolfsson, Hitt and Yang, (2002) and Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and

Hitt (2002) have argued that technical change and organizational change are

complementary activities. So investments in information technology and other types of

capital may facilitate organizational innovation.

       Ideally any examination of the adoption, diffusion and termination of investments

in organizational innovation should be done on a representative sample of businesses

over time and control for profitability, capital investments including investments in IT,

product market competition, management quality, unionization, and characteristics of

workers. Due to data limitations no previous study has done this. This study addresses

this gap in the literature. Using longitudinal data from a unique nationally representative

survey of businesses I am able to examine a wide range of factors and their association

with the adoption and diffusion of organizational innovation. My analysis focuses on

five main research issues. The first is the role of past profitability in the decision to

undertake current or future investment in organizational innovation. On the one hand it
                                                                                            13

may be the case that those businesses that have been doing poorly in the past may have a

greater need to change and may find it is easier to get employee buy-in to dramatically

reorganize work in a time of crisis. On the other hand, organizational innovation is a

costly investment so the firms most likely to adopt and invest extensively in

organizational innovation are those who can afford to do so.

       The second issue I examine is the role of external focus and networks in the

adoption and diffusion of organizational innovation. It may well be the case that those

businesses that export a higher fraction of their output, use benchmarking and are part of

a multi-establishment firm are more likely to invest in organizational innovation.

       The third issue is the complementarity between investments in information

technology and organizational innovation. While it has been hypothesized that such a

complementarity exists, having information on past as well as current investments in IT

and organizational innovation is critical to examine sequencing of investment.

       Fourth, those businesses with greater internal capacity to take advantage of

organizational innovation (i.e. more educated employees and more employees with

“softer” skills such as communication) are more to adopt and have higher diffusion of

organizational innovation than employers with less skilled workforces.

       Finally, there will be forces that will either resist or be in favor of organizational

change. I investigate whether older businesses, since they are more likely to have

entrenched management, are less likely to introduce such changes. The effect of a union

is ambiguous. On the one hand some unions may oppose organizational change because it

is perceived as leading to a loss of union power. On the other hand, the presence of a

union may lead workers to more willingly participate in new work practices because they
                                                                                                         14

feel that their employment is more secure. Moreover, managers in non-unionized plants

may favor adopting these practices as a way to reduce the probability of a plant becoming

unionized. Finally, certain occupational groups may be relatively more in favor of such

investment – technical workers, while others may be more opposed because it challenges

their traditional authority – supervisors.


4.       Data

         The data used in this paper come from the Educational Quality of the Workforce

National Employers Survey, EQW-NES. The first round of the EQW-NES was

administered by the U.S. Bureau of the Census as a telephone survey in August and

September 1994 to a nationally representative sample of more than 3,000 private

establishments with more than 20 employees2. The respondents were asked to provide

data for the previous year. The survey represents a unique source of information on how

employers recruit workers, organize work, invest in physical capital, and utilize education

and training investments. The survey over-sampled establishments in the manufacturing

sector and establishments with more than 100 employees. Public sector employees, not-

for-profit institutions, and corporate headquarters were excluded from the sample. The

target respondent in the manufacturing sector was the plant manager and in the non-

manufacturing sector was the local business site manager. However, the survey was

designed to allow for multiple respondents so that information could be obtained from

establishments that kept financial information such as the book value of capital or the


2
  The first survey was designed by Lisa Lynch in collaboration with EQW Co-Directors
Robert Zemsky and Peter Cappelli. The second survey included a subset of questions identical to this first
round plus an extensive section on employers’ school-to-work activities. The surveys were supported by
the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, US Department of Education.
                                                                                              15

cost of goods and materials used in production at a separate finance office (typically at

corporate headquarters for multi-establishment enterprises). The sample frame for the

survey was the Bureau of the Census SSEL file, one of the most comprehensive and up-

to-date listings of establishments in the United States. Although the sampling frame omits

establishments with less than 20 employees, it captures establishments that employ

approximately three-quarters of all workers in the U.S.

        The response rate in the first round EQW National Employers Survey for

manufacturing and non-manufacturing establishments was 72 percent. This is

substantially higher than most other voluntary establishment surveys. However, not all of

the establishments who participated in the survey completed all parts of the survey by the

interview cutoff date of October 1, 1994. Therefore, the final number of establishments in

the sample for which all parts of the survey were completed was 3167, a slightly lower 63

percent 'completed' survey response rate.

        A second survey was administered by the Census Bureau in August 1997 with a

response rate of 78 percent3. The final sample for the second round of the EQW-NES

included 3081 establishments -- 1827 in the manufacturing and 1254 in the non-

manufacturing sector. The second survey was considerably longer in duration than the

first survey (close to 45 minutes). Therefore, in spite of the high overall response rate

there are a large number of businesses that do not provide information on all questions

asked including items such as the value of shipments and sales, the book value of the

capital stock, the costs of materials, wages paid to workers and the proportion of workers

trained. This will reduce the final sample sizes used for analysis in this paper.


3
 There was oversampling of establishments in California, Kentucky, Michigan, Maryland and
Pennsylvania and a sub sample of establishments that had been contacted in the first round.
                                                                                            16

       A panel of 766 establishments (approximately two-thirds of which were

manufacturing establishments) can be constructed from the two rounds of the EQW-NES.

The panel response rate (for first round establishments who were contacted and

completed the interview in the second round) was 74 percent. The EWQ-NES was

designed so that a large fraction of the manufacturing establishments could be matched

with the Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Research Database, the LRD, which pools

information from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers and the Census of Manufacturers.

In this paper I will use data on sales, capital expenditures, employment, and material and

labor costs to construct measures of operating profits per worker and investment per

worker.


5.     Empirical Results

       Using the unique data described above this section presents detailed findings on

the incidence and extent of organizational innovation and the factors associated with the

adoption and diffusion of organizational innovation during the 1990s. The empirical

work is organized as follows. Descriptive statistics on the incidence and intensity of

organizational innovation for manufacturing and non-manufacturing businesses are

presented first. A cross section and longitudinal analysis of the factors associated with

organizational innovation in the manufacturing sector follows. Finally, I conclude with

the empirical analysis of the factors associated with organizational innovation for the

non-manufacturing sector.

          Description of Practices. Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics on the

incidence and intensity of various dimensions of organizational innovation. While the

EQW-NES survey has information on a lengthy list of workplace practices, I focus on
                                                                                          17

those that have been the most significant in previous work on determinants of

productivity and wages (see Black and Lynch (1996, 2001, 2004)). These include the

proportion of production workers receiving training, the proportion of non-managerial

workers meeting regularly to discuss workplace issues, the fraction of workers in self-

managed teams, and the proportion of workers who participate in job rotation. For each

of these practices I also construct an incidence measure that equals 1 if any fraction of the

workforce participates in the practice and zero otherwise. In addition, the 1997 survey

included a question on whether or not the establishment underwent any re-engineering

over the past three years. Re-engineering production is a radical change in the

organizational structure of a company and usually means moving away from highly

specialized and compartmentalized departments to more cross-functional teams that

follow a product through from development to final distribution. Since this is such a

major disruption to the production process it is not surprising that the survey finds only a

relatively small fraction underwent this massive organizational change – 12 percent of

manufacturing establishments and 9 percent of non-manufacturing establishments over

the period 1994-1997.

       The two practices with the highest incidence include production worker training

and the percentage of non-managerial workers meeting on a regular basis to discuss

workplace issues. Over 80 percent of manufacturing and non-manufacturing

establishments provided training for production workers in 1994 and more than three-

quarters of all businesses reported having some non-managerial workers meeting

regularly to discuss workplace issues. However, less than one half of all employers use

job rotation and slightly less than one third of employers report having self-managed
                                                                                            18

teams. Manufacturing establishments report a higher incidence of usage of job rotation

while non-manufacturing establishments report a higher incidence of employer provided

training for non-managerial workers. Interestingly there has not been an across the board

increase in the incidence of the practices associated with organizational innovation over

the period of 1994 to 1997. In fact, in several of the dimensions of organizational

innovation examined in this survey we see the incidence actually declining by 1997. This

suggests that there is experimentation in practices going on and some firms reducing or

even terminating programs such as allowing employees to work in self-managed teams.

       The effect of organizational innovation on the productive capacity of a firm will

depend not only upon the incidence but also upon the extent of investments in such

innovation. In Table 1 we see that while almost half of all manufacturing establishments

report having job rotation on average, only 23.7 percent of workers rotated their jobs.

Approximately 30 percent of all establishments report having some workers in self-

managed teams yet the extent of workers in self-managed teams is much lower. Over the

period 1994-1997 the fraction of workers in manufacturing receiving training remained

relatively constant around one half, while the fraction rose in non-manufacturing from

slightly less than half of all workers to two thirds of all workers. While the percentage

of employers with workers meeting on a regular basis to discuss workplace issues

declined over this time period, the percentage of workers meeting regularly increased.

So the decline (from a high level) of the incidence of this practice across employers is

paralleled by more extensive employee participation within those firms who did have

regular meetings with workers.
                                                                                            19

        One of the reasons for the high response rate to this survey was a keen interest by

the respondents (plant and business site managers) to find out what worked and what

others were doing in this area of innovation. This suggests that there may have been

experimentation with different practices. Table 2 shows the percentage of business that

changed their investments in organizational innovation (+/-5 percent or more from their

1994 level) over the period 1994-1997. There was a great deal of change in the fraction

of workers trained and the fraction of workers meeting regularly. In general the trend

was to increase this practice but there were firms that reduced their activities in these

areas. In addition, the extent of job rotation and workers in self-managed teams seems to

have stalled at relatively low levels, especially in non-manufacturing. In Black and

Lynch (2004) we found that those manufacturing employers with a higher fraction of

their production workers in self-managed teams had lower productivity, everything else

constant. So the fact that we do not see more diffusion of this practice likely reflects

managerial experience of lower productivity gains associated with this practice compared

to others.

        Figure 1 shows the distribution of practices in 1997 across our survey for the

manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. More manufacturing establishments (70

percent) had three or more practices than non-manufacturing businesses (65 percent).

After controlling for the intensity of usage of the practice (only counting a practice if the

percentage of workers engaged in it is above the mean for that practice) we see in the

bottom half of this figure that only forty percent of manufacturing and thirty-eight

percent of non-manufacturing businesses have intensely invested in these practices. So

while this figure indicates that a high fraction of employers report that they are
                                                                                                   20

innovating on these dimensions, there is still room for more intensive adoption of these

practices within firms.

           Organizational Innovation in Manufacturing: Cross Section Results. I have

separated the sample into manufacturing and non-manufacturing because for the

manufacturing sector I am able to match the survey information on organizational

innovation with data from the Census Bureau’s longitudinal research database, the LRD.

Table 3 presents results from probit models of the factors associated with the probability

of having each specific dimension of organizational innovation. The dependent variables

have a value of 0 or 1 simply indicating whether or not establishment has invested at all

in the specific practice at two different points in time – 1994 and 1997. I estimate a

separate equation for each survey year.

           The explanatory variables are grouped into five categories – external focus

variables, technology, profitability, skill capacity and other establishment characteristics.

For measures of external focus I include whether or not the establishment is part of a

multi-establishment firm, the percentage of the main product that is exported4, and

whether or not the establishment benchmarks its practices to other organizations. To

capture IT technology I include the percentage of non-managerial workers who use

computers in their job. Since I am able to match many of the manufacturing businesses

in the EQW survey with the Census Bureau’s LRD I can construct the average annual

investment per worker and the average annual operating profit per worker over the six

years prior to the reference year for the measure of organizational innovation (see the

appendix for more details on both of these variables). This allows me to examine how

past profits and investments correlate with present investments in organizational
4
    Missing data on exports in the EQW-NES survey is supplemented with data from the Census LRD.
                                                                                           21

innovation. By using average values on investment and profitability I smooth year to

year fluctuations. Moreover, using six years allows me to maximize the number of

Economic Censuses (conducted every five years) used in the construction of the

variables. For 1994, I am also able to include whether or not the business had any R&D

activities either at its own site or at another establishment within the firm.

       Using information from the EQW survey I construct two measures of skills

capacity of the establishment. The first is the average education of workers in the

establishment using information on average education in the establishment for 5

occupational categories and the employment share for each of these occupations within

the establishment as weights. The second measure is a 0-1 indicator of whether or not

communication skills are a high priority in recruitment by the employer. Other

establishment characteristics controlled for include whether or not the establishment is

unionized, the age of the establishment, the total number of workers, the share of workers

by occupational category, the fraction of employees who are female or minority, and

industry controls. Unfortunately questions on age of the establishment and R&D activity

were only asked in the 1994 survey so I am not able to include these measures in the

1997 equation.

       In general we see in Table 3 that firms that have a more “external” focus are more

likely to have adopted some types of organizational innovation. However, the magnitude

of the association between these external factors and the different dimensions of

organizational innovation is not uniform. Being part of a multi-establishment firm is

positively associated with adopting several dimensions of organizational innovation

while the share of production exported is actually associated with a lower probability of
                                                                                            22

training production workers. In addition, those businesses that have a larger fraction of

their non-managerial workers using computers in their job or invest in R&D are more

likely to train, have workers meeting on a regular basis to discuss workplace issues, or

have some workers organized in self-managed teams. Lagged capital investments per

worker (that include IT and non-IT related capital) are positively associated with having

workers meeting regularly but negatively associated with having job rotation in 1997.

       We see little association between profits and most dimensions of innovation in

Table 3. The one exception is the positive association between past profits and having

workers meet regularly to discuss workplace issues. In terms of skill capacity, those

establishments with more educated employees and employees with more effective

communication skills are also more likely to have adopted various dimensions of

organizational innovation.

       The impact of unions on organizational innovation is mixed. On some

dimensions such as shared rewards and training, the presence of a union increases the

probability of there being this type of workplace innovation. However, non-unionized

firms are more likely to have job rotation and non-managerial workers meeting regularly.

This is in spite of the fact that in Black and Lynch (2004) we found that unionized

establishments that have workers meeting on a regular basis have significantly higher

productivity than otherwise similar non-unionized establishments.

       Finally, larger employers and those establishments with a higher fraction of

production workers are more likely to adopt these practices than smaller employers.

Interestingly, age of the establishment does not seem to be a factor in adoption of

organizational innovation after controlling for other characteristics of the establishment.
                                                                                            23

           Table 4 examines a different margin of organizational innovation – the diffusion

of specific practices within an establishment5. Those employers that benchmark their

processes with other firms are more likely to have a higher fraction of their workers

engaged in job rotation, in training, meeting regularly to discuss workplace issues and in

self-managed teams. In addition, businesses that have been more profitable in the past or

that have a higher fraction of their workers using computers in their jobs are likely to

have a higher fraction of their workforce meeting regularly or in self-managed teams.

Engaging in R&D and having a more skilled workforce is also positively associated with

intensive use of most of the dimensions of organizational innovation. However, older

and unionized establishments are likely to have a lower diffusion rate of these workplace

practices. Finally, the association between lagged capital investment per worker and

organizational innovation seems to vary by practice and over time.

           The previous two tables have examined each of the dimensions of organizational

innovation separately. In Table 5 I allow for complementarities and synergies in these

practices and examine first the factors associated with undertaking a significantly large

organizational innovation -- re-engineering and then factors associated with different

summary measures of the extent of practices within manufacturing establishments.

Column one presents estimates from a probit analysis of the probability of a business re-

engineering their production process over the period 1994-1997 as a function of 1997

characteristics of the establishment. Benchmarking is associated with an increase in the

probability of re-engineering, as does being a large firm that is part of a multi-

establishment firm. There appears to be complementarity between investments in IT and

re-engineering a business. In addition, businesses that have done better in the past with

    Tobit estimates with cutoffs at 0 and 100.
                                                                                              24

respect to profits are more likely to re-engineer. This suggests that deep pockets rather

than crisis times are most relevant for undertaking this type of major organizational

innovation.

       The remaining columns examine various summary measures of the other

dimensions of organizational innovation. I first construct a raw count measure that just

adds up each of the practices irrespective of how intensely a business has implemented

the specific practice. I then re-define count to only include a practice if the fraction of

workers engaged in the practice is equal to or greater than the mean for manufacturing.

This variable is labeled “count intense” and equations using these two types of measures

are estimated using ordered probit models. The final dependent variable is constructed

by using principal components analysis to create an index of organizational innovation.

Estimation for this dependent variable is done using standard multiple regression

analysis.

       Regardless of survey year, those establishments that benchmark, have been more

profitable in the past, have prioritized recruiting workers with high communication skills,

have a higher fraction of production and technical workers, or are non-union are much

more likely to have adopted a more comprehensive range of practices associated with

organizational innovation. In addition, in 1997 we see that those employers who have

invested more in IT and have a more educated workforce are more likely to have invested

more broadly in organizational innovation.

       In sum, in the cross section analysis it appears that there is some evidence of

complementarity in investments in IT and investments in organizational innovation. In

addition, non-union businesses that have more educated employees, a greater share of
                                                                                                         25

production workers, and an external focus are more likely to invest extensively and

intensively in organizational innovation. Finally, investments in this type of innovation

seem to occur more in businesses that have been doing well in terms of profits rather than

in businesses in financial crisis.

        Organizational Innovation in Manufacturing: Panel Results. In spite of the

wealth of information contained in the EQW-NES survey and the Census data, this

analysis may not control for all factors that are associated with organizational innovation.

The cross section estimates may still be subject to omitted variable bias due to

unobserved establishment characteristics. One can remove biases due to omitted but

time-invariant establishment-specific effects using panel data. Table 6 presents fixed

effect estimates for changes in the extent of organizational innovation. Two measures for

the dependent variable are used – changes in the raw count in practices between 1994 and

1997 and re-engineering (this is a change measure since it equals 1 if the establishment

re-engineered at any time during 1994-1997)6.              The first column of results presents

estimates from a standard fixed effect model. The second column treats the change in

investment in organizational innovation over the period 1994-1997 as a function of

changes in establishment characteristics over this period along with the level of those

characteristics in 1994. The introduction of lagged level variables in this first differenced

equation is consistent with assuming that the level of practices in 1997 depends both

upon the level of an explanatory variable in 1997 and its cumulated value up to 1994.

        In equation 1 for both dependent variables we see that those businesses that grew

in employment over this period were also more likely to change their investment in


6
 This is perhaps a better specification for re-engineering than what was presented in Table 5 column 1
where the explanatory variables are in levels.
                                                                                             26

organizational innovation. This is potentially an important result since much of the

discussion on organizational innovation seems to suggest that this type of change in

workplace practices results in a decreased demand for labor.

       In Table 6 the coefficient of the change in lagged average profitability is not

significant in any equation. It may be that changes in employment are picking up the

relative economic health of these establishments or there is actually not enough variation

in this average value over this time to pin down its coefficient. Alternatively,

profitability in the cross sectional equation may have simply been a proxy for the overall

quality of a firm and of its management. Note that while the coefficient on the change in

profits is not significant, the lagged level of average profits in 1994 has a negative and

significant coefficient in the equation for the change in the count measure between 1994

and 1997, but not in the one for reengineering. Conditional on recent past profitability,

lower accumulated profits in the more distant past seem to be associated with

organizational innovation further down the road.

        Those employers that change their recruitment priorities and hire workers with

higher communication skills are also more likely to increase their investment in

organizational innovation. In equation 2 we control for the cumulated stock of

investments in organizational capital by also including the level of the explanatory

variables in 1994. Now a richer and more complex story emerges about investments in

organizational innovation. There appears to be a complementarity between the amount of

organizational innovation and investments in IT. Both the level and the change of the

percentage of non-managers using computers are positive and significant in equation 2.
                                                                                           27

       When we examine equations 3 and 4 in Table 6 we see some differences in the

factors associated with changes in the count of practices versus re-engineering. For re-

engineering, which is perhaps the most extensive and expensive form of organizational

innovation, having in place a more educated workforce or being part of a multi-

establishment firm resulted in an increased likelihood that the plant re-engineered its

production process. Although the fraction of non-managers using computers is never

significant, the coefficient on the change in the lagged average investment per worker is

positive and significant for re-engineering in equation 4 suggesting complementarities

between past investment in all types of physical capital and more recent investments in

organizational innovation. Those establishments who were more inward focused in 1994

or had invested in softer skills in their workforce were also more likely to adopt

additional dimensions of organizational innovation over the period 1994-1997.

       In sum, looking at the results for the cross section and panel equations together

we see some evidence, especially in the cross section equations, that those businesses

who have had higher past profits are better positioned to undertake investments in

organizational innovation. Past profits tend to be positively associated with

organizational innovation. Employers with a more external focus and broader networks

to learn about best practices (as proxied by exports, benchmarking, being part of a multi-

establishment firm, and having a more diverse workforce) are more likely to invest in

organizational innovation. The positive association seen in the cross section results

between investing in R&D and investing in organizational capital may reflect a broader

taste for innovation by management. Investments in human capital, information

technology and more generally in physical capital appear to be complementary and
                                                                                           28

precede investments in organizational innovation. Plants that have more employees and a

higher share of production and technical workers are more likely to adopt and invest

more intensively. Finally, non-unionized plants are more likely to have invested more

broadly and intensely in most dimensions of organizational innovation.

       Due to confidentiality restrictions, I have not been able to report industry

coefficients in each of the equations presented. Nevertheless, there are clear patterns

which emerge across sub-sectors within manufacturing. Primary and fabricated metals

along with establishments in food and tobacco are much more likely to adopt and invest

more intensively in the various dimensions of organizational innovation examined here.

However, the one industry that consistently has a significantly lower probability of

investing is textile and apparel. This final result is perhaps not that surprising given the

looming elimination of the Multi-Fiber Agreement facing this industry at the time of

these surveys. These results suggest that there are important industry differences in the

adoption and diffusion of organizational innovation that would be important to consider

in prioritizing sectors for intra-industry research.

        Organizational Innovation in the Non-Manufacturing Sector. Tables 7-9 re-

examine the factors associated with organizational innovation but now focusing on the

non-manufacturing sector. There are clearly important differences between these two

broad sectors such as average size of establishment. However, one of the most important

differences between these sectors in the EQW-NES surveys has to do with the diffusion

of information technology. One in three non-managerial workers in the manufacturing

sector uses computers in their jobs while, as shown in Table 7, two-thirds of non-

managerial workers in non-manufacturing in 1997 use computers in their job.
                                                                                                             29

Unfortunately it is not possible to match the EQW-NES survey for non-manufacturing

establishments with establishment level data from the Census Bureau such as lagged

operating profits since these data are not collected at this level of disaggregation by the

Census Bureau7. Nevertheless we can see how other factors are associated with adoption

and diffusion of organizational capital in non-manufacturing establishments. In

particular, it will be interesting to see if we see the same associations between

investments in human capital and information technology with investments in

organizational capital.

         Table 7 presents findings on the probability of adopting various components of

organizational innovation. As in the results for manufacturing we see that using

benchmarks, having a more educated workforce and investing in R&D is associated with

an increase in the probability of adopting several dimensions of organizational

innovation. However investments in IT seem to only be positively and significantly

associated with training and not any other component. The coefficient for unionization is

insignificant with the exception of the probability of having shared rewards in 1994

where it appears with a positive sign. Larger establishments (in terms of employment)

are more likely in some years to have shared rewards for non-managerial workers or to

have job rotation.

         Table 8 contains the results on the diffusion of various dimensions of

organizational innovation. We see that investing in R&D is associated with a higher

proportion of workers getting training, a higher fraction of non-managerial workers

meeting to discuss workplace issues, and a higher fraction of employees working in self-


7
 I also do not include fraction of product exported due to missing data for 1997 that can not be filled in
with Census data. However, for 1994 this is never significant for any equations estimated.
                                                                                         30

managed teams. Unionized establishments have a higher fraction of non-managerial

workers receiving training but a lower fraction of workers meeting regularly. For the

first time we see the age of establishment coming in significant with younger

establishments, as well as smaller establishments, more likely to have a higher diffusion

of organizational innovation. In addition we see a positive association between the

diffusion of information technology and the fraction of workers meeting to discuss

workplace issues in 1994.

       In Table 9 I allow for complementarities and synergies in these practices and

examine the factors associated with undertaking re-engineering and the number of

practices adopted in non-manufacturing establishments. Column one presents probit

estimates of the probability of a business re-engineering their production process over the

period 1994-1997 as a function of 1997 characteristics of the establishment.

Benchmarking, being part of a multi-establishment firm and having a more educated

workforce are all positively associated with undertaking this major organizational

innovation.

       The remaining columns in Table 9 present results on the degree of investment in

organizational innovation by counting the number of practices, only counting practices

when they pass a threshold of diffusion, or using an index of organizational innovation as

the dependent variable. In general we see that establishments with a more external focus

as proxied by benchmarking or being part of a multi-establishment firm are more likely to

have undertaken multiple dimensions of organizational innovation. Those establishments

with more educated workers and who have invested more in IT are also more likely to
                                                                                            31

have invested in multiple components of organizational innovation. Unionization is

never significant nor is size of establishment except in 1994 for the index of practices.

       Finally, while I can not report specific coefficients I can summarize the

relationships between sub sectors in non-manufacturing and different dimensions of

organizational innovation. In general the sub sector that is more likely to invest in

various dimensions of organizational innovation even after controlling for a broad range

of other factors is the wholesale trade sector. Not surprisingly, the likelihood of workers

working in self-managed teams is greater in the construction industry and less in financial

services. Workers in the communications and utilities sectors are more likely to be in job

rotation and those in business services are more likely to receive employer provided

training. These results highlight the importance of including a wider range of controls

when trying to examine the relationship between industry and organizational innovation.

They also suggest so additional sectors to be studied in more detail in the non-

manufacturing sector.


6.     Conclusion

       The latest measures of productivity growth for 2006 suggest a slowdown in

growth from the previous decade. Does this mean that the so-called “New Economy” has

returned to the “Same-Old Economy”? The answer will depend in large part on the

investments companies will make in innovation – both technological and organizational.

This paper has provided evidence to suggest that at least in terms of investments in

organizational innovation there are several factors that seem to be highly correlated with

this type of innovation. These include having a skilled workforce, higher past operating
                                                                                            32

profits, significant past investments in information technology, an external focus on the

part of management, and being a relatively young and non-unionized business.

       With an increasingly global economy it is likely that U.S. managers are going to

continue to be more outwardly focused. Profit rates are at historical highs so businesses

certainly have the financial resources to invest in organizational innovation. However,

since the later part of 2006 business investment in equipment and software has slowed

sharply. This may have negative consequences on productivity growth directly and

indirectly due to the complementarity between IT and organizational innovation.

Unionization in the private sector in the U.S. continues to decline so we might expect to

see more investment by non-unionized employers in organizational innovation.

However, as discussed in Black and Lynch 2004 and 2001, those unionized

establishments that also invest in organizational innovation have significantly higher

productivity than similar non-unionized establishments. Therefore, the impact of this

decline in unionization on productivity may be mixed.

       An important factor that facilitates investments in organizational innovation is the

skill level of our workforce. This is a potential area of concern. From the OECD

International Adult Literacy Survey we know that only half of the U.S. adult population

aged 16-65 years of age has the minimum proficiency necessary, as identified by the

National Institute for Literacy, to succeed in the labor market. From one in five to as

many as one in four U.S. adults scored in the lowest category for the three literacy areas

that were tested -- prose, document, and quantitative literacy. Given this skills gap, firms

that would like to invest in organizational innovation may find themselves constrained by

skills shortages in our economy.

           The final factor associated with more organizational innovation is the age of

establishment, in particular for the non-manufacturing sector. The bad news here is that

we do not know much about these firms. Our business statistics have not kept up with

the changing nature of our economy8. Not only do they not track important forms of

intangible capital such as organizational innovation that have played an increasingly

important role in productivity growth in recent years, they also provide limited coverage

of new young businesses. Census data limitations also mean that we are not able to

examine the relationship between past profits and innovation in the non-manufacturing

sector as we are able to do for manufacturing. Addressing these data limitations would

be enormously helpful to researchers and policy makers alike so that they may better

understand the role of all types of innovation for the U.S. economy.

Shared rewards: Does your establishment contribute towards stock options or profit
sharing?

Job Rotation: Job rotation refers to a work design system that allows employees to rotate
between different jobs. What percent of, or how many non-managerial and non-
supervisory employees are currently involved in job rotation?

Production worker formal training: Formal training includes all types of training
activities that have a predefined objective as opposed to informal on-the-job training.
Examples of structured or formal training include seminars, lectures, workshops,
audiovisual presentations, apprenticeship, and structured on-the-job learning. What
percent of, or how many, production workers received formal training last year?

Workers meeting regularly: What percent of, or how many, non-managerial and non-
supervisory employees are involved in regularly scheduled meetings to discuss workplace
issues?

Self-managed teams: Self managed teams have some degree of responsibility and
discretion over such decisions as methods of work, tasks schedules, assignment of
members to different tasks, and feedback about group performance. What percent of, or
how many, non-managerial and non-supervisory employees are currently involved in
self-managed teams?

Reengineering: Did this establishment undergo any re-engineering over the past three
years?

For Manufacturing Establishments Only:

Using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Research Database – average annual
operating profit between 1987-1992 or 1990-1995; average annual investment per worker
1987-1992 or 1990-1995. Operating profit is calculated as total revenue – (labor +
materials costs).
