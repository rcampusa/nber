Ethnic Differences in Demographic Behavior in the United States:
Has There Been Convergence?
Michael R. Haines
NBER Working Paper No. 9042
July 2002
JEL No. N3, J1



                                               ABSTRACT

         This paper looks at the fertility, mortality, and marriage experience of racial, ethnic, and nativity
groups in the United States from the 19th to the late 20th centuries. The first part consist of a description
and critique of the racial and ethnic categories used in the federal census and in the published vital
statistics. The second part looks at these three dimensions of demographic behavior. There has been both
absolute and relative convergence of fertility across groups, It has been of relatively recent origin and has
been due, in large part, to stable, or even slightly increasing, birth rates for the majority white population
combined with declining birth rates for blacks and the Asian-origin, Hispanic-origin, and Amerindian
populations. This has not been true for mortality. The black population has experienced absolute
convergence but relative deterioration in mortality (neonatal and infant mortality, maternal mortality,
expectation of life at birth, and age-adjusted death rates), in contrast to the Amerindian and Asian-origin
populations. The Asian-origin population actually now has age-adjusted death rates significantly lower
than those for the white population. The disadvantaged condition of the black population and the
deteriorating social safety net are the likely origins of this outcome. Finally, there was a trend toward
earlier and more extensive marriage from about 1900 up to the 1960s. At this point, coincident with the
end of the “Baby Boom,” there has been a movement to later marriage for both males and females among
whites, blacks, and the Hispanic-origin populations. This trend has been more extreme in the black
population, especially among females. There has also been a significant rise in proportions never-married
at ages 45-54 among blacks and, to a lesser extent, among Hispanics. So here too, there has been some
divergence.

THE CONCEPTS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY IN THE UNITED STATES CENSUS AND VITAL STATISTICS
             The fascination of Americans with race, ethnicity, and counting have always
come together in the census.       From the earliest census's division of the population

into three groups to the 63 ethnic categories in Census 2000, the census has both
reflected social realities and changes and affected our perceptions of them. 1      This
article summarizes the most recent estimates of trends in population, births, deaths,

marriages, and divorces for most ethnic categories throughout American history.         It is
meant to serve as a reference about national ethnic trends from 1790 through 2000.

Perhaps the most striking patterns show that, while ethnic group behavior has largely
converged in fertility and marriage patterns, African-Americans continue to be

markedly less healthy than whites or Asian-Americans.
    The issue of measuring and analyzing racial and ethnic differences in population

characteristics and vital processes has long been a feature of demography in the
United States.       The federal census has been collecting data on race since the first

census of 1790, though that census merely divided the population into free whites, all
other free persons, and slaves.       The origin of this was in the Constitution itself

which specified in Article I, Section 2 that the House of Representatives was to be

apportioned “by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to

Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all

other persons.”       The “three fifths compromise” allowed slave states to count three

fifths of their (disenfranchised and thus non-voting) slave populations for the

purposes of Congressional representation.       This distinction continued up to 1810, when

the terms “colored persons” and “Indians not taxed” first appeared.        In 1820, the free

colored and slave populations were explicitly classified by age and sex.        Since slaves
were only persons of sub-Saharan African descent, no further racial distinction was

used.    Also, a category of “foreigners not naturalized” was given (and used again in

1830).       This distinction continued up through 1850.   In 1860, the categories of
“Asiatics,” “Civilized Indians,” and “Half-Breeds” were added for some states. 2        In



       1
         It should be strongly emphasized that the concept of race is a social one
with no implication of a biological or genetic significance of component. For a
detailed discussion of racial and ethnic classifications in the United States Census,
see Lee [1993] for the 1890-1990 period, Edmonston and Schultze [1995, ch. 7] for the
1850 to 1990 period, and Anderson and Fienberg [1999, ch. 8] for the entire range of
the federal census.
         2
         Asiatics (likely almost all Chinese) were tabulated only for California,
while the ambiguous category of “Half-Breeds” was used only for Wisconsin and New
Mexico. “Civilized Indians” were those Amerindian people living in regular domiciles
in areas subject to enumeration.
                                             2

addition, in 1850, 1860, and 1870, the instruction was added to make a distinction
between blacks and mulattos, though precisely how this was to be done was left

unclear.3    A listing of the racial categories used in the U.S. censuses from 1790 to
1990 is provided in Appendix Tables A-1 and A-2.

    The question of nativity was not fully addressed until the census of 1850, the
first census to enumerate each individual (i.e., a nominal census).     The previous six

censuses had been enumerations by the name of head of household with summary
categories of persons by age, sex, and race.     As mentioned, the 1820 and 1830 censuses

had questions about “foreigners not naturalized,” but the 1850 census asked a question
about each person’s place of birth – state within the United States if native born and

country of birth if foreign born.    This has continued up to the present.   In 1870,
questions were added about the nativity of the person’s father and mother, although

initially it was only native or foreign born.     For the censuses of 1880 to 1970,
questions were asked about the detailed nativity of the father and mother (state

within the United States, country if abroad), although these were only for samples for

1940-1970.4    With these questions, it was possible to tabulate the population by

nativity.     This was extensively done with a major distinction being made between the

native white and the foreign-born white populations.     Later categories were created

for native white of native parentage and native white of foreign or mixed parentage.

After 1970, however, the nativity of parents was no longer a question.

    Some additional questions were added at various points in time that shed light on
ethnicity.     For example, a question on mother tongue as inserted in the censuses of

1910-1930 and again in 1960 and 1970 (for samples).     Language spoken was also asked in
1910.   This has been useful, for example, in analyzing some subgroups such as the

Yiddish-speaking Jewish population) for which separate identification is otherwise
difficult or impossible. [See, for example, Condran and Kramerow, 1991.]     For

immigrants, the number of years in the United States in 1900-1920 and again for 1970-
1990.   The ambiguous and difficult question on “ancestry” was first asked in 1980 and

         For an account of instructions to enumerators up through the 2000 census, see
U.S. Bureau of the Census [1979, 2002].
        4
         Sampling began in 1940 in which everyone was enumerated on the main form and
then persons on the “sample lines” were asked supplementary questions. The same
procedure was repeated in 1950. 25% of persons were asked to answer additional
questions in 1960 by the enumerator. In 1970, the first true self-enumerating census,
a variety of different sample groups were asked to answer additional questions. In
1980, the practice of short and long forms began, with everyone enumerated at least on
the short form. When enumerators were used, they were instructed to allow respondents
to self identify race (which, or course, would occur with self enumeration).
                                             3

was repeated in 1990 and 2000.    It is purely self identification and difficult to
interpret.

    The question of race has undergone a number of changes over time.      At the 1870
census, slavery had legally ceased to exist in the United States, and the non-white

population was then divided into “colored” (African American), “civilized Indians,”
Chinese, and Japanese.    This taxonomy was continued in 1880, but in 1890 the black
population was divided into blacks, mulattos, quadroons, and octoroons (see Appendix

Table A-2).    A simpler classification was restored in 1900, but the question on

mulattos was asked again in 1910 and 1920.       Thereafter, the black population was
identified as “Negro” or, from 1970, also as black.       From 1910, the number of

categories for other groups has proliferated, as Table A-1 shows.       In 1930, a decision

was made to reclassify Mexicans as non-white, but that decision was reversed in the

1930s.   Consequently, the 1940 census retabulated the population from 1930 with

Mexicans placed among whites and published these results along with the 1940

tabulations.    The 1990 census had 16 racial categories to choose from, including a

residual category of “Other race.”

    The detailed tabulation of race, nativity, and ethnicity in the published volumes

(for example by age and sex for geographic subunits) closely followed the official

categories up to 1860, although detailed tabulations of the native- and foreign-born

populations by age, sex, and race did not appear until 1870.      Tabulations of the
population by age, sex, race, and nativity at least for states then have been

published up through the present, although the non-white population has sometimes been
aggregated together (e.g., 1940-1960).    For 1880, all non-white groups were placed

together for the tables in a group called “colored.”       From 1870 to 1970, there was a
distinction of the native-born and foreign-born white population, though for 1950-1970

it was generated from one of the samples.    More recently (1980 and 1990), the
distinction of nativity by race has been largely dropped.       The current standard broad
categories are: White; Black or African American; American Indian or Alaska Native;

Asian; and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.       These categories were established by

the Office of Management and Budget in 1977 in Statistical Policy Directive 15 and
modified in 1997.5   There are also two questions now on ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino,
and Non-Hispanic or Non-Latino.



       5
         The categories from 1977 to 1997 were: White; Black; American Indian, Eskimo,
or Aleut; and Asian or Pacific Islander. Census data for 1980 and 1990 and much
recent vital statistics data are categorized this way.
                                            4

    The identification of race is now self identification, which goes along with self

enumeration (in effect since 1970).    Some combination of self identification and
enumerator identification was used in 1960.     Before 1960 the judgement was left to the

enumerator’s observation.   Persons of mixed white and another race were usually
identified with the other race.   Physical appearance was likely very important.

    The separate enumeration and tabulation of the Hispanic population began in 1970,
although the category “Mexican” had been given as an answer to the question on race or

color in 1930.   Before 1970, it is possible to identify a large portion of the
Hispanic-origin population by looking at questions on place of birth, parent’s place

of birth, mother tongue or language, and (when available in the IPUMS samples)

surname.   These were used by Gratton and Gutmann [2000] to make their estimates of the

size and composition of the Hispanic-origin population (see Table 2).      Since 1970,

specific questions have been asked about Spanish or Hispanic origin or descent.       These

are described in Appendix Table A-3.   Unfortunately, Hispanic origin overlaps other

racial categories, and so now there is a further division of the Hispanic and non-

Hispanic populations by the OMB categories (white, black, American Indian and Alaskan

native, Asian, Hawaiian native or Pacific islander).     A considerable amount of

tabulation has been done in recent censuses for the Hispanic-origin population.

    Citizenship status is a related inquiry.    It was first asked in 1900 (citizen

[assumed as blank], naturalized, applied for first papers, and alien) and has been

included in the census since then with the exception of 1960. 6     In 1980, a confusing

question on ancestry was introduced.   It is wholly self identified and allows for

multiple responses.   The question certainly does not describe strict cultural or
geographic categories and thus far seems to have had limited value for demographic and

social science research.

    The categories of race and ethnicity are still in a state of flux, having been
changed as recently as 1997.   They, and the politicized process of determining the
categories, were seriously critiqued by William Petersen:

      Indeed, the Census Bureau can do little or nothing to alter the political
      context of ethnic counts, nor can it escape from fiscal control by a Congress
      sensitive to racial and ethnic blocs. What it can do, for instance, is not to
      repeat the egregious error of inviting representatives of special interests to
      act as formal consultants supervising its operations. Instead of seeking to
      avoid pressure from ethnic blocs to revise definitions or enumeration
      procedures, the bureau invited the participation of blacks, Hispanics, Indians,
      and others, each of whom wanted to shape the process to its political advantage.
      These committees were of a type different from those made up of statisticians or
      typical users of census data, for the members were generally chosen less for

           The citizenship question in 1970 was in the 5% sample.
                                             5

      their knowledge than for their ideology. Giving aspirant leaders this kind of
      quasi-official status aggravated the disadvantages of the procedure already
      established–the delineation of ethnic categories by self-identification combined
      with promotional campaigns that stressed the monetary advantages of larger
      counts, thus encouraging the creation of “instant” members of the various
      categories. [Petersen, 1987, p. 233.]
    Presently, it is explicitly stated by the Census Bureau that the concept of race,

whose categories are intended to be mutually exclusive, is not supposed to reflect any
biological or anthropological definitions.       That is laudable, but the fact remains

that rather arbitrary changes over time have made secular comparisons more difficult.
An example of the difficulty is the group of Hispanic origin population which is seen

as an ethnic, and not a racial, group.   Within the Hispanic origin population there
are then racial groups.   The change to self identification has further complicated

matters.   This is undoubtedly some improvement over enumerator identification, but

further muddying the waters.    For example, the Amerindian population of the United

States grew by 5.4% per annum in the 1970s, 3.6% per annum in the 1980s, and 7.4% per

annum in the 1990s.7   Since this was a group for which net in-migration was likely

negligible, such rapid growth would indicate significant amounts of self-redefinition.

Finally, the category of “Other” now includes persons who identify with no racial

category, often persons of mixed race.   We do the best we can with what we have, but

the limitations must be kept in mind.

    The vital statistics of the United States suffer from many of the same issues.

Systematic collection of vital statistics at the federal level only began with the

creation of the Death Registration Area in 1900 (comprising at first only ten states

and the District of Columbia) and the Birth Registration Area in 1915 (also initially
comprising only ten states and the District of Columbia).       Both were complete only in

1933 with the admission of Texas.   A Marriage Registration Area was only set up in
1957, and a Divorce Registration Area was only created in 1958, although national

estimates exist for the period since 1920.       The Marriage and Divorce Registration
Areas are still not complete.   Birth and death data were reported by race (with a few

exceptions), while marriages and divorces were often not. 8     Through the 20th century,

much of the published reporting was done for whites and non-whites (often referred to



       7
         The term “Amerindian” is used here in preference to the term “Native
American” because the latter is not properly descriptive of the origins of that group.
The Canadian official statistics have used, for example, the terms “aboriginal” and
“first inhabitants”.
       8
         Consequently, much of the analysis of nuptiality relies on census-based
measures, such as those presented in Table 8, below.
                                             6

as “All Others”).   Separate reporting for blacks began in 1960 and for the Amerindian

and Asian or Pacific Islander populations in 1980.



RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC BEHAVIOR
   Tables 1 and 2 provide information on the size, composition, and growth of the

American population by race and ethnicity.       An overview of fertility and mortality for
the white and black population since 1800 is given in Table 3.      Fertility is described

in detail in Tables 4 and 5, mortality in Tables 7 to 9, and nuptiality in Table 13.
In addition, Tables 6, 10-12, and 14 exhibit comparisons of differentials of

fertility, mortality, and marriage by race and ethnicity.
POPULATION SIZE AND COMPOSITION

   Table 1 provides information on the size and racial composition of the American

population since 1790.   The second panel has the percentage breakdown from 1790 to

2000 by race.   Note that the category “Hispanic” is not part of the racial

categorization and should be looked at separately.

   At the beginning of the Republic, about four-fifths of the population was white

and one-fifth black, most of whom were slaves in the South.      In 1820, the first census

to distinguish slaves from free blacks, the free black population was 13% of the total

black population.   This proportion actually fell to about 11% in 1860, largely due to

the higher fertility of slaves relative to free blacks..      The share on the non-white

population began to decline from the early 19th century to about 1930, when it

stabilized for several decades.   This decline was caused by the significant influx of

migrants to the United States, most of whom were white Europeans.      Between 1819 (the
first date for which we have regular immigrant entry statistics) and 1920,

approximately 34 million migrants entered the United States.       This total was about 64
million through 1997. [U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series 89, and extensions by
the author.]

   From about 1950 the white share of total population began to decline such that it

fell from about 90% to about 77% in the 2000 census.      Although the share of the black
population in the total has risen in recent decades, much of the increased share for

non-whites has been in the category of “Other Races,” especially Asians, who were

about 45% of that group, and the Amerindian population (about 15% of “Other Races”).
The Hispanic population is comprised of various races and is considered an ethnic and
not a racial category (see Table 2).    That population has grown at rates of 4% to 6%

per year in the decades since 1940.    A great deal of that growth more recently has
                                            7

been from persons of Mexican origin, who now comprise 58% of the Hispanic origin
population.   The other important components are those of Puerto Rican origin and Cuban

origin (9.6% and 3.5% of the Hispanic population, respectively), with a very rapidly
growing group from other areas of Central and South America.

    The implications for the demography of minorities is clear and well known.      The
United States if becoming less of nation of white persons of European origin and more
a racially and ethnically diverse group.   In recent years, the Asian and Hispanic

populations have shown the most rapid growth (Table 1, last panel).    The exceptionally

fast growth of the Amerindian population is due to ethnic re-identification.       Given
the present immigration laws, policies, and practices in place and the attraction of

the United States labor market, this trend shows every indication of continuing.

FERTILITY

    Evidence on fertility by race is presented in Tables 3 to 5.    The measures

selected are the crude birth rate, the general fertility rate, the total fertility

rate, and the census-based child-woman ratio. 9   A notable feature of fertility in the

early Republic was the large family size of white women, who exhibited a crude birth

rate of about 55 in 1800 which implies a total fertility rate of about 7 live births

per woman in her reproductive lifetime.    Information for the black population does not

become available until 1820 in the form of a child-woman ratio (children aged 0-4 per

1,000 women aged 20-44) and not until the 1850s for the crude birth rate and the total

fertility rate.10   It is apparent that white fertility declined fairly steadily from

1800 until the onset of the “Baby Boom” in the 1940s, while black fertility remained

rather stable up to the Civil War.   This is not too surprising, since the incentives
under slavery were for the profitable reproduction of the slave population.

Nonetheless, after about 1880, the fertility of the black population began to decline

in parallel with that for whites.
    Table 6 shows that the total fertility rates for blacks and whites did not begin
to converge until about 1880, when the black TFR was over 70% higher than the white

TFR.   There was then a convergence up until about 1920, followed by some widening of


       9
         It is possible to reconstruct fertility and mortality rates back into the
19th century. Table 3 reports some of the results currently available. Improved
estimates of the fertility of the white population back to 1850 will soon be available
using own-children methods with the Integrated Public Use Micro Samples (IPUMS) of the
censuses of 1850-1880, being conducted by J. David Hacker.
       10
          Note that the rates in Table 3 are for “All Other” (i.e., non-whites) for
1920-1970 for the crude birth rate and for 1940-1990 for the total fertility rate.
But much of the non-white population (over 90%) was black during those decades.
                                            8

the gap to about a 20-40% higher TFR among black women (about one birth per woman).

Since about 1990, however, the gap has begun to close to only a 6.4% higher TFR in
1998, amounting to only about .1 birth per woman.    The decline since the end of the

“Baby Boom” in the early 1960s has been significant, though much of it occurred in the
1990s.   This may be seen graphically in Figure 1.   Some of this has come from declines

in birth rates among very young black women.     For instance, birth rates for black
women aged 15-17 declined from 82.3 per 1,000 in 1990 to 56.8 in 1998 (and from 152.9

to 126.8 for black women aged 18-19). [U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000, Table 80].
But there has been some decline in age-specific rates at older ages as well.

   From 1980 onwards we have vital statistics for the Amerindian and the Asian
populations, and from 1989 onwards for the Hispanic-origin population.     In all these

cases, convergence has been taking place.   Indeed, for the Asian and Pacific Islander

group, the TFR’s are now below those for the white population, and those for the

Hispanic-origin population are very close (Tables 5 and 6).     For the Amerindian and

Asian populations the convergence was taking place from the early 1980s.     Table 5

provides some idea of the origins of all this.    White TFR’s stabilized in the 1970s

and began a slow increase to above 2 per woman (or 2,000 per 1,000 women) in the late

1990s.   The increased representation of the somewhat higher fertility Hispanic women

in the white population was certainly playing some role.     Simultaneously, the TFR’s

for black, Amerindian, and Asian women declined a bit.     Finally, the fertility of

Hispanic-origin women remain roughly stable from 1989.     What is occurring is that all

groups seem to be converging on about 2 births per woman.

   As to why minorities should have different fertility is an open question.     If, as
in the case of blacks, Hispanics, and the Amerindian population, a higher proportion

have lower incomes, less wealth, less stable employment, and less education than the
majority white population.   These are factors often associated with higher birth
rates.   But there is also the “Minority Group Status Hypothesis,” which conjectures

that minority groups strive to improve their status. [Bean and Marcum, 1978.]     This

might be achieved using the help of more children, hence leading to higher birth
rates.   But there is the competing view that the desire to be upwardly mobile might

spur more efforts toward family limitation to conserve family resources and

concentrate on more human capital per child.     Thus the predicted direction of the
differential is unclear.   The American case would seem to support the view that lower
socioeconomic status has had the effect of raising fertility, but that these effects

are diminishing over time, as birth rates come close to replacement levels.

MORTALITY

   Tables 7 through 9 provide measures of mortality for the racial and ethnic groups
for which reporting was available over longer periods of time.      Thus, the breakdown is

for whites, all non-whites (“All Others”), and blacks.      In the case of Hispanics, some
data are available for infant mortality since 1989.      The period covered is 1850 to

1998.   Table 7 contains data on the neonatal mortality rate (deaths at 0-28 days of
life per 1,000 live births), the infant mortality rate (deaths in the entire first

year of life per 1,000 live births), and the maternal mortality rate (deaths from
childbirth and its complications per 100,000 live births).      Table 8 presents the

expectation of life at birth by sex and for both sexes combined.     Table 9 provides
data on age-adjusted death rates by race and sex from 1900 to 1998.     The data in Table

7 for 1915 to 1932 are for the current Birth Registration Area only.     Similarly, the

data in Tables 8 (lower panel) and 9 for 1900 to 1932 are for are also for the Death

Registration Area.     The relationships to the white population are given in Table 10

for the neonatal mortality rate, the infant mortality rate, and the maternal mortality

rate, Table 11 for the expectation of life at birth, and Table 12 for age-adjusted

death rates.

   The picture for mortality is different from that for fertility.      It is not one of

relative convergence.     If anything, there has been substantial relative divergence,

although there has been much closing of the white/non-white gap in terms of absolute

numbers of deaths per number of live births of in years of expectation of life.        The

difference in the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births between whites and

blacks has been reduced from 41 in 1900 and 46 in 1910 to 8.3 in 1998.     The reduction

has been even greater for all non-whites (to 2.6 infant deaths in 1998).     But the
relative situation has deteriorated.     Black infant mortality was in a more favorable

circumstance relative to white infant mortality in 1900 (42% higher) than at any
subsequent date.     In 1998 it was 137% higher.   The more favorable showing of entire

group of non-whites reflects undoubtedly the more favorable showing of the Asian and
Pacific Islander population.     A graphic depiction of this relative divergence is

presented in Table 10 and Figure 2.
   The serious disadvantage of the nonwhite population is traceable significantly to

their low average levels of education and income.      This is true especially for blacks
but also for the Amerindian population.     It also holds for the Hispanic population
(both white and nonwhite).     The Asian/Pacific Islander population as a whole does not

suffer from this mortality penalty.     On two counts, American society has come up short
                                           10

– it has failed to provide adequate health and medical care to its poor, and it has

also failed to raise the level of living of many of its poor.     In 1996, the United
States ranked 29th in the world in infant mortality.     But even if all Americans has the
same infant mortality rate as the white population (6.1), the United States would

still only be tied for 21 st place [World Bank, 1998].    A wealthy and technologically
advanced society surely can and should do more.   As Antonovsky and Bernstein [1977, p.

459] note: “Low social class per se does not cause high infant
mortality...however,...social class does subsume a large set of more directly

causative biological and behavioral variables.”   Some of those causative variables may
be amenable to direct policy intervention (e.g., universal child immunization

programs), but some may be address by more general improvements in the living
standards of the society, particularly among its poor.

    The record for neonatal mortality was about the same as for overall infant
mortality.   Similarly, maternal mortality showed deterioration from the early 20th

century up to the early 1960s and then a modest improvement.     But maternal mortality
is still over three times higher for the black population than the white population,

despite a reduction in the absolute number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births

from 455 in 1915 (for all non-whites) to 12 for blacks and 9.8 for all non-whites in

1998.   The relative difference seems to have no trend at present.

   Table 8 demonstrates that overall black and non-white mortality, as measured by the

expectation of life at birth, was higher throughout the period 1900 to 1998.     Table 11

gives the relative deficit of the total non-white and black expectations of life at

birth annually since 1900.   Up to 1933, those estimates are for the current Death

Registration Area.   The upper panel of Tables 8 and 11 contain estimates for 1900 and

1910 for the whole nation based on indirect estimation from the samples of the
microdata from the 1900 and 1910 U.S. censuses. [Haines, 1998; Preston and Haines,
1991; Haines and Preston, 1997.]   Since those are estimates for the whole population,

rather than the rather restricted sample of the early Death Registration Area, those
estimates are to be preferred to the annual estimates in the lower panel.     If those

benchmarks are used, the picture for the black population is somewhat more favorable,
since in 1900 and 1910 the national black population was more rural than in the Death
Registration Area, which afforded some degree of protection.     The DRA of 1900 had less

than 5% of the nation's African American population, and, of that, 82-83% was urban.

The national average percentage urban of the black population was 20% in 1900 and 27%
in 1910. [Haines and Preston, 1997.]   Although by those standards, real progress has
                                             11

been made, nonetheless, in 1998, black males still had e(0) 6.9 years below those for

white males.   The number for black females was a deficit of 5.2 years.   These numbers

in 1900 had only been 8.1 and 7.4 years, respectively.
    Table 9 provides data on age-adjusted death rates by race and sex from 1900 to

1998.   These are also for the Death registration Area up through 1932.   Table 12 gives
the ratios of these age-adjusted death rates to those for the majority white

population.    The record there would indicate only modest progress for the African
American population (the overwhelming share of the “All Other” category until the
1950s).   In 1998, the age-adjusted death rate for blacks stood 53% higher than for

whites.   Interestingly, for the Amerindian and Asian populations, the outcomes are
better.   Indeed, the younger populations of those groups do relatively well, with

Amerindians close to the white rates and the Asian and Pacific Islander origin
population substantially below the white population (58% of the white rates).

Overall, however, the record on minority mortality is less than admirable.
    The source of this is to be found in disadvantaged socioeconomic status not

ameliorated by corrective social policies.    No extensive national-level information on
income for individuals exists before 1939.    The first census to ask a question on

income was the U.S. Census of Population of 1940, and for that census the question was
only about wage and salary income for 1939, excluding proprietary, self-employment,

and property income.   Much of what we know about American incomes by race originates
in the Current Population Survey, conducted monthly by the Bureau of the Census since

1947, particularly aimed at labor force issues such as unemployment and income. 11    One

partial earlier piece of evidence may be gleaned from a Bureau of Labor Statistics
survey taken in 1917-1919 of 12,817 families in 99 urban centers in 42 states of the

United States for purposes of studying the cost of living [United States Bureau of

Labor Statistics, 1924].    In that study, white family heads had   average earnings of
$1,352 while colored family heads had average earnings of $979 (or 72% of that of




       11
          Originally in 1947, the Survey covered a representative sample of
approximately 21,000 interviewed households in areas throughout the United States.
This sample was increased to approximately 35,000 in May 1956 and to approximately
50,000 in January 1967. It is subject to sampling error. At present, about 50,000
occupied households are eligible for interview each month. Of these, about 4 to 5
percent are, for a variety of reasons, unavailable for the interview. Estimates of
population characteristics based on the CPS will not agree with counts based on the
census because the CPS and the census use different sampling procedures, different
samples, and different procedures for racial groups, the Hispanic population, and
other topics.
                                             12

whites).12    For the period 1947 to 1970, families headed by non-whites had median
incomes of 51-64% of those for whites heading families.     The range was 61-78% for

unrelated individuals.     In the case of families, there appeared to have been an
improvement over time in both real income (in constant 1967 dollars) and in relation

to income for white-headed families.     This was not, however, true for unrelated
individuals, who did experience a rise in real income but showed no trend relative to

whites. [U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series G 189-204.]     By 1998, the median
income of black-head households was 62% of that of white households (in contrast to

113% for Asian-headed households and 69% for Hispanic-headed households). [U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 2000, Table 737.]     In terms of income distribution, the Current

Population survey also reveals that in 1947 46% of families with white head had income
below $3,000, while this was 81% for families with a non-white head.     This had

improved to 7.5% for whites and 20.1% for non-whites by 1970, both because of rising

real and nominal incomes; but the gap was still substantial.     Similar results obtain

for unrelated individuals.     In 1947, 61% of whites had incomes under $1,500, while 79%

of non-whites were in that situation.     By 1970, this was 21% for whites but still 35%

for non-whites. [U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, Series G 16-30.]     In 1998, 8.7% of

white-headed households had incomes below $10,000, while this was 21.4% for black-

headed households and 14.9% for Hispanic-headed households. [U.S. Bureau of the

Census, 2000, Table 738.]

    Overall, the disadvantaged status of non-whites generally, and blacks in

particular, are demonstrated by these income disparities,     Since socioeconomic well-

being has an important effect on expectation of life, infant mortality, and death

rates overall, it is not surprising that the relative disadvantage of the black
population in mortality has not disappeared.
NUPTIALITY

    Finally, some results on nuptiality are presented in Table 13 with ratios for the

non-white, black, and Hispanic-origin populations to the white population in Table 14.
Over the period 1880 to 1990 covered by those tables, there have been fluctuations in

the age at marriage (given by the singulate mean age at marriage) and the percent
married at ages 20-24.     There have been comparable fluctuations in the proportion

never-married at ages 45-54 and in Coale’s indices of proportions married (Im and
Im*).   There was a rise in the age of marriage to about 1900 (probably throughout the



        12

19th century), followed by a decline up to the 1960s, and then a rather dramatic
increase.    Among whites, the recent rising age of marriage was not accompanied by an

increase in lifetime non-marriage (proportion single at ages 45-54); but there was a
sharp rise in this among blacks.     Most notably, the non-white population and the black

population in particular have moved from having had a first marriage age substantially
below that for whites to an age well above it.    This dramatic reversal may be seen in
Table 14 and in Figure 3.    The black/white differential was even more pronounced for

females than for males.     This was not true of the Hispanic-origin population, which

seemed to move more closely with the white population.     The overall rise in the age at
marriage and in the proportions never-marrying reflects a tendency toward delayed

marriage and childbearing among working women and also a trend towards a greater

proportion of female-headed households among all households.     In 1990, 12.9% of all

families were headed by women with no spouse present in the white population, in

contrast to 43.8% in the black population.     The percentages for female-headed families

with no spouse present and with own children were 7.4% for whites and 29.9% for

blacks. [U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1997, Table 50.]     These proportions have been on

the rise since the middle of the 20th century.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

    Examining data from a variety of statistical sources on the demography of racial

and ethnic groups in the United States to the present reveals some interesting
results.    Taking into account the changing definitions and boundaries of race and

ethnicity in official federal statistics, the has been both relative and absolute
convergence in fertility behavior across groups.     It has been of relatively recent

origin and has been due, in large part, to stable (or even slightly increasing) birth
rates for the majority white population combined with declining birth rates for blacks

and the Asian-origin, Hispanic-origin, and Amerindian populations.
    This has not been true for mortality, however.    The black population has
experienced absolute convergence but relative deterioration in mortality (neonatal and

infant mortality, maternal mortality, expectation of life at birth, and age-adjusted

death rates), in contrast to the Amerindian and Asian-origin populations.     The Asian-
origin population actually now has age-adjusted death rates significantly lower than
those for the white population. 13   The disadvantaged condition of the black population



       13
          The age-adjusted death rates for the Hispanic-origin population are
available only since 1994. For the 1994-98 period, those rates were lower than those
for the white population (at about 80%).
                                           14

and the deteriorating social safety net are the likely origins of this outcome.

   Finally, there was a trend toward earlier and more extensive marriage from about
1900 up to the 1960s.   At this point, coincident with the end of the “Baby Boom,”

there has been a movement to later marriage for both males and females among whites,
blacks, and the Hispanic-origin populations.     This trend has been more extreme in the

black population, especially among females.     There has also been a significant rise in
proportions never-married at ages 45-54 among blacks and, to a lesser extent, among

Hispanics.   So here too, there has been divergence.
   The lessons to be learned are not that the American population is becoming more

homogeneous.   On the contrary, it is seemingly more heterogeneous.    But it seems that
groups are responding in similar ways to social trends and constraints.    The most

troubling result is the relative deterioration of the mortality situation for the

black population.   This is clearly an issue which warrants the most serious attention

by policy makers.

Footnotes:
\1 Based on estimated total live births per 1,000 population for specified group. Based on a 50-percent sample of births for 1951-1954,
1956-1966, and 1968-1970; on 20- to 50-percent sample for 1967. Prior to 1959, births adjusted for underregistration; thereafter,
registered live births. Rates by race are by race of child before 1980 and by race of mother from 1980 onwards. GFR is computed by
relating total births, regardless of age of mother, to women aged 15-44 years.
\2 Includes Alaska.
\2 First year for which figures include Alaska and Hawaii.
\4 Figures by race exclude New Jersey; State did not require reporting of race.
\5 Based on 20- to 50-percent sample of births.

\1 Total fertility rates are the sums of birth rates, by age of mother, multiplied by 5. Birth rates
are live births per 1,000 women in the specified groups. Beginning in 1970, data exclude births to
nonresidents of the United States. Based on estimated total live births per 1,000 population for the
specified group. Based on a 50-percent sample of births for 1951-1954, 1956-1966, and 1968-1971; on a
20- to 50-percent sample for 1967; and on a 100 percent sample for selected states and a 50 percent
sample for all other states for 1972-1984. Prior to 1960, births adjusted for underregistration;
thereafter, registered live births. Rates by race are by race of child before 1980 and by race of
mother from 1980 onwards.
\2 Denotes first year for which figures include Alaska and Hawaii.
\3 Figures by race exclude New Jersey. That state did not require reporting of race.
\4 Beginning in 1997, rates for women aged 45-49 are computed by relating births to women aged 45-54
to women aged 45-49.

population, total fertility rate: Coale and Rives [1973], p. 26. Numbers for 1890 to 1930 are
arithmetic averages for the two quinquennia surrounding the year. For 1905/10, total fertility rates
and age-specific birth rates are from Haines [1989], Table 1. For 1933-1939, total fertility rates
and age-specific birth rates are from Linder and Grove [1947], Table 46. The rates are adjusted
upward on the basis of the annual adjustments implied in U.S. Public Health Service [1999a], Tables 1-
1 and 1-2. 1940-1959: U.S. Public Health Service [1970], Table 1-1. 1960-1997: U.S. Public Health

\1 The overall death rate and the age-adjusted death rate are per 100,000 population. Prior to 1933, this is for the Death
Registration States only.
\2 Includes Alaska.
\3 Denotes first year for which figures includes Alaska and Hawaii.
\4 Excludes New Jersey for rates by race. That state did not require reporting of race.

1997,” U.S. Bureau of the Census, PPL-91 and appendices. The population by race for 1962 and 1963 excludes New Jersey, which did
not report deaths by race in those years. The estimated population of the United States for whites and all other races was
estimated and reported in Vital Statistics of the United States, 1962, Vol. II, Part A, “Mortality,” “Technical Appendix” and
Vital Statistics of the United States, 1963, Vol. II, Part A, “Mortality,” “Technical Appendix.” Age-adjusted death rates for
the Amerindian and Asian and Pacific Islander populations 1980-1997 are taken from National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 47,
No. 19, "Deaths: Final Data for 1997," Table 1. The other overall and age-adjusted rates will differ from the official NCHS
published rates because of the use of slightly different base populations here. Overall and age-adjusted death rates for 1998
are taken from National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 48, No. 11, "Deaths: Final Data for 1998," Table 1. The rates for 1998 do
not use the same base population estimates as for the period 1940-1997. The same standard is used for the age adjustment.

 (a) The categories are given in the order in which whey appeared on the schedule or in the
enumerator’s instructions. The abbreviations are those that were to be used on the schedules.
W= white; B=black; M=Mulatto; Neg=Negro; I, In, Ind., or Indian (Amer)=Indian (Amerindian); C,
Ch, or Chi=Chinese; Jp or Jap=Japanese; Ot=other; Fil=Filipino; Hin=Hindu (South Asian Indian);
Kor=Korean; Mex=Mexican; API= Asian or Pacific Islander.
 (b) In 1850 and 1860, on the schedule for free persons, the instructions to the enumerators
were “in all cases where the person is White leave the space blank in the column marked
‘Color’.” For the slave schedule, the listed categories were “B” and “M”.
 (c) Although a category for Amerindian people was not listed on the census form, the
enumerator’s instructions for 1860 were: “5. Indians – Indians not taxed were not to be
enumerated. The families of Indians who have renounced tribal rule, and who under State or
Territorial laws exercise the rights of citizens, are to be enumerated. In all such cases write
“Ind.” opposite their names, in column 6, under the heading “Color”....9. Color. Under heading
6, entitled “Color,” in all cases where the person is white leave the space blank; in all cases
where the person is black with admixture insert the letter “B”; if a mulatto, or of mixed blood,
write “M”; if an Indian, write “Ind.” It is very desirable to have these instructions carefully
observed.”

Appendix Table A-3.   Census Questions on Hispanic or Spanish Origin or Descent.
                      1970-1990.(a)


Year                       Questions
1970         Is this person’s origin or descent?
             Mexican
             Puerto Rican
             Cuban
             Central American
             Other Spanish?(b)
1980         Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin or descent?
             No, not Spanish/Hispanic
             Yes, Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano
             Yes, Puerto Rican
             Yes, Cuban
             Yes, other Spanish/Hispanic

1990         Is this person of Spanish/Hispanic origin?
             No, not Spanish/Hispanic
             Yes, Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano
             Yes, Puerto Rican
             Yes, Cuban
             Yes, other Spanish/Hispanic, print one group..

 (a) The census asked a specific question on “Spanish origin or descent” in 1970 on the 5%
sample as a second part of a sample question on birthplace. In 1980, the question on
“Spanish/Hispanic Origin or Descent” appeared on the short form (100% sample). Before 1970,
members of the Hispanic origin population could be identified by a combination of questions on
palce of birth, place of birth of parents, and mother tongue. In the 1930 census only, the
category “Mexican” was a separate category for answers to the question on “Color or Race.” See
Gratton and Gutmann [2000].
 (b) This question appeared in the 1970 5% sample long form.
