                       UNEMPLOYMENT EFFECTS OF MINIMUM WAGES


1. Introduction

        Empirical investigation of employment effects of minimum wage legis-

lation is a subject of continuing interest, judging by a growing number

of studies. The      older   studies were concerned mainly with changes in

employment in low—wage industries. In the more recent work attention

has shifted to effects on unemployment in low-wage demographic groups,

such as teenagers. Despite the statistical difference there is no

apparent recoqnjtjon of a conceptual as well as substantive distinction

between minimum wage effects on employment and those on unemployment.

        The   purpose of this paper is to explore the analytical distinction
between employment and unemployment effects in the hope of providing some
understanding Of     the observations.    Though related empirical work is    far
from being definitive the findings appear to be informative.
        The distinction between employment and unemployment effects of
minimum wages    arises in one or both of the    following   cases:   (a) when

only   part of the economy     is "covered" by minimum wage legislation and
(b) when the supply of labor to the market is not perfectly inelastic.

Obviously, when all of the economy is "covered" and       the   labor force is

fixed in number,    there    is no distinction (except for algebraic signs)

between   changes in employment and changes     in unemployment. The condi-

tions   which create   the distinction   are important and must be treated

explicitly      in the analysis of minimum wage effects) The upward movement



           1
               Both factors receive explicit attention in a current study by

   Finis Welch of effects of minimum wages on sectoral distribution of

   employment. His analysis omits the unemployment effects, which is

   the focus of this paper.




along the demand curve in the covered sector and the corresponding re-

duction of employment there is only a beginning of the story: there are

responses in movements of labor from the covered to the uncovered sector

(or conversely), as well as from the market to the norunarket (or conversely),

and some   amount of   "perinanent"2unemployment is generated as well. More



           2
            By   'permanent" unemployment, I mean unemployment corresponding
   to a given coverage and minimum wage. Ceteris paribus, the mere
  passage of time would not change the volume of this unemployment.


precisely, given similar labor in the two sectors (there is only one be-
fore the imposition of minimum wages) and a wage w, the imposition of
an above equilibrium minimum wage in the covered sector w > w will
                                                             m    0
lead to two equilibrating adjustments: in the uncovered sector the wage

will change from w to w inconsequence of generated sectoral movements

of labor, and with w > W (as we shall prove) a certain amount of
                                 —3—


"waiting" for jobs in the covered sector becomes worthwhile, creating a

fixed amount of unemployment.

     A question of particular interest is the direction of labor mobility

resulting from the minimum wage imposition (or increase). An outflow from

the covered sector implies some withdrawals from the labor force and

some reemployment in the uncovered sector as well as a decrease of the

wage in that sector. In the opposite case, there are net inflows of labor

into the covered sector both from the nonmarket and from the "free"

sector, in turn raising the wage in the latter as well. I proceed to

explore the conditions which distinguish these opposite movements, as

well as the specific effects of increasing minimum wages and of coverage

on (a) wages in the uncovered sector, (b) unemployment, and (c) labor

force withdrawals. The qualitative conclusions hold regardless of whether

coverage is partial or complete and whether the total labor force is fixed

or responsive to wage changes. Also, similar results hold for a multi-

period analysis as for the analysis collapsed into a single period, from

which I start.


2. The Probability of Employment and Equilibrium Unemployment

      A wage w exceeding the equilibrium wage w is imposed on a part of

the economy (the "covered" sector), creating a differential wm -        where

w is the resulting wage level in the "uncovered" sector. In order to

abstract from other influences assume that the job searchers' probability

of employment in the uncovered sector is unity within the period. With
                                    —4-.




wages above equilibrium in the covered sector, jobs must be rationed.

Chances of success in job search depend on the method of rationing.

I shall assume probabilistic rationing,3 one in which every job searcher



          3
              Price rationing or discrimination would eliminate unemployment

   rather quickly. One form of price" rationing is worker monetary

   investment in search. This would reduce waiting time, hence observed

   unemployment, by substituting direct costs for foregone earnings of

   job searchers.




has an equal chance of getting a job, and every employed worker an equal

chance of keeping the job. This assumes that some vacancies arise

periodically in the covered sector, due to turnover (Vacancies are also

created by growth in demand, a factor I shall consider later.)

        Abstracting from risk preferences and from search costs other than

foregone earnings, equilibrium wages after imposition of wm in the covered

sector are given by:

                                     w
                p wm =w,or

       In the covered sector employment is E, the number of vacancies

per period is 6E. Abstracting from growth or cycles, the rate 6 is

simply a separation rate. The 6E vacancies are filled as soon as they

appear and a remaining pool of unemployed searchers of size U is ob-

served. Since the number of vacancies (separations) is                           and the

total number of job searchers is U +                   6E,   the probability of employment

      It appears that the unemployment rate induced by the imposition of

minimum wages is proportional to the percent wage gap (w) between the

sectors, the separation rate (6), and the coverage ratio (k). The

separation rate 6 has a maximum   value   of unity. This case of complete

(100 percent) turnover provides the highest chance of success for job

searchers, hence maximum unemployment, namely U'     = w, and    = k w

The opposite extreme, zero turnover implies no unemployment--all those

without jobs having left the covered sector.4



         4
          Even when turnover is zero, if demand for labor is growing,

   vacancy rates appear and by eq. (2) unemployment will arise, since
     = g.E    ,   when g is the growth rate of employment. This is the
      u+g.E
   case discussed in the context of rural-urban migration in less

   developed countries by Todaro (1969) and Harberger (1971).




3. Labor Mobility and the Equilibrium Waqe Differential

      Before the imposition of minimum wages, the market wage in both

sectors was w. The minimum wage produces two adjustments: it

generates an unemployment rate u and it changes the wage in the un-

covered sector from w0 to w in consequence of the movement of labor

between the sectors. Which way does labor flow? It is usually assumed

in the minimum wage literature that disemployed labor flows out

of the covered to the uncovered sector. The opposite assumption is made
                                                                   —7—



in the development literature--that labor will be attracted to the covered

sector even at the cost of a substantial period of unemployment. Each

may be right in their context, but this is not obvious. At a purely

arithmetical level, it simply depends on whether generated unemployment

U is less or greater than the reduction in employment CE0 - Em) in the

covered sector. If (E — Em) >
                    o                                     u,   there is an outflow from the covered

sector and a depression of wages in the uncovered sector, while the

opposite is true when U > CE0 — Em).                                In the latter case, wages rise in

the uncovered sector as well, but never to the level of w.5

               As is shown                below,     p.        •   A similar result can arise in non-

   probabilistic models, without unemployment, when the covered sector

   is capital intensive, the other labor intensive. Cf. H. G. Johnson

   the reader prefers).

We need to determine w. It will simplify matters to assume first a zero

elasticity of aggregate labor supply——a fixed labor force.

covered sector. If negative, it is the number attracted from the uncovered

sector. If labor demand elasticity in the uncovered sector is e in absolute

value, then w, the percentage change in the "free" sector wage is given by:

ment in the covered sector. It is multiplied by                     k     to express it    as a

That is, the ratio of generated unemployment to employment in the covered
sector is a positive function of the minimum wage hike, but the effect is

small when the vacancy rate 6 is small, and when the demand elasticity in

the covered sector n     is    small.

        Figure 1 portrays the effects in a convenient fashion, assuming

constant elasticity curves. Given movements along the demand curve

from point 0 up to the left, the locus of resulting wages w in the un-

covered sector and the supply of labor               to   the covered sector L is shown
as a line L with positive slope                 .   e passing through point 0. For
a   given minimum wage (point M on the demand curve D), the values W and
L   are given by point J        the intersection of line L with line R, with

negative slope , passing from M.

        The "supply curve" L remains fixed for given e, k, and r. For
e = n   and k =   -, it is a mirror image of D with opposite slope, as drawn
in Figure 1. A     change in turnover 6 rotates the line R around M, counter
clockwise   for increased turnover. It changes the intersection K, but

leaves L fixed. Since the slope of R is 6 and of D is r, the point K

is to the left of 0 when n >        6,   and to the right, when r <      6.   In the

        An increase in demand elasticity e in the uncovered sector flattens

L, while an increase in coverage makes L steeper.       In the limit, when

k =   1,   L is vertical through 0.

           The scales in Figure 1 are logarithmic. Hence Em Lm is the un-
                                                                        W
employment percentage u, E Em is the disemployment ratio, and Wm

the   sectoral relative wage gap. Since ri > 6 in the figure, a shift of

M to the left increases all three, induces outmigration from the covered

sector. An increase in coverage steepens L, thereby increasing E        L

(unemployment ratio in the covered sector), increasing the wage gap, and

reducing the outflow of labor from the covered sector. When coverage is

100 percent, L is vertical and unemployment equals disexuployment, only

because of the assumption of zero elasticity of aggregate labor supply.
Labor Force Resoonses
      The graphic solution in Figure 1 remains useful, mutatis mutandis,

after the assumption of a fixed labor force is dropped. This more general

case presents no particular complications. The only new development is

the inclusion of the non—market along with the uncovered sector as the

destination (when n > 6) or origin (when r < 6) of labor mobility.
                                                                        -
           With an upward sloping supply curve of labor some of the         Lm

workers who leave the covered sector (when r > 6) will drop out of the

 labor force rather than     accept   a wage below their shadow price in the

 uncovered sector.

         Consequently the downward pressure on wages in the uncovered sector
    will be weaker than in the previous case. The L-curve in Figure 1 will

    be flatter the more elastic the supply curve, thereby reducing the

    sectoral wage gap and unemployment, while increasing outflows from the

    covered sector-—as compared to the case of inelastic labor supply.              If

    n < 5, the flatter L-curve means that the wage gap and unemployment will

    be increased compared to the inelastic case, while inflows will also be

    larger and will come both from the uncovered sector and from persons

    out of the labor force whose shadow wages are less than n

          The division of outflows from the covered sector into reemployment

    in the uncovered sector and withdrawals from the labor force is determined

    by the relative sizes of demand and supply elasticities in the uncovered

    sector. As Figure 2 indicates out of E0 -               workers leaving the covered

    sector (measured as a percentage of employed in the uncovered sector),
                                                                                         5'

       The proportion of workers leaving the covered sector to be employed

in the uncovered sector is                    •       e   , the      proportion dropping out is

parameters hold in this general case as they did before, when $                                 0

       The effect of supply elasticity s is best seen in the limit:

As s +      ,i+          •        In   that case, unemployment in the covered sector

becomes entirely independent of the demand elasticities e and n and of

coverage. It is merely a function of the turnover rate 6 and of the

minimum wage hike 4•              Disemployment is as before n .                    and   the
difference between disemtloyment and unemployment ',                          (n - 6) drops out

into or enters from the non—market.

       To the extent that welfare systems provide payments near w

this extreme case is relevant. Wage hikes which create downward pressures
                                            — 15 —




on wages in the uncovered sector will result mainly in withdrawals from

the labor force. Therefore, when n > 5, the connection between minimum

wage hikes, growth of coverage, and growth of welfare enrollments is

strongly suggested.

          Finally, an interesting case worth considering, in view of the

high coverage proportion of the U.S. labor force, is the case of complete

coverage, k =       1.      In this case, the L-curve in Figure 1 is simply the

supply curve S, and w is an unobserved shadow wage: All those not

employed at the minimum wage w, drop out of the labor force, if their

shadow wage exceeds w. Again, if w > w, which takes place when n < 6,

people move from the non—market into the labor market.

          Substituting k = 1 in (11) and (12), we have:


                                    •

Unemployment is a positive function of the turnover rate, wage hike and

demand elasticity. It is a positive function of s, if r < 5, negative if

Ti > 6,

          Labor force withdrawal takes place when         > 6, and is greater the

greater the wage hike, the demand and supply elasticities, and the

smaller the turnover rate. When n < 6, the labor force increases, and the
                                           — 16 -




increase   is larger, the larger the wage hike, the turnover rate, and the

supply elasticity, and the smaller the demand elasticity.

        In the very special case of perfect turnover 6 = 1 and complete

coverage k =              unemployment is maximal, for given i and elasticities

r and S.

                  This was the case considered by Hashimoto and Mincer (1971),

   and by A. King (1973).




        The direction of labor force change now depends on whether demand

elasticity is less than or greater than unity. If n <             1,the   unemploy-

ment ratio cannot exceed the (percent.age) size of the wage hike.

4.   Multiperiod Analysis and Growth of Demand

        In a multiperiod formulation workers search or wait for jobs in the

covered sector, as long as the net discounted gain from doing so is posi-

tive. Abstracting from risk preferences, the net gain is zero at the

margin:


                       n     p w -w
             G= E             trw n=0                                                          (16)

                               (l+i)



Pt in the expression for G is the probability of having a job in period t.

This is to be distinguished from the probability of getting a job

        =         '
                      and the probability of losing the job when employed,
              6

namely 6. The discount rate is i.

       The probability Pt grows with time, according to the recursive re-

].ation:

          The coefficient a now plays the same role as the separation rate

6 in the single—period analysis.

          According to (19), a > 6 so long as 6 < 1.               Only when i =   , is
a = 6 which is the single-period case, while t = 0 or 6 = 1                     makes

a = 1 its highest value. Thus when discount rates are extremely high

or turnover complete there is no distinction between the single and

inultiperiod analysis. The lower the discount, rates the higher a, the

greater unemployment (cf.                                           )   because of the

greater willingness to wait. Since a > 6, the likelihood of n <                      a,
hence of labor mobility toward the covered sector is greater than sug-

gested in the single period analysis, where the comparison was between

n   and   6.

          This likelihood becomes even greater when growth of demand in the

covered sector is taken into account. Even if turnover were zero, and

demand grows at the rate g creating a vacancy rate of g percent,

    =   ___
        u+     g
                    and u =

                                             .
                                                   so   a =
                                                              l+i • g                     (20)




          In the more general case when g > 0                 and 6 > 0.


                    u =         (g + 6)      .                                            (21)


                                             l+i (q + 6)
Thus the coefficient of w, a =               .+                is expressed most generally


in (21).           (19) holds for g =   0,       and (20) for 6 = 0.     Also, when g > 0,

a can be sizeable and unity is no longer its upper limit. It is plausible

therefore, that promotion of rapid employment growth in "protected" high

wage sectors, as described in the development literature, stimulates move-

ment tø these sectors creating high levels of equilibrium unemployment,

while the opposite movements, disemploytnent and labor force withdrawals

are the major conseauences of minimum waces in the U.S. and in other de-

veloped economies.


5. Some Conclusions

        Do minimum wage hikes represent a redistribution of income toward

low wage labor? Total income is, of course, reduced. Does a larger

share of the smaller product go to low wage labor? A demand elasticity

n < 1 increases the wage bill of labor in the covered sector, but only

the employed pocket the gains, at the expense, in part, of those dis—

employed. However, if labor turnover is complete (5 =      1),   the employed

and unemployed are the same people and each of them is working less but

earning more, at least nominally.

       The analysis in this paper suggests that this conclusion would be

correct if iS   = 1.   Otherwise, a less than unitary demand elasticity

n   < 1 is not a sufficient condition. Not only must n < 1,      it mi,ist be

true that n < 5.       Only then will those employed In the not—covered

sector have a wage w >      w,   and those unemployed in the covered sector

an expected wage w >
                          w0.

       Since an implication of ri < 6 is the flow of labor from the un-

covered sector and from the non—market to the covered sector, such a

hypothesis is subject to empirical tests, even without estimation of
                                      — 20 —




parameters r and 5. The empirical work to be reported rejects the hypothe-
sis. The labor force diminishes in consequence of minimum wage hikes.

This finding supports the alternative hypothesis that n > ci >.6 .     It fol-
lows that unemployment arising in consecuence of minimum wage hikes under-

states the disemployment being only a part of it, the other two parts

being reemployment at wages lower than before, and labor force withdrawals.

The inference that n >   ci further   implies that growth of coverage aggravates

unemployment even within the covered sector, and that the growth of num-

bers of welfare recipients may be induced by the growth in minimum wages.

It is suggestive, in this connection, that labor force withdrawals appear

to be rather substantial in the empirical analysis which relates employ-

ment and labor force changes to minimum wage hikes.

                               Empirical       Analysis

      Regressions of the form Y      f(MW,     uc,     AF, T, T2) were run for ten

age—sex-color population groups using quarterly data from 1954 to 1969

inclusive. The dependent variables are employment to population (),

and labor force to population (!),      The independent variable MW is the

ratio of the minimum wage to average hourly earnings multiplied by the

coverage rate.8 UC is the unemployment rate of adult males (age 45-54)



         8
          This variable was constructed by the BLS and published in

   Bulletin 1657, 1970. Coverage rates were estimated separately for

   teenagers (age 16-19) and for the adult labor force. The minimum

   wage variable was calculated as follows:



             MW =   E
                    i
                        E.

                                                                    1




   where E is employment, AHE is average hourly earnings, MP is the

   basic minimum wage, MN is the minimum wage for newly covered sectors,

   CB is the proportion of non-supervispry employees covered by the basic

  minimum and CN is the proportion of non-supervisory employees covered

   by the rate applicable to newly covered workers. The index i indicates

  major industries and t is total private nonfarm economy.




and serves as an index of the business cycle. AF is the fraction of popu-

is   a time trend variable, which is an admittedly crude substitute for

complete (?) specifications of employment and labor force functions.

The MW variable enters the regression with an Almon unconstrained

quadratic distributed lag. Experiments showed that a lag pattern of

6-8 quarters was significant for most groups.

        Table   1.   presents summary statistics for   the variables used for

the regression analysis, and Table 2 summarizes         results of the regres-

sions. It    presents regression coefficients of the minimum wage       varia-

ble obtained by using the Almon distributed lag method. Since it is

through labor demand and supply that minimum wage effects operate, it

is the   labor—force and employment regressions that are of immediate
interest.    Unemployment effects were estimated as the difference of

labor—force and employment effects. Unemployment regressions, however,

were also run to facilitate a comparison.

        Except for males (25—64), nonwhite males (65+) and nonwhite

females (20+) ,the minimum       wage variable is significant in both   labor—

force and employment regressions. For most groups, therefore, unemploy-

ment effects are substantially smaller than disemployment. Unemployment

effects estimated from labor—force and employment regressions are

also shown in        Table 2.
         The net minimum wage     effects on labor—force participation appear
to be    negative for most of the groups. The largest negative effects are

observed for nonwhite teenagers, followed by nonwhite males (20—24),

white males (20—24), white teenagers, and nonwhite males (25—64).
                                   — 23 —




        The net employment effects are negative with the exception of non-

white females (20+), for whom the positive coefficient is statistically

insignificant. The largest disemployment effects are observed for non-

white males (20—24), followed by nonwhite teenagers, white males (20-24),

and white teenagers.

       Except for nonwhite teenagers and white males (65+), the magnitude

of the employment effects are greater than those of the labor-force ef-

fects The implication is that labor flows from the covered sector to

the   uncovered and out of the labor force. Also, both the    labor—force

and the   employment effects are greater for nonwhite groups than for

white groups in general. The largest increase in the unemployment rate

is observed for nonwhite males (20—24) followed by nonwhite teenagers,

white males (20—24) and white teenagers. This pattern is observed for

both the direct regression results and the indirect results calculated

from the labor-force and employment effects.

       It is striking to observe that the labor-force effects of minimum

wages are predominantly negative. According to the theoretical analysis,

the labor force may increase or decrease, given a decrease in employment,

depending on demand elasticities and turnover rates. Findings of nega-

tive labor—force effects indicate that the demand elasticities are not

so small as to cause   an increase in the   labor force, and that low-wage

workers who are not employed in the covered sector perceive the minimum

wage hike as a deterioration of their wage prospects.
