            Input Price Shocks and the Slowdown in Economic Growth:

                         The Case of U.K. Manufacturing


                                   ABSTRACT

    This paper provides a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of

input price shocks on economic growth, with a focus on United Kingdom rnanufac-

turing in the 1970s. The theoretical model predicts a discrete decline in out-

put and productivity after an input price rise, and a longer-run slowdown in

productivity growth, real wage growth, and capital accumulation. These features

characterize the United Kingdom and most other OECD economies after 1973. The

empirical results confirm the important role of input prices in recent U.K.

adjustment, but also point to an important role for other supply and demand

factors.

    Two types of explanations have been offered for the sharp deterioration in

U.K. economic performance in the past decade, focusing respectively on demand

and supply factors. A standard Keynesian view holds that macroeconomic demand

management has been either too expansionary or too contractionary, and that ris-

ing unemployment and falling output reflect the burden of anti-inflationary

policies. An alternative view holds that various supply shocks are the main

source of the poor output performance. In this interpretation, higher raw

material prices (particularly oil)   ,   competition   from the newly—industrializing

countries (NICs), and perhaps an independent decline in productivity growth, all

have lowered output growth and raised unemployment.

    There is little doubt that both supply and demand shocks played their roles

in the recent experience, and that their relative importance has varied over

time. Buiter and Miller [1981] have argued persuasively, for example, that the

sharp rise in unemployment during the Thatcher experiment (since 1979) is

largely the result of demand restraint. In general, however, there is no

settled macroeconomic framework for disentangling which factors are at work in

particular cyclical episodes. The theoretical analyses in Malinvaud [1977, 1980]

and related studies offer a promising advance in this direction, though they

remain far from empirical implementation.

    In this study, we focus our attention on the supply shocks, particularly raw

material price increases, to see if they alone can take us far in understanding

the recent experience. Qualitatively, the answer is a resounding "yes", since a

model of input price shocks predicts a short-run decline in output and produc-

tivity after such a disturbance, and a longer—run slowdown in productivity

growth, capital accumulation, and real wage growth. All of these features
                                     —2—



characterize Britain, and most other OECD economies, since 1973. Quantitative-

ly, the answer is mixed. The evidence strongly suggests that raw material price

increases have had significant output, employment, and productivity effects, and

that these effects have worked mainly through profitability and the incentive to

produce and invest, rather than through aggregate demand. But there is also

evidence that: (i) the raw material price increases alone do not explain

Britain's recent productivity debacle; and (2) demand explanations are needed to

account for deep recessionary episodes (such as 1975 and 1980—81).

    Table 1 highlights the decline in performance of U.K. manufacturing since

1973, and Table 2 depicts the severe squeeze in profitability that has accom-

panied that decline. From the first table note that the slowdown in growth of

gross output reflects a growth slowdown in capital and labor inputs, as well as

an apparant decline in total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Unfortunately,

there is no published volume index of intermediate inputs, so that we were

forced to create our own variable. For a number of reasons (see data appendix)

we regard our constructed index and thus our estimates of TFP, as subject to

fairly large error. It must be emphasized that a TFP slowdown cannot easily

be accounted for by an input price shock (aside from appeal to various measure-

ment errors that such a shock might induce); to the extent that such a slowdown

has occurred, it will require an explanation outside of our framework below.

    Table 2 provides the basis for the supply shock view of U.K. performance.

On a variety of measures, we see evidence for a deep and sustained squeeze on

profitability in U.K. production that goes far beyond short-run cyclical fluc-

tuations in labor's share of value. In the 196Os, the wage relative to product

prices (henceforth the "product wage", denoted Wp          w/p) grew at about the rate

of productivity increase. Labor's share of value in manufacturing, and the rate

of return to capital remained fairly stable. Between 1969 and 1975, product

wage growth accelerated substantially, squeezing profits sharply. Moreover,

when intermediate input prices rose in 1973, and TFP growth declined,

real wages failed to decelerate, further intensifying the profit squeeze.

Product wage growth slowed sharply under the Labour Government incomes policies

during 1976—77, but then rebounded during 1978-80. The final column, denoted

"valuation ratio", records the valuation of corporate capital (in "industrial

and commercial companies") relative to the replacement cost of corporate

capital. This ratio, often denoted "Tobin's q", is an indicator of market

expectations of future profitability of the existing capital stock. Under spe-

cific conditions, described below, it is also a good measure of the incentive to

invest. Clearly, it has fallen very sharply in the 1970s.

    The essence of the supply—side argument is that low output growth in the

1970s reflects poor incentives to supply output, rather than insufficient demand.

Low investment rates, similarly, are deemed to reflect low expectations of

future profitability. On a purely statistical basis, there is a strong link

between profitability and output (Morley [1979] has also examined this link).

The following regressions attest to this correlation; the theoretical models

below provide a structural basis for such relationships:1


         log   (Qt) = 5.8   +   .033 Time + .35   (Profit Share)t.i           .97

                                        —6—




    In certain circumstances, the supply argument would per force be true. To

the extent that U.K. manufacturers are price—takers on a large world market,

output fluctuations must reflect supply rather than demand constraints. Similar

evidence would be an inverse relationship between import demand for manufactured

goods and domestic production of manufactures. A decline in aggregate demand

would likely reduce the demand for both home and foreign goods, while a decline

in aggregate supply should raise foreign imports at the expense of home goods.

The growing import penetration ratios for U.K. manufacturing attest to such a

process [see (    ) for    details]. A simple correlation of manufacturing output

with manufacturing imports (with both measured as deviations from trends) yields

a highly significant r =        •2

    The preceding evidence is at best circumstantial. We now turn to formal

analysis. The first goal is to build up a model of dynamic output supply for a

competitive firm using capital, labor, and an intermediate input. Using that

model, we depict the time path of adjustment to a rise in the product price of

intermediate inputs. This adjustment is studied under alternative assumptions

of real wage stickiness and full labor market clearing. In the succeeding

section, the various equations of the model are estimated. The short—run and

long—run effects of a supply shock are measured, and various numerical simula-

tions are undertaken. In a concluding section, we consider some models which

better integrate supply and demand features into the analysis.

I. Theory of an Input Price Shock


 (a) The Value-Maximizing Competitive Firm

      Our analysis of input price shocks begins with the supply behaviour of a

value—maximizing competitive firm. The firm produces gross output Q according

to the well—behaved constant returns to scale production function Q = Q(L, K, N)

using labour, L, capital, K, and a raw material, N. The price of output is P,

and that of the raw material is N• For the time being assume that the relative

price         =
                  Ps/P is given (as is the case if both N and Q are tradeable goods in
a small open economy). We denote the product price of labour as Wp =

the nominal cost of capital as r, and the real cost of capital as H (r
                                                                       r—P/P),
where the dot signifies rate of change.

      As a basic model, assume that the firm can costlessly and instantaneously

adjust the inputs of L and N, while it can adjust K only subject to convex costs of

adjustment. The treatment of K as a quasi-fixed factor and L as a pure variable

factor is admittedly extreme, and is relaxed in some of the empirical work later

on. Denote the rate of gross capital formation as J, and the rate of depre-

ciation as d, so the K = J — dK.            Total investment expenditure, I, includes

payments on J, as well as adjustment costs. Let Pj be the cost of a unit of

physical capital, and iij (=Pj/P) its real price. Following Hayashi [1982],

adjustment costs per unit of J are assumed to rise as a function of 37K, so that
I =       +       q(J/K)J, where ()   is   the per—unit adjustment cost.

      Under conditions of perfect foresight, the real market value of the firm is

simply the discounted value of cash flow:


(U            V =   Je-Q   - WpL -         - I]dt

where    = f R( t)d T.
                                       -8-




The goal of the firm is to maximize V subject to the production technology, and

the costs of adjustment in capital accumulation. The results of this maximiza-

tion are straightforward: for a given K, the firm should short—run profit

maximize, hiring L and N to the point where marginal productivities equal

current factor costs. Investment should be undertaken as a function of the

entire future profit stream, which depends on the entire future path of factor

costs. The dependence of L and N on current costs, and I on expected future

costs, results of course from the assumption about costs of adjustment.

    The specific conditions for optimization are:3

    (e) V= 1<
    (f) K = J    — dK



(2)(a) and (b) define short—run factor demands. (2)(c) is the investment equation,

with 37K a rising function of Tobin's q, denoted as t,   the   real equity value of

a unit of the firm's capital. The value of T may be written as in (2)(d), as

the discounted value of the marginal productivity of capital. Notice that this

marginal product is the sum of QK and (J/K)2'(J/K), where the latter term is

the contribution of an increment of K to a reduction in adjustment costs.

(2)(e) shows that the value of the firm is simply IC.

      In the specific case of linear adjustment costs, with


                =       .




the   investment function is given by J/K       (   T_Tj),/frj.    In the steady state,
(J/K) =   d, SO T                (The notation x will signify the steady state value
                    llj + kjd.

of x.) From (2)(d), we may therefore derive that K must equal

(R+d)i + dR + 4d2/2 (note that QK           R1Tj for d            0). We will denote this cri-

tical long-run value of QK by H. Clearly, T and therefore investment will

tend to be high if QK is expected to exceed R for an extended period.

      In the simulations later we will modify the investment function to allow for

certain features of the (post—1973) U.K. tax provisions on corporate earnings,

depreciation, and investment. Specifically, for corporate tax rate tC, full

expensing of new capital investment, and full equity financing, the investment

equation is changed slightly to be J/K =
                                               (T-1-tc_ij)/[q(1_t0)].        Summers and

Poterba [1981] provide a detailed account of how U.K. tax provisions affect the

form of the J/K function.


(b) The Factor Price Frontier

      The effects on supply of a shift in T are governed by (2), which can best

be understood by appeal to the factor price frontier (FPF).4 The FPF summarizes

the information about the gross output technolor in terms of the maximal com-

binations of the three marginal factor products,                     K' QN) = 0, which by
substitution of (2)(a) and (b) may be written as F(W, QK )                    0.   The curve

 11n0 is downward sloping and convex to the origin. The slope of the tangent at

the point A measures the capital/labour ratio that corresponds to the pair of

factor returns (Q1<,wp0), and its intercept on the Wp axis (OT) measures Y/L.

Likewise, the intercept on the Q1< axis (os) measures Y/K. The elasticity of FPF

at the point A = SA/TA measures the relative shares of capital and labour in Y.

      Weak separability of the production function {Q = Q[V(L,K) ,N] 1 implies weak

separability of the dual FPF, i.e., F0 takes the form F[f(Wp,Q1<),7]                  0. A
raw-material price increase, like Hicks—neutral technical regress, is thus

represented by a homothetic inward shift of F0 to            F1 .   At   the point C on the new

FPF, on the ray OA, the capital/labour ratio is the same as at A. Thus, for
K =          and L = L0, a rise in Tt11   shifts
      1<0                                          the factor returns from A to C. We will

call C the point of short—run adjustment (when K =
                                                              K0, L = L0).     Following a rise
in 7L1      marginal   factor products at C are reduced by the same ratio from their

original level at A. Total real income per unit of labour (Y/L) falls by the

same proportion from OT to OM (and Y/K from OS to ON). Since                   < H, there will

tend to be disinvestment at A. The case of real wage rigidity at Wp0, which may

be termed the very short run, is represented by the point B where                  and Y/K

must of necessity fall by more than at C and the capital/labour ratio is higher

than at C. At the given capital stock, K0, L will fall and unemployment will

emerge. 5


      The polar case -to the very short run (Wp =
                                                          Wp0) is that of an externally
imposed long—run real rate of return (QK = H).             This is represented by the point

D, to be termed the long run, at which the real wage and the capital/labour

ratio are below their levels at C. In contrast to C, the point D represents an

equilibrium steady—state level after capital has adjusted downward to the given
                                                    —12—



real rate of return, R. With full employment of labour, capital and output

(gross and net) at D are both lower than at the initial point A.

      Of course, the designations of very short run, short run,                    and   long run

responses to a change in T                are   stylizations that must be flushed—out in a fully

dynamic model. To get such a model, we must append a wage equation to (2)

(a)—(e), as we do in section (e) below. We will consider two types of wage

equations: continuous market clearing, and a Phillips curve mechanism.

      First, however, the graphical representation can be given full analytical

content. Consider any rn—factor constant returns production function whose out-

put (in logs) is q. Let the (log) quantity and product price of factor i be

denoted by a and W            (i   =
                                       1, 2, ..., m), respectively.6           Next, denote the cost

share of the ith factor by Sj               and let the Hicks—Allen elasticity of substitution
be 0i where OjjSj =           (wj/aj)(ai/wj).           Using dots for rates of change, the unit

factor demand functions are:

(3)                   -       =
                                          Gj5W
                                   j= 1

and

                m
                              = 0
                 2.

                      ojw                 for all i =   1, 2, ...,   m.




      Next we write down the factor—price—frontier in rate of change form:


(4)                           = 0.


      Equation (4) can be substituted into equation (3)                   to   solve out for

the case in which one of the factors (say, the mth) is fixed (in our
                                                    —13—




case:    capital is fixed in the short run). Thus, equation (3) can be

r ew r i t ten;




(3')                 i -                         - m)sj;j        (i = 1, 2, ..., rn)




Applying equation (3') to the three factor case (L, N, K), we get


(5)           £ -        = s( o -    ok)wp
                                             +
                                                  (a       -


(6)           n   - q =
                          s(     -
                                     k)Wp    +             -

()            k   - q =
                          z(     -
                                     ck)Wp
                                             +    ( n k)   -



Equation      (7), when reversed in sign (            - k),    is the short-run supply function.

Since k < 0, this readily shows that output (per unit of capital) is a negative

function of the raw material price (Tr) when capital and raw materials are co-

operant factors (okn > 0). Also, it is a negative function of the real wage

(we)    if   capital and labour are co—operant factors (                 £ > 0).

       By subtracting equation (5) from equation (7), we get an expression for the

labour/capital ratio and likewise find that L/K is negatively related to Wp (for

a given )           if   °k > 0, and is negatively related to               (at given Wp) as long as

fl + 9- °.zn + k• The latter condition is automatically satisfied in the

case of raw material separability (o =                          to   which we now turn.7

       When separability Q[V(L,K),N] is assumed, these equations can be further

simplified. Since now                =           equation (6) now becomes:
                                                          -14-



(6')                     n -    =


where       o =
                   s( °nk —               = 0ni   =
                                                      °rk is the elasticity of substitution between V
and N in Q. Similarly, it is easy to show that s(                           —      = sk( °k —       =


       is    the elasticity of substitution between L and K in V. We can now write

down the output supply per unit of capital and labour demand per unit of capital

in the following simplified form:


                  q —   k =           -    SkSn01 1n
                               °lWp
(a)               £ -   k = -01(1 + skis)wp -             SklSn01
where n = (1 —s)—l (si+ 01—1 k) < 1, if 01 > o.                      These equations can also 'be

obtained more directly (see below).

       Let us now reconsider the implications of a raw material price increase

under the various time specifications. In the very short run, if the real wage

is rigid and the capital stock is held constant, we move from the point A to B

in Figure 1. One gets an output and employment reduction, respectively, of


                  q =   —(sklsflGl    n)ir1.


                  z=

When the real wage is allowed to adjust downwards, so as to maintain full

employment at a given capital stock (this was termed the "short—run": . =                       k
0), the economy moves to the point C in Figure 1.                       From the equation for £ —   k

we get Wp =             _(i_s)1sir          and therefore the output reduction is mitigated

by the amount (1_s)_lsoii.8
                                                   —15—



  Finally, as we move to the long run at point D in Figure 1, we have QK = R, L

  L, i.e., p =             0, (where p        log (QK)). A constant rate of return implies,

by (4)    that         =
                  Wp       S91Sn       Therefore,     the drop in q -   k of the very short run
is now recovered by the larger amount Sllsnoli                 > (1—sn)isn           i.e.,   Q/K at
D must be higher than at C, but it is most probably still lower than than at the

starting point A.

    Since K now falls, total output never rebounds to the level at D.                    The

total long—run change in output from A to D can be written down directly by

observing the symmetry with the case of the very short run with capital now

replacing the role of labour. Exchanging the subscripts in the coefficient of

   in equation (7) or (7') we have for the total output drop:


            q =   -s(o- a)n -(i - sn)l(sk_1s                       +



while    the output drop in the very short run can be written as


                 [_sk_lsnbi n]i
                                   =   [-(i   -
                                                  5n)l(s5kd1   +


There    is partial output recovery in the long run            from the   very short run as long

as s/sk > sk/s, a condition on the relative labour share which empirically

usually holds.


(c) A Two—Level CES Production Function

   A logical sequel to the production framework discussed in the previous sec-

tion is the nested (or two—level) CES production function for which the elasti-

cities of substitution o and o (but not necessarily the factor shares) are

assumed constant. Thus we assume Q                = Q[V(K,L),N],   where the intermediate input

(N) is separable from real value added (v) and consider Q                 to   be a CES function in
                                           —16—



V, N, with constant elasticity of substitution a, and V to be CES in K, L

with constant elasticity 01 .       As before, we use the convention of applying small

letters (where capital letters also appear) to denote the natural logarithms and

use dots for the time derivatives (e.g., P =       lnL,   £ =   L1   aL/st). We now denote

the output elasticity of labour (se, etc.), the intermediate input, and capital

by ; , and        i, respectively, and again assume constant returns to scale ( cx +

       1= i).

       For any production function we have (ignoring technical progress) the rate

of change of output:


(9)



and for the dual price structure (letting p =       ln(QK)):9

(10)              0 =      +      + yp


which leads to the factor—price—frontier in rate—of-change form:


(ii)               p= -l( )
       In   the discussion that follows we shall introduce technical progress in

labour—augmenting form (at the rate A). This implies that instead of L, we

write L' = Le       and 9.' =   £ + A and similarly write W'p =
                                                                Wpe       (and Wp' = Wp   A)



instead of Wp. Thus, equation (ii) will take the form:


(ii')               = r1[x)           +
                                          —17--

        We rewrite the rate of change of output
                                                      supply [equation (7')] and labour
 demand [equation (8)] in the following revised form:


 (12)             s =    r101[;    -   x) + n]        +

 (13)             £d =   -T101[(1(;     A) +      ]+k-         A



 where n= (i—&)—l[a+ 01—1A and n<             1   for ci >

        These equations reveal the danger of measuring total factor productivity by

 subtracting weighted inputs of labor and capital, but not intermediate goods,

 from a measure of output. The "conventional"
                                                          measure yields:


 (14)            q - (1-     (+ c) =    (1-   )1 (a
Thus, the measure confounds the normal technical             progress term, cxA,   with tech-
nical regress due to the rise in raw material input prices, 3o1r. We suspect
that some of the apparent slowdown in TFP growth in manufacturing in the
industrial countries in the 1970s can be ascribed to this term.


(d) The Dynamic Adjustment Process

    The last step in the theoretical analysis is to describe the explicit

adjustment paths of factor prices, employment, output, and the capital stock,

between the very short run and the long run. We will work with the case of weak

separability of N in the gross output function; it is straightforward to extend

the analysis to the general case. We have seen that output and employment can

be written as functions of K,     i, and w, while K is a function, through
Tobin's q, of the future paths of ii and
                                         wp. We will continue to take lTn                as
exogenous, but will now specify the wage dynamics in order to close the model.

At many points in the following discussion we will drop inessential constant

terms that arise from linearization.
                                                           -18-



       The alternative assumptions are:


(1 5) (a)     £ =                       Continuous Full Employment
or

       (b)    Wp     e(z—f)             Phillips       Curve


In case (b), we assume that firms' demand for labour at the posted wage is

always satisfied, so that £ may exceed 9 in the short term.                           (1 5) (a) or (b),

together with (2) defines a complete dynamic model.

       In the full employment case, £ =                    0, so according to (8) we see that: Wp

[+
          f
             lsoi]/[(i          +    sk_1s)].              By integrating this expression, we can write

(with    wp the full-employment wage):


(16)         w =          +   [(k   -   ')       +                -
                                                                      )]/[(1     +
                                                                                     s(1s]
Weak separability is sufficient to ensure that w is an increasing function of

k, and a decreasing function of iTs.                       As a first—order approximation, the FPF can

be written as:


(17)             p- = -(sn/sk)(-'nO)                   -
                                                           (silsk)(w_wP0)

Next, use (16) and (17) to write:


(18)         p        -
                          (n/k)(             -
                                                     ) - (silsk)[(k     -   )+
                                         - ,)]/[(i
Therefore,       with continuous market clearing, p is a decreasing function of k and

lI,    which we will write as p = —ak-b
                                                     -19-



        From the firm's valuation equation, T = RT —
                                                     [QK —                    ( T-1)2/(2 j)], which can be
linearized around T = 1+fr3d (see page 9) as i =
                                                                   (R+)T      —
                                                                                  QK, with     a positive
constant. Since p          = log(Q)     =
                                            ak-bTI,    we can approximate Qk by linear function in
k and 7r as well. Ignoring constants, and linearizing around Qk =
                                                                  R, we have
Qk       -aRk-bRii =   -ak-bTr     (a = aR, b =       bR).
        Substituting into the equation for T, we have T = (R÷                     )T   + ak + bit11.

Together with (2)(f) we have a 2x2 linear differential equation system in T and

        The system is shown graphically in Figure 2.                   Adding the phase plane arrows
to the figure, we see inimediately that the system is saddlepoint stable, with

the trajectory given by the dashed line. The equation for T as an integral of

future profitability, (2)(d), is equivalent to the condition that the stock

market price t always adjusts to keep the economy on the stable trajectory after

an unanticipated shift in

     Figure 3 examines such a shift in ir. The figure depicts an unanticipated,

once—and—for—all jump in , under the assumption that K, L, and N are all

co—operant factors, so that dk/drr < 0. The T = 0 locus shifts to the left,

moving the long-run equilibrium from E13 to E1. At the time of the change in

n, the equity price falls from T to T(0), giving the signal to firms to reduce

gross fixed capital formation. Over time, Ic falls to reach a new lower level

at Ej ,   as i rises back to .                    What   about    real wages?      On      impact, we have a shift

in wp and        as shown from A to C in the FPF, Figure 1. Over time, Wp moves as

in (16), and so Wp < 0 along the entire path to E1

       When the model is extended to include sluggish wage adjustment, both its

realism and analytical complexity increase. First, we use the labour demand

schedule in (a) to write employment as a function of k and 11:


(20)                    =         +               -                               -   SkSn

Substituting       this equation into the Phillips curve relationship (15)(b) we have

trajectory is not available.

       For one time, once-and—for-all jumps in              we can determine I according to

a method suggested by Dixit [1981]. He shows that t— is a linear combination of k—k

and W_w, where the weights are the elements of the eigenvector corresponding

to the positive characteristic root in (23). Thus


(24)                 T -    = a1 (k-k) + a2(w-w)

where a1 and a2 are equal to


                 =
            a1       a26/A< 0
            a = _(silsk)R(e(1+silsk)+A]              < 0



A is the positive eigenvalue in the matrix in (23).

       Notice that T —       T is   a negative   function of k —   k and w —
                                                                               w.   When

Tt rises, both of these latter terms are positive under our assumptions, so that
q —      correspondingly becomes negative. On impact, therefore, 1 must be less

than zero. At time zero, with k and w as yet unchanged, the disturbance in

      is exactly the very short run shock that was formally analyzed earlier.

       To trace out the longer—run dynamic implications of the i increase, we may

substitute (24) back into (23) to get




                                                 (1/)a2            k -   k

illustrated in the figure.

II. Empirical Evidence on Input Price Shocks: The Case of U.K. Manufacturing

       The goal of this section is to give a quantitative assessment of the dynamic

responses in U.K manufacturing to higher input prices in the 1970s. An invest-

ment equation, wage equation, and short—run production block are estimated using

the framework of the previous section. The gross output technolor is spe-

cialized to the CES case, and an output supply, labour demand, and FPF equation

are jointly estimated with the appropriate cross—equation restrictions. A fully

efficient estimation procedure would include the wage and investment equations

in the jointly estimated block, but given the complexity of the resulting

restrictions we did not pursue joint estimation of the complete model. The

simplification is at the cost of some efficiency, but not consistency of the

parameter estimates. One basic problem with the model as it now stands is the

fact that while (11')—(13) are correct as written in rate-of—change form, the

coefficients (i.e., elasticities) derived from output elasticities (a, , y)

may vary (unless we are in a Cobb—Douglas world). One simplified approach,

which we pursue here, is to consider a linear approximation of each equation

around some fixed elasticities, which amounts to estimation of the equations in

level form, and adding an intercept.12 We shall consider both single equations

and jointly estimated equations done on this basis.

       To recapitulate, we estimate the following three equations for the gross

output function:

(26)          =
                  o — (ci/A)(w.it)   —   (   /A)i11                   (factor—price   frontier)

(27)        q =     — (ao1/X)(w—Xt)      —
                                             (no/A)i +     k          (output supply)

(28)          =     — [(1—)oj/A](w—At)         —   (o1/A)ii + k   —    At     (labor demand)
                                     —27-



The 1o i        parameters are inessential constants. These equations are simply

the level forms of (ii'), (12) , (1 3). Regression 1 in Table 3 shows a single—

equation estimate of (26), reported earlier in Bruno [1981]. Regressions 2 and

3 show related estimates for germany, and Japan. The estimates for the labor-

augmenting productivity factor, A, the share of profits in value—added,       =


y/(1—),   and the share of intermediate goods in total costs, ,   all   have the

right orders of magnitude. Figure 5 gives a graphic representation of the esti-

mated factor price profile for the U.K. The chart is drawn in terms of the

actual profit rate      and the detended product wage (we'   Wpet), using the
estimated A.   There is a clear upward movement in W' (at the expense of R) more

or less along a given FPF before 1972, and a clear shift, to a new FPF after

1972. The U.K. evidences short—run real wage rigidity after the shift, during

1973—76, and then a steep decline in W' in 1977. Data for 1978—80 suggest that

the product wage has more than recovered, and that R has continued to fall.

   Notice that the estimated equation assumes a constant trend growth of TFP

during 1961-77. All shifts in labor—productivity after 1973 are therefore

attributed to the higher level of    or a lower growth in (K/L), rather than to

other productivity—reducing factors. While such a procedure yields plausible

estimates, there is some worry that the method might attribute an independent

decline in TFP to it   Since the apparant decline in TFP growth is so closely

timed to the material price shock, we were not able to separate the two effects

in our econometric estimates. We attempted to allow for a shift in A after

1973, but the high multicollinearity of the time shift and 11   led   to unstable

parameter estimates and high standard errors.

   Regressions 5—6 show two versions of the single—equation estimation of the

output supply function, and regressions 7-8 show analagous regressions for the

labor demand schedule. These are annual ordinary-least—squares regressions for

1956—78. After some experimentation with OLS and SLS versions of the equations,

we determined that lagged rather than current factor prices were more decisive

for output supply and labor input. The importance of these lags probably

reflects costs of adjustment in altering the variable factor inputs and/or a

lead time in production planning. The simple equations do not perform par-

ticularly well, as the wage is insignificant in the output equation and the

intermediate input is insignificant in the labor demand equation. The capital

stock is significant, or nearly significant at P = .05, in all of the equations.

Our estimates with cross-equation restrictions improve upon these results

markedly.

    In regressions 5 and 7, we add the lagged inventory—output ratio (S/Q) as a

regressor, and find a strongly significant effect in the output equation.

Inventories have been cited in a number of recent studies as the channel through

which demand shocks lead to serially correlated output fluctuations. An initial

demand disturbance causes a large unexpected accumulation of inventory stocks.

Part of the response to these shocks is de—stocking, and part is a reduction in

output, until   inventory   levels are back to normal. In this case,the variable

may proxy for the effects of demand disturbances on output. Note that it is

highly significant, and that it raises the coefficient and significance on

in the output equation. It also markedly improves the Durbin—Watson statistic,

suggesting that it helps to explain the serially correlated fluctuations in Q.

    Table 4 presents estimates of the YPF, output supply, and labor demand, in

which the cross equation restrictions are imposed. A variety of models are

estimated: model A is as shown in earlier; model B adds the lagged

inventory-output ratio to each of the regressions; and model C adds the inven—

tory variable to the labor and output variables alone. When the system is esti-

mated as a whole, the parameter estimates are almost all highly significant, and

almost always are in the reasonable range for factor shares (cx, ,      i)   and labor

productivity growth (x).         The estimated substitutability of value—added and the

intermediate input (o) is between .28 and .41, a plausible range that is in line

with earlier estimates of Bruno [19811. More surprising are the exceedingly low

estimates of °i   ,   the   elasticity of substitution between K and L in value added.

The estimate in model A is the highest, at a mere .31; and they fall to only .12

in model C. While these estimates are indeed far from the standard Cobb—Douglas

assumption, they of course do no more than reflect the sharp rise in labor's

share of value added, from an average of .72 during 1960—72 to .77 during

1972-75, and up to .78 during 1975—78.

   We can use the regression estimates in order to compute the components of

change in q-k in terms of the underlying explanantory variables. The first

panel in Table 5 gives the component breakdown by sub—period for model C.

   of 1.2 percent per annum.

    These estimates suggest that during the period 1973—78, raw material prices

directly explain over half of the 15 percent fall in output per unit of capi-

tal. The "demand" variable accounts (inventories) for another 45 percent. Real

wages, relative to the productivity trend, were fairly rigid during 1973—76

(especially when compared to the contemporaneous developments in some other

industrial countries, like Japan and the U.S.; see Bruno and Sachs [1981]).

Only in the latter part of the period, 1976—78, did they mitigate the output—

depressing effect of raw materials somewhat.13 For the period 1973—78 as a

whole, the average contribution was slightly positive (.7 relative to —2.7).

There is an unexplained residual component of about 25 percent which may be due

to productivity slowdown or other deflationary elements that are unaccounted for

in this model.

    The second part of Table 5 provides a similar breakdown for manhours per

unit of capital. Real wages and technical progress account for most of the fall

in the labor/capital ratio throughout the period 1956-78, with raw material pri-

ces taking up about 1/3 after 1973. The model over—explains the relative

employment slowdown in 1973—76, which may be evidence of labor hoarding, consti-

tuting the other side of the unexplained producitivity residual.

    It should be stressed that the direct attribution of one half of the change

in q—k to raw material prices at best represents only the direct short—term

effect from the supply side. To this one should add the indirect effect of the

profit squeeze on investment and capital stock, as we do in the simulations that

follow. 2his point is best illustrated by appealing to the distinction made in
                                               -35—



Section I between the various time horizons.           Using model C parameters the
elasticity of response of output to a 1 percent increase in                    is —.40 in the
very short fllfl (Wp =   k   =
                                 o),   -.33 in the short run (   k   =
                                                                         0),   and -1.3 in the
long run ( = k     =   0).14     Finally, one may add the depressing effect of rising

relative import prices on real incomes as well as on initiating contractionary

macropolicies, which play their role here (if at all) through the inventory
variable.

    Next, we need numerical estimates of the investment and wage functions.

There is now a growing literature that confirms the link between Tobin's q and

investment in the United Kingdom (see especially Flemniing [1976a,b] for pioneering

estimates of r; Oulton [1978]; Jenkinson [1981]; and Poterba and Summers

[1981]). The potential for a strong econometric relationship is clearly evident

in Figure 6, which is reproduced from Flemniing [1976b]. The investment rate is

closely tied to fluctuations in T, which seems to lead by about a year.

    Some simple regressions between J/K and T are shown in Table 6. The

regressions are reproduced from Poterba and Summers [igai]. These authors make

various adjustments to the valuation ratio (the market value of the firm rela-

tive to the replacement cost of capital) to take account of U.K. tax laws.

While the theory presented earlier argues for a contemporaneous relationship of

investment and t, the regression estimates clearly point to a lagged effect of

T on J/K as well. Tobin's q is shown to have a highly significant effect,

though the low Durbin-Watson statistics suggest some mispecification in the

basic equation. When the equations are re—estimated with corrections for first—

order and second-order serial correlation, the estimated effect of I diminishes

somewhat, but still remains significant.

    A surprising feature of the regressions is the extremely small magnitude of

the coefficients on r.      A drop of i from 1 .0 to 0.5 is calculated to result in a

fall in J/K from about 0.09 to 0.075 (using regression 1). Such small effects

of T have also been reported for U.S. data (in Summers [1981], for example).

The coefficient (or sum of coefficients) on T measure the inverse of the

adjustment cost parameter, according to the linear—adjustment cost model.

Thus, the estimates of        +    =   .02 suggest a   of 50, which seems very high.

    There is little doubt that data problems in part account for a downward bias

on the T coefficient, but theoretical problems also play a role. In the invest-

ment model we use, the observed firm value (subject to some important tax

adjustments) is always the appropriate indicator of marginal investment deci-

sions. In a world of vintage or putty—clay capital, however, it is possible for

stock market movements to signal changes in the value of quasi—rents on old

capital that do not affect investment decisions on new capital. In the jargon

of the investment literature, "marginal Tobin's q" does not equal "average

Tobin's q" (i.e., observed values of t).       Unfortunately, we remain a long way

off from a convincing and empirically tractable vintage model of production with

intermediate inputs.

    Next, we turn to the wage equation. As thoroughly explained in Grubb,

Jackman and Layard [1981], the form of the wage equation is both unresolved and

enormously important to the questions at hand! Most importantly we must know:

(i) whether the degree of labor market slack affects the rate of real wage

increase; and (2) whether real wage growth responds to the difference of actual

real wages and some "target" or "aspiration" level of real wages (the so—called

Sargen effect). And    if   the target—wage model is correct, do target wages them-
                                       —39—



selves respond adaptively to the history of actual wage growth? These questions

remain subject to enormous dispute in the U.K. literature, with opposite answers

reached by numerous authors on each of the issues.

    For us the relevant question is whether temporary labor market slack is

necessary and sufficient to reduce the path of real wages following an input

price shock. Under what circumstances can real wage targets be reduced by a

bout of unemployment? Some very simple, and imprecise evidence is gathered in

the final three regressions of Table 6. Labor market slack is measured by the

deviation of (log) manhours in manufacturing from a linear trend. Because

lagged real wages are insignificant in regression 5, the equation implies that

labor market slack leads to a reduction of real wages but not to a steady

decline in real wages growth, If the model log(w) =     +   og(L)   is correct, as
is implied, then an input price shock permanently lowers the employment level

in U.K. manufacturing. In the next regression, there is a modest effect of

slack on real wage change. According to the equation, a one percent decline in

manhours (relative to trend), sustained for five years, results in a fall in

   of only 0.33 percent relative to trend. Finally, in regression 7 we see

again that changes in U.K. real wages are basically tied to changes in

employment, but not closely to the employment level itself.

    These results are suggestive but rather crude, as sophisticated wage equa-

tions must better account for: the difference of the real consumption wage and

producer's labor costs; the timing of contract negotiations; pre—tax versus

post—tax labor earnings; inflation expectations; incomes policies; and problems

in measurement of labor market slack. Still, there is a strong feeling that
                                      -40-




downward real wage adjustment is not likely to be a smooth, costless process in

the U.K. economy.

     The complete supply—side model is now simulated, using (approximately) the

parameters that we have estimated. Model C of the joint estimates is selected

for the gross output block. The simulation model is shown in full in Table 7.

Two labor market equations are used, representing the alternatives of instan-

taneous market clearing and sluggish real wage adjustment. Three simulations

are undertaken from an initial steady state: (1) a 10 percent, unanticipated

permanent rise in    in 1980, with full employment of labor assumed; (2) the

same increase in iTs, but with slow real wage adjustment; and (3) a 10 percent

rise in nn, announced in 1980 and commencing in 1983. The simulations yield the

time paths of output, employment, investment, equity prices and wages following

the given shock. They will be reported as percentage deviations from an initial

full—employment steady—state growth path.

     As pointed out above, the complete model exhibits saddlepoint stability,

and the tricky part of the simulation exercise involves finding the particular

initial value for Tobin's q that drives the system to a new steady state (all

other values of T lead to an explosive divergence from steady state). We use

the method of multiple shooting, described in Lipton, Poterba, Sachs and Summers

[1980], to find the saddlepoint—stable trajectory.

     The results of the simulations are shown in Table 8. In the full-

employment case, the rise in 1I causes an immediate fall in real wages of 6.9

percent, and in productivity of 2.5 percent. Since Qk is reduced below its

long—run value, the stock market price falls, in this case a modest 2.7 percent.

Far-sighted investors know that the marginal producivity of capital will rise in

the future, so that they do not place to much weight on the immediate sharp

deterioration of profitability (Qk falls from   —   percent   to   percent in

1980). Over time, K continues to fall, pushing the real wage and productivity

even further below the initial trend. Qk rises, on the other hand, and Tobin's

q approaches its initial value. In the long run, the real wage falls by 8.4

percent; productivity, Q/L, by 2.7 percent; and the capital stock, K, by .6 per-

cent. The very modest long-run decline in K reflects the low value of           in

the value—added function (set at .11 for the exercise). Since K must rexaain in

almost fixed proportion to full—employment L, it changes little over the course

of time. Were      assumed to be 1.0 initially, with all other parameters the

same, the long—run decline in K would equal

     Simulation 2 dramatically indicates the depressing effect of real wage

resistance on the adjustment to a supply shock. Most directly, 1980 output

falls more than in the first simulation (4.2 percent rather than 2.5 percent),

and the unemployment rate rises to 2.6 percent. Since the higher real wage

reduces profitability and since forward—looking investors correctly perceive a

very slow decline in future wages, the 1980 level of Tobin's q falls more

sharply than in the market—clearing case (down 13 percent rather than 2.7

percent). As a consequence, the real—wage rigidity leads to a steep process of

capital decurnulation. In the first simulation, K falls slowly to .6 percent

below the baseline. With wage rigidity, K falls steeply to —1.8 percent below

trend, and then slowly recovers as real wages fall. The model exhibits a

strongly damped oscillation of the sort demonstrated in Figure 4. Since real
                                        —45-



wages decline so slowly, K falls below its long-run level; in turn, w is pulled
below
        w, which eventually pushes K above K, etc. (The oscillation is in fact so
damped that there is almost direct convergence to equilibrium.)

     In the third simulation, the increase in Tt is anticipated (in 1980)     three
years before it actually occurs (in 1983). The stock market immediately capita-

lizes the decline in future profitability, as Tobin's q declines 8.2 percent.

Since equity prices drive the investment process, the decumulation of capital

starts in 1981, two years before the price increase.    Of course, as K falls,

employment is also reduced in the rigid real—wage case. In 1972, the

unemployment rate stands at .3   percent.   hen the shock finally hits, the

unemployment rate jumps and productivity falls, while the stock market hardly

responds. The remaining adjustment profile is very similar to that of simula-
tion 2.

     These numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility of specifying,

estimating, and solving a dynamic non-linear supply model with forward-looking

agents. In our papers, Bruno and Sachs [1982] and Sachs [1982] the approach is

extended to a complete macromodel of the economy, with optimizing households as

well as firms.

III. Conclusions

    This paper develops a theoretical model of the effects of input price

shocks, and applies the model to the case of U.K. manufacturing. With the

theoretical model we trace out the dynamic adjustments to the price shock, and

show that the paths of output, employment, and capital stock depend crucially on

the responsiveness of real wages to labor market slack. Even with full labor-

market clearing, an input price shock causes a fall in output, productivity,

real wages and real equity prices on impact, and leads to a continued decline in

the capital stock and output over time. When real wages are sticky, these

effects are greatly magnified, and unemployment as well as reduced output beco-

mes a major effect of the shock. With greater real wage stickiness, profitabi-

lity is more sharply affected by the rise in input prices, and investment tends

to be more sharply squeezed.

   There is abundant evidence that higher input prices have played a signifi-

cant role in the slowdown in economic growth since 1973 throughout the OECD.

Most major economies have experienced a serious squeeze in profits and invest-

ment that dates from around the first oil shock (see Sachs [1979] and Bruno

[1981b] for details). We develop this case in some detail for the U.K. by esti-

mating a gross output function, investment equation, and real wage equation for

the manufacturing sector, based on the theoretical model. Estimates of the

factor—price frontier show a sharp shift in the frontier after 1973, in line

with the observed drop in profitability from about 9.5 percent return on capital

during 1960—72 to under 5.0 percent during 1973—76 (see Table 2). Estimates of

output supply also confirm the large role for input prices. We estimate that
                                        -47-



 over half of the growth slowdown in output
                                               per unit capital (Q/K) after 1972 can
 be attributed to higher input
                                 prices. Moreover, the slowdown in K itself can be
 traced in large part to the higher input prices via reduced profitability. To

 show the complete dynamic effects, we simulate a small non—linear model based on

 the econometric estimates, and once again we find large effects of the input

 shock, particularly in the case of real wage resistance.

    These are major shortcomings that remain at the conclusion of this work,

involving: (1) lags in factor adjustment; (2) the
                                                     productivity puzzle; and (3)
the integration of demand factors into the supply—side framework. We touch on

these in turn. With respect to factor
                                         adjustments, there is widespread evidence
and a long tradition holding that
                                    labor, like capital, is adjusted only slowly
over time in response to an exogenous shock. Indeed
                                                        in our empirical work, we
found it necessary to relate current employment and output to lagged factor pri-

ces. In his excellent study of labor demand in
                                                   U.K. manufacturing, Symons
[1981] also finds a lagged adjustment
                                        pattern. Conceptually, this slow adjust-

ment is readily handled, by supposing convex costs of adjustment to labor as in

Sargent [1978] as well as capital. Empirically, though, the problem is

trickier, as now labor demand depends on expectations of future real factor

prices, and not just their current level.

    An even more central empirical problem is our treatment of productivity

developments since 1973. That labor productivity growth has deteriorated there

is no doubt, but the allocation of that slowdown to various factors is still

very much in doubt. On our limited post—1973 data we could make
                                                                   little progress
in evaluating whether reduced capital and intermediate input utilization can
                                      -48-



explain the slowdown, or whether an exogenous slowdown in total factor produc-

tivity (TFp) growth had occurred. The implications of an input shock or exoge—

nous TFP slowdown for output, unemployment, real wage growth, and investment are

actually very similar, since an input price shock is analogous to technical

regress. But for quantitative assessments it is important to know the sources

and size of the productivity slowdown. Our Table 1, and regressions in Bruno

[igai] suggest that K and    cannot fully explain the U.K. productivity
experience. In future empirical work, the TFP developments must be better

integrated with the input price shock.

    The greatest conceptual problem lies in the proper integration of supply and

demand factors in the study of the macroeconomic adjustment process. Our model

assumes that profit—maximizing firms are always on their supply schedules, so

that fluctuations in output can always be attributed to shifts in the capital

stock or factor prices. Pure demand disturbances, in which firms are rationed

in the output market and hence off of their supply schedules, are not allowed.

This treatment is extreme, though no more so than the typical Keynesian position

which treats all fluctuations as pure demand disturbances. A more sensible

position, no doubt, would allow for both supply and demand shocks to play

distinct roles, whose importance varies over time. We would surmise that the

deep recessions of 1975 and 1980 represent cases in which firms were pushed off

of supply schedules by tight demand, while the rest of 1973-onward basically

reflects the type of supply squeeze that we depict in the paper. We are now

attempting to formulate a dynamic model that will allow for that possibility.

Input-Output Accounts for U.K. Manufacturing, 1954—78

    The manufacturing sector is defined as Orders III, V—XIX of the Standard

Industrial Classification. Order IV, "Coal and Petroleum Products", was

excluded. Inputs were divided into four categories: labor, capital, energy, and

non—energy intermediate inputs. Definitions of the constructed variables are as
follows.



Gross (
    Price    and quantity indices for output were constructed and then normalized

to equal the value (.    million)   of gross output, excluding stock appreciation

(source: Table 21, DAE1), in 1968. Before normalization, PQ = Wholesale Price

Index of Home Sales, all manufactured products, 1975 = 100; ETAS 1980.

Exclusion of the contribution of SIC Order IV was not possible with available

data.

    Q =    Index of Industrial Production, Manufacturing, 1975 = 100; ETAS 1980.

Using the Index for Coal and Petroleum Products (MDS, various) and appropriate

weights the contribution of SIC Order IV was subtracted from Q.

    Before normalization it was observed that the ratio of PQQ to gross output

(DAE1) for 1954-68 was stable taking on values of 7.3 to 7.6.

Labor (PLL)

     Before normalization, L = Index of hourly compensation, manufacturing, 1967
=
    100; USBLS. L = Index of total hours worked in manufacturing, 1967 = 100;

USBLS. These were then normalized to equal the 1968 value of wages and salaries

in manufacturing less that accruing in SIC Order IV (BE), plus employers'

national insurance contributions (BE). An estimate for these contributions in

SIC Order IV was estimated by a proportion of the total equal to the ratio of

"employees in employment" in Order IV to total manufacturing. The ratio PLL to

the constructed labor compensation series for 1954—78 varied from .77 to .80.


Capital (PKK)

     Define:

PKK — BE:      Profits in total manufacturing after stock appreciation, before depre-

               ciation; (BE various); no exclusion of SIC Order IV; 1954-78.

PKK - DAE: As above excluding SIC Order IV (Table 25, DAE1). Only available for

               1 954—68.


PKK - BD:      (PKI<
                       -   BB)(Average value of 1954-68 of (PKK — DAE)/(PKK — BE)).   PKK
               was constructed as PKK — DAE (1 954—68) and PKK — ED (1969—78).

     To construct K, define:

NK7O:          Net capital stock all manufacturing, 1970 prices. (STUDOS).

PNK7O:         Price index defined as ratio of current and constant (1970 as base

               year) price series for gross domestic fixed capital formation (BB).

ADJUST:        NK7O*O.0347, where 0.0347 equals the average value for 1954—68

               (period for which data was available) of the ratio of gross capital

       (excluding fuel producing ones). The available data for "all industry"

       includes "construction", "water", "other manufacturing and quarrying" for

       which disaggregate numbers are not available. Source, UKESD).


         was constructed as PEE/E where PEE was derived as follows. PEE by final

users is only available post 1968 (see UKESD, 1980), and so a series was calcu-

lated by multiplying several disaggregate quantity and price series. Quantity

series, as in E, were from UXESD. Price series were taken from : for 1954—63,

"Purchasers average prices of fuel in U.K." (p. 115, DAE2); for 1963—79, "Prices

of fuels used by manufacturing industry" (UKESD, 1977, 1980). In calculating

expenditure the following assumptions were made: the price of coal, coke and

breeze, other solid fuel was taken to be that of coal; the price of all types of

gas was taken to be the published price; the price of petroleum and creosote—

pitch neocture taken to be that of heavy fuel oil. This constructed series was

used as an estimate of PEE.

Non-Energy Intermediate Inputs (PPM)

          PMM was derived as the residual from PQQ -              -         -          and M as PMM/PM.
                                                           PLL        PKK       PEE,
          is defined as PMM =                     a weighted average of intermediate

purchase from outside and from within the manufacturing sector, where

PQ =          as above, wholesale price index of home sales.
      =       share of manufacturing non-energy purchases in manufacturing gross output

              in 1973. Calculated from 1973 Input—Output Tables (ET, June 1978).
              =   0.3547.

WNM           same as WM for noninanufacturing non-energy purchases. WNM =                 0.6453.
NM =          (PBM_E*pIE)/(1_wE), where
 EM
          =   Wholesale Price Index of Materials purchased by manufacturing industry,

              average of monthly figures, 1970 = 100;     MJJS.


IE =          Unit   Value Index of Fuel Imports, U.K., average of quarterly figures,
              1970 = 100; MDS.


WE
     =        Share of purchases of coal and crude petroleum (considered as materials

              not fuels in BM by the mineral oil refining and coke oven industries

              is total non-energy intermediate input purchases by manufacturing,

              for 1973. WE = 0.03696.

NM            is therefore the material input price index for manufacturing excluding

              SIC Order IV.


Intermediate Inputs, Total (Energy and Non-Energy) (PNN)

      When the accounting framework is reduced to three inputs, aggregating energy

and non—energy intermediate inputs, a price index                      was calculated as,
                                            —53—




      =                 + OO684*P   +
          O.O6O76*PNM                   O.334O*PQ
where the coefficients are the shares, calculated from the 1973 Input—Output

Tables (ET, June 1978), of non-manufacturing, energy, and manufacturing inputs

respectively, in gross output. N is then calculated as (PEE+PMM)/PN. (When a

division index was used to create N, the change was trivial.)

    Profit share is the ratio of gross trading profits in manufacturing to gross
    output. The profit rate is the ratio of gross trading profits to the nomi-
    nal value of the manufacturing capital
                                           stock. Both series are from the
    Dicks—Mireaux data.

3   See Sachs [igao] for details. The derivation is a straightforward applica-
    tion of the optimum conditions for the Hamiltonian H:

         H e [(Q-wL-N_I) + J-dK)]

4   A more detailed analysis for the single sector case and alternative tech-
    nological assumptions is given in Bruno (1981).

5   In the putty-clay case in which the capital/labour ratio cannot
                                                                    immediately
    adjust to the new factor prices, the various solutions are given along the
    line FCG, i.e., in the rigid real wage, rigid capital/labour case the eco-
    nomy will be at F and not at B, the rate of profit falling by more and L by
    less than at B.

6   Here and elsewhere we shall adopt the convention of using lower—case letters
    for the natural log of a capital—lettered variable (e.g., q = lnQ, etc.).

7   While the case of weak separability of intermediate inputs may be relevant
    for most industrial raw materials, it is most probably not applicable to the
    case of energy inputs, E, for which separability may take the alternative
    form Q[L,G(K,E)] [see Bernt and Wood, 1979]. Here energy combines with
    capital to form a composite from which labour (and other raw materials, here
    left out) are separable. By analogy, the resulting factor price frontier in
    the    - F
               space will now contract along the F axis at a rate which will be
    independent of the real wage. While the short—run implications may be dif-
    ferent (e.g., L/K need not fall with a rise in energy prices), the long—run
    implications are qualitatively the same.

8   As will be seen, for realistic orders of magnitude of the parameters this is
    unlikely to reverse the output drop from the initial pre—shock level.
9   The full symmetry of the two dual expressions can be
                                                         seen by writing (9) in
    the form: 0   o(2._q) +   (n-q)   +

10 The two conditions i          = r-   [Q+(J/K)2q'(J/K)] and t 1etr(t) = 0   are
    equivalent to equation 2(d).
11 Saddlepoint stability in (23) requires that the matrix have two negative and
    one positive eigenvalue.

12 E.g., an equation like z = ax + by is transformed into z = c     +   ax +by,
    where x =   x   -   x,   etc., and c = z — ax -   by.
13 Note that during the earlier growth periods 1954—64 and 1964-73, capital
    deepening was accompanied by an increase in real wages (net of productivity),
    a point which is also apparent from direct inspection of the factor price
    profile (Figure 2). See also Sargent (1979); Glynn and Sutcliffe (1972).

14 If model A estimates are used instead, with the higher value of c (.31
    rather than .11), the values become: —.00 in the very short run, —.00 in the
    short run, and -.00 in the long run. The difference between short—run and
    long—run is magnified, since there is greater long—run substitution away
    from k.
