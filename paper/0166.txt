                           INTRODUCTION AND SUNMARY


      In   this study we examine the characteristics of industrial demand for

 energy, which accounts for more than one—fourth of annual energy consumption in

 the United States. Our research has been focused on four topics:

           1. interfuel substitution in two—digit industries;

           2. substitution among energy, capital and labor;

           3. technical change in energy use; and

           4. dynamic structure of energy demand.

     Chapter 2 reports the results on interfuel substitution in two—digit

industries. Cost share equations derived from transcendental 1ogarithmc

(translog) unit cost functions are estimated with cross—section state data for

1971, 1962, and 1958. Pesults include estimates for each Industry of own and

cross price elasticities of demand for electric energy, fuel oil, natural gas,

and coal.

     The model performs well for Industries accounting for most of the total

consumption of energy in manufacturing in each year. The results indicate

considerable variation in energy substitution boih across industries and across

types of energy. Aggregate manufacturing demand for energy appears to be hIghly

price responsIve. Estimated own price elasticIties for all types of energy

except electric energy are generally substantially greater than unity.

     The use of a unit cost function for energy assumes that energy inputs are

separable from capital, labor, and other inputs. The separability of energy

inputs from capital and labor can be tested with data for 1958. The tests

were performed by Jay Ford as part of his dissertation research. As reported

in Chapter 3, separability is rejected. for four of the eight industries for

which it could be tested. The industries for which separability is accepted
                                    —2—


account for some two—thirds of energy consumption by the group of eight

industries. Nevertheless, the rejection of separabIlity for some industries

indicates that the interfuel substitution results have to be interpreted with

caution.

     Estimation with 1958 data of a cost function including capital and labor

also makes It possible to calculate estimated cross elasticities of demand

between energy Inputs and cat'ital and labor. The preliminary results reported

in Chapter 3 indicate considerable variation in substitution between different

types of energy and non—energy inputs.

     The estimated price elasticities of demand reported in Chapters 2 and 3

can be interpreted as long—run elasticities. Short—run elasticities of demand,

and the time path of response of demand to price changes, are equally important

but have been largely ignored in previous studies. In this study, the model

of demand for factors of production developed by Nadiri and Rosn (1969, 173]

is adapted to estimate dynamic demand equations for energy and other inputs

for total U.S. manufacturing.

     The results are reported in Chapter 4. All estimated short—run

elasticities of demand for energy are statistically significant. Estimated

long—run elasticities are similar to estimates In other studies. Th onse

to price changes     found to be quite rapid. The response of demand for each

input to excess demands for other inputs is also reported. The results indicate

that excess demand for energy increases labor stock and capacity utilization

and decreases capital stock.

     Energy price elasticities measure the response of demand for energy to

price changes holding technology constant. In the long—run energy consumption

may also be affected by changes in technology, which may in part be induced by

changes in prices.

     Technical change in energy use In the prinary metai.s.industrjes was

examined by John Wills in his Ph.D. dissertation. As discussed in Chapter 5,

the results indicate that technical change has occurred through factor augmen-

tation at unequal rates. Statistically significant labor—using and material—

E.aving biases are found. There also appears to have been a small energy—

saving bias, but it is not statistically significant.

              INTERFUEL SU3STITUTION IN TWO—DI(1T lNDtJSTRI±S


                               I. Introduction


     Considerable shifts have occurred in the composition of the manufacturing

sectorts energy consumption in recent years. In 1971 electric energy comprised

15.3% of total purchases of the four major types of energy, fuel oil 14.0%,

natural gas 58.2, and coal 12.5%. The shares in 1958 were electric energy 11.9%,

fuel oil 13.5%, natural gas 44.8%, and coal 29.8%. This chapter examines the

extent to which shifts in the composition of energy consumption in manufacturing

can be explained by changes in relative energy prices.

     The characteristics of energy demand can be expected to vary across individu-

al industries. Table 1 provides data on energy consumption by each two—digit

manufacturing industry in 1971. Industry shares in total manufacturing energy

consumption range from 21.2% for industry 28, chemicals and allied products, to

0.1% for industry 21, tobacco manufacturers. Differences in energy consumption

across industries are due both to differences in total output and to differences

in the energy intensiveness of production. Energy cost as a percent of value

added is also shown in Table 1. By this measure, energy intensiveness varied

from 11.3% for industry 29, petroleum and coal products, to 0.8% for industry 21.

     The apparent differences in energy consumption across industries indicate

that the inter—relationships between the demands for each type of energy should

be examined on an industry—by—industry basis. Previous studies of industrial

energy demand have generally considered the demand for only one type of energy,

usually electric energy,1 or have provided results only for total manufacturing

rather than for individual industries.2 In this chapter, complete systems of

energy demand equations are estimated for each two—digit industry. Duality

theory is used to derive the systems of demand equations from flexible cost func—

dons which impose minimal a priori restrictions on the estimated elasticities

of demand.

     Estimates of all own   and   cross price elasticities of demand are presented for

each two—digit industry. The results show wide variatlun across industries in the

characteristics of energy demand. Aggregate elasticities of demand are also calcu-

lated and indicate that total manufacturing demand for energy is highly price

responsive.


                                     II. The Model

     A twice differentiable aggregate production function is assumed to exist at

the state level for each two—digit industry,

           Y = F(E, 0, G, C, X)
                                                                             (1)

where Y is total output, E is electric energy, 0 is fuel oil, C is natural gas,

C is coal, and X is a vector of all other inputs. Assuming that the production

function is homothetically weakly separable in the energy inputs, it can be

written,

           Y = C[H(E, 0, G, C), Xl

where H is an energy input function.

     Dual to the energy input function is an energy cost function,

              =   J(Z, E'   C' 'C
where W is total cost of energy, Z is aggregate energy input, and P, P0

    and     are the prices of electric energy, fuel oil, natural gas and coal

respectively. If the energy input function is a positive, nondecreasing,

positively linear homogeneous, concave function, then the energy cost function

can be written

           U =
                  ZV(P,     G'                                               (2)


where V is a unit cost function satisfying the same regularity conditions,

Diewert [1973].
                                               —3—


      Demand functions can be obtained from the unit cost function using Shepard's

lemma,


          X. = Z                        i =   E,   0, C, C,
                     i


where X is the cost minimizing quantity of energy input i, Dlewert [1973]. Thus

the characteristics of industrial demand for energy can be examined by specifying

an appropriate functional form for the unit cost function and differentiating it

to obtain demand functions.

     A convenient functional form for the cost function is the transcendental

logarithmic (translog)

          mV =       +          + a0lnP0 + Gh1PG + clnP + 1/2YEE(1nPE)2


                 + E0 E''0 +                         + EC1'E'C + 1/2y00(lnP0)2

                 + 0C1"1'0'G + YocltlpOlnI,C + 1/21GG(1nPG)2 +
                                                                      YGC1nPG1nPC


                 + 1/2ycc(lnPc)2.                                                       (3)


The translog form provides a second order approximation to an arbitrary twice

continuously differentiable unit Cost function. The translog unit cost function

does not satisfy the regularity conditions globally unless all               =   0,   i.e. unless

it collapses into a Cobb—Douglas form. However, the estimated cost function can

be tested to determine if the regularity conditions are satisfied in the relevant

region.

     Demand functions are obtained by logarithmic differentiation of the unit

cost function,


                 =          =       +         lnP.       i,j = E. 0, C, C.              (4)

By Shepard's lemma,                =
                       3V/aP           X/Z.     Since the cost function Is linear homogeneous
in prices, W =
                   ZP1X by Euler's theorem. Therefore, V                 EPX1/Z.

where M is the cost share for input 1. Thus demand functions
                                                             for energy inputs

can be estimated even though aggregate energy input, Z, is not observed.

where the additive disturbance terms, u1, are included to reflect random errors in

tion, the parameters must satisfy the following adding—up

                                              —5—



Thus only fifteen of the twenty parameters are free and parameter estimates for

all four share equations can be derived from the parameter estimates for any

three.

     Derivation of the share equations, from the cost function, (3), implies the

following cross—equation equality restrictions on the

                         GC

The cross—equation equality restrictions reduce the number of free parameters

to nine. Imposition of these restrictions requires that the equations be estimated

simultaneously. Since the cost shares necessarily sum to unity, the sum of the

disturbances across the four equations is zero at each observation and the dis-

turbance covariance matrix is singular. Therefore, one equation must be omitted

from the system.

     The choice of the equation to be omitted is arbitrary. We drop the disturb-

ance term from the equation for Mc and omit this equation from the system.

Because                and       do not appear in the remaining three equations, an

alternative set of cross—equation equality constraints is required for these

parameters. Substituting in (7.c), (7.e) and (7.f) from (6),

iterative Zelirter efficient procedure, which is equivalent to maximum likelihood

estimation.6 Thus the parameter estimates are invariant to the choice of

equation to be omitted from the system.

    The equations are estimated with cross—section state data for 1971, 1962, and

1958. The system of cost share equations derived from the four input energy

cost function cannot be estimated for all two—digit industries because data on

coal consumption are not available for a sufficient number of states f or some

Industries. Restricting the iaodel to electricity, fuel oil and natural gas is

appropriate If the production function is weakly separable in these three inputs.

The separability of these inputs from coal is tested statistically for those

industries for which the four input model Is estimated.

      Weak separability of the (homogeneous) energy input function In E, 0, and G

implies weak separability of the unit cost function in E' 0' and         However,

the translog approximation of a weakly separable cost function is not necessarily

weakly separable. The conditions on the translog unit cost function correspond-

ing to weak separability of the true unit cost function in E' P0, and      from

   are

Explicit separability of the translog function itself requires the further

restrIction, 0 =       0,       in (8)..

      As noted above, the unrestricted translog unit cost function does not satisfy

the regularity conditions globally. Imposition of the equality restrictions on

the       together with the adding—up restrictions ensures that the unit cost

function is linear homogeneous in the input prices. However, the fitted unit

cost function may or may not satisfy the conditIons that it be non—decreasing

and concave.

      The fitted unit cost function is non—decreasing In the input prices if the

fitted shares are non—negative, since

                                 P1
                                            =E,O,G,C
                      i

and P and V are always positive. Concavity of the unit cost function requires

that the Hessian matrix be negative semidefinite for each observation. This

will be true if the first n — 1 ordered principal minors alternate in sign. The

th order principal minor will be zero due to the imposition of linear

homogeneity in input prices. Concavity is checked for each observation by
                                                —8—


 calculating the values of the         principal   minors. Since it is not determined if

 the principal minors are statistically significant, this procedure does not

 constitute a statistical test of concavity.

     An appropriate measure of goodness of fit of the estimated equations is the

 "pseudo—R2', which states the proportion of generalized variance in the system of

 equations explained by variation in the right—hand variables.8 The pseudo—R2

 is calculated as 1 —                     where 1r1J is the determinant of the estimated
                           1r11/1r21

 right—hand variables are constrained to .equal zero. The value of the pseudo—R2

 is invariant to the choice of equation to beomitted from the•system.

     Estimates of the own and cross—price elasticities of demand are calculated

 from the estimated cost share equations. The own—price elasticity of demand for

 energy Input i is defined as

                   ax P

Applying Shepard's lemma to obtain expressions for             X and            in terms of

derivatives of the unit cost function, the own—price elasticity can be rewritten,


                   P1 .
                          7/aP2           M2 —        +

 Similarly, the cross—price elasticity of demand for Input i with
                                                                  respect to
the price of input J is,

           i   =   —i      —i-   =
                                     P2v/p

     Because the elasticities of demand are functions of the cost shares,
                                                                          they
will vary across the sample. Rather than report the estimated
                                                               elasticities for
                                             —9—


    each observation, the elasticities are evaluated at the means of the data and

    only these values are reported here.9 The data are scaled so that the means of

    the prices are equal to unity. Therefore the estimated          k = E, 0, G, C, are

    equal to the fitted cost shares at the means and the formulas for the elasticities

    at the means are given by (9) and (10) with Mk replaced by ak.

         Since the elasticities at the means are functions only of the estimated

    parameters, the calculation of their estimated standard errors is considerably

    simplified. A first order Taylor series approximationto the variance of the

    estimated elasticities can be computed as


              SB V (B) SB


    where S Is the column vector of first partial derivatives of the elasticities

    with respect to the parameters ctk and         and V(B) is the estimated variance—

    covariance matrix of the parameter estimates)0



                                III. Empirical Results

        The systems of cost share equations are estimated with Census of Manufactures

    data for 1971, 1962, and 1958. The Census provides data on the quantity consumed

    and total cost for each type of energy.11 The price of each type of energy is
                                                         1,
    calculated by dividing cost by quantity consumed.

        The model including electric energy, fuel oil, natural gas and coal is

    estimated for nine industries in 1971, eleven in 1962, and eight in 1958. The

    industries for which the four input model could be estimated tended to be the

    major energy users. For examp1e,th1 group of industries accounted for 67.7%

    of consumption of total energy and 93.0 of coal consumption in manufacturing In

    1971. The model excluding coal is estimated for ten industries in 1971, four in

    1962, and four in 1958. There are too few observations to obtain results for the
)

    remaining two—digit industries in each year.

          Derivation of the cost share equations from the unit cost function implies

     cross—equation equality restrictions on the y, see (7) above. In order to test

    whether or not the loss of fit from imposing the equality restrictions is signif i—

     cant, the equations are estimated with and without the restrictions imposed. The

    results are compared by computing — 2 log A, where A is the ratio of the maximum

    value of the likelihood function for the restricted equations to the maximum value

    of the likelihood function for the unrestricted equations. Under the null hypothe-

    sis this test statistic is distributed asymptotically as chi—squared with degrees

    of freedom equal to the number of restrictions being tested.

          Test results are shown in Table 2. Because these restrictions are directly

    implied by derivation of the cost share equations from the cost function, a very


    small significance level, .001, is used for the tests. The cross—equation

    equality restrictions are rejected for three industries in 1971, three in 1962,

    and none in 1958.

          Tests of the separability of electric energy, fuel oil, and natural gas from

    coal --'crc performed for tose industries for which the four input nodel could be

    astFiated. In every case, both separability and explicit separability were

    accepted at the .01 level in all years.

•
          Monotorticity of the unit cost function is checked by determining if the fitted

    values of the Cost   shares   are positive. Jf the 942 fitted cost shares in 1971,

    938 are positive. Similarly, 703 of 713 are positive in 1962 and 579 of 584 are

    positive in 1958. ince i i not determined whether or not the negative fitted

    Cost shares are significantly different from zero, this check does not provide a

    statistical test. iowever, a statistical test is available at the ieans of the

    data wuere the fitted cost shares are equal to the estimated ce.. TYith the

    exception of      for industry 26 in 1958, which is positive but insignificant,
    all     are significantly positive in all years. Therefore, monotonicity
                                     —11


is accepted at the means of tie data.13

   Concavity of the unit cost function is checked by examining the signs of the

principal minors at eacti observation. The number of observations with principal

minors of the incorrect sign are shown in Table 3. Although it is not determined

if the principal minors with incorrect signs are statistically significant, the

existence of incorrect signs for more than a few percent of the observations is

considered to cast doubt on the satisfaction of the concavity condition.

    The performance of the model is questionable with respect to either the

regularity conditions or cross-equation equality restrictions for nine industries

in 1971, four in 1962, and two in 1958. however, the node1 performs very well

for the reraining industries in each year. The industries for which the model

performs well account for most of the industrial consumption of energy in each

year. For example, the group of industries for which the model performed well

accounted for 81.6% of total energy consumption in manufacturing in 1971.     The

share of this group in the consumption of each type of energy in 1971 was 76.1%

for electric energy, 78.0% for fuel oil, 85.7 for natural gas and 87.6% for

coal. For brevity, further results are given only for the industries for which

the model performs well.14

    Parameter estimates and asymptotic standard errors are shown in Tables 4,5,

and 6, together with the value of the pseudo—R2 for each system of equations.

Results shown are for the initial regressions, there was no sequential estimation.

    The estiriates of the    parameters are equal to the fitted cost shares at

the means of the data. Since the cost shares are equal to the elasticity of the

unit cost of energy with respect to the price of each type of energy, lnV/lnP

the estimates of ct. show the responsiveness of the price of aggregate energy to

the prices of each type of energy at the means of tLe data. As shown in Tables

4-6, cianges in the price of electric energy have the greatest effect on the price

of aggregate energy.

     The estimates of the y. parameters can be interpreted as estimated share

elasticities. The cost siare of input i is equal to alnV/alnP1. The cross

partial derivative

                              2lnV        —
                             alnPalnP         Iii
can be defined as a constant share elasticity summarizing the response of cost

as



                             3lnP LI
In the latter case, the estimated share elasticities at the means of the data will

be equal to the estimates of

     Estimates of the price elasticities of demand at the means of the data are

shown in Tables 7, 8 and 9 tgether with their approximate standard errors.

Because the elasticities are derived from unit cost functions for energy, they

show the price responsiveness of demand for individual types of energy holding

total energy input constant.

     Estimates of the own price elasticities are shoczn in the first four rows of

the table. All   the   own   price   elasticities have the correct sign in. all years.

For 1971, 29 of the 37 estimates are significant at the five percent level using a

one—tailed test. For l962 36 of 40 are significant and for 1958 31 of 35 are

signifIcant. There is considerable variation across industries in the estimated

own price elasticities. For example, in 1971 the range is —.124 to —1.096 for

electric energy, —1.151 to —4.300 for fuel oil, —.425 to —2.134 for natural gas

and —.656 to —2.531 for coal.

     The estimates of the cross price elasticities also show considerable variation

across industries. The relationship between different types of energy appears to
                                        —13—


be predominantly that of substitutes rather than complements.     In 1971, only 18

of the 102 estimates are negative, and only two of the negative estimates are

statistically significant at the ten percent level, using a two—tailed test. In

1962, 16 of 108 cross elasticities are negative, of which two    are   significant.

                                                               and none of the
In 1958, 6 of 90 estimated cross elasticities are negatives

negative estimates are statistically significant.

    As would be expected, the estimates of the cross price elasticities tend to

be smaller in absolute magnitude than the estimates of own price elasticities.15

However, the results do indicate significant cross price responsiveness of energy

demand. For example, of the 84 positive estimates of cross price elasticities

in 1971, 54 are significant at the ten percent level.

    Aggregate price elasticities for the group of industries for which the model

performed well in each year are estimated by constructing weighted averages for

individual industries. The weights are each industry's share of total group
                                            16
consuiption for the relevant type of energy.       Since the model performs well for

industries accounting for most of energy consumption in manufacturing in each

year, the group elasticities provide reasonable approximations to the aggregate

elasticities for total manufacturing.

    The weighted average elasticities are shown in Table 10.     Uith the exception

                                    elasticities are quite consistent in each of te
of oil, the estimated own   price
 three years. The oil own   price   elasticity is much larger in absolute magnitude in

 1971 than in the earlier years. The cross price elasticities of demand for oil

with respect to the prIces of other types of energy are also considerably larger

 in 1971 than in earlier years.

     Changes in estimated elasticities over time may be due either to changes

 in the cost shares or changes in the estimated parameters of the unit cost

 function due to technological change. To test for the consistency of the
                                           —14—

parameters of the cost function over tine, the data for 1971 and 1962 were

pooled and F tests were perforried for hotiogeneity of the estImated paraineters)7

The test statistic is

                     (Rss — (RSS1 ÷ RSS2))/k

                         (RSS1 + RSS2)/n—2k
where

       RSS     = The residual sum of squares of the joint regression,

       RSS1 = The residual sum of squares of the 1962 regression when run
                   separately,

       RSS The residual sum of squares of the 1971 regression when run
                   separately,

       TI      = Total   number of observations in pooled set,

       k       = Number of parameters estimated.

The test statistic is distributed as F with (k, n—2k) degrees of freedom.

       It was possible to compute the test statistic for 13 of the   industries   for

which the model performed well in 1971 and 1962. Test results are shown in Table

12. The null hypothesis of no change in the estimated parameters between the two

years is rejected at the .01 level for 8 of the industries. Thus differences in

the estimated elasticities of demand appear to reflect changes over time in the

parameters of .the cost function as well as changes in the shares of each type

of energy. Chapter 4 presents further results on technical change in energy use

in manufacturing.

       As noted above, price elasticities estimated with a unit cost function for

energy show the extent of price responsiveness holding aggregate energy input

constant. This is clearly not equal to the total price responsiveness since a

change in the price of a type of energy will affect the price of aggregate energy

and   thus   will affect total energy input. Treating aggregate energy input as

variable, the effect of a change in the price of energy input j on the quantity

of energy input i is

estimates of the elasticities of demand for each type of energy allowing total

energy input to vary. The weighted average elasticities for the group of

industries are shown in Table

        Allowing aggregate energy to vary increases the absolute magnitudes of the

own price elastIcities and decreases the cross price elasticities. Elasticities

involving the price of electric energy are affected the most, since the price

of electric energy has the greatest effect on the                 price   of aggregate energy

input. The own price elasticity for electric energy in 1971 increases in abso-

lute magiiitude to —0.92, which            is   comparable to estimates obtained in previous
           20
studies.

     Estimates of Allen partial elasticities of substitution can be calculated

from the estimated price elasticities and cost shares. The cross elasticity of
                                    21
substitution is equal to

price elasticities where the normalization Is chosen such that the elasticities

are invariant to the ordering of the factors. Accordingly,

                                    IV. Concluding Comments

     Estimation of demand functions derived from translog unit cost functions

provides estimates of elasticities of demand and substitution that are subject

to minimal apiori restrictions.22 Disaggregation of the analysis to the two—

digit industry level allows for variation across industries in the characteristics

of demand for each type of energy.

     The model performs well for industries accounting for most of the total

consumption of energy in manufacturing in each year. The results indicate con—

slierable variation in energy substitution both across industries and across

types of energy. This variation should be taken into account in the formulation

of energy policies. Aggregate manufacturing demand for energy appears to be

highly price responsive. Estimated own price elasticities for all types of

energy except electric energy are generally substantially greater than unity.

     Two points should be noted with respect to the interpretation of the

estimated elasticities for analysis of public policies toward energy. First, the

estimates reflect the long—run effects of prices on energy demand. Short—run
                                     —17—


effects can be expected to be considerably smaller. Second, the elasticities

do not measure the net effects of price changes on consumption of fuel oil,

natural gas, and coal. Because these fuels are inputs in the production of

electric energy, the net effects of price changes will include changes in the

demand for fuels In electric power generation.23

                           I.   Introduction


    As discussed in Chapter 2, elasticitIes of demand for individual types of

energy are estimated using a unit cost function for energy. The use of a unit

cost function for energy is based on the assumption that energy inputs are

separable from all Other inputs in thproduction function. The separability

of energy inputs from capital and labor can be tested for 1958 by estimating

an expanded cost.function inclcrding these inputs. Unavailability of adequae

data on capital prevnts the expanded cost function fr-am being estimated for

other yeat.

     Estimation of the cost function including capital and labor also provide

estimates of the elasticities of demand for these inputs as well as their

cross elasticities with energy inputs. The cross elasticities have con-

siderable interest for policy analysis. For example, the cross elasticities

of demand for energy inputs with respect to the price of capital will indicate

the effect of investment incentives on demand for each type of energy. Also,

since labor input is disagregated into production and non—production workers,

the estimated cross elasticities will Indicate whether changes in energy

prices have differential effects on employment of different types of labor)

     Research on this portIon of the study is still in progress. Model

formulation and data collection are complete but estimation is not. Therefore

the results reported here are preliminary only. Final results will appear

in a University of Washington Ph.D. dissertatiort by Jay Ford.

      It is assumed that there exists by state and two—digit manufacturing

industry a positive, homogeneous of degree one, concave production function

y =   (K,B,W,E,O,G,X), where y is gross output, K represents capital services,
B and W are the services of production and non—production employees, E, 0, and

G are electric energy, fuel oil, and natural gas, and X is a vector of re—

malning inputs. If, in addition, capital, labor, and the energy inputs are

separable from X, then it is appropriate to express the production function

in the form y =             g(h(K,B,W,E,O,G),X), and h will have the same propertiesas f.

      Restrictions on the translog function ensure that the cost function is

homogeneous of degree one and the associated demand functions are homgencous

of degree zero. These restrictions are:

Because the cost shares must sum to unity any one of the above equations will

be a linear combination of the others and may be dropped from the estimation

process. The system of five share equations Is estimated with an iterative

Zeliner efficient procedure, which is equivalent to maximum likelihood estima-

tion. Thus the parameter estimates are invariant to the choice of equation to

be omitted from the system.

     It is natural to think of the conditions necessary for the separability

of functions in terms of marginal rates of substitution, however equivalent

restrictions can be stated via the equality of certain of the Allen partial

elasticities of substItution. In this case the energy inputs are weakly

separable from labor and capital If the following equalitIes hold

       ESF., =          =
                 ESOK       ESGK

       ESEB = ESOB = ESGB

Expressing ES in terms of the parameters of the share equations, the first of

the conditions in (4) is

Thus the substitution of OKcLI for each of these y's assures the equality of

the ESiK, i=E,O,G. In a similar fashion the full set of restrictions of the

y's necessary for the separability of electricity and fuels from labor and

capital can be worked out. These are:

The conditions in (5) are substituted into the factor share equations (3) in

order to incorporate the type of separability which is being investigated.

       The statistical procedure for testing the hypothesis of separability of

energy inputs is based on the ratio of the values of the likelihood functions

of the restricted and unrestricted sets of equations. Minus twice the

logarithm of this ratio has asymptotically a chi—square distribution with

degrees of freedom equal to the reduction in the number of estimated parameters

in going from the unrestricted to the restricted set of factor share equations.

If the hypothesis of weak separability is not rejected, the restriction that

   =   0, i=K,B,W, may be imposed in order to test for explicit separability of
the translog cost function.




               III. Data Sources and the Construction of Variables

       The Census of Manufactures, 1958 was                     distinguished   by the publication of

various data relating to the cost of oming and maintaining capital equipment

and    structures.       This informatIon is reported at infrequent intervals and the

1958 census is the most recent, although much less detailed data collected in
                                              —5—


1963 became available in 1971. These data, along with information from which

may be inferred the prices of production and non—production workers and energy

inputs, are sufficient to estimate the translog cost functions outlined in

the previous section.

        With respect to the energy inputs the calculation of prices is a simple

matter of dividing the reported expenditures on electricity, oil, and gas by

the quantity at each observation. These prices are then transforzed into cents

per kilowatt—hour equivalent. The price of capital services cannot be

developed in this straight—forward manner, however, because the transaction

normally takes place within the firm. Hence we have adopted with some modifi-

cation the procedure used by Christensen and Jorgenson [1969], inferring the

rental price of capital from the price of investment goods, the rate of return

on corporate pronerty, and the rates of taxation, depreciation, and capital

gains.

        The rental price of capital to industry i in state j is calculated as

follows:
                    1 —
                          uz1
          P =   [
                    1 -
                                I (q_1r   +   qw — (—_1)] +
                          Ujj
where q is the asset price of capital, u is the effective rate of combined

Federal and state corporate income taxes, Z is the present value of deprecia-

tion deductions for tax purposes on a one dollar investment in producers'

durables, w is the rate of depreciation, and d is the effective property tax

rate.

        As is indicated by the absence of state and industry subscripts on q and

r, it is assumed that a single market exists for new investment goods and

capital so that then prices are equalized across states and industries. The

remaining elements of the rental price of capital are constructed in the

following manner:
                                           —6—


                the sum o    the cffocttv Federal   corporate profits tax by industry

                and the state corporate profits tax    by   state,

                                          where r is the discount rate and L1
     Z1 = L           (1 —
                              (T_)Lij],
                is an estimate of the lifetimes of depreciable assets used for tax

                purposes,
            =   annual depreciation charges in 1957 divIded by the gross book value
    Wjj
                of depreciable assets as of December 31, 19579 and

     d11 =      property    taxes paid during 1957 divided by the gross book value of

                depreciable assets as of December 31, 1957.

This procedure amounts to the calculation of the annual user cost of one

dollar's worth of capital equipment.

     The available 1958 employment data by state and two—digit industry con-

sist of total payroll and number of employees and for production workers, the

number of workers, man—hours, and total wages. The price of production workers

services is total wages divided by man—hours. The price for non—production

workers is based on the residual payroll and number of employees and the

assumption      that white—collar workers are employad for forty hours per week.
The wage rate for both production and non—production workers is augmented to
reflect   the reported cost of supplementary employee benefits.

    These prices will be adjusted to account for interstate differentIals in

the quality of the labor force. The following labor quality indices, used in

Griliches [1967] have been provided by Zvi Griliches:

       1. occupational mix of employees by state and industry,

       2. median age of employed males,

       3.       whIte as fraction of total employed males, and
       4.       females as a fraction of all employees.
                                  —7—


     These quality—of—the—labor force variables are intended to serve as

proxies for education and training so that nominal wage differentials across

states and industries are converted into wage differentials in efficiency units



                        IV. Empirical Results

     A sufficient number of observations Is available for the estirtation of

the system of cost share equations for eight of the twenty—two digit manufact

ing industries. Results available to date are for data that has twt been

adjusted to account for interstate differentials in the quality of the labor

force.

     Results of the tests of separability of the energy inputs from capital anc

labor are shown in Table 1. The null hypothesis of weak separability of energy

inputs is not rejected for industries 20, 28, 33, and 34, food and kindred

products, chemicals and allied products, primary metal industries, and fabri-

cated metal products, respectively. For these industries,.whlth account for sor

two—thirds of energy consumption by the group of eight industries, the use of

unit cost function for energy is appropriate. However, the rejection of

separability for the remaining four industries indicates that the inter fuel

substitution results obtained under the assumption of separability have to be

interpreted with caution.

     Estimated own price elasticities for capital and the two types of labor

as well as the cross elasticities of these inputs with the energy inputs are

shown in Table 2. AU own price elasticities for capital are significant

at the five percent level using a one—tailed test. Five of the own price

elasticities for blue collar workers and two of the own elasticities for white

collar workers are signicant at this level.
                                 —8—


     The estimated cross price elasticities are generally not statistically

significant,2 but the pattern of results is suggestive. Previous studies

have Indicated that capital and aggregate energy are complements.3 However,

only nine of the twenty—four cross—elasticities between capital and individual

energy inputs are negative. Evidence of complentarity is somewhat greater

for non—production workers and energy inputs, with eleven negative cross—

elasticities, and is least for production workers, with only five negative

cross—elasticities.

                          DYNA'iIC STRUCTURE OF ENERGY DET'IAND


                                   I.    Introduction


     Energy demand   in   manufacturing should not be expected to respond instantan-

eously to changes in energy price. Due to adjustment costs for energy, and other

inputs, the full response of energy demand to a change in price may be spread

over a number of years. however, previous studies have largely ignored the

dynamic structure of energy demand.

     In this cnapter the model of demand for factors of production developed by

Nadiri and Rosen [1969, 19731     is    adapted to estimate dynamic demand equations for

energy and other inputs. The results include estimates of short—run, long—run

and intermediate—run price elasticities of demand. The results also include

estimates of the response of demand for each Input to temporary excess demands for

other inputs. Pairs of inputs are defined as dynamic substitutes if the response

of each to excess demand for the other is positive and dynamic cotp1ements if

the response is negative.

     All estimated short—run elasticities of demand for energy arc statistically

significant. Estimated long—run elasticities are similar to estimates in earlier

studies. The responses to price changes are found to be quite rapid, with the

full long—run responses being approximately realized,ithin three years after the

year in which a price change occurs.

     The estimated long—run price elasticities indicate that capital and energy

are complements and labor and energy are substitutes in the long run. The

estimated responses of demand to excess demands for other inputs indicate that

capital and energy are also dynamic complements and labor and energy are dynamic

substitutes.

          L =      labor   stock,

          H =      utilization      rate of labor.

        Stocks and utilization rates of capital and labor are entered separately

since they are separate objects of choice by the firm. Energy input is measured

as a flow. The firm may hold stocks of some types of energy, but most energy is

obtained directly from outside the firm. Therefore, it is not meaningful to

break down energy input into stock and utilization rate coriponents.

      The firm is assumed to minimize costs subject to an output constraint. The

firm's costs are

               =
          C
                   PE + PKK + P(LH) +        PLL

utilization rate of capital, U, does not appear explicitly in the cost equation
but   appears implicitly through the effect of U on the depreciation rate and

hence on P, P =

where p =      +c+       c. The long—run demand equations have several interesting

characteristics. First, the level of output has no effect on utilization rates in

the long—rui. Second, long—run utilization rates are independent of all cross—

price effects except with respect to the price of the corresponding stock

variable. Third, the prices of the utilization inputs, P and H' affect the

demand for energy    positively.
        The long—run demand equations can be written In matrix notation as

           X*=k+BQ+CR                                                              (3)


where all variables are in logarithmic form, X* is a vector of optimal input

demands, k is a vector of intercept terms, B is a vector of scale effects, Q             is
output, C is a matrix of factor price effects, and R is a vector of factor prices.

Since the demand equations are log—linear, theelementsof matrix C are equal to

long—run price elasticities.

        The firm will not be in long—run equilibrium at every point in time due to

costs in adjusting inputs to their desired levels. A log—linear adjustment

function is assumed

                             =   E
                                 j   yjj(2nXj*
                                                  —
                                                      inXi) +                      (4)

where X is the quantity of input X
                                 i in period t, X. is the esred or target
       it

level of input j in period t and is defined by (3), the             are fixed adjustment

coefficients, and the           are random variables with zero means and constant

variances. The specification of the adjustment function allois the adjustment

of each input to be affected by the level of "excess demand" for all inputs.

     Writing (4) in matrix notation,
           =
               rx*   + (I —
                              r)x_1 + c
where all variables are in logarithmic form, X is a vector of input quantities
in period t, r is a matrix of adjustment coefficients, X* is a vector of desired

input quantities in period t, I is an identity matrix, and           is a vector of error

terms. The equations to be estimated are derived by substituting for             in

(5) from (3),

           =    rA + 1'BQ   + rcR + (I —
                                           r)X1 +     .                         (6)

     The diagonal elements of r are own adjustment coefficients and should satisfy

the restriction, 0               1, for all 1.. The more variable the factor, the close:

to unity will be the own adjustment coefficient. The off diagonal elements,

indicate the effect on input i of excess demand for input j. The             can be

either positive or negative. Assuming that the firm remains on its production

function at all times, not all elements in any row of r can be of the same sign.

Inputs must react positively to excess demand for some inputs and negatively to

excess demand for others.1

     The cross—adjustment coefficients need not be symmetric. Pairs of inputs

with identically signed cross—adjustment coefficients can be identified as dynamic

substitutes or dynamic complements. If              is positive, excess demand for input

j increases the short—run demand for input i. Pairs of inputs for which cross—

adjustment coefficients are positive are defined to be dynamic substitutes. If

the cross—adjustment coefficients are negative, the inputs are dynamic complemen

Due to short—run adjustment costs, inputs may be dynamic complements even though

they are substitutes in the long run.
                                                —5—


       Because the input demand equations are log—linear, the elements of the matrix

product rc are equal to the short—run price elasticities of demand. From (3),

the long—run price elasticities are equal to the elements of matrix C. Given

estimates of (1 ) and rc, the estimated long—run price elasticities are computed
from [I -     (I   -   r))rc.
       The estimated response path of input demand to prices can be computed from

Ti =   (I   _r)krc, see tadiri and Rosen (1973, P. 75]. Computation of

            r + r ÷. . . .+ r              =   o,   i.
             0   1
provides a matrix of estimated price elasticities showing the extent to which

demand responds during a length of time n+l periods long. Thus in addition to

short—run and long—run price elasticities, the results provide estimates of all

intermediate—run elasticities.

       Dynamic stability of the system of demand equations requires that (I —

approaches zero as n gets large. Note that (I — T) = M'AM where           is a matrix

of characteristic vectors of (I — 1") and A is a diagonal matrix of characteristic

roots. Thus (I — T)t1 =         NAM,   which approaches zero if the absolute value of

each element of A is less than unity. Therefore dynamic stability can be checked

by determining if the absolute values of the characteristic roots of (I — T) are

less than unity. however, this procedure does not provide a statistical test of

stability because the sampling distributions of the characteristic roots are

unknown.




                                  III. Empirical Results

       The equations are estimated with annual data for total manufacturing for

1947—1971. Data availability requIres some modifications in the system of equa-

tions to be estimated. The prices of labor stock and of capital utilization are

omitted due to lack of data. Because data on the utilization rate of capital are
                                         —6—



not   available, the utilization rate of capacity is used as a proxy for this

variable. The distinction is important, since the capacity utilization rate

reflects the utilization of all inputs, not just capital. Capacity utilization

data are from Wharton [1976].

      The relevant output variable is the equilibrium level of output perceived

by the firm. As measures of this variable, shipments and shipments plus changes

in inventories are included in alternative specifications of the demand equations.

Data on shipments and inventories are from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1976]. The

output variables are deflated by the wholesale price index for manufactured goods

from U.S. Department of Labor [197Gb].

      Data on capital stock, rental price of capital, energy input, and energy

price are from Berndt and wood [1975]. Data on labor stock and the utilization

rate of labor are from U.S. Department of Labor (1976a]. The stock of labor is

equal to the total number of employees in manufacturing. Average weekly hours

of production workers is used as the labor utilization variable. Data on the

price of labor utilization, defined as the quality adjusted wage rate, are from

Berndt and Wood [1975].

      In order to impose homogeneity of degree zero in prices, the demand equations

are expressed in terms of price ratios. The equations estimated are then

         LnX = ai + binQ +      ciiZn()   + c21n() +    g1nE    1
                                                                    +

               +
                   g31nU + g49nL 1 + 5nH1 +                  i =   E,K,U,L,FI.

                                                                                 (7)


The error terms,      ,   are assumed to have zero means and constant variances. The

use of ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate (7) will result in biased estimates

if the error terms are serially dependent. In order to test for first—order

serial correlation, the demand equations are estimated by both OLS and a Cochrane—

Orcutt [1949] procedure.
                                                  —7—


             The OLS and Cochrane—Orcutt (CO)    results   ar compared using the F—statistic,

                              SSR   -SSR
                   F(1, n—k-i) SSRn—k—l

    where n is the number of observations, k is the number of coefficients, SSR is the

    ijm -F   qured res1du1        ni   the ubocripts indicate the estimation procedure. This

    test is equivalent to a test of the null hypothesis that the first       order   serial

    correlation coefficient is equal to zero. The null hypothesis Is rejected at the

    .10 level for four of the five      demand equations. Therefore, the results obtained

    using   the Cochrane—Orcutt   procedure are reported here.

               estimated parameters in the equation using shipments plus changes In
             The

    inventories as the measure of output are very similar to those obtained using ship-
    ments. Since the estimated standard errors are somewhat smaller when shipments are

    used, the results here are for this specification. Inclusion of a time variable

    to allow for trends in equilbrIuiu output has little effect on the estimated para—

    ieters but does cause problems of collinearity. Therefore, the results reported

    here are for the equations excluding time.

             Estimated parameters are shown in Table 1 together with their t—statistIcs.

    The short—run elasticities with respect to output are significant at the five

    percent level in all equations except the one for energy. The effect of output on

    inpUt demand is largest for capacity utilization and next largest for labor stock.

    The insignificant effect of output on energy demand indicates that short—run fore-

    casts of energy demand do not depend critically on predicted output.

             The relative price of capital is significant at the five percent level in

    three equations and at the ten percent level in one more. However, the relative

    price of energy is significant only in the energy equation. The coefficients of the

    relative prices of capital and energy are equal to the estirated short—run

)   elasticities    with respect to these prices. The short—run elasticity with respect to
                                            —8—



 the wage rate is equal to the negative of the sum of the capital and energy price

 elasticitie. The elasticity wIth   respect   to the wage rate is significant only iñ

 the energy equation.
       The estimated coefficients of the lagged endogenous variables are equal to

the estimated alements of the matrix (I —   r).   The elements of the matrix r are

shown in Table 2. All own—adjustment coefficients are positive as required. The

own—adjusttent coefficient for labor stock is greater than unity but not signifi—
           2
cantly so.

       The own—adjustment coefficient for labor stock is largest, followed by the

coefficients for average hours and energy. The magnitudes of these own—adjustment

coefficients indicate that the corresponding inputs are truly variable. The own—

adjustment coefficient for capital stock is considerably smaller, as would be

expected. The own—adjustment coefficient for utilization is smallest .of all; mi

apparently incongruous result may be due to the use of capacity utilization rather

than capital utilization for this variable.

       Seven of the twenty cross—adjustment coefficients are significant at the five

percent level. The coefficients of capital stock and average hours worked are both

highly significant in.the energy equation, indicating that excess demand for these

inputs has a significant effect on energy demand. The coefficient of energy is

significant only in the capacity utilization equation.

       The cross—adjustment coefficients need not be symmetric. Where the signs of

the cross—adjustment coefficients for a pair of inputs are identical, it is possible

to identIfy the inputs as dynamic substitutes or dynamic complements. The results

indicate that energy and capital stock are dynamic complements, while capacity

utilization and labor stock are dynamic substitutes for energy. Thus, excess demand

for energy Increases labor stock and capacity utilization and decreases capital

stock. These results provide tentative information on the important policy question

of the effect of temporary energy shortages on demand for other inDuts.

       All three short—run price elasticities for energy are sinificanc at the .025

level. The time path of the price elasticities is shown in Table 3. The elastici-

ties through year zero ar equal to the estimated short—run elasticities. The

estimated short—run own price elasticity is —0.28 and the estimated short—run cross

elasticities with respect to the hourly wage rate and the user cost of capital are

0.34 and —0.10 respectively.

       The last column of Table 3 shows the estimated long—run price elasticities.
                                                                                          *
The results indicate that energy and labor are substitutes and energy and capital

are complements in the long run. The estimated long—run own     price   elasticity is

—0.42 and the estimated long—run cross elasticities ith respect to tl.ie hourly wage

rate and the user cost of capital are 0.57 and —0.15 respectively.

       The estimated intermediate—run elasticities shown in Table 3 indicate quite

rapid response to price changes. The cumulative elasticities through year three

are approximately equal to the long—run elasticities. Two of the     elasticities   are

actually slightly larger in absolute value than the long—run elasticities, indicating

a small degree of over—shooting in the intermediate—run response to price changes.

       Dynamic stability of the system of demand equations is checked by calculating

the characteristic roots of (I —   r).   The characteristic roots for the matrix used

in calculating the elasticities shown in Table 3 are 1.0019      0.0435 i, 0.0425

3.0275 i, and 0.0652. The condition that all characteristic roots be less than unity

is not satisfied. However, the departure from the conditions for stability is small

and its statistical significance cannot be determined. The existence of complex

roots is consistent with the non—monotonic behavior of the intermediate—run

elasticities shown in Table 3.

                              1'J.   Concluding Comments

       The use of a dynamic model of demand for inputs provides ne: information

on the characteristics of energy demand in U.S. manufacturing. The estimated

cross-adjustment coefficients indicate that energy is a dynamic complement of

capital stock and a dynamic substitute for both labor stock and capacity utilization.

Estimated short—run price elasticities of demand for energy are found to be

statistically significant. The response of demand to price changes is quite rapid,

with the full long—run response being approximately realized within three years

after the year in which a price change occurs.

       The estimated long—run price elasticities are similar to those reported in

studies using static demand models. Berndt and Wood's [1975.] study of U.S. manu-

facturing and Fuss' f1977] study of Canadian manufacturing also find that energy

and capital are coruolements and energy and labor are substitutes in the long—run.

The estimated long—run own price elasticity of —0.42 in the present study is

comparable to the value of —0.47 obtained by Berndt and Wood for 1959, the mid—year

of the sample period used here.3

                               TECUNICAL CHANGE IN ENERGY USE

                                           John 1. Wills

                                      I.    Introduction

       Over   time   man's stock of knowledge about potential production processes has

Increased. 1Ten additions to that stock of knowledge are translated into actual

changes in production technique we say that technical change has occurred. It may

be that a technical change is "biased;" that is, it results not only in an increase

in   the amount of output obtainable from a given bundle of inputs, but also alters

the   resource aix which    minimizes the cost of output. It is the purpose of this

chapter    to seek evidence of biased technical changes in eñergy and other inputs
in the    TJ.S.   primarymetals'industry      after World Wai II.

      In the theory of the firm without technical change, the production function

is assumed no to change. The great bulk of econometric work in this area, being

concerned with other issues than technical change, has also followed this path.

But it is the essence of technical change that the production function does change

over time. For empirical work the notion that a production function might simply

change in any unrestricted fashion is too general to be useful. There are, however

a variety of ways in which some amount of "flexibility" can be built into

estimated production functions.

      It is useful, first of all, to require that the functional form and the

parameter values be unchanged over time. Otherwise the estimating problems,
especially with time series data, are overwhelming. Indeed, in the general case

it is impossible to simultaneously estimate both production parameter and

technical change measures from the same data unless additional restrictions are

imposed.

      One such restriction which Is sufficient to identify both the production func-

tion and technical change, but which permits some flexibility, iS      that   technical
                                                  —2—


change occurs at a constant rate (or at least with a constant rate of change) over

the time period. This can be accomplished by entering "time" in the production

function symmetrically as an input, so that the change in output per unit of time,

inputs held constant, is a constant. This is one procedure followed here.

     This can be done in such a fashion as to restrict all technical change to

being a magnification of output possible from given inputs, or it can permit

changes in technique which will imply changes in the input mix for any set of

prices. In the former case technical change is "neutral," in the latter it is

"biased.

     The conventional definition of bias as first proposed by Hicks (19351 in the

context of a two—factor production function. In that case the following three

definitions are equivalent:


                   dL                             d(—        Labor saving
           sign
                  d()   =   sign
                                   dNL =
                                           sign
                                                   L <       neutral
                   dt                              dt
                                                             Labor using


where K and L are capital and labor, respectively, ML is the cost share of labor,

and f(i.K,L) is the marginal product of the 1th factor. All of the above

differentials were to be evaluated at constant factor prices. In the ceneral

n—factor case, however, the first and last of the above versions wIll yield n—i

measures of the bias of technical change. Only version two yields a single

number; on that basis it is the definition used In this chapter.
                                                         1
     One convenient characterization of biased technical change is that it is

factor—augmenting. Technical change is factor—augmenting if the production

function can be written:

              =
                  f(A   X1 ,..., A         X)
                                          —3—


where the t—subscript refers to time. The parameters of the production function

remain unchanged; all technical change can be considered to change the values of

the        the "augmentation coefficients." The X's now measure input quantities in

natural units (e.g., manhours) and the Aixj measure input quantities in "efficiency

units." So technical change has the effect of increasing the effective input

which can be derived from the natural units purchased in the marketplace. This

method can, obviously, be used to permit biased technical change, since the various

augmentation coefficients can change at different rates.

      As discussed below, the hypothesis of factor augmenting technical change is

not rejected by the data. The hypothesis that technical change has been neutral

is rejected lndicat!ng that factors have been augmented at different rates. The

results indicate significant labor—using and material—saving biases. There also

appears to have been a small energy—saving bias, but it is not statistically

significant.



                           II. Econometric Specification

      In Part A below we show how   time—series   data can be used to test for biased

technical change and for factor augmenting biased technical change (agsinst

alternative hypotheses of neutral technical change or no technical change). Esti-

mates of the rates of factor augmentation and of the Hicks factor—use biases are

also derived. In Part B we show how cross—section and time series data can be

used together to test for factor augmentation. Also, two cross—sections on the

same data at different points in time can   provide   additional evideace on technical

change.


A. The Time—Series Model

      Production technology can be represented by a production function:

          Q   = f([X])
                                               —4—


where Q is output and [X] a vector of inputs.1 For simplicity of presentation the

vector [X] is assumed to exhaust the input set. When this is not the •case the

principal problem arising is that of defining the output of a "su—production"

function and insuring that the empirical conditions for Its validity are met.

This is discussed where relevant below.

       If production exhibits factor augmenting technical change the corresponding

production functinn is

          Q   f([AX]).


       In all empirical work we choose to represent the production function by the

translog functional form. Th translog production function (iithout technical

change) can be written

          lnQ =                      +                                        (1)
                  a0 + Ea lnX1            Z y lnX lnX
                        I                ii j

where                  Q is the quantity of output and the Xi's are the quantities of

inputs. Equation (1) can be interpreted as a production function in its own right;

or as a second order Taylor's series approximation to an arbitrary twice differ-

entiable functional form.

        Differentiating with respect to lnX



           1nQ     =        . _! =       +I
                                              y lnX ,
                                                          i1.   .              (2)



Given competitive input markets                 = W.
                                             since each factor will be paid the
                                   i
value of its tnarginal product. If production exhibits constant returns to scale

then


                    =1
                                        —5—


so the left hand side of (2) represents the share of total cost accuring to factor

i, called N1. (It also happens to equal the output elasticity with respect to

factor 1.)

    All we need to know about the production function can be gotten from estimat-

ing the system of share equations (3)

        Mi   c   + Z Y1j 1QX. ÷
                           3      Uj

                     j


where an additive disturbance term has been appended to each equation.         Because

the shares necessarily sum to one, (and         y) any one      of the 11   equations   is a

linear combination of the n — 1 others. This implies the following restrictions

on the parameters:

        Ec =1
        Ii
                                                                                 (4)
        Zy =Zy =0
     Because the equations represent shares in total cost, we should expect the

errors to exhibit joint covariance. Therefore the equations are estimated with

a Zeilner efficient procedure (joint GLS).     The sum of the disturbances across

the share equations is zero at each observation and the disturbance covariance

matrix is singular. Therefore, we eliminate one equation and then solve for the

parameters of that one equation via the restrictions (4). Ordinarily ti-ia Zeilner

estimate is sensitive to the choice of the equation to be omitted, but this

undesirable result is avoided by adopting an iterative Zeliner efficient

procedure.

      Especially in the production function it may be the case that the input

quantities, being chosen by the entrepreneur along with output rates, are In fact

 correlated with the error vector. Under this condition the (iterative) three—

 stage least squares (3SLS) estimator is appropriate, provided we can identify

 the pre—determined variables of the system.

        Generally        it is not possible to use any time series to identify both produc-

tion parameters and technical change. There are several ways to achieve

identification. One way is by using a priori Information obtained perhaps, from

supplementary cross—section data. This is discussed further below, in Part B.

      Here we identify technical change by assuming it occurs at a constant rate,

in the manner        of   Berndt and Wood [1975a]. In

          Q =     f([X], t)
let   t be treated symmetrically as a factor. Then the translog function is:

                     CL0 + EctlnX +                                           E               T
          lnQ
                               i            ii   E
                                                                              :1-
                                                                                    jT lnXi

                 +   1      2
                     TTT
Differentiating with respect to lnX and T we have the system of cost shares plus

an equation for                     , the rate of change of total output when input quantities

are fixed:

              =

Following    Berndt and Wood,                               is measured as an index of "total factor

productivity."            The      computation       of that index Is explained in the Data Appendix.

      A specialization is to treat technical change as factor augmenting. Factor

augmenting    technical            change (at a constant rate) implies that
             =
                   f([AX])
where

 and A is the constant rate of augmentation for factor 1. Thea                  the   production
 function becomes

                =   f((LeA1T ])

Expanding and differentiating we             arrive   at production function share equations and
a   productivity equation identical in form to (5) but with the followin additional

restrictions implied:


           TEa1XI
              i
                                                                                          (7)

Of course, restrictions (4) and (6) still apply.

        Factor augmenting technical change implIes, therefore, testable parametric

restrictions. A logical next step would be to test for neutrality of technical

change. Hicks neutral technical change Implies that                  =        all i, j. Substi—    £
                                                                         X,

and

          TT =

and again we can test for this.

      The least general hypothesis of all is that there has been no technical

change whatsoever; i.e. the A1 =                  0. In this case we are left with the
                                            A1

systems of equations (3).
                                       —8—


     To summarize, the nested hypotheses are:

          non—neutral, non—factor--augmenting technical change

          non—neutral, factor augmenting technical ch.3nge

          neutral factor augmenting technical change

          no technical change

These tests are based on the log of the ratio of likelihood functions. See Theil

[1971].

     The bias of technical change is measured by the iT terms. This is a

constant, independent of prices. Hence the possibility that the bias of technical

change depends upon where along the isoquant it is measured is ruled out in this

estimating procedure.


B.   Cross—Section !odel

     An alternative to assuming constant rates of technical change is to permit

the bias or Factor augmentation coefficients to adopt different values in each

time period. In          f([AX]) the At's are not directly observable. If we

already know the parameters of the production function, we can estimate their

implicit values, but we cannot use any single time series to estimate both the

parameters and the values of the At. In this section we will impose information

from cross—section estimates on time series data to derive non—constant rates of

factor augtnentation.2

     Return to the production function with factor augmenting technical change,

but not now constrained to a constant rate:

          lnQ =     + E n ln(AX1) +        E   y ln(A X) ln(A. Xi

             lnQ     -
                     —     + E

            =        + E
                ct               lnX + E ',' mA1


or, in matrix notation

         [N] =    [a] + r[lnx + mA]

hence

         (mA] =      [N      —
                                 a]    —
                                            [lxix]

so if we know the r and a matrices we can solve for lnA,3 or for changes in mA:

         [dmA] =      F[d]        —       [dlnX].                                   (8)



      The bias is the change in N which occurred as a result of technical change.

Call this dN*. From above

         [dM] =     r[dlnx   + dlnAl

and the effect of technical change is

         [diI*J =    r(dmnA]
and from (8)

         [dM*] =     r(r[dM1          —    (dlxix]   I




         [dM*] = dM — r[dmnx].                                                      (9)

and again, knowing the parameters we can estImate the biases.

      A practical problem is that our estimates of [dmA] are likely to have large

variances, since they are rather complicated functions of the parameter estimates.

Our [dmA] estImates are functions of random variables and hence are random
                                   A
variables themselves. e know that 1' is consistent for T, therefore r               is
                                         —10—


consistent for r.       Therefore   our estimates will at least be consistent. The

biases, being simpler functions, should exhibit smaller standard errors.

     Our parameter estimates are derived from cross—section data where variation

in input use depends only on variation in prices, and not on technical change.

An initial adjustment for labor quality differentials can be made. Then labor

input over time should be measured to account     for   this.

     If non—neutral factor augmenting technical change has occurred over some time

period then production finction estimates which ignore it will appear to be

unstable. For example, suppose the production function

           =   XB + u

is estimated at two separate time periods from cross—section data. If the true

production function is

               (AX) + u

and if the ratio of the Ar's changes over the time period then the B estimates

derived will be biased. This will increase the probability of wrongfully reject-

ing the hypothesis that the parameters are unchanged. If we adjust the observed

quantities of inputs in the later sample by estimated factor augmentation, however,

we should derive parameter estimates closer to those of the initial sample. This

can be tested by a Chow test.

                               III. EmpirIcal Results


     In Part A we use time—series data to estimate rates of factor augmentation and

factor—use   biases and come up with significant estimates of each. We reject

models of neutral technical change in favor of biased technical change; and accept

factor augmentation. In Part B we estimate two cross section models and compare

them. On the basis of this comparison we accept the hypothesis of an unchanged

production structure, both in natural and in efficiency units. In Part C T,Je

compare the time series and   cross   section results. The results of the "modified1'

time series model are similar to those of the full tie series model, and also

similar to the 1963 cross section results. Again        reject neutral technical

change. Data sources are discussed in the Appendix.


A. The Time Series Results

     The specifications of the nested hypotheses to be tested are (in order of

decreasing generaiity):

     1. Biased technical change

     2. Biased factor augmenting technca1 change

     3. Hicks—neutral, technical change

     4. No technical change.

     Table 1 presents the coefficient estimates and summary statistics for

specifications 1—3. The test statistic is equal to minus twice the difference in

the log—likelihood values for the null and alternative hypotheses, and is dis-

tributed     with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions imposed,

see Theil [1971, p. 396].

     Table 2 gives the results of the tests. The null hypothesis of "No technical

change" amounts to deleting an equation from the system and    so   requires a compli-

cated correction of the estimated likelihood function value. But this is also
                                                                                         L.


equivalent   to a simple parametric restriction (aT = 0) ihich we test witu a t—test.
                                      —12—



     The evidence is strongly for accepting factor au'nientation. Factor augmenta-
tion is     relatively weak restriction of non—neutral technical change. It

imposes five independent parameter restrictionc but introduces four new variables;

net the number of restrictions is one. Indeed, the sum of squared residuals

actually falls (slightly) under the restrictions. (This is possible since the

parameter restrictions are non—linear.)

     The estimated rates of factor augmentation are as follows: (t—values in

parentheses)

          LK = —.0005    (   .09)
          LL =   .0194   (7.61)

          LE = —.0014    (   .74)
          LM = —.0041    (2.74)

     These results and tests are all based on the joint GLS estimates of the

production function. To the extent that there is any difference when a 3SLS

procedure is used to account for possible simultaneity, the differences do not

affect the implications for technical change. SInce the joint GLS estimates

generally provided better fit we use these estimates in the tests.

     Two of the augmentation rates are not significantly different from zero,

but labor appears to have been augmented at just less than 2% per year, on

average. 1ateria1s inputs have been negatively augmented at approximately —4/10

of 1% per year. One may conjecture that this is the result of a decline in the

quality of some inputs.

     We strongly reject the hypothesis that technical change is neutral. This

makes the final test of "No technical change" vs. "Neutral technical change" a

bit meaniigless, but it is worth pointing out that it is possible to accept the

hypothesis of "No technical change" if the &ternative is "Neutral technical

change" rather   than "Biased technical change."   What this   means is   that shifts in
                                        —13—


the shape of the isoquants are a relatively more niportat feature of technical

change than are simple "sca1e—contractions of the isoquants toward the origin.

       There is a significant labor—using, material-saving bias, measured by the

iT terms. The share of labor in total cost increased, on average, by just less

than    of   1 percentage point every year, holding prices constant. The cost share

of materials input decreased at approximately the same rate. (As seen in Table

1 these estimates are virtually identical whether or not factor augmentation is

imposed.) There is evidence of a borderline energy—saving trend; but if so, the

trend is weak. The capital bias is not significantly different from zero.

       Imposing factor augmentation does curiously affecc the coefficient of Time

in the TFP equation. This coefficient represents the acceleration" of technical

change; that is, TFP itself represents - and so          =
                                                             -—- .
                                                                 When factor
                                                         T
augmentation is not imposed the rate of acceleration of technical change is

.003, but with a large standard error. When factor augmentation is imposed, the

rate declines to .0031 but the standard error falls dramatically and the latter

estimate is easily significantly different from zero.


Concavity of the production function

       Estimated production functions should display the same characteristics as

theoretical production functions. In particular, they should be monotonically

increasing; that Is, an increase In any input quantity should, ceteris paribus,

increase output. Also, they should display convex isoquants; that is, the

production function should be at least quasi—concave.

       Some functional forms such as Cobb—Douglas automatically impose these

features on estimated production functions. There may be values of the 1ij'

however, for which the translog production function is not concave or not

monotonic. If the    fitted   cost shares are positive the production function is

monotonic and If the bordered Hessian of second partial derivatives of the
                                         —14—


production function is negative definite (principal minors alternate in sign)

then the production function is quasi—concave, which is necessary for convex

isoquants.

     All fitted cost shares were positive, so we conclude that our production

function is iaoaotonic. The last eighteen of the twenty—four years, however,

display a non—concavity in some dimension. That iS, the fitted bordered Hessian

is not negative definite when evaluated at these observations. It is not possible

to derive estimated standard errors for the fitted values of the principal minors,

so we cannot test directly for the significance of this result.

     We can,   however,   impose concavity on the production function at the means

of the data, though not at each observation. Lau (1974] shows the parametric

method for imposing concavity; the restrictions are quite complex.

     Given the complexity of the non—linear parametric restrictions, it is not

too surprising that we experienced some difficulty in estimating the equations

under this constraint. In particular, different starting values converged to

different estimates; often to local maxima which did not satisfy the convergence

criteria of the computer program used. Here we report the estimates that

correspond to the smallest residual sum of squares of all the attempts. These

estimates did satisfy the convergence criteria. They are reported in Table 3

below. The unconstrained estimates are reproduced for convenience in comparison.

     We do not report the standard errors here; these reported      and y estimates

are non—linear functions of the parameters actually directly estimated; which

themselves entered the estimating equations non—linearly. Calculation of standard

errors here involves twIce successively applying a Taylor's approximation, and

it was felt that these numbers would mean little. The constrained estimates,

however, are generally not significantly different from zero although almost all

of the unconstrained estimates are significant.
                                         —15—


       The   constrained   model fits the data much more poorly than the unconstrained

model; we reject concavity on the basis of a likelihood ratio test. Because of

the poor fit it was judged that the tests of the nested hypotheses would be

better carried out with the unconstrained model.

       Despite the fact that the concavity restriction causes significant changes

in the coefficient estimates in general, the implications with respect to techni—

cal change are not too different. Both models indicate a labor—using, material

saving bias of the same order of magnitude; and weiker effects on energy and

capital inputs.

       The issue of concavity of the production function remains open. The data

clearly reject concavity, at least with respect to some input(s). And a pro-

duction function which is not concave implies some bizarre results; i.e., violent

input quantity changes upon small changes in relative input prices. But yet we

achieve good fit and "reasonable" parameter estimates from the unconstrained

model. Since convex isoquants are properties of firms and we are here estimating

an industry production function, there may be a problem of aggregation involved.

Given that the rest of our unconstrained empirical estimates seem reasonably

good, we     leave   the concavity problem unsolved.


B. Cross Section Results

       Because of the unavailability of a cross—section materials price index, the

cross section production models assume that the production function is separable

in these inputs; that is, that the production function

             Q   = Q(K,L,E,N)
can be written

             Q   = Q*(K,L,E) + H(M).

This   is in principle testable, but the same unavailability of data that requires

the assumption forbids the test.
                                          —16—


     Tha two years of crocs sections are 1963 and 195a. They were not generally

similar years; the former was an expansionary year and the latter a moderate

recession. Klein and Summers [1966] measure the annual rate of capacity utili-

zation in the    primary   metals industry in 1963 and 1958 as 30.45% and 68. 75%

respectively. Since the regression model assumes no lag in input adjustment,

we adjusted capital input by multiplying the index by the above capacity

utilization rates for one of the sets of pooled estimates.

     Also, because we construct'our energy quantity input by "translog aggrega—

tion' of electricity, oil, natural gas, and      coal,   we must discard any observa-

tion for which we lack data on a single one of these. This reduces the sample

size to fourteen in 1963 and ten in 1958, but this is clearly a better measure

of energy input than to aggregate by BTU content.

     The mean values for each of the three cost shares for each year are:

                       1963        1958

        NK                 .471    .341

        ML                 .464    .575

        ME                 .063    .084


     In Table 4 we present the coefficient estimates and summary statistics for

each cross section separately. In Table i, we present the results of three sets

of pooled estimates: 1. The simple 1963 and 1958 data, unadjusted for capacity

utilization differences, 2. The same, but with a capital use adjustment, and 3.

The 1958 data pooled with the 1963 data which has been "augmented" by applying

the rates of factor augmentation for capital, labor, and energy derived in

Part A, above.

     Our first test is a test for constancy of the production structure over

the five years. The procedure is a standard Chow test. We consider two
                                        —17—


soeclfications of the   null   hypothesis:

     1. The production function is unchanged in natural input units,

     2. The production function is unchanged in efficiency input units, but is

        changed in terms of natural units.

     The first corresponds to the pooled estimates where all inputs are unadjuste

for technical change, the second to the pooled estimates where the 1963 data

was augmented. For the former we use the results from the estimates made when

the capacity utilization rate adjustment was made, since these were generally

better results, i.e., lower residual sum of squares and more significant para-

meter estimates. The test results are presented in Table 6.

     We acceot the notion that the production structure is unchanged, both in

natural units and in efficiency units. Indeed, augmenting the latter cross

section by the augmentation coefficients derived from the time series model

lowers the explanatory po'7er of the joint regrcssion, though only negligibly.


Deriv1n annual estimates of technical change

     We use the 1963 parameter estimates to derive year—by—year estimates of      the
annual rate of change in the augmentation coefficients of capital, labor, and

energy inputs. This is achieved through the use of formula (8) from Part B

of Section II, where d in A1 =
                                   (A1/A).
     Note that estimating this series requires dcleting one roz and column from

the matrix of estimated         coefficients. Because of sampling variation the

derived series will be sensitive to this choice, so the results presented below

are for simple averages of the series derived Erom each possible set of coeffi-

cient estimates; capital and energy, capital and labor, and labor and energy.

We also estimate the annual hicks factor—use bias in a similar manner, but using

formula (9) of Section II.

     The entire series are not presented here. The derived numbers displayed

considerable variation, though       in   most years the estimated rate of change in any

augmentation coefficient was less than 10%. The estimated average rates of

factor augmentation for the three inputs is presented below.

C.   Time Series and Cross Section Comparison

     To compare time series and cross section regression estimates directly, we

must re—estimate the time series model using the (Capital, Labor, Energy) speci-

fication rather than the full, four—input model. Once we have done this, we

no longer estimate the Total Factor Productivity equation with        the   cost share

equations. We can still enter time into the production function to allow for

technical chanqe, though some information is lost since not all of the parameter

restrictions of the full model can be imposed. Still, our estimators are

consistent.

     Me present the parameter estimates and summary statistics in Table 7 for

two specifications of the times series K, L, E model, with and without technical

change. The estimating equations here are:

     1. without technical cinge:


         I=cL+Ey11 logX +u.                                  iK, L, E
                                          —19—


and

      2. with technical change:

              =    +        log      + iT T + u1             I   X, L, E
                        3


where, as before, the cs and y's are parameters and the X's are input

quantities.

      Here again, as in the complete time series model, we have the annoying

failure of the conditions for convex isoquants at some of the observations. And

again, on the basis of a log—likelihood test, we reject the hypothesis of no

technical change in favor of non—neutral technical change. And the derived

biases are siuiilar to those of the full time series model, being labor using and

energy saving. There is a slight capital saving bias in the modified time series

model that does not exist in the full model.

      The estimated coefficients of this time series model appear roughly compar-

able to those of the 1963 cross section, as can be seen by comparing Table 7

with Table 4. The coefficient estimates are always of the same sign, for example

and of roughly comparable relative magnitudes.

      With respect to technical change we derive roughly the same implications

from both the time series and the cross section data. The         estimated   constant

rates of factor augmentation from the time series are compared to the average

rates from the cross section below:


                            Factor Augmentation Rates

                            Time Series      Cross Section

              Capital        —.0005              —.0024

               Labor              .0194           .0230

               Energy        —.0014              —.0810
                                     —20—


The one difference is the tixe series gives aa insignificantly negative estimate

for the rate of energy augmentation; in the cross section it is negative and

of a much larger magnitude in absolute value.

    Also we compare the average Hicks factor use bias rates beloi:5


                            Hicks Bias Rates

                       Time Series     Cross Section

            Capital      —.0034          — .0049

            Labor          .0044            .0028

            Energy       —.0010          —.0032


Both samples imply the same conclusion: Technical chacige has been labor using

and perhaps slightly capital and energy saving over the time period.

                                  DATA SOURCES



     The data is for the primary metals industry; Standard Industrial Classifi-

cation (SIC) number 33. Included are the manufacturer of pig Iron and iron

products, all types of steel, aluminum, zinc, copper, and various other metals

accounting for a small portion of output.



Part A: Time Series Data

     There are two special problems in construction of the data: 1) Construc-

tion of a total factor productivity (TFP) index, and 2) construction of a series

for capital input and the rental price of capital.

1) The index of total factor productivity is usually a Divisia index of

output less a Divisla index of input. According to Jorgenson and Griliches

(1967],

          TFP = Q/Q - E
                      I
                          w(XX)
where                                   Q   = output
                 Px
             =                              = input    price
                 ii                                                th
                                            =   quantity   of the i   input



     Because of lack of data on Inter—industry flows we cannot use a net output

measure of TPP. The data is readIly available for a value added based measure

but as Star (1971] notes, if the material inputs do not enter the production

functIon in approximately fixed proportions, their neglect will bias the total

factor productivity measure. Our use of gross output data for a two—digit

industry group implies homogeneous industries within the group. This is slightly

different than assuming an aggregate production function for the industry group.
                                        —2—

        The total factor productivity index is readily calculated from data on

input quantities and output quantity; or on the corresponding prices. The

capital price and quantity indices are discussed in detail below. Otherwise

data is as follows:

L:      An index of production and non—production employees, from the Annual

Survey of 1anufactures (ASM). Following Griliches [1967], we calculate labor

inputs in production worker man—hour equivalents. The average wage rate of

production workers is calculated as indicated below. The difference between

total payroll and production worker payroll is then converted into production

worker man—hour equivalents by dividing by the average wage of production

workers.

PL: An average wage equal to production worker wage bill divided by number of

production worker man hours, both from the Annual Survey of Manufacturers.

Note that L ignores non—payroll labor costs; social security, pensions,

insurance, etc. These data are not available, though at this high a level of

aggregation it would almost certainly be highly correlated with the variable

used.

E:      Nominal expenditure on all energy inputs (from the ASM) divided by a

nominal price index f or all energy inputs (from the Bureau of Labor Statistics).

This measure will be incorrect if industry purchases of energy inputs are not

divided among the inputs in proportion to the inputs' weights in the aggregate

price index, but no alternative is available.

        The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) nominal energy price index.


Q:      Value of Shipments in current dollars adjusted for changes in the value of

inventories of final goods (both from the ASM), divided by the BLS nominal price

index for the industry group output. (The BLS index actually includes some
                                       —3—


metal products not classified in SIC—33, but their weight is trivial.) Value

of Shipments estimates are available only for 1953 on. Gross Output for 1947—52

is estimated on the basis of the Office of Business Economics index of

industrial production for SIC—33 (published in Business Stastics) which covers

the entire period.


PQ: The BLS industry—group price index.

p: Moody's index of MA Corporate Bond yields.

Material Inputs: Expenditure on materials inputs (in current dollars) is

calculated as Gross Output less the sum of total payroll, expenditure on energy,

and expenditure on capital services (all in current dollars). This is divided

into price and quantity components by dividing by a nominal price index for

inputs.

     This price index is constructed as a weighted average of three published

BLS indices from the Handbook of Labor Statistics: 1.      non—food, non—fuel

crude   materials,   2. intermediate materials and components for manufacturing,

and 3. industry output price (since there are significant inter—industry flows),

The weights are derived from the 1963 Input—Output tables for the United States,

according to the source of direct requirements per dollar of Cross Output.
Capital:
         require three pieces of information: The quantity (physical units) of

a stock of capital actually "used up" in the production process in a given time

period; the corresponding price per unit of service flow which firms can be

considered to charge themselves (the rental price), and the share of capital in

total cost. The last is equal to the product of the first two, and is also

identically equal to total property income associated with any producing unit.

     The procedure for separating the value of capital services into price and

quantity components is as fol1ozs:
                                     —4—

1. The first step is construction of an index for the capital st.       The


perpetual inventory formula is

        Kt =    It   + (l_u)K_i

where u is the rate of depreciation. Note that this is a physical relationship.
                                             benchmark Kt we add annual net
not a value relationship. Beginning with a

 investment deflated by a nominal pr±ce index.


 2.   The capital stock index (K) is used, along 7ith an asset price index (q),

 the rate of depreciation (u), the value of capital services       (property

 income), and the effective tax rate (tx) to compute the rate of return (p) on

 capital:

            p = p(K, q, u, K' tx).

 The exact form of this function depends upon the pattern of depreciation and of

 taxation; see Christensen and Jorgenson [1969] for this and other details of

 the procedure.

      Finally, since the value of capital services equals K     K, which is total
 4.

 property income, we can compute an index of the flow of services as total

 property income divided by our rental price.
                                                            Capital Price Index.
      We use Christensen and Jorgenson's [1969] corporate

 This series ends in 1968. We update it through 1971 with the help of Berndt

  and Wood's [l975b) capital input price index.

      Total property income is calculated as value added less total payroll

  (both from the ASM).



  Part B: Cross—section data

       Since it is not possible to construct a cross—section price index for non

  energy intermediate inputs we estimate only a three—factor K, L, E model rathet

  than the four—factor K, L, B, N time series model.
                                             —5—


        Total expenditure      on capital   services is measured as value added less

.total payroll. We assume the flow of services is proportional to the stock, and

use gross book value as a proxy for input quantity. Griliches [1967] considers

this as well as several other measures involving insurance payments, rental

payments, property taxes, and depreciation but notes that the simple correlation

between all the measures is greater than or equal to .99.

     L and         are measured as in the time series section. The quantity index

for energy inputs is constructed in a specIal fashion. We define a separate

"sub—production function" for energy inputs:

          Q    Q(capital,      labor, "energy")

where energy        F(electricity, oil, natural gas, coal). We assumethat the energy

function is translog, so


          ln(energy)           + E cx1lnX1 +       E   E a.3 log X log X
                                  I                ii
where

              =   electricity                           =   natural   gas
              =   fuel   oil                            =   coal

     Estimating these a's and y's exactly as we do in the body of the chapter,

we can   "predict"       ln(energy) up to a constant, which is sufficient for our

purposes. This translog aggregation is permissible if the four fuel inputs are

separable from the basic proauction function.

     The unit of observation is the state. All cross—section data are from

the appropriate Censuses of Manufactures.

Chapter 2

     'See Anderson [19711, Fisher and Kaysen [1962], Halvorsen [1976] and Mount,

Chapman and Tyrell [1973].

     2Berndt and Wood [1975b] consider the demand for aggregate energy and other

inputs by total U.S. manufacturing. Berndt and Jorgenson [1973) and Fuss [1977]

consider the demand for individual types of energy by total U.S. and total Canadian

manufacturing respectively.

     3The translog form was introduced by Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau [1971]

and [1973].

     4Note that the adding—up restrictions together with the cross—equation

equality restrictions on the y1. impose linear homogeneity in prices on the cost

function.

     5Note that the parameter estimates obtained from estimation of the cost share

equations can be used in (3) to compute the unit cost of aggregate energy. A1terI.L

tively, the unit cost of aggregate energy can be indexed using superlative index

numbers, see Diewert [1976).

     6See Zeliner (1962] and Oberhofer and Imenta [1974].

     7Jorgenson and Lau [1975] develop these restrictions in the context of translog

utility functions. The test for implicit separability is exact only at the point of

approximation. However, the test for explicit separability is invariant to the

scaling of the price variables.

     8See Berndt [1977].

     9Not having the elasticities of demand constrained to be constant Is one of

the major advantages of the use of a flexible functional form for the unit cost

function.

    10See Krnenta [1971, pp. 443—444).
Chapter 2 (Continued)

     11Consumption of residual and distillate oil is reported separately.

The quantity of fuel oil is computed by weighting the number of barrels of each

type of oil by kilowatt hours equivalent factors in U.S. Bureau of the Census

(19731. The use of prices as weights provided very similar results.

              the price data are equal to average prices. The use of declining

rate schedules for electric energy and natural gas results in a divergence

between marginal and average prices for these inputs, but data on marginal prices

are not available. See Halvorsen [1975, 1976] for further discussion.

     l2aUse of a .01 significance level would result in rejection of the cross—

equation equality restrictions for an additional four industries in 1971 and

five in 1962 and 1958.

     13The monotonicity test at the means of the data can be interpreted as a

local test at the point of expansion, see Jorgenson and Lau [19751.


     l3aA procedure proposed by Lau [1974] provides a statistical test of

concavity but was not used due to computational difficulties.

     14Results for 1971 for the industries for which the model did not perform

well are given in Appendix Tables A.1 and A.2.

      15The cross price elasticities should generally be smaller because the sum

 of the own   and cross price elasticities is zero and most of the cross price

 elasticities are positive.

      16For elasticities involving coal, the weights are the shares of each

 industry in consumption by the industries for which the four—input model

 performed well.

      17Data for 1958 were not included in the pooled regressions because 1958 was

 a recession year and therefore not fully comparable with 1971 and 1962.
Chapter 2 (Continued)



            [1977) obtained a virtually Identical result f or EHV for total

Canadian manufacturing for 1971.

    '9Since the estimates of       are obtained holding manufacturing output

constant, these elasticities do not reflect induced output effects on

energy demand.
ChaPter2 (Continued)
     20Halvorsen [1976] obtained an estimate of —1.24 for EE with cross—section

state data for total industrial demand for electric energy in 1969. The estimate

of      in that study, 0.23, is very close to the estimate of 0.20 obtained in this

study for 1971.

     21See Allen [1966] and Uzawa [1962].

     22Because     the Cobb—Douglas functional form is a special case of the translog

form, It is possible to test whether the more restrictive Cobb—Douglas form is

appropriate for the cost function. The Cobb—Douglas form was rejected for all

industries at the .05 level except industry 34 in 1958, industries 22, 23, 25, 27,

and 35 in 1962. and industries 23, 29, 34, and 36 in 1971.

     23Estlniates of the elasticities of demand for fuel oil, natural gas, and coal

in electric power generation are reported in Atkinson and Halvorsen [1976].

      1The results will also provide further information on the existence of a

consistent aggregate of production and non—production workers, see Cook [1968] and

Berndt and Christensen [1974).

      2Sixteenof the seventy—two estimated cross elasticities are significant at the

ten percent level using a two—tailed test.

      3See Berndt and Wood (1975b1 and Fuss [1977].


Chapter 4

      1The constraint that the firm is on its production function also implies

singularity of (I —   ), see   Nadiri and Rosen [1973, pp. 32—33). The restrictions

are not imposed on the system of equations.

            calculating intermediate— and long—run elasticities, the value of the

 labor own—adjustment coefficient is set equal to one.

      3Fuss [1977] reports as a representative result for Canada an estimate of

 —0.49 at the means of the data for Ontario.

     'We could also investigate technical change through its effects on the cost

function which is dual to the production function. This would have the econometric

advantage of permitting a parametric test for constant-returns—to—scale, rather

than Imposing it as we do here. But it would also have the disadvantage of requir-

ing us to maintain that the factor augmentation values were exogenous, since if

they are endogenous they will not show up in the dual cost function. Some

empirical work was done using a translog cost function; the results were generally

poorer than with the production function.

     2Thjs is the procedure used by Sato (1970], and by Binswanger [1973] who uses

a translog cost function.

     3We are looking at the reduced system of xi — 1 share equations here; for the

full system r is singular so        does not exist.

     41t should be noted that there is some question about the proper estimation

of the standard errors of the parameter estimates. The Issue has to do with the

proper number of degrees of freedom for the model. The standard errors and t—

statistics here conform to Theil's [1971] and should be Interpreted as asymptotic

standard errors and t—statistics.

    51n principle the cross section bias estimates should sum to zero, as do

those of the time series. This constraint is difficult to Impose given the way

in which these numbers were calculated. See above, Part B.
