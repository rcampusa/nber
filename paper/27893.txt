                                          ABSTRACT

All colonial powers granted concessions to private companies to extract natural resources during
the colonial era. Within Africa, these concessions were characterized by indirect rule and
violence. We use the arbitrarily defined borders of rubber concessions granted in the north of the
Congo Free State to examine the causal effects of this form of economic organization on
development. We find that historical exposure to the concessions causes significantly worse
education, wealth, and health outcomes. To examine mechanisms, we collect survey and
experimental data from individuals near a former concession boundary. We find that village
chiefs inside the former concessions provide fewer public goods, are less likely to be elected, and
are more likely to be hereditary. However, individuals within the concessions are more trusting,
more cohesive, and more supportive of sharing income. The results are relevant for the many
places that were designated as concessions to private companies during the colonial era.

1. Introduction

The Congo Free State (CFS), what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), was the

personal colony of King Leopold II of Belgium between 1885 and 1908. Leopold designated large

parts of the CFS as concessions to private companies. These private companies extracted natural

resources by using extreme violence and by coopting local leaders. Historians have noted that the

rubber concessions granted under Leopold II had disastrous consequences for local populations.

An estimated 10 million people, approximately half of the population of Congo, died between

1880 and 1920 (Vansina, 2010, Hochschild, 1998).

   While the concessions granted under the CFS and the subsequent abuses that occurred are

particularly infamous, all major colonial powers granted concessions to private companies.

Within Africa, concessions existed in French, British, Belgian, German, and Portuguese colonies

(e.g. Angola, Botswana, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Chad, DRC, Gabon, Malawi,

Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe).1 While the

form of concessions varied widely across contexts, a common element is that these companies'

primary purpose was to extract natural resources. They were assigned powers that are typically

associated with government ­ such as monopoly over violence and ability to tax. In sub-Saharan

Africa, concessions to private companies were characterized by indirect rule, in which the scope

and power of local leaders was altered and coopted, and the use of violence to achieve their

extraction goals (Mamdani, 1996, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2020).

   While concessions to private companies were common across colonial Africa as a form of

organizing economic production, causal evidence on their impacts has been difficult to obtain.

The lack of evidence is due in part to how ubiquitous these concessions were. Some colonies were

completely run as concessions.2 Additionally, the concessions' boundaries were rarely randomly

allocated, and concessions were often granted in resource rich areas.

   However, the rubber concessions granted in northern Congo ­ Abir and Anversoise ­ offer

an opportunity to test how exposure to private concession companies has affected development.

Abir and Anversoise were defined using salient geographic features at a time when relatively
   1 Concessions to private companies also existed outside of Africa, for example: the East India Company in India,

the United Fruit Company in much of Central America (Méndez-Chacón and Van Patten, 2020), and the Dutch East
India company in Indonesia.
   2 For example, all of Rhodesia (present day Zimbabwe) was granted as a concession to the British South Africa

company.

little was known of the interior of Congo. Additionally, the former concession boundaries do

not align with any present day political boundaries, ethnic group boundaries, or any particular

natural resource endowment. The concessions only existed for 14 years, a relatively short amount

of time. Finally, the concessions focused exclusively on extraction, rather than on investments

in infrastructure or human capital (in contrast to Dell and Olken, 2020 and Méndez-Chacón and

Van Patten, 2020). These features allow us to isolate the effects of exposure to extraction-based

colonial concessions on our outcomes of interest (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2020). In this

study, we examine the effects of the rubber concessions granted in the CFS on development, the

performance and accountability of local leaders, and on pro-social norms and behavior.

  Exposure to the concessions in the CFS was characterized by violence and the use of village

chiefs to enforce rubber collection quotas. The concession companies were given monopoly

rights over natural resource extraction within the concession boundaries. European agents had

monetary incentives tied to rubber production and were given support from the CFS armed

forces (the Force Publique), their own militias, and a state mandate to use coercive means to reach

their rubber extraction goals. Historical accounts of the rubber concession period highlight how

the rubber companies forced village chiefs to support the rubber regime. Those who did not

support the rubber regime were killed and replaced by outsiders willing to enforce the rubber

quotas (Harms, 1975, Vangroenweghe, 1986). This combination of cooption and coercion is a

highly relevant bundle for the colonial context and likely the most relevant for understanding the

importance of colonial extraction (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2020).

  We examine the implications of the rubber concessions for development outcomes using

a geographic regression discontinuity design. Consistent with the idiosyncratic manner with

which the historical boundaries were determined, we demonstrate that those areas designated as

concessions are geographically and culturally similar to the areas just outside of the concessions.

We then use Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 2007 and 2014 to estimate the

effects of the historical concessions on present-day education, wealth, and health outcomes. We

find that individuals from the former concessions have significantly worse outcomes. The results

are robust to a variety of analyses, including: alternative RD specifications, bandwidths, and

kernels; a donut hole analysis; dropping observations along the Congo river; standard error

adjustments to account for spatial auto-correlation; and an analysis by concession. We address

several possible concerns with examining the effects of the historical rubber concessions: the use


                                                2
of river basins to define boundaries, selective migration, and subsequent colonial or missionary

investment. We find no evidence that these factors explain our observed results.

   We then examine mechanisms. We present a conceptual framework based on three premises.

First, the use of indirect rule may have led to less accountable and more despotic leaders (Mam-

dani, 1996, Vanhee, 2005). Second, weakened institutions and violence may have encouraged more

pro-social behavior; as local institutions failed to function, returns to investing in social capital

became higher and cooperation became more important (von Dawans, Fischbacher, Kirschbaum,

Fehr and Heinrichs, 2012, Bauer, Blattman, Chytilová, Henrich, Miguel and Mitts, 2016). Third,

institutions and culture may act as substitutes, leading to a low-development equilibrium (Bisin

and Verdier, 2017).

   We collected survey and experimental data from 520 individuals in Gemena, DRC, a town

on the border of the former Anversoise concession.          Gemena was created after the end of

the concession era; therefore, those who live there are migrants themselves or descendants of

migrants. Our analysis follows the epidemiological approach (Fernández, 2011): we compare

data from individuals in Gemena with ancestors from inside the former concessions to those

with ancestors from outside the former concessions.

   Using data on the villages of origin of our respondents, we examine the selection mechanism

for the chief and the extent to which the chief provides various public goods for the village.

Generally, village chiefs are chosen either through elections, in which village members or rep-

resentatives of villagers can vote among several candidates, or are hereditary, coming from one

specific lineage within the village. We find that village chiefs within the former concessions are

34 percentage points less likely to be elected to their position and are more likely to be hereditary.

This is possibly due to the common historical practice of anointing particular lineages as "ruling"

lineages, from which subsequent village chiefs would be chosen. In some cases, medals were

given to particular chiefs as proof that their lineage is a ruling lineage (Vanhee, 2005, Omasombo,

2013).

   We then examine the responsibilities of the village chief. The village chief serves a particularly

important role in this context, as the national government is weak and generally unable to provide

basic public goods (Sanchez de la Sierra, 2020). We find that village chiefs inside the former

concessions are less likely to provide public goods, such as road maintenance, conflict arbitration,

and maintenance of schools. As a consequence, these villages also have fewer public goods.


                                                  3
   Building on other work examining the effects of colonial extraction (Dell, 2010, Dell and Olken,

2020) which primarily focuses on institutional and investment channels, we test whether the

concession system had consequences for several different cultural traits, including trust, social

cohesion, altruism, and support for sharing income. This is important given growing evidence of

the feedback between institutions and cultural traits (Bisin and Verdier, 2017).

   Using survey questions on trust in a variety of other individuals or groups, we find that

individuals from areas exposed to the rubber concessions are more trusting of others than those

just outside the former concessions. We also examine measures of social cohesion and support for

sharing income. We find that individuals from the former concession areas report feeling closer

to a variety of others, are more likely to agree with statements that money should be shared

with others, and are more likely to redistribute in an experimental task. Based on the historical

narrative and our conceptual framework, we suggest that these changes may due to a need to

compensate for the lower quality institutions that arose from the concession era. Additionally,

these changes may reinforce each other: chiefs are held less accountable and allowed to stay in

power since individuals rely less on their formal institutions and instead rely more on informal

sharing norms for support.

   We contribute to several literatures.          An important set of studies examine the effects of

colonialism, pre-colonial characteristics, and exposure to the slave trade on modern outcomes

(La Porta, López de Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny, 1998, Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson, 2001,

Gennaioli and Rainer, 2007, Michalopoulous and Papaioannou, 2013, 2014, Alsan, 2015, Nunn,

2008). A related literature has examined the effects of investments made by colonial governments

(Huillery, 2009, Cage and Rueda, 2016, 2017, Osafo-Kwaako, 2012, Wantchekon, Klasnja and

Novta, 2015, Lowes and Montero, 2020).3

   However, there is no evidence on the concession system, despite that it was a very common

form of economic organization used by all colonial powers to extract natural resources from their

colonies (Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2020).4 In the case of these concession companies, they

did not make productive investments in these areas. Rubber requires little capital investment to

be collected, and it does not require training of the labor force. The primary input is labor, and

the concession areas are connected to river networks so that there was no need to invest in road
  3 See Michalopoulos and Papaioannou (2020) for a thorough review of work examining historical legacies in Africa.
  4 Current evidence mostly focuses on cases in which companies made productive investments (Juif and Frankema,
2017, Dell and Olken, 2020)



                                                        4
infrastructure. Thus, the key focus was extraction.5

   Past work has shown that forms of indirect rule are associated with worse development

outcomes (Banerjee and Iyer, 2005, Acemoglu, Reed and Robinson, 2014). The concession era

contributed to the proliferation of indirect rule. We find evidence consistent with Mamdani's

hypothesis that indirect rule has created less accountable and worse leaders. By coopting local

institutions, replacing uncooperative leaders with compliant ones, and creating ruling lineages,

the rubber concessions instituted a series of local strong men, who continue to dominate village

politics today.

   There is growing theoretical evidence that culture responds to institutions and that under-

standing this process is important for understanding persistence (Bisin and Verdier, 2017, Ace-

moglu and Robinson, 2019, Nunn, 2020). By combining survey and field work with our historical

analysis, we are able to empirically examine the role of both institutions and culture. Additionally,

the results speak to the importance of "place" for intergenerational mobility (Alesina, Hohmann,

Michalopoulos and Papaioannou, 2020, Chetty and Hendren, 2018, Chetty, Hendren and Katz,

2016). We show that development outcomes for second-generation migrants converge once in

Gemena, despite that they maintain different cultural norms.

   Finally, we provide the first quantitative evidence on the effects of an historical event of signif-

icant magnitude. This itself is an important contribution. After the slave trade, the concessions

granted under King Leopold are one of the most important events in modern African history.

Joseph Conrad, author of Heart of Darkness, describes this era as "the vilest scramble for loot that

ever disfigured the history of human conscience and geographical exploration".6 We find that the

rubber concessions granted by Leopold II have large and significant negative effects on economic

development. This finding is relevant for the many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South America,

and Asia that were granted as concessions to private companies during the colonial era.

   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides historical background on the Congo

Free State and the rubber concessions. Section 3 presents the main empirical results from the

DHS data. Section 4 describes the fieldwork data and results. Section 5 concludes.
   5 This is also related to the literature on the long-run effects of labor coercion, a common element of colonial

extraction in Africa and a common feature of labor relations for much of human history (van Waijenburg, 2015, Dell,
2010, Nunn, 2008, Dippel, Greif and Trefler, 2017, Acemoglu and Wolitzky, 2011).
   6 This is related to literature on the effects of mass killings, such as the Holocaust, the Rwandan genocide, and the

expulsion of the Moriscos (Acemoglu, Hassan and Robinson, 2011, Rogall and Yanagizawa-Drott, 2014, Chaney and
Hornbeck, 2016).

2. The History of the Rubber Concessions

By the mid-1870s, European powers had made claims to most parts of Africa. However, the center

of Africa remained largely unexplored. In a bid to make Belgium a colonial power, King Leopold

II of Belgium convinced other European colonial powers of his philanthropic goals in Congo,

including his mission to end the slave trade. The British, French, and German governments

acquiesced to Leopold's interest in Congo to avoid conflict with each other over their own colonial

aspirations. Thus, the CFS was created in 1885 as the personal colony of Leopold. According to

the Berlin conference in which the borders of the CFS were outlined, Congo was to remain a free

trade zone for individuals of all nationalities.


2.1. Concessions in the Congo Free State

Leopold needed to demonstrate continued state presence in the Congo in order to retain his

rights over it. This proved a costly endeavor. In 1891 and 1892, in an attempt to increase revenues

and contrary to the spirit of the Berlin agreement, he declared all lands and any raw materials

found on these lands to be the property of the CFS. This decree divided Congo into three areas.

The first area was the domaine privé, which was property of the state. Areas of the domaine privé

were divided into concessions given to private companies. The two largest concessions granted

in the domaine privé were Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (Abir) and Anversoise (Waltz,

1918). An additional part of the domaine privé was allocated as private land for the king himself,

called the domaine de la couronne. A second area, called the "closed area," was to be settled as

circumstances allowed. Most of this area was eventually allocated to the Katanga Company in

the southwest. The rest of the country was primarily a "free trade zone" where individuals of

any nationality could engage in trade. The Kasai region in the South and Southeast remained

open to free trade until 1902, when the Kasai trust was established. See Figure 1 for a map of the

concessions as of 1904.

   The administration of the various areas of the CFS varied depending on whether they were

part of a concession, the concession's timing and duration, and the natural resources present in

the area. The Abir and Anveroise concessions were the largest focusing on the collection of rubber

and existed for 14 years, from 1892 to 1906.7 The Abir and Anversoise concessions differed from

other concessions in that their borders were defined by the extent of river basins, their borders do

not coincide with present day political boundaries, they existed for a short period of time, and

the concessions focused almost exclusively on the collection of rubber, which required little to no

investment. While most of the paper focuses on the Abir and Anversoise concessions, we return

to an examination of all of the concessions granted during the CFS era in Section 3.5.


2.2. Creation of Abir and Anversoise

Abir and Anversoise were created in the Upper Congo Basin shortly after the invention of the

pneumatic tire in 1890, which lead to a dramatic increase in the demand for natural rubber.

The Upper Congo Basin had immense natural rubber resources, and Leopold finally saw an

opportunity for profits. The state had limited manpower and capacity, so Leopold established

concessions to be given to private companies for the exploitation of rubber.

   Because most of the interior of the Congo was uncharted at the time, the concession bound-

aries were defined using salient geographic characteristics, namely major rivers and their basins

(Harms, 1975). The contracts establishing the agreements between the CFS and Abir and Anver-

soise confirm that salient geographic characteristics determined the concession boundaries. Abir

was established in 1892 and given rights over the Maringa-Lopori basin. This concession area was
  7 The Kasai area was partially under the free trade regime, then part of a concession company from 1902 to the
mid-1950s. The Katanga area was part of a concession, though the extraction focused primarily on copper, rather than
rubber.


                                                         7
defined by two rivers and their tributaries: the Maringa river and the Lopori river, plus a 25 km

buffer area around them.8 In the same year Anversoise was created and given extraction rights

in the Mongala river basin, defined by the Mongala river and its tributaries.9 Figure 2a presents

the boundaries of the Abir and Anversoise concessions.10

   To see that the boundaries of the concessions do conform to the definitions as stated in

the founding contracts, Figure 2b illustrates the concession boundaries and the associated river

basins. The concession borders appear to align almost exactly with the extent of the river basins.

Additionally, Figure 2b shows the locations of the rubber collection posts established by the

concession companies. The posts all fall within the boundaries of the concessions. In return

for the land granted to the concession companies, the state would collect 2% of the companies'

profits. Leopold himself was a majority stake holder in Abir and Anversoise (Harms, 1975). Areas

just outside of the concessions continued to be free trade zones, but individuals trading in these

areas did not have the same rights and resources granted to the concession companies.


2.3. Rubber Collection

The concession companies forced individuals within their concessions to collect rubber as a form

of paying taxes. The collection of rubber required little capital investment, in contrast to the

collection of other natural resources such as diamonds or minerals, and it did not require training

of the labor force. The intensity of rubber extraction in concession areas was thus linked to the

supply and productivity of labor.
   8  The initial contract between the Secretary of the Interior of the CFS, Mr. Eetvelde, and Mr. J.T. North and
Alexis Mols, representatives of the Société Anonyme Anglo-Belgian-India-Rubber and Exploration Company defines
the boundaries of Abir as follows: "The State of Congo concedes to the undersigned on the other part under the
conditions stated in this contract and for a period of 30 years starting today, the right to exploit rubber, gum copal and
other products of the forest situated on state lands in the basin of the Lopori and the Maringa, from and including
Basakusu and to include the forest situated in an area of 10 kilometers around this post. The state will provide all
facilities for such exploitation that will be with the assistance of the District Commissioner and at the sole risk and
peril of the concessionary" (Waltz, 1918, p. 372). Article 4 of the document specifies rights to an area of 25 km around
each post.
   9 This concession was defined as the area north of part of the Congo River up to the former international border

between the CFS and French Equatorial Africa. The initial contract between the Secretary of the Interior of CFS,
Mr. Eetvelde, and Mr. Alexander de Browne de Tiège, representative of Anversoise defines the boundaries of the
Anversoise concession as follows: "The Congo State accords to the undersigned on the other part, under the conditions
indicated in the present contract and for a term of 50 years starting today...the concession of the forests in the state
land situated in the basin of the Mongala, with the exclusive right to exploit the rubber, gum copal, and all the other
products of the forest" (Waltz, 1918, p. 352).
  10 The maps of the rubber concessions are from Waltz (1918), which describes all of the concessions given by King

Leopold II. This includes details on the physical boundaries of the concessions and the year when each concession was
granted. Figure 2a is a map of the concessions of interest: Abir and Anversoise. These were the largest concessions in
the Upper Congo Basin, and the largest concessions that focused exclusively on rubber (Vangroenweghe, 1985).

    Notes: The Anversoise rubber concession is the northern concession and the Abir concession is the southern
    concession (Waltz, 1918). The Mongala river basin is the northern basin and the Maringa-Lopori river basin
    is the southern basin.



  Once the rubber concessions were allocated, the companies set up posts within the concessions

to collect rubber. One or two European agents would be assigned to each post within a concession.

They would survey surrounding villages and make a census of the number of adult men in the

village. Concession companies set quotas for the collection of rubber based on these population

censes. Male villagers were required to deliver a quota of about four kilos of dried rubber every

two weeks. In addition, villages were required to provide food and supplies to maintain nearby

posts (Harms, 1983, 1975).

  Most rubber collected during the CFS era was from the vine landolphia, which is delicate and

easily damaged, rather than from the more hearty rubber trees, funtumia elastica, which were more

prevalent in the French Congo and West Africa (Harms, 1975). Rubber collection was both time

intensive and physically demanding. The rubber collection process could take days, particularly

as rubber supplies dwindled and untapped rubber vines became more difficult to find. For

example, men in the Baringa area would spend around 10 days of every 14 days in the forest

collecting rubber (Harms, 1983).


2.4. Violence

The concession companies maintained militias comprised of sentries who were responsible for

ensuring compliance with the rubber quotas. Generally, the sentries were outsiders recruited


                                                        9
from other areas of Congo; this strategy was purposefully selected to ensure that sentries were

willing to use violence against villagers. Approximately 25 to 80 "post sentries" armed with rifles

were assigned to each new post established. An additional 65 to 100 "village sentries," armed

with muzzle-loading cap guns, were stationed in the villages surrounding the posts. In 1903, one

Abir post received 17,600 cartridges for the Albini rifles used by the post sentries (Harms, 1983).

To prevent waste, soldiers were required to provide a human hand for every bullet used. The

human hands were then smoked for preservation and collected by the European agents.

   Individuals were severely punished if they failed to meet their rubber quota. Punishment

could take many forms. For example, individuals could be imprisoned and forced to work. Their

family members could be held for ransom until the quota was fulfilled. Individuals could also

be subjected to various forms of physical violence, including whipping by the chicotte (a whip

made of hippopotamus hide), burning with gum copal, or death. The chief of the village could

also be imprisoned if his village did not meet the quota. In July 1902, records indicate that 44

chiefs were imprisoned in the villages around a single post (Harms, 1983). The sentries from the

concession companies' private militias were primarily responsible for carrying out these violent

tactics. However, the European agents also engaged in the imprisonment, torture, and killing of

villagers.

   Testimony collected by Robert Casement, a consul for the British sent to Congo to investigate

accusations of atrocities, documents the intensity of the violence:


          "When I was still a child, the sentries shot at the people in my village because of the rubber.
      My father was murdered: they tied him to a tree and shot and killed him, and when the sentries
      untied him they gave him to their boys, who ate him. My mother and I were taken prisoner.
      The sentries cut off my mother's hands while she was still alive. Two days later, they cut off
      her head." (Janssens, 1904)


If the sentries faced any resistance, they were able to call on soldiers from the Force Publique to

provide support.


2.5. Indirect Rule

A tactic employed by sentries to ensure rubber production was to undermine and coopt local

authority. Non-compliant chiefs were held captive, replaced, or killed. One of the sentries in

each village was assigned the position of kapita, or head sentry for that village. In fact, kapita is a


                                                      10
Lingala word used today to denote "chief". Once in the village, the kapita would recruit eight to

ten people to serve as bodyguards. He then began the process of asserting his authority over the

villagers. To do so, he would attack men in positions of esteem or authority. For example, lineage

headman were required to carry soil and rubbish alongside slaves. Anyone who challenged the

kapita could be whipped or killed.

   The kapitas severely undermined the prestige, authority, and wealth of lineage headmen and

village chiefs. The village headmen were "shamelessly degraded in the eyes of their people, made

to fetch and carry for soldiers, cast into chains and flung into prison" (Morel, 1904). Though they

were still considered to have important connections to ancestors, the headmen no longer had

the authority to make important decisions. They were unable to protect their lineage from the

brutality and terror imposed by the sentries. Additionally, since most able-bodied men were

required to collect rubber in the forest, there was a power vacuum in the village that was filled

by the kapita. In fact, some sentries began to take on the responsibilities previously allocated to

lineage headmen, such as settling disputes among lineage members. Finally, the sentries would

take the wealth from lineage headmen, including marrying their daughters and wives (Harms,

1974).


2.6. Aftermath

Though the CFS government objected in principle to the violence, in practice it allowed and

encouraged it. The effectiveness of the labor coercion allowed the concession companies to

make exorbitant profits (Plas and Pourbaix, 1899). By 1905, the natural rubber supplies were

nearly exhausted in the Upper Congo Basin. Due to depleted rubber supplies and increasing

condemnation of their labor practices in Europe, Abir and Anversoise left CFS in 1906. In 1908, the

CFS became a Belgian colony. After 1910, competitive production of rubber from hevea plantations

in Southeast Asia and South America, along with the invention of synthetic rubber, led to a large

decrease in rubber prices (Harms, 1975).

   Historians have noted that the rubber concessions granted under Leopold II had disastrous

consequences for local populations. Villages subjected to the rubber regime were unable to tend

to their fields, leading to low yields and famine. Sentries raided local livestock. Malnourished in-

dividuals became particularly susceptible to disease, including the increasingly rampant sleeping

sickness (Harms, 1983). As Hochschild describes, "the world has managed to forget one of the


                                                11
great mass killings of recent history... it was unmistakably clear that the Congo of a century ago

had indeed seen a death toll of Holocaust dimensions" (Hochschild, 1998, pp. 3-4). The brutality

of the rubber collection tactics resulted in the deaths of an estimated 10 million people and earned

the policies the nickname "Red Rubber" (Vangroenweghe, 1985).

   Since the end of the rubber era, there have been three key periods: Belgian colonial rule

(1908 to 1960), the Mobutu era (1965 to 1997), and the present. Across the Equateur region,

the Belgian era was characterized by little investment, forced cultivation of cash crops (coffee,

palm oil, and cotton), forced labor (particularly during the World Wars), missionary provision

of education, and sleeping sickness campaigns (Clement, 2014). Mobutu pursued policies of

centralization (reducing the number of provinces); returning to cultural "authenticity" (banning

Western influences); and "Zairinization" in which foreign enterprises were expropriated and

eventually taken over by the state. Corruption was rampant and the government invested only

1.5% of its budget in the Equateur region (Hesselbein, 2007). Since Mobutu's overthrow, the

Equateur region has experienced civil conflict and unrest. Equateur remains one of the poorest

regions of Congo. Most individuals are engaged in subsistence agriculture; the non-agricultural

sector is close to non-existent (Van Reybrouck, 2014).


3. The Effects of the Rubber Concessions on Development

3.1. Data

To examine the long run impact of the rubber concessions on development outcomes we combine

Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 2007 and 2014 with maps of the boundaries of

Abir and Anversoise. The DHS surveys from the DRC provide detailed information on education,

assets, and health outcomes. These data sources and the variables used in our analyses are

described in detail in Appendix A.11 Figure 3 provides a map with the rubber concession borders

and the DHS clusters from 2007 and 2014 that are within 100 kms of the borders of the rubber

concessions. Appendix C.1 provides summary statistics for clusters in and outside of the former

concessions.
 11 In Appendix I we also explore other datasets including data on population density (Landscan and African
Population Database); nightlights; and conflict (PRIO).

3.2. Empirical Strategy

We can estimate the causal effect of exposure to the rubber concessions on the outcomes of interest

with the following regression discontinuity (RD) specification:



          yi,v =  + RubberConcessioni,v + f (locationv ) + Xi  +  + i,v f or v  bw                                      (1)

where yi,v is our outcome of interest for individual i from village v ; RubberConcessioni,v is an

indicator equal to 1 if v is inside a rubber concession area and equal to 0 otherwise; Xi is a vector

of covariates for individual i such as gender, age, and age squared;  is a nearest concession

fixed effect; and f (locationv ) is the RD polynomial, which controls for smooth functions of

geographic location for village v . Following Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014), Cattaneo,

Idrobo and Titiunik (2020), and Gelman and Imbens (2016), our baseline specification is a local

linear polynomial in distance to the concession border estimated separately on each side of the

concession. We use a triangular weighting kernel and calculate the optimal bandwidth bw using

the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020). We also present results with




                                                     13
a wider fixed bandwidth of 100 kms from the border.12 We check robustness to using various

other forms of the RD polynomial, kernel, and bandwidths (see Appendix C).

   Our coefficient of interest is  : the effect of being just inside the concession area on our outcome

of interest. The intuition behind this specification is that concession borders arbitrarily allocated

some villages to be part of the concessions and others to be just outside the concessions. These

villages should have similar geography, culture, history, and institutions prior to the concession

era, allowing us to identify the effect of rubber extraction on contemporary outcomes.13

   The RD approach presented in equation (1) requires two identifying assumptions. The first

assumption is that all relevant factors before the concessions were granted varied smoothly at the

concession boundaries. This assumption is needed to ensure that individuals located just outside

the concessions are an appropriate counterfactual for those located just inside them.

   A key concern for identification is that the rubber concessions were chosen strategically for

certain characteristics that could also affect our outcomes of interest. For example, these areas

might have been more suitable for certain crops or populated by ethnic groups with different

cultures. However, whether an area was exposed to rubber extraction is a deterministic and

discontinuous function of whether or not a village fell inside the concession boundaries. As

described in Section 2, these concessions were granted at a time when much of the Congo had

not been explored. The concession boundaries were defined by salient geographic characteristics

- in this case, rivers and river basins. Thus, the concession boundaries are unlikely to have been

selected based on local characteristics that also vary discontinuously at the concession border.

   To assess the plausibility of this first assumption, Table 1 presents summary statistics and

estimates using specification (1) for important geographic and pre-concession characteristics. This

analysis is at the 20km by 20km grid cell level. These results are presented with standard errors

clustered at the territory level for geographic characteristics and the ethnicity level for cultural

characteristics; we also present results using Conley standard errors with a cut-off window of

50 kms to account for spatial auto-correlation (Conley, 1999) in Appendix C.2 and with wild
  12 We calculated the Imbens and Kalyanaraman optimal bandwidth for several of our outcomes of interest with
distance to the border as the running variable. The optimal bandwidth was generally between 75 and 125 kilometers
depending on the outcome. Thus, we chose our fixed bandwidth to be 100 kms.
  13 This RD approach has been used in multiple settings to examine the effects of historical events, such as in: Dell

(2010), Miguel and Roland (2011), Grosfeld, Rodnyansky and Zhuravskaya (2013), Michalopoulous and Papaioannou
(2014), Becker, Boeckh, Hainz and Woessmann (2015), Fontana, Nannicini and Tabellini (2016).

bootstrap p-values (Cameron, Gelbach and Miller, 2008) in Appendix C.3.14                               In addition to

showing balance at the grid cell level, we also show balance on pre-concession characteristics

at the DHS cluster level in Appendix C.4.

   Consistent with the first identification assumption, we find balance on a number of important

geographic and pre-concession characteristics. The geographic characteristics include: elevation,

rainfall, rainfall variability, land suitability, ruggedness, river characteristics, disease suitability

measures, and distance to Kinshasa and the coast.15 We find balance on these characteristics,

suggesting that the areas inside and outside the concession are comparable along the border.

   Finally, we also show balance on a number of pre-concession characteristics using data from

the Ethnographic Atlas (EA) (Murdock, 1967) and Nunn and Wantchekon (2011). Ideally we

would present balance on pre-concession characteristics for all ethnic groups near the concession.

However, the EA only contains information for a sub-sample of groups in our area of interest.

Using the sub-sample with information in the EA, we find balance on a number of pre-concession

characteristics such as exposure to the Atlantic slave trade, population density prior to coloniza-

tion, levels of centralization, and polygamy. Additionally, the concession borders do not align

with Murdock ethnic group borders (see Appendix Figure B4) nor do they align with present day

political borders.

   The second important assumption for the RD approach is that there was no selective sorting

across the RD threshold when the concession borders were established. Selective sorting would

require certain villages be able to select out of being allocated to a concession. This is unlikely to

have happened given that villages were unable to negotiate the boundaries of the concessions.

   An important related concern is selective migration either during the rubber era or subse-

quently, which would be considered an outcome of the rubber concessions.16 It is likely that some

migration took place during the rubber era, as individuals tried to avoid the rubber demands and

the associated violence. Unfortunately, there are no data available to quantify the magnitude of
   14 For the clustered standard errors, we cluster at the territory level, the lowest administrative level for which there

is spatial data. For RD bandwidths below 50 kms, the number of clusters is slightly below thirty, potentially leading
to overly optimistic standard errors (Cameron et al., 2008). Overall, the clustered standard errors tend to be quite
consistent with (and more conservative than) both the wild bootstrap and Conley standard errors.
   15 Note, rubber in the CFS era was from a vine called landolphia owariensis, rather than from rubber trees. We do not

have data on the suitability for the rubber vine, which was found in forested areas. Reassuringly, the entire Congo
basin region is heavily forested, and this does not align with the concession boundaries. Appendix Figure B2 visually
presents the extent of river networks.
   16 By selective migration, we mean migration of only the "highest ability" individuals from just inside the conces-

sions to just outside the concessions.

 Notes: The unit of observation is a 20 by 20 km grid cell. Columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 present the mean of the corresponding variable. Columns 3 and 6 present clustered standard
errors for the difference in means clustered at either the territory level for geographic variables or ethnic group level for pre-colonial variables. Inside and Outside indicate
whether a grid cell is inside or outside the former rubber concession area respectively. Columns 7 and 8 give the estimated RD coefficient and standard error that uses the
corresponding variable as its outcome using a local linear specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary and use a triangular kernel. The RD MSE
optimal bandwidth is determined using the procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020). Column 7 uses the average of all optimal bandwidths (39.30 kms). Regressions include
a nearest concession fixed effect. Variable definitions and data sources used in this analysis are described in detail in Appendix A. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.




migration during the rubber era.17 While we are unable to analyze migration during the rubber

era, we conduct a number of tests using present-day DHS data and fieldwork data to show

that selective migration is unlikely to fully explain the effects. In Appendix F, we examine the

sensitivity of the results to selective migration and to heterogeneity by ease of migrating from

inside the concession to outside the concession boundaries. Rates of selective migration would

have to be quite high to fully explain our results, and there is no evidence of differential effects

based on ease of migration.
   17We can only highlight the difficulties associated with migration. Anecdotal evidence from Harms (1975) suggests
that the rubber companies greatly controlled migration (using village censuses they collected themselves) and forced
people to remain in their villages. Harms (1975) notes that local chiefs were held accountable when individuals that
migrated did not meet their quotas, incentivizing chiefs to prevent migration. Finally, since the concessions were
defined by the extent of river basins, and rivers were used for transport, migration outside of the concessions would
likely have been difficult.

3.3. Regression Discontinuity Results

To examine the long-run effects of exposure to the rubber concessions, we analyze 2007 and 2014

DHS data on education, wealth, and health. All variables are defined in the table notes. Table 2

reports estimates for specification (1) with education outcomes in Panel A, asset wealth outcomes

in Panel B, and health outcomes in Panel C. Section 3.4 discusses additional RD polynomials and

other robustness checks. The results in Table 2 Panel A show that areas inside the concession

have significantly lower levels of education across all specifications and bandwidths. Individuals

just inside the former rubber concessions are estimated to have approximately 1.3 fewer years of

education than individuals just outside the concessions.

   Table 2 Panel B reports estimates for the asset wealth measures available in the DHS survey.18

Individuals in villages inside the former rubber concessions are approximately 25% less wealthy

than similar individuals outside the rubber concessions. In standard deviation terms, areas inside

the former concessions are about 0.5 standard deviations less wealthy.

   Table 2 Panel C reports estimates for different health outcomes and finds evidence that

individuals from inside the former concessions have worse health outcomes.                            Children and

women inside the former concessions have approximately 9 percentage points lower height-to-age

percentile. Overall, we find evidence that individuals residing in villages inside the former

rubber concessions are less educated, less wealthy, and have worse health outcomes today than

individuals in villages outside the former rubber concessions.

   Figure 4 presents standard RD plots for our main outcomes of interest, with distance to the

border as the running variable and a local linear trend to each side of the discontinuity. For these

outcomes, we observe there is a clear discontinuity at the concession border. See Appendix B for

the spatial RD plots.


3.4. Robustness of DHS Results

There are three main empirical concerns for the DHS results presented in Table 2: robustness to

alternative RD specifications, random displacement of DHS clusters, and the use of basins to de-

fine borders. The first concern is whether the results are robust to alternative specifications of the

RD-polynomial. In Appendix C.5, we show that the results are robust to alternative bandwidths,
  18 To reduce the influence of outliers and to ease interpretation, we show wealth results using the log of the wealth
factor score.

  Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. All regressions include a local linear
specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary and use a triangular
kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by
Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Regressions control for age, age squared, gender,
survey year, and nearest concession fixed effects. Literacy is an indicator variable equal to 0 if the
respondent cannot read at all and 1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an index generated by the DHS
using principle component of asset ownership. Wealth Index is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where
1 is poorest quintile and 5 is richest quintile from the Wealth Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile
is measured for a subset of female respondents divides each respondent's height by her age and
finds her percentile in the entire sample. Similarly, Child Ht/Age Percentile was asked to a subset
of children and divides each child's height by his or her age and finds his or her percentile in the
entire sample. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Notes: The figure presents RD plots for our main outcomes and the mean value of each outcome variable at each 2.5 km bin along
the running variable (distance to concession border) as well as with a local linear trend estimated separately on each side of the
discontinuity. Each regression is estimated using the optimal bandwidth chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by
Cattaneo et al. (2020). Regressions controls for age, age squared, gender, survey year, and include a nearest concession fixed effect.

bandwidth selection procedures, and kernels (e.g uniform, triangular, and Epanechnikov). In

Appendix C.6 we show that the results are robust to using local quadratic polynomials. We also

test robustness to latitude and longitude specifications in Appendix C.7, where we modify f (.)

in equation (1) to be a function of latitude and longitude.

    A second potential issue is that the DHS randomly displaces the coordinates of the clusters

in order to maintain the confidentiality of the respondents. The GPS coordinates are displaced

by up to 5 km for all urban clusters and 99% of rural clusters, and up to 10 km for 1% of rural

clusters. Importantly, this displacement is random and induces classical measurement error. This

would bias our coefficient towards zero. However, with the regression discontinuity approach,


                                                                                                                                        19
one might be concerned that the results are being driven by clusters right along the border

that might be incorrectly assigned to inside or outside the concession because of the random

displacement. Thus, we estimate our regression discontinuity results with a "donut-hole" of 10

kms (the maximum possible displacement) in Appendix C.8 and find that the results are robust

to excluding observations close to the border.

   A third possible concern is that because the concession borders were drawn using major river

basins as the salient geographic feature for the borders, the results may reflect some inherent

characteristic of river basins, rather than exposure to the concessions. To assess this claim, in Ap-

pendix D we conduct a falsification exercise where we run our main specification across all major

river basins in DRC and show that the estimated effects for the former concessions are larger and

more negative than the estimated effects for most of the other major river basins in DRC. The

falsification exercise presents important evidence that the results are not a consequence of the

concessions being drawn using river basins, but instead suggests that our estimates represent the

impact of exposure to rubber concessions. Additionally, to address concerns that the concession

borders may have been manipulated, Appendix D shows the estimated effects are similar when

we use the relevant basin borders and a 25 km buffer as an instrument for being inside the former

concessions.

   In Appendix C, we show our results are robust to the following additional robustness tests. We

analyze the results: looking at each concession individually to ensure that the results are not being

driven by one particular concession (C.9); without covariates (e.g. gender, age, and age squared)

(C.10); with Conley standard errors (C.11); at the DHS cluster level, rather than the individual

level since assignment to treatment occurs at the village level (C.12); dropping observations along

the Congo river to address concerns that villages along the Congo river are different than those

farther away from the river (C.13); and dropping one DHS cluster at a time (C.14). In Appendix

E we find no evidence of differential missionary presence or subsequent colonial investment, and

in Appendix I, we examine the relationship between the concessions and road network density,

population density, nighttime lights, and conflict.

   Finally, in Appendix I we present two additional complementary analyses. First, in I.4 we

examine the correlation between intensity of exposure to the rubber concessions ­ as measured

by year a post is constructed and the number of tons of rubber collected at that post ­ and our

key outcomes of interest. We find that greater intensity of exposure is negatively correlated with


                                                 20
education, wealth, and health. We also test whether there appears to be convergence in outcomes

overtime across age cohorts in I.5. We find no evidence for convergence.


3.5. Analysis for All Concessions

We have found that those individuals from the former Abir and Anversoise concession areas have

lower levels of education, wealth, and health today. Given that other concessions were granted

during the CFS era, it is natural to examine the broader implications of the concession system for

the development of DRC.

  In Appendix J, we present RD results for education, wealth, and health examining all conces-

sions granted in DRC as of 1904 (see Figure 1 for a map of all of the concession boundaries). We

present results pooling all of the concessions as well as results excluding Abir and Anversoise.

We find that across all concessions in DRC, individuals experience worse education, wealth, and

health outcomes. The coefficients are always negative, though sometimes not significant when

Abir and Anversoise are excluded. Given that the 60% of DRC's landmass that was formally part

of a concession, wealth would be about 30% higher had they not been part of a concession. While

these estimates are unlikely to be causal, given that these other concession boundaries correspond

with present day political boundaries and have different histories than Abir and Anversoise, they

are suggestive of the detrimental long-run legacy of the concession system.


4. Testing Mechanisms with Fieldwork

4.1. Conceptual Framework

Our analysis so far has documented lasting negative effects of the rubber concessions granted

in Northern Congo on development outcomes. These concessions were characterized by indirect

rule, violence, and no productive investment ­ characteristics that were common across the many

concessions granted during the colonial era (Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1972, Vangroenweghe, 2006).

However, the concessions only lasted 14 years; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms

through which the negative effects of the rubber concessions persist.

  Our conceptual framework consists of three main premises and is informed by the recent

theoretical literature on how institutions and culture matter for development (e.g. Bisin and

Verdier, 2017, Acemoglu and Robinson, 2019, Nunn, 2020, Persson and Tabellini, 2020). This


                                               21
literature takes as a starting point that institutions are an important factor for explaining economic

development (e.g. North, 1990, Acemoglu et al., 2001). However, a key insight from this emerging

literature is that one cannot understand historical persistence by focusing only on institutions;

rather, it is important to also understand how culture evolves and endogenously responds to

institutions. Informed by work from historians and oral histories, we apply these insights to our

setting and discuss conditions when the framework is most likely to be relevant.

   The first premise is that the rubber era undermined local institutions via the use of indirect

rule. A key aspect of the way the rubber concessions were able to function was through the

cooption of local leaders (Marchal, 1996, Harms, 1974, 1975, 1983, Stengers and Vansina, 1985).

Prior to the concession era, lineage headman held positions of authority and leadership within

communities. These leaders either cooperated with the rubber regime or were replaced by

individuals who would. As Stengers and Vansina (1985, p. 336) write, "Chiefs were auxiliary

agents of the state. They did not need to have any traditional legitimacy".

   Compliance with the rule of coopted leaders was achieved through extreme violence. This

violence was often perpetrated by armed sentries recruited from outside the area with the support

of European agents. Local institutions suffered, and leaders could no longer be relied upon to

protect the community or fulfill important leadership functions (Vangroenweghe, 1986, Harms,

1974).

   Thus, we will examine how local institutions differ inside the former concessions. Specifically,

we will examine how chiefs are selected ­ either hereditary or through elections ­ and whether

chiefs are responsible for public goods provision.

   The second premise of our conceptual framework is that cultural traits likely responded to

these changes in local institutions.19 Bisin and Verdier (2017) highlight that certain cultural

traits will respond endogenously to changes in institutions and that ex-ante, it is unclear how

culture may respond (see also Tabellini, 2008). Under certain conditions, changes in culture will

reinforce changes in local institutions, leading to persistence, while in others, cultural change will

counteract institutional change.20

   Historians have highlighted how villagers had to develop alternative coping mechanisms as

they faced a brutal rubber regime and local leaders who were unable to protect them (Harms,
  19Culture is generally defined as values and preferences that are internal to individuals in a society (Tabellini, 2008).
  20This insight is related to a growing literature on how institutions can affect culture (e.g. Guiso, Sapienza and
Zingales, 2004, Tabellini, 2010, Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales, 2016, Lowes, Nunn, Robinson and Weigel, 2017).

1974, Nelson, 1994, Marchal, 1996). The rubber period required communities to adapt and

cooperate in order to survive. In particular, there was an increased reliance on horizontal ties

(e.g. age sets) and mutual insurance. This allowed individuals to bypass corrupt and ineffective

elders who had been targeted by the rubber regime.21

   Changes in the political power structure may have led to important changes in cultural norms

related to pro-social behavior, cooperation, and trust. Therefore, we examine how pro-social

norms and behavior differ inside the former concessions.

   The final premise of the conceptual framework is that the interaction between institutions and

culture is important for understanding the long-run effects of the rubber era. As modeled in

Bisin and Verdier (2017), institutional quality and culture may act as substitutes, enforcing an

equilibrium of low institutional quality but more pro-social norms (see also Jha, 2013, Platteau,

2000).22 If culture and institutions are substitutes, stronger pro-social norms may undermine

long-run development if they allow less effective and less accountable local leaders to remain in

power. We explore correlational evidence consistent with this premise using fieldwork data.23

   We discuss when these mechanisms are likely to be present. Four main conditions appear

central. First, the conceptual framework applies to concessions characterized by indirect rule,

violence, and a focus on extraction. Second, violence was generally perpetrated by outsiders

­ either European agents or sentries recruited from outside of the region. Third, there was

minimal productive investment (unlike in Dell and Olken, 2020). The concessions granted across

large parts of sub-Saharan Africa generally met these three conditions (Coquery-Vidrovitch, 1972,

Vangroenweghe, 2006). Finally, initial state capacity is likely important. The Northern conces-

sions had little state centralization prior to colonization; anecdotally, ethnic groups with more

centralization (e.g. in the South of Congo) were better able to resist concession companies and

their violence (Stengers and Vansina, 1985). Additionally, the Congolese state since independence

has been weak and ineffective at projecting power outside of urban areas.
  21 For example, the rubber period was associated with an increase in cooperation among individuals of same age

grade. These "pacts of friendship and mutual aid between age-mates facilitated the social mobility required in the
search for rubber" (Nelson, 1994, p.110), as people were often forced to collect rubber in groups far away from their
village.
  22 As in Bisin and Verdier (2017), we view institutional change as a "myopic" short-run process. In contrast, culture

evolves more slowly over time, through socialization and cultural transmission.
  23 Bisin and Verdier (2017, p.38) write that their theoretical work "underlines the fact that the search for a unique

origin for long-term development can be quite an arduous and even sterile undertaking. Focusing more systematically
on the positive or negative interactions between culture and institutions along the development process might be more
fruitful in terms of historical understanding".

4.2. Data Collection

Existing data from DRC does not allow us to examine institutional or cultural mechanisms.

Therefore, we conducted surveys and collected experimental data in Gemena, DRC. Gemena

is the capital of Sud-Ubangi province and is situated near the border of the former Anversoise

concession. Gemena is inside the former concession boundary, but less than 10 km away from the

border. Gemena was created by colonial administrators in the mid-1920s, after the CFS period,

and therefore consists primarily of migrants from surrounding areas. Nearly all individuals in

our sample identify their "village of origin" as a village outside the town of Gemena. A "village

of origin" is the village where an individual's family or ancestors are from.24

   The data were collected between July and August 2015. We randomly sampled individuals

in Gemena for a total sample size of 520 individuals for the first visit and 484 for the second

visit. We divided our survey into two visits per household to avoid survey fatigue; the first visit

consisted of the main survey module and second visit consisted of lab experiments and a short

survey. Of those sampled, 49.71% percent identified their village of origin as being from inside the

boundaries of one of the former concessions and a total of 511 originate from villages within 200

kms of the former concession boundaries. Figure 5 presents a map of the locations of villages of

origin for our sample, the location of Gemena, and the borders of the former rubber concessions.

For more details on sampling and survey methods, see Appendix G.1.

   We use the data from the Gemena-based sample to compare individuals with ancestors from

inside the former concessions to those with ancestors from outside the former concessions. This

approach has two main advantages. First, logistically, it is considerably easier to work in one

main town rather than numerous villages in the area, as transportation infrastructure is of very

poor quality. Second, it allows us to more precisely identify cultural differences: by examining

individuals removed from their original institutional environments and who now share the same

institutional environment, any differences in behavior in experimental measures or responses to

survey questions are capturing differences in internalized cultural norms.25

   Individuals answered a series of questions on demographics, migration history, income, trust,

and beliefs. In addition to collecting individual level data, we ask respondents detailed questions
  24 This is a commonly understood concept in this area, and all respondents knew their village of origin. A village
of origin is not necessarily where an individual is born.
  25 This is the epidemiological approach as described by Fernández (2011). This approach was employed in e.g.

Lowes et al. (2017) and Alesina, Giuliano and Nunn (2013).

detail below.

   The survey data has multiple questions that could be used to test the hypotheses of interest.

We present all of our survey-based results using thematic indices that group related questions.

We follow Anderson (2008) and compute the inverse covariance weighted (ICW) index across

outcomes within an index. In Appendix G.7 we include coefficient plots of each of the individual

components of the index in addition to the estimated ICW index coefficient. As with the previous

RD analyses, we estimate equation (1).

   Summary statistics are presented in Appendix G.5 by whether an individual originates from

inside the former concession. On average, individuals from inside the concession have fewer

years of education and lower income than those from outside the concession, but these differ-

ences are not statistically significant. Additionally, there is no relationship between being from

inside the former concessions and being knowledgeable about one's village of origin, which

mitigates concerns about differential knowledge of villages of origin. A possible concern with

data collected in Gemena is differential selective migration based on whether an individual is


                                                                                                                             25
from the former concession area. In Appendix Table G3 we present mean differences on key

migration characteristics for individuals from inside and outside the former concessions. We find

very little evidence of differences in reasons for migration for individuals from inside and outside

the concession.26


4.3. Economic Development in Villages of Origin

We first examine whether villages of origin within the former concessions are less developed than

those just outside the former borders using our survey data from Gemena. This analysis is similar

to Section 3.3 where we use DHS data to test for differences in development outcomes. We asked

individuals about the public goods available in their villages of origin and their perception of the

relative wealth of their village of origin. Panel A of Table 3 presents the coefficients for two ICW

indices: an index of public goods available in the village of origin and an index of a respondent's

subjective measures of the development of their village of origin. All questions included in the

index and their response options are reported in the notes of the table. Villages within the former

concession are described as having fewer public goods and are rated as less developed.


4.4. Differences in Village Chief Selection and Performance

We turn to the first premise in the conceptual framework: the rubber era may have undermined

local institutional quality. The historical accounts of the rubber period and the oral histories from

individuals in Gemena suggest that the position of chief may have been affected by the rubber

period (Young, 1965, Vanhee, 2005). Today, village chiefs are tasked with organizing public good

maintenance and construction, resolving conflict, and welcoming outsiders. If the rubber regime

altered the accountability and quality of village chiefs, this could explain the worse development

outcomes we observe inside the former concessions.


Selection and Performance of Village Chiefs

Panel B of Table 3 presents the results on the chief selection mechanism. Chiefs in villages

inside the former rubber concessions are 35 percentage points less likely to be chosen by election.
  26 Because it is difficult to rule out selective migration with the Gemena sample we also corroborate our main
fieldwork findings using baseline data for another project that was collected from 300 villages in the region (Lowes,
Montero, Nunn and Robinson, 2016) in Appendix H.

 Notes: Standard errors are clustered at the origin village level. All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on
each side of the concession boundary and use a triangular kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure
suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Regressions include nearest concession fixed effects and control for age,
age squared and sex. Village Public Goods Index is a summary index for the following questions (with the number of components for
each question in brackets): (1) What material is the road in your village of origin made of? [2: 0=Sand, 1=Gravel or Pavement] (2) Is
your village of origin on a main road? (3) Does your village of origin have a secondary school? [2] (4) Does your village of origin have
a Health Dispensary? [2] (5) Does your village of origin have a Hospital? [2] (6) Does the water in your village of origin come from a
well? [2: 0=Spring water, 1=Well]. Village Subjective Ratings Index is a summary index for the following questions (with the number of
components for each question in brackets): (1) How would you rate the quality of the primary school in your village of origin? [5] (2)
How would you rate the quality of the secondary school in your village of origin? [5] (3) How would you rate the quality of the road
in your village of origin relative to other roads in the area? [5] (4) Relative to other villages in the area you have visited, how would
your rate your village of origin overall? [5] Chief Public Good Index is a summary index for the following questions: Is the chief in your
village of origin responsible for providing (1) road maintenance, (2) new roads, (3) school maintenance, (4) land allocation, (5) protection
of property rights, (6) tax collection, (7) jobs, (8) conflict arbitration, and (9) road brushing; all questions answered as a 0 to 2 categorical
variable where 0 is No, 1 is Partially, and 2 is Yes. Chief Elected is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the village chief of a respondent's
origin village is selected by elections. Respect for Local Authority Index is a summary index for the following questions: (1) How much
do you trust your village of origin chief? [4], (2) How much do you trust your sub-tribe chief? [4], (3) How satisfied are you with your
village of origin chief? [4], (4) Would you vote for your village of origin chief if there were an election held tomorrow? [2], (5) How
much confidence do you have in local chiefs? [4]. Chief IAT Score is the D-Score for the Implicit Association Test that asked respondents
to sort sounds of words related to local chief authority, where more positive values indicate a more positive implicit association with
local chiefs. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.




                                                                       27
Instead, they are more likely to be hereditary, i.e. chosen from a particular lineage within

the community. This lineage is known as the "ruling" lineage, and chiefs then tend to come

exclusively from this lineage.

   To examine whether there are differences in the quality of chiefs, we construct an index that

combines all questions on whether chiefs are responsible for providing specific public goods (and

their maintenance) in the villages of origin; a lower value on this index suggests chiefs are of lower

quality in the sense that they are not considered responsible for providing key public goods at

the village level. We find that chiefs inside the former concessions are responsible for providing

fewer public goods.


Respect for Chief Authority

An important consideration when examining differences in village institutions is to account for

differences in respect for authority. If respect for chief authority is lower inside the concessions

due to the rubber concession period, then local chiefs may be less able to organize productive

activities, resolve conflicts, and provide order, even if the chiefs themselves are of the same quality.

   To examine respect for village chief authority, we first construct an index of subjective survey

questions on confidence and trust in chiefs. We scale all variables so that more positive values

indicate greater respect for local chiefs. Because respondents may be unwilling to answer poten-

tially sensitive questions about local political figures truthfully, we also conducted a Single-Target

Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT) to measure implicit attitudes towards chiefs.27

   Panel C of Table 3 reports the estimates from these two different measures of respect for

authority. Individuals from inside the former concessions report that they respect chiefs more in

the subjective index, though the results are not statistically significant. Likewise, the IAT results

do not providence evidence of different levels of respect for authority. Overall, the measures of

respect for authority in Panel C suggest that the result of lower public goods provision by chiefs

inside the former concessions is not driven by lack of respect for authority.


4.5. Differences in Trust, Social Cohesion, Altruism, and Support for Sharing

The second premise of the conceptual framework is that the rubber regime led to changes in

cultural traits. The historical accounts suggest that exposure to the rubber regime affected a

series of important outcomes related to cooperation and sharing by increasing the importance

of and reliance on mutual insurance. We examine differences in trust, feeling of closeness with

others, and survey and experimental measures of support for sharing.


Trust in Others

We examine whether trust is different across the former concession borders in Panel A of

Table 4 by constructing an index of questions on how much individuals trust various people.28

The coefficients on trust inside the former concessions are positive and statistically significant,

suggesting that individuals from the former concessions are in fact more trusting than those

outside the former concessions. The coefficient plot for each question individually is presented in

Appendix G.7. We also ask respondents how close they feel to people to various groups of people.

We present the results on differences in closeness in Panel A of Table 4. We find that individuals

from the former concessions report feeling closer to a wide variety of other individuals.


Strength of Beliefs in Importance of Sharing

To test whether there are differences in beliefs in the importance of sharing, we first construct

an index of survey questions asking individuals whether they think it is appropriate to share

income in a variety of different situations. The index includes questions on whether you and

others should share income when it is earned by luck and when it is earned by work. We also

ask the respondent how they think people in their village of origin would respond to the same

series of questions to understand their expectations regarding the beliefs of others.

   Panel B of Table 4 present the estimates for each of these measures. Individuals from the

former concessions are more likely to agree that income should be shared with others. They are

also more likely to report that individuals in their villages of origin would also agree that income

should be shared. Individuals support sharing income regardless of whether it is earned by work

or luck and regardless of whether they are speaking about sharing their own income with others

or others sharing with them.

   We also collected experimental measures of support for sharing. Individuals in our sample

participated in a dictator game (DG) to measure altruism and in a reverse dictator game, to
   28 We chose these survey questions following work by Johnson and Mislin (2011) and Johnson and Mislin (2012)

who demonstrate that trust survey questions have a positive, robust correlation with experimental measures of trust
(i.e. amount sent in the trust game).

     Notes: Standard errors clustered at the origin village level. All regressions include a local linear specification
    estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary and use a triangular kernel. Optimal bandwidths
    are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms.
    Regressions include nearest concession fixed effects and control for age, age squared and sex. Trust Index is a
    summary index for the following questions: How much do you trust (1) people from your village of origin, (2)
    people of another tribe, (3) people of your own tribe, (4) people you meet for the first time, (5) your family, (6) your
    neighbors, (7) people of another nationality, and (8) people of your sub-tribe; all questions answered on a 0 (Not
    at All) to 4 (Completely) scale. Closeness to Others Index is a summary index for the following questions: (1) How
    close to you feel to people from your village of origin?, (2) How close to do you feel to people of Gemena?, (3) How
    close do you feel to people of your own tribe?, (4) How close do you feel to people of your age set from your origin
    village?, and (5) How close do you feel to people of your age set in Gemena?; all questions answered in a scale
    from 0 (Not Close at All) to 5 (Very Close). Sharing Norms Index is a summary index for the following questions:
    (1) If you get money from luck you should share it, (2) If you earn money from hard work you should share it, (3)
    If someone else earns money from luck they should share it, (4) If someone else earns money from hard work they
    should share it; all questions answered in a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Sharing Norms
    Index Village of Origin is a summary index for the following questions, where all questions start with "How much
    would someone from your village of origin agree with the following statements", for the same statements listed
    above. Dictator Game: Amount Shared measures the amount sent to an anonymous player 2 in the standard Dictator
    Game. Effort Task: Share Redistributed is the total share taken (weighted by the maximum budget amount possible
    to take) in the effort task from the anonymous player 1's earned income. It represents an experimental measure of
    respect for earned income property rights. Two individuals declined participating in the Dictator Game, and one
    additional individual declined participating in the Reverse Dictator Game. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

measure support for redistribution. In the standard DG, a player 1 is given an endowment and

is asked to allocate it between themselves and a player 2. The reverse DG differs in two key

ways from the standard DG. First, the player 1 earns an endowment by completing a task.29

Second, the player 2 is told how much the player 1 earned and is asked what share of the player

1's earned income they would like to keep for themselves. The amount player 2 decides to take

from Player 1's earned income therefore represents a measure of willingness to redistribute.30 See

Appendix G.2 for more details on the reverse DG with earned income, the protocols used, and a

description of the earnings task.

   Panel C of Table 4 presents the estimates for the experimental measures of altruism and

willingness to redistribute. We find no significant differences in amount sent in the dictator

game, thought the coefficient on inside concession is positive. For the reverse dictator game, we

find that individuals from the former concessions redistribute a larger share of the other player's

earned endowment to themselves. We interpret this as having greater support for redistribution,

consistent with the survey measures on sharing that suggest individuals think income should be

shared.31

   One implication of greater support for sharing income is that we would expect villages inside

the former concessions to have less income inequality. Consistent with greater support for sharing

income, in Appendix I.3, we find lower levels of income inequality, as measured by both the

standard deviation of the wealth score and the inter-quartile range of the wealth score, within

DHS clusters inside the former concessions.

   The results in Table 4 provide evidence that individuals from inside the former concessions

are more trusting, feel closer to others, believe it is important to share income, and redistribute

more in a reverse dictator game. The results all point to more pro-social beliefs and values within
   29 For the earnings task, we selected a task that could be easily understood by all respondents and for which more

effort was rewarded by more income. Subjects played a "clicking-game" on touch screen tablets. In this "clicking-
game," a small blue dot appears in a random location on the screen every three seconds and the respondent has one
second to push the dot before it disappears. Importantly, this effort task did not rely on physical strength or skill but
instead relied on concentration and perseverance. The game lasted five minutes and respondents were paid based
on the number of successful "clicks," earning 100 Congolese Francs (approximately $0.10) per 10 successful clicks.
Respondent were very engaged in the task and earned on average 700 CF in this task.
   30 Variation (i) of the DG has been used before by Hoffman, McCabe, Shachat and Smith (1994) and Cherry, Frykblom

and Shogren (2002); subjects tend to be much less generous when they earned their own income, which Farh and
Irlenbusch (2000) refer to as earned property rights. Variation (ii) on its own changes the standard DG to what is known
as a Reverse DG, which has been used many times before (List, 2007). Jakiela (2011) combines these two variations to
get a measure of respect for earned property rights and finds that subjects in the US tend to others' respect earned
income much more than subjects in Kenya.
   31 Work by Platteau (2000) discusses how there may be a dark side to sharing and redistribution norms. For example,

they can dampen incentives for investment.

the former concessions.

   Note, our priors before data collection had been that the rubber concessions may have led

to both worse institutions and less pro-social norms. These priors were informed by work by

Nunn and Wantchekon (2011), who find that the slave trade undermined trust. Thus, while

potentially surprising, our results are in line with recent work by Bauer et al. (2016), who review

findings from 16 post-conflict settings and have found that individuals exposed to conflict are

more pro-social because they are more dependent on local informal systems of risk-sharing and

insurance.32 Our results suggest that in response to weakened institutions and violence, cultural

traits related to cooperation and mutual aid changed.


4.6. Discussion of Results

An important question is: how do the changes in institutions and culture lead to a low-

development equilibrium? Of course, this cannot be directly tested in our data, but a compelling

explanation underlying our conceptual framework is that these changes in institutional quality

and culture reinforce each other: chiefs are held less accountable and allowed to stay in power

since individuals do not rely on their formal institutions as much and instead rely on informal

sharing norms for support. Indeed, consistent with the conceptual framework, in Appendix

Figure I1, we find a negative correlation between pro-social norms and a chief's provision of

public goods; a positive correlation between chief's provision of public goods and wealth; and

a negative correlation between pro-social norms and wealth. We interpret this as suggestive

evidence that more pro-social norms serve as a substitute for better quality institutions.

   Our fieldwork data also lets us explore whether the cultural changes on their own are sufficient

to lead to low development outcomes, or whether they only lead to less development when paired

with low quality local institutions. We do this by comparing first and second generation migrants

from in and outside the concessions. These individuals are removed from their village institutions

and share a common institutional environment presently.

   We first explore whether migrants converge in terms of development outcomes when they

share a common institutional environment in Figure 6. We find differences in education and
   32 This finding is also related to the "tend-and-befriend" hypothesis in psychology, which suggests people build

alliances during times of stress (see von Dawans et al., 2012).

income that are quite stark if we look only at first generation migrants.33 However, if we examine

second generation or higher migrants separately, we find convergence in these outcomes.

                   We then turn to the cultural outcomes. The results in Figure 6 suggest that both first and

second generation migrants exhibit more pro-social norms. This has important implications for

understanding if our observed effects are "place" or "person" specific. It suggests that removing

individuals (and their cultural norms) from the former concession areas actually leads to relatively

quick convergence in education and wealth outcomes.

Notes: Figure presents estimates from estimating specification (1) for the sub-sample for first-generation migrants (in red) and second-
generation or higher migrants (in blue) to Gemena. Data is from the survey conducted in Gemena. Pro-social norm indexes are
defined as in Table 4. Educational Attainment is a 0 to 3 categorical variable, where 0=No schooling, 1=Primary Schooling, 2=Secondary
Schooling, and 3=Post-Secondary Schooling. Standard errors clustered at the origin village level. Figure presents 95% and 90%
confidence intervals (with and without transparency, respectively). Regressions include nearest concession fixed effects and control
for age, age squared, sex, latitude and longitude. All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on each side
of the concession boundary and use a triangular kernel using a 100 km bandwidth from the former concession borders.




5. Conclusion

We examine how exposure to the concession system, which was characterized by violence and

indirect rule, has shaped the development of areas of Congo. The rubber concession period was

characterized by its extreme brutality and violence and the use of local leaders to achieve rubber

production quotas. We provide micro-level evidence on how these common colonial "treatments"

­ concessions, violence, and indirect rule ­ matter for understanding the comparative develop-

ment of sub-Saharan Africa.

                   This study documents that former rubber concession areas have lower levels of education,

wealth, and health than areas outside of the concessions. A likely mechanism is that inside the

former concessions, chiefs are less likely to be elected, are more likely to be hereditary, and
  33                     Interestingly, the differences are of very similar magnitude to the DHS results we present in Section 3.3.


                                                                                                                                         33
provide fewer public goods. Despite the negative effects on development and local institutions,

we also find evidence that individuals inside the former concessions are more pro-social.

   The results highlight that even a short exposure to extractive institutions can have a meaningful

impact on the development of an area, particularly when local institutions are integrated into

supporting the extraction. It is important to keep in mind our counterfactual; most of Congo was

exposed to various forms of violence and colonial extraction. Thus we are capturing the effect of

relatively greater exposure, suggesting that we are providing a lower bound of an effect relative

to no extraction.

   We present the first quantitative evidence on the effects of this common form of economic

organization and on an important historical event. These results suggest that concessions, where

private companies are given state-like powers for the purpose of generating profit, can have

significant and negative long term consequences. These results have important implications for

the development of the DRC and other parts of Africa, much of which was granted as concessions

during the colonial era.

Appendix A. Data Sources and Variable Definitions


A.1. Geographic Data and Variables
  · Elevation: The elevation data is provided by the Global Climate Database created by
    Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones and Jarvis (2005) and available at http://www.worldclim.
    org/. This data provides elevation information in meters at the 30 arc-second resolution
    (approximately at the 1 km2 level near the equator). The elevation measure is constructed
    using NASAs SRTM satellite images (http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/). Our paper's ele-
    vation variable calculates the mean elevation for each 20 km by 20 km grid cell in meters.34

  · Precipitation: Precipitation data is provided by the Global Climate Database created by
    Hijmans et al. (2005) and available at http://www.worldclim.org/. This data provides
    monthly average rainfall in millimeters. We calculate the average rainfall for each month for
    each 20 km by 20 km grid cell and average this over the twelve months to obtain our yearly
    precipitation measure in millimeters of rainfall per year. We also construct the standard
    deviation of rainfall over the twelve months to obtain our measure for the variation in
    rainfall in millimeters of rainfall per year.

  · Soil Suitability: Soil suitability is the soil component of the land quality index created
    by the Atlas of the Biosphere available at http://www.sage.wisc.edu/iamdata/ used in
    Michalopoulos (2012) and Ramankutty, Foley, Norman and McSweeney (2002). This data
    uses soil characteristics (namely soil carbon density and the acidity or alkalinity of soil)
    and combines them using the best functional form to match known actual cropland area
    and interpolates this measure to be available for most of the world at the 0.5 degree in
    latitude by longitude level. (The online appendix in Michalopoulos (2012) provides a
    detailed description of the functional forms used to create this dataset.) This measure is
    normalized to be between 0 and 1, where higher values indicate higher soil suitability for
    agriculture. Our Soil Suitability variable measures the average soil suitability in each 20km
    by 20km grid cell to provide a measure of soil suitability that also ranges between 0 and 1,
    with higher values indicate higher soil suitability for agriculture.

  · Ruggedness: We use the measure of terrain ruggedness created by Nunn and Puga (2012).
    This data uses elevation and constructs a terrain ruggedness index as the square root of the
    sum of the squared differences in elevation between a central point and the eight adjacent
    points on a grid of 30 arc-seconds. Our ruggedness variable measures the average terrain
    ruggedness (normalized by 1000) in each 20km by 20km grid cell to provide a measure of
    ruggedness, with higher values indicate higher terrain ruggedness.

  · Rivers and Navigable Rivers: The Referentiel Geographique Commun, an online repository for
    GIS maps for DRC, provides shape files for the DRC on all rivers and navigable rivers in
    DRC as of 2010. Our variables Access to Navigable Rivers and Access to any River are indicator
    variables equal to one if the 20 km by 20 km grid cell contains a navigable river or any river,
    respectively Navigable River Density is defined as total length in meters of navigable rivers
    in each grid divided by the grid's surface area in kilometers squared.

  · Malaria Suitability: Malaria data uses the Malaria Ecology index created by Kiszewski,
    Mellinger, Spielman, Malaney, Sachs and Sachs (2004). The index was created by Kiszewski
    et al. (2004) to approximate the prevalence of severe forms of malaria, and adjusts for the
 34   See Figure B7 for a Map of the Grid Cells.



                                                   7
     mosquito type that is most prevalent in a region. We calculate the average of this measure
     for each 20km by 20km grid cell to provide a malaria suitability.

   · Tsetse Fly Suitability: The tsetse suitability index (TSI) is from Alsan (2015). The TSI
     is measured as the Z-score of the potential steady-state tsetse fly population constructed
     using global climate data. We calculate the average of this measure for each 20km by 20km
     grid cell to provide a measure of Tsetse Fly Suitability.

   · Distance to Kinshasa: We calculate the euclidean distance (in kms) from the centroid of
     each 20km by 20km grid cell to Kinshasa, the capital city of DRC.

   · Distance to the Coast: We calculate the euclidean distance (in kms) from the centroid of
     each 20km by 20km grid cell to the ocean.

A.2. DHS Survey Data and Variables
Survey data on development outcomes for individuals is provided by the 2007 DHS survey on
the DRC implemented by The DHS Program with the help of the DRC Ministry of Planning. The
fieldwork was carried out from January 2007-August 2007 and sampled 9995 women between
the ages of 15-49 and 4757 men between the ages of 15-59. The survey provides detailed
information on education, assets, and health outcomes for individuals in multiple villages.As
well, the DHS 2007 DRC survey provides GPS coordinates for each village (i.e. clusters in the
survey); these coordinates are displaced by up to 5km for all urban clusters, and 99% of rural
clusters and up to 10 km for 1% of rural clusters. Importantly, this displacement is random,
and simply induces classical measurement error. The survey data and detailed information on
the sampling procedure and variable definitions is available at http://dhsprogram.com/data/
Data-Variables-and-Definitions.cfm. Below we explain the variable definitions for the variables
used in this paper from the DHS 2007 DRC survey:

   · Years of Education: For each individual surveyed, the DHS survey asks the individual the
     total number of years of education in single years.

   · Literacy: Literacy is a 0 to 1 indicator variable for each individual where 0 is "cannot read
     at all", and 1 is "able to read only parts of a sentence" or "able to read a whole sentence".

   · Wealth Factor Score: Wealth Factor Score is an index generated by the DHS using principle
     component analysis on asset ownership for each individual. For the log of the wealth factor
     score, we define it as Log(Wealth Score) = Log(Wealth Factor Score + min(Wealth Factor Score) +
     1).

   · Wealth Index: Wealth Index is a is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where 1 is poorest quintile
     and 5 is richest quintile (in the entire DRC 2007 sample) from the Wealth Factor Score.

The DHS survey runs a survey instrument on health behavior to a subsample of the sampled
female population (about a third of the entire sample). The following variables are only defined
for this subsample:

   · Respondent Ht/Age Percentile: The aforementioned subsample of the female population
     measures respondent's height (cms) and weight (kgs). Respondent Ht/Age Percentile
     divides each respondent's height by their age and determines the percentile for this measure
     relative to the entire subsample. This index is then normalized by the DHS to be within 0
     and 10000.


                                                 8
A.3. Colonial Data and Variables
  · Missionary Stations in 1897: Missionary post locations in 1897 is from a map in Rouck
    (1945). This map contains missionary post locations for 1897 and was digitized in ArcGIS.
    Our variable Number of Missionary Stations in 1897 is defined as the total number of mission-
    ary stations in 1897 located in each 20 km by 20 km grid cell.

  · Missionary Stations in 1924: Missionary post location in 1924 is from Nunn (2010) and is
    available at http://scholar.harvard.edu/nunn/pages/data- 0 in the form of a GIS shapefile.
    This shapefile was created by Nathan Nunn by digitizing maps from "Ethnographic Survey
    of Africa: Showing the Tribes and Languages; also the Stations of Missionary Societies" published
    by Roome (1924). Our variable Number of Missionary Stations in 1924 is defined as the total
    number of missionary stations in 1924 located in each 20 km by 20 km grid cell.

  · Missionary Stations in 1953: Missionary post location in 1953 is from a map in the
    Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer (1954). This map contains missionary post
    locations for 1953 and was digitized in ArcGIS. Our variable Number of Missionary Stations
    in 1953 is defined as the total number of missionary stations in 1953 located in each 20 km
    by 20 km grid cell.

  · Telecommunication Stations in 1953: Telecommunication Station locations in 1953 are from
    a map in the Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer (1954). This map contains telecom-
    munication post locations for 1953 and was digitized in ArcGIS. Our variable Number of
    Telecommunication Stations in 1953 is defined as the total number of Telecommunication
    stations in 1953 located in each 20 km by 20 km grid cell.

  · Health Centers in 1953: Health center location in 1953 for the DRC is from the Académie
    Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer (1954). The Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer
    (1954) includes a map with missionary post locations for 1953 that was digitized in ArcGIS.
    Our variable Number of Health Centers in 1953 is defined as the total number of health centers
    in 1953 located in each 20 km by 20 km grid cell.

  · Road Network Density in 1968: Maps outlining the road network in 1968 for the DRC are
    available at the UT Map Library (Perry-Castaneda Map Collection), specifically the Africa
    Map Series made by the Army Map Service, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army. This series
    was made in 1968 using the best available sources at the time, and is available at http://
    www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/africa/africa_index.html. The DRC maps and roads were
    digitized in ArcGIS. Our Road Network Density in 1968 variable is defined as total length in
    meters of roads in 1968 in each 20 km by 20 km grid divided by the grid's total surface area
    in kilometers squared.

A.4. Precolonial Data and Variables
  · Number Enslaved (Atlantic Trade): We use data from Nunn and Wantchekon (2011) on the
    number of individuals enslaved (in 1000s) from each ethnic group ­ where ethnic groups
    are defined using maps from Murdock (1959) ­ during the Atlantic slave trade.

  · Precolonial Data: Precolonial data are from the Ethnographic Atlas created by Murdock
    (1967). Note that not all ethnic groups have data for pre-colonial information (and many
    groups are missing information for some variables), so the sample size for these variables is
    small for our area of interest. The variables we use are the following:




                                                 9
       ­ Population Density: Population data are estimated by Murdock (1959) for African
         ethnic groups. Population density is presented as the mean size of the local community
         (v30) provided in bins equal to: <50, 50-99, 100-199, 200-399, 400-1,000, 1,000-5,000,
         5,000-50,000, and more than 50,000. We follow Alsan (2015) as use her measure
         of population density for each group, defined as logarithm (inhabitants per square
         kilometer).
       ­ Centralization: Centralization is defined as in Alsan (2015): an indicator variable equal
         to one if there are > 1 level of hierarchy above the local authority (v33) in Murdock
         (1967).
       ­ Hereditary Local Headman Selection: Hereditary Local Headman Selection is defined
         as an indicator variable equal to one if the succession to the office of local headman
         (v72) is through either the patrilineal heir or the matrilineal heir. (However, note that

       ­ Polygynous: Polygynous is defined as an indicator variable equal to one if the Do-
         mestic Organization (v8) is said to be "Polygynous: unusual co-wives pattern" or
         "Polygynous: usual co-wives pattern" in Murdock (1967).

A.5. Road Network Data and Variables
  · Road Density The Referentiel Geographique Commun also provides a GIS shapefile on the
    road network in the DRC as of 2010. Our Road Density variable is defined as total length
    in meters of roads in each 20 km by 20 km grid divided by the grid's total surface area in
    kilometers squared.

  · Bridges The Referentiel Geographique Commun provides a GIS shapefile on the location of all
    bridges in the DRC as of 2010. Our Number of Bridges variable is defined as the total number
    of bridges located in each 20 km by 20 km grid cell.

Note: The figures below are spatial RD plots. Each figure plots the geographic scatterplot of the
DHS clusters, each shaded with the mean value in each cluster of the outcome variable of interest.
The background shows predicted values for a finely spaced grid of longitude-latitude coordinates
from a regression using a linear polynomial in latitude and longitude and the RubberConcession
indicator variable. Darker values represent worse development outcomes and vice-versa.35




  35We present results using the linear polynomial in latitude and longitude for simplicity, comparability to other
work, and as a complement the RD plots presented using the local linear in distance to the border specifications.

Appendix C. Robustness Tables

C.1. DHS Summary Statistics
Table C1 presents simple differences in means inside and outside the concession areas for vari-
ables from the DHS. We restrict our analysis for these differences in means to observations that
are within 200 kms of the rubber concession borders in order to compare relatively similar areas.
Simply comparing differences in means, it appears that the concession areas are less educated,
less wealthy, and have worse health outcomes than the areas just outside the concession borders.
We have also examined these differences in means between areas inside the former concessions
and areas outside the concessions for bandwidths of 100 kms and 50 kms and for all DHS clusters
in the DRC. The summary statistics are generally consistent with Table C1.

            Notes: The data are from the DHS 2007 and 2014 DRC surveys. Standard errors are clustered
            at the DHS cluster level. There are 109 clusters within 200 kms of the historical rubber borders.
            Educational Attainment is a 0 to 3 categorical variable where 0 is no education and 3 is higher
            education. Literacy is a 0 to 2 categorical variable where 0 is cannot read at all and 2 is able to read
            a whole sentence. Wealth Factor is an index generated by the DHS using principle component of
            asset ownership. Wealth Index is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where 1 is poorest quintile and
            5 is richest quintile from the Wealth Factor Score. Ht/Age Percentile divides each respondent's
            height by their age and finds their percentile in the sample and normalizes this percentile to be
            within 0 and 10000. The DHS only records respondent's height and weight for a subsample of
            the female population. Child Ever Vaccinated is an indicator variable equal to one if the child has
            ever received a vaccination. Child Ht/Age Percentile divides each children's height by their age
            and finds their percentile in the sample and normalizes this percentile to be within 0 and 10000.

 Notes: The unit of observation is a 20 by 20 km grid cell. Columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 give the mean of the corresponding variable. Columns 3 and 6 give the Conley (1999) spatial standard
error assuming a cut-off window of 50 kms. Inside and Outside indicate whether a grid cell is inside or outside the former rubber concession area respectively. Columns 7 and 8 give
the estimated RD coefficient and Conley (1999) spatial standard error for the corresponding variable as its outcome using a local linear specification estimated separately on each side
of the concession boundary. Regressions include a nearest concession fixed effect. The RD MSE optimal bandwidth is determined using the procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al.
(2020). Column 7 uses the average of all optimal bandwidths (39.30 kms). Variable definitions and data sources used in this analysis are described in detail in Appendix A. * p < 0.10,

 Notes: The unit of observation is a 20 by 20 km grid cell. Columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 give the mean of the corresponding variable. Columns 3 and 6 give the wild bootstrap p-values
clustered at the territory level with 500 repetitions for the differences in means. Inside and Outside indicate whether a grid cell is inside or outside the former rubber concession
area respectively. Columns 7 and 8 give the estimated RD coefficient and wild bootstrap p-value, respectively, usingthe corresponding variable as its outcome using a local linear
specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary. Regressions include a nearest concession fixed effect. The RD MSE optimal bandwidth is determined
using the procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020). Column 7 uses the average of all optimal bandwidths (39.30 kms). Variable definitions and data sources used in this
analysis are described in detail in Appendix A. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.




C.4. Balance Table at DHS Cluster Level
Table C4 presents the estimates for differences in geographic characteristics for the DHS clusters
in the sample instead of at the grid cell level as in Section 3.2. As in Table 1, there are no significant
differences in the main geographic variables of interest for our baseline specification.

 Notes: The unit of observation is a DHS cluster for the 2007 and 2014 DRC DHS Surveys. Columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 give the mean of the corresponding variable. Columns 3 and 6 present
robust standard errors. Inside and Outside indicate whether a grid cell is inside or outside the former rubber concession area respectively. Columns 7 and 8 give the estimated RD
coefficient and standard error that uses the corresponding variable as its outcome using a local linear specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary
and use a triangular kernel. Regressions include a nearest concession fixed effect. The RD MSE optimal bandwidth is determined using the procedure suggested by Cattaneo et

 Notes: The unit of observation is a DHS cluster for the 2007 and 2014 DRC DHS Surveys. Columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 give the mean of the corresponding variable. Columns 3 and 6
present Conley (1999) spatial standard error assuming a cut-off window of 50 kms. Inside and Outside indicate whether a grid cell is inside or outside the former rubber concession
area respectively. Columns 7 and 8 give the estimated RD coefficient and and Conley (1999) spatial standard error for the corresponding variable as its outcome using a local linear
specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary. Regressions include a nearest concession fixed effect. The RD MSE optimal bandwidth is determined
using the procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020). Column 7 uses the average of all optimal bandwidths (99.05 kms). Variable definitions and data sources used in this analysis
are described in detail in Appendix A. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. All regressions include a local linear specification
estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary. Regressions control for age, age squared
and gender, and nearest concession fixed effects. Regressions use a triangular kernel following Cattaneo et
al. (2020). Figure shows point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. All regressions include a local quadratic
specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary. Regressions control for age,
age squared and gender, and nearest concession fixed effects. Regressions use a triangular kernel following
Cattaneo et al. (2020). Figure shows point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

respondents divides each respondent's height by her age and finds her percentile in the entire

height by his or her age and finds his or her percentile in the entire sample. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05,

 Notes: Standard errors are Conley (1999) spatial standard errors assuming a cut-off window of
50 kms. All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on each side of
the concession boundary. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure
suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Regressions control for average age,
age squared, gender, survey year, and nearest concession fixed effect. Literacy is an indicator
variable equal to 0 if the respondent cannot read at all and 1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an
index generated by the DHS using principle component of asset ownership. Wealth Index is a
1 to 5 categorical variable where 1 is poorest quintile and 5 is richest quintile from the Wealth
Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile is measured for a subset of female respondents divides each
respondent's height by her age and finds her percentile in the entire sample. Similarly, Child
Ht/Age Percentile was asked to a subset of children and divides each child's height by his or her
age and finds his or her percentile in the entire sample. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

  Notes: Sample excludes observations within 25 kms of the Congo River. Standard errors clustered
at the DHS cluster level. All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on
each side of the concession boundary and use a triangular kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen
using the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms.
Regressions control for average age, age squared, gender, survey year, and nearest concession
fixed effect. Literacy is an indicator variable equal to 0 if the respondent cannot read at all and
1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an index generated by the DHS using principle component of asset
ownership. Wealth Index is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where 1 is poorest quintile and 5 is richest
quintile from the Wealth Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile is measured for a subset of female
respondents divides each respondent's height by her age and finds her percentile in the entire
sample. Similarly, Child Ht/Age Percentile was asked to a subset of children and divides each child's
height by his or her age and finds his or her percentile in the entire sample. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05,
*** p < 0.01.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. All regressions include a local quadratic specifi-
cation estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary estimated within the MSE-minimizing
bandwidth from Cattaneo et al. (2020). Regressions control for age, age squared and gender, and nearest
concession fixed effects. Figure shows point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. All regressions include a local quadratic specifi-
cation estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary estimated within the MSE-minimizing
bandwidth from Cattaneo et al. (2020). Regressions control for age, age squared and gender, and nearest
concession fixed effects. Figure shows point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

Notes: The figure shows RD plots for our main covariates and present the mean value of each outcome variable at each 2.5 km bin
along the running variable (distance to concession border) as well as with a local linear trend estimated separately on each side of the
discontinuity. Each regression is estimated using the optimal bandwidth chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by
Cattaneo et al. (2020). Regressions control for survey year, and include a nearest concession fixed effect. Standard errors are clustered

Appendix D. Basin Falsification Exercise

This section explains the basin falsification and basin IV exercises discussed in Section 3.4We
first describe the HydroBASINS data and the algorithm used in the construction of the river
basin shapefiles. Second, we explain how the falsification exercise was implemented, and present
the falsification results. Third, we use the HydroBASINS basins corresponding to the concession
basins and present results using these basins and a 25 buffer around them as an IV for being inside
the former concessions (and present placebo basin buffers and show the results are strongest for
the 25 km buffer, consistent with the way the concessions were defined).

D.1. River Basin Data
The data used in the falsification exercise is from Lehner and Grill (2013).36 The data used is
called the "HydroBASINS" data. This data provides a set of polygon shapefile layers that depict
  36   The data is available online at www.hydrosheds.org.


                                                                                                                                          45
watershed boundaries and delineate sub-basins at a global scale.
    The significant innovation in this data is the sub-basin delineation procedure. Two important
features required for a consistent mapping of river basins at a global scale are (1) a consistent
method for sub-basin breakdown, i.e. the decision of when and how to subdivide a larger basin
into multiple tributary basins, and (2) a method for grouping sub-basins together. For example,
take the Mongala river basin in this paper, which defined the limits of the Anversoise river
concession. The Mongala River basin is part of the larger Congo River basin, but also constitutes
its own sub-basin, the Mongala River Basin.
    The HydroBASINs data proceeds as follows for sub-basin breakdown. First, it breaks out sub-
watersheds at any confluence where the inflowing branches (i.e., a tributary and its main stem)
exceed a certain size threshold. In particular, hydroSHEDs divides a basin into two sub-basins at
every location where two river branches meet which each have an individual upstream area of at
least 100 km2 (Lehner and Grill, 2013).
    The second critical feature of the HydroSHEDs data is the way the sub-basins are grouped or
coded to allow for the breakout of nested sub-basins at different scales. The "Pfafstetter" coding
system is used due to its relative simplicity and ease of application. Pfafstetter coding in this case
means that a larger basin is sequentially subdivided into 9 smaller units (the 4 largest tributaries,
coded with even numbers, and the 5 inter-basins, coded with odd numbers). Thus, the next finer
resolution of a sub-basin delineation is achieved at the next Pfafstetter level by adding one digit
to the code of the previous level as depicted in the Figure D1 from Lehner and Grill (2013). The
HydroBASINS data uses the Pfafstetter coding system for 12 levels globally.

D.2. Falsification Exercise: Implementation
One possible concern with the results presented in Section 3.3 is that because the concession
borders were drawn using major river basins, the results may reflect some inherent characteristic
of river basins, rather than exposure to the concessions. To assess this claim, we conduct a
falsification exercise where we run our main specification across all major river basins in DRC
using the HydroBASINS data from Lehner and Grill (2013) to examine how our estimated effects
for the former concessions correspond to the estimated effects for all other major river basins in
DRC.




              Figure D1: Example of the Pfafstetter Coding used in HyrdroBASINS


                                                 46
   In particular, we re-run our main analysis using all other river basin limits from HydroBASINS
that are of similar size and importance as our two main river basins. Specifically, the river basins
corresponding to Anversoise and ABIR concession boundaries are level 5 and 6 river basins in
the HydroBASINS data, respectively. Thus, the falsification exercise uses all level 5 and level 6
HydroBASINS layers to only consider river basins of similar size and importance to the main
basins of interest.
   We take all of these river basins ­ excluding the basins corresponding to Anversoise and ABIR
concession boundaries ­ and use the DRC DHS 2007 and 2014 to calculate distance to each basin
and whether or not a DHS observation falls within the river basin polygon. We exclude all DHS
observations in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi since Kinshasa and Lubumbashi ­ the two largest cities
in DRC ­ are major outliers in the DHS data. We then estimate our two specifications. (1) Our
baseline specification ­ local linear in distance to the borders estimated separately on each side
­ within a bandwidth of 25 km (the average optimal bandwidth across all basins), our preferred
specification as detailed in Section 3.2. (2) to complement the specification using distance to the
border, we also show our results using a parsimonious linear latitude-longitude RD specification
­ linear latitude-longitude ­ within a bandwidth of 100 km from the river basin border that
includes controls for age, age-squared, gender, survey-year fixed effects and district fixed effects.
The district fixed effects serve as border-segment fixed effects. The advantage of using districts
fixed effects as border-segment fixed effects is that we can construct border-segment fixed effects
for all of DRC in a non-arbitrary manner.
   As the dependent variables for the analysis, we use years of education and the log of the wealth
score. We limit our analysis to river basins that have at least five DHS clusters within the basin
so that the RD estimate is well-estimated, leaving us with 29 river basins in total. We record the
RD estimates for each of these river basins and present them visually in the next section below.
   Figure D4a presents a map of all level 5 river basins in DRC and Figure D4b presents a map
of all level 6 river basins in DRC from the HydroBASINS data. Figure D5 presents a map of the
HydroBASINS river basins corresponding to the ABIR and Anversoise concessions along with
the actual concession borders. It shows that both boundaries are roughly similar, consistent with
Section 2 on how these concession boundaries were drawn.37

D.3. Falsification Exercise: Results
Figure D2 presents the empirical cumulative distribution of the RD estimates for education for
all major river basins in DRC, excluding the basins corresponding to the Anversoise and ABIR
concession boundaries. On average, being inside a river basin is associated with more years of
education and higher asset wealth. To highlight where the corresponding RD estimates for ABIR
and Anversoise would fall relative to these estimated basin effects, we include in solid-red the
RD estimate corresponding to the ABIR concession border and in dashed-blue the RD estimate
corresponding to the Anversoise concession border. The Anversoise estimate falls in the bottom
2.5% of this river basin RD estimate distribution for both outcomes of interest, while ABIR falls in
the 0.05% and 0.10% of the distributions for log wealth score and years of education, respectively,
when using our baseline specification.
    We also present results using a linear latitude and longitude specification in Figure D3. The
results are very similar: the Anversoise estimate falls on the far-left of the distribution, and the
ABIR estimate is also on the far-left of the distribution and only a few of the river basin estimates
are more negative. In particular, the ABIR estimate falls in the bottom 3.44% of this river basin RD
  37 It is important to note that we wouldn't expect the borders to match the modern river basins as rivers can move
across decades, and the concession borders were drawn with imperfect maps at a time when the interior of DRC was
not mapped in great detail.

latitude and longitude specification.
    The results of this basin falsification exercise presents important evidence that the results
presented in Section 3.3 are not an artifact of the concessions being drawn using river basins,
but instead represent the impacts of the labor coercion during the rubber period.

D.4. Basins as Instruments: Implementation & Results
We use the data from Hydrobasins (Lehner and Grill, 2013) on the geographic extent of two
basins used to define the rubber concessions ­ the Mongala basin and the Maringa-Lopori basin ­
to create a prediction of the actual boundary line. We do this to address concerns that the actual
boundaries may have been manipulated. Figure D5 provides a map of the two relevant basins
and our concession borders.

                      Notes: The map shows the river basins outlines from Hy-
                      droBASINS corresponding to the river basins used the falsifica-
                      tion exercise. These correspond to all level 5 and level 6 river
                      basins for DRC with at least ten clusters in the DHS data for
                      DRC.



   Using this data, we calculate the distance from each DHS cluster to the two basins (with a 25
km buffer around the basins), and determine whether they fall inside or outside the basins. We
then estimate an instrumental variable specification, using "inside basin" as an instrument for the
actual classification (i.e. whether or not a cluster falls within the former concession boundaries).
Table D1 presents reduced-form RD estimates; Table D2 presents the IV estimates. Using these
basin borders, we find (i) that the basin classification is a strong predictor of whether or not a
DHS cluster falls within the concession borders, and (ii) the estimates effects are quite similar to
our main baseline estimates presented in Table 2: areas inside the former concession boundaries
tend to have lower education, wealth and less health outcomes.

D.5. Basins as Instruments: Using Placebo Basin Buffers
As a placebo test, we extend the analysis and re-calculate the reduced-form estimates using
several different "placebo" buffers around the two relevant basins. We present the results in
Figure D7. Consistent with the actual rule used to define the rubber concession borders, we find
that the largest negative effects occur precisely using the buffer the colonialists used to define the
concession borders (25 kms) and do not find similar negative estimates for other placebo buffers
(and generally tend to find positive estimated effects).

 Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. Regressions use distance to the
Mongala and Maringa-Lopori basin as defined by Hydrobasin (with a 25 km buffer around
each basin). All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on each
side of the basin boundary and use a triangular kernel. Regressions control for average age,
age squared, gender, survey year, and nearest concession fixed effect. Literacy is an indicator
variable equal to 0 if the respondent cannot read at all and 1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an
index generated by the DHS using principle component of asset ownership. Wealth Index is a
1 to 5 categorical variable where 1 is poorest quintile and 5 is richest quintile from the Wealth
Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile is measured for a subset of female respondents divides each
respondent's height by her age and finds her percentile in the entire sample. Similarly, Child
Ht/Age Percentile was asked to a subset of children and divides each child's height by his or
her age and finds his or her percentile in the entire sample. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

 Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. Regressions use distance to the Mongala
and Maringa-Lopori basin as defined by Hydrobasin (with a 25 km buffer around each basin) as
an instrument for being inside a former concession. Regressions control for average age, age
squared, gender, survey year, and nearest concession fixed effect. All regressions include a local
linear polynomial in distance to the basin borders estimated separately on each side of the basin
boundary and use a uniform kernel. Literacy is an indicator variable equal to 0 if the respondent
cannot read at all and 1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an index generated by the DHS using principle
component of asset ownership. Wealth Index is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where 1 is poorest
quintile and 5 is richest quintile from the Wealth Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile is measured
for a subset of female respondents divides each respondent's height by her age and finds her
percentile in the entire sample. Similarly, Child Ht/Age Percentile was asked to a subset of children
and divides each child's height by his or her age and finds his or her percentile in the entire sample.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. Regressions use distance to the Mongala and Maringa-Lopori
basin as defined by Hydrobasin, with an additional buffer around each basin denoted on the x-axis. Vertical line
denotes basin buffer distance historically used to define the concession areas. All regressions include a local quadratic
specification estimated separately on each side of the basin boundaries within a 25 km bandwidth from the boundaries.
Regressions control for age, age squared and gender, and nearest basin fixed effects. Regressions use a triangular kernel
following Cattaneo et al. (2020). Figure shows point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

Appendix E. Differences in Subsequent Colonial Policies

In this section, we explore several alternative mechanisms that may explain our observed results.
In particular, we explore whether the rubber extraction period (i) affected subsequent Belgian
colonial infrastructure investments and missionary presence (ii) altered migration patterns and
induced selective migration. In Appendix I.6 we examine differences in market access today using
modern road network data, and in Appendix I.7 we analyze differences in population density.
   One potential explanation for the differences in development today is that the subsequent
Belgian colonial policies were different inside and outside the former concessions. We gathered
archival data from the Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer (1954) and Rouck (1945) to
assess whether colonial policies and investments were different in the former concessions relative
to areas just outside the border. In particular, we examine missionary presence and colonial
infrastructure investments.

E.1. Missionary Presence
In particular, during the colonial period, Catholic and Protestant missions were the primary
providers of education (Hochschild, 1998). The differences in education found in Table 2, could
be explained by differences in missionary presence if missionaries or colonial officials decided
not to engage as much with the former concession areas. We use data from Nunn (2010) on
missionary posts in 1924 and colonial maps from 1897 (from Rouck (1945)) and 1953 (from
Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer (1954)) to test whether areas inside the concessions
had fewer missionary posts.
   Panel A of Table E1 presents results from estimating equation (1) on missionary presence in
1897, 1924, and 1953 (see Appendix Figure B5 for a map of mission stations in 1924). We find
no evidence that areas inside and outside the concessions had significantly different missionary
presence during the colonial period. Additionally, we find no differential Protestant or Catholic
presence, nor do we find any differences in type of mission station (e.g. with health center,
school or neither).38 This suggests that differences in outcomes are not driven by subsequent
missionary interventions in the areas, nor by the different policies pursued by Protestants and
Catholic missions during the colonial era.

E.2. Colonial Infrastructure Investments
Even though the Belgian colonial government was not primarily responsible for the provision of
schooling, the government did provide infrastructure investment and other public goods (Van
Reybrouck, 2014). If the colonial government chose to invest less in former concessions areas
- perhaps due to lower population density as a result of the rubber period - then differences
in colonial investments during this period could be a channel through which the rubber areas
remain less developed today.
   Using colonial data from the Académie Royale des Sciences d'Outre-Mer (1954), we test
whether areas inside the former concessions had fewer telecommunication stations and health
centers in 1953, and lower road network density in 1968 using maps from the Army Map Services,
Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army (1968). The DRC achieved independence in 1960, but dealt
with political instability in the subsequent years (Van Reybrouck, 2014); thus, even though the
road density data is from after independence, it serves as a reasonable proxy for colonial road
investments. The estimates are presented in Panel B of Table E1. We find little evidence that
colonial investments in these goods were different inside and outside the concessions: areas

Appendix F. Migration

F.1. Selective Migration
As mentioned in Section 3.2, a potential channel of interest is selective migration. Selective
migration would be a plausible channel of persistence if all of the most capable individuals
are leaving the former concession areas and moving to places outside of the former concession,
and the relevant determinants of income are highly heritable. Examining the plausibility of this
last assumption about the heritability of the relevant determinants of income, especially in a
rural setting, is interesting but outside the scope of the paper. Unfortunately, detailed micro-level
information on migration rates does not exist for our area of interest. However, in this section we
conduct three exercises to examine what the magnitude of present day selective migration would
have to be to explain our observed results and to test for heterogeneity in effect sizes by ease of
migration.
    First, we conduct a trimming exercise with the DHS data to examine whether selective
migration might be responsible for the differences in development outcomes between former
concessions and areas just outside the former concessions. The intuition is that all of the "good"
people inside the concession areas leave and locate just outside the concession areas. Thus, the
areas outside the concession appear more developed. We consider how much of the sample
we would have to trim in order for our results to lose significance. Specifically, we ask what
percentage of the most well-off individuals who reside outside of the concessions would we need
to omit so that we no longer observe statistically significant differences between former concession
and non-concession areas, under the strong assumption that the x% of the most well-off from
outside the concession are actually from inside the concession and that the "good" individuals
from outside are not migrating to even better locations. When we examine our education and
income results, we find that x would have to be between 16% and 26% to explain the differences
we observe. This would imply that for selective migration to fully explain the results, only the
"best" people from inside are leaving and that the top one-fifth of the individuals we observe
outside the concession are all came from inside the concession.
    We present the results if we trim the top 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% of the most well-off individuals
and present the results in Figure F1. After trimming the top 10% of the sample outside the
concessions but within 200 km, the estimates of the effect of the former rubber concessions remain
of similar magnitude and statistical significance. These estimates demonstrate that even under a
strong assumption of high levels of selective migration our results remain consistent. However,
for higher trimming rates (e.g. 15%), the results tend to no longer be statistically significant. As
a point of reference, Dell (2010) omits the top 4.8% using information on migration rates in Peru.
A 10% migration rate is a much higher estimate of migration than the differences in population
flows we observe using Landscan data from 2007 compared to 2013, or using a measure for
population density in 1954 compared to modern Landscan data. In both cases, population growth
differences between inside and outside the concessions are a maximum of 4%.
    Finally, we examine whether our estimated results differ between places inside the former
concessions where it would be easier to migrate compared to places where it would be more
difficult to migrate. If selective migration is easy such that more of the "good" people are leaving,
we would expect that the RD estimates for villages where it is easier to migrate to be larger and
more negative than the estimate for villages for which migration is more difficult. As proxies
for ease of migration, we use (i) the colonial road network and (ii) ethnic group boundaries. For
(i), we calculate the shortest distance along a road to leave the concession for each village. We
then compare villages that have a below median road distance to leave the former concessions to
those villages that have an above median road distance to leave the former concessions. Almost
all villages happen to be next to a road segment, so this exercise is not comparing villages with


                                                 56
roads to those without roads. The intuition is that for villages with a shorter road segment out
of the concession, it is easier to migrate. For (ii), we use maps of ethnic groups boundaries from
Murdock (1959) and compare villages inside ethnic homelands with an above median share of
their ethnic homeland outside of the concession to those villages within ethnic homelands with a
below median share of their ethnic homeland outside the concession. The intuition is that leaving
the concession is easier for individuals with an above median share of their ethnic homeland
outside of the concession. The results for exercise (i) are described and presented in Appendix F.3.
The results for exercise (ii) are detailed and presented in Appendix F.4. In both cases, we find that
villages where it is easier to migrate are not significantly worse off than villages where it is less
easy to migrate, offering additional suggestive evidence that selective migration is not enough
to explain the differences in development presented in Section 3.3 In fact, in general, those areas
where it is harder to migrate have larger and more negative effect sizes.
    The results from these exercises suggest that migration today is likely not the main channel
behind the differences between former concessions and neighboring areas. This finding is consis-
tent with a growing literature that highlights a lack of selective migration in developing country
settings. For instance, Bazzi, Gaduh, Rothenberg and Wong (2016) examine the Transmigration
Program in Indonesia that relocated two million migrants from rural Java and Bali to new rural
settlements in the Outer Islands. They find that there has been little selective migration away
from the settlements. The results are also consistent with qualitative evidence from our visits to
the area: migration to other rural areas is challenging due to poor infrastructure and difficulties
in gaining access to land and resources in a different village if one does not originate from that
community.

Notes: We trim our sample by dropping the top x% of observations outside of the former conces-
sionsand then estimate our main specification for each dependent variable (where x is denoted on
the x-axis). All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on each side of
the concession boundary and use a triangular kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the
MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Regressions
control for age, age squared, gender, survey year, and nearest concession fixed effects. Standard errors
are clustered at the DHS cluster level. Figure plots 95% confidence intervals.

F.3. Heterogeneity by Ease of Migration Based on the Colonial Road Network
In this section, we examine how our results differ depending on the ease of migration to outside
the former concession. In particular, we examine villages that happen to be on a road segment
that has a easy access (i.e. shorter distance) to the concession border relative to those villages
who happen to be on roads with harder access to the border. For intuition, consider Figure F2.
Here we are considering two villages in the former Anversoise concession with similar euclidean
distances to the border but differing road route distances to the border: one village is located on
a road that makes it easier to leave along the road network (Figure F2a, optimal path highlighted
in green) while the other village is on a road that makes it harder to leave the former concession
(Figure F2b). By comparing these two villages, we can examine whether people in the villages
where it's easier to get out have worse development outcomes than those from villages where it's
harder to get out.

   We proceed in the following way. First, for each village inside the former concessions, we
calculate the shortest cost road route from its location to the border. These optimal shortest cost
road segments for each cluster in the DHS data are highlighted in the map in Figure F2a in green.
Second, for each sub-sample of villages within an Euclidean distance bandwidth away from the
concession borders, we split the sample into villages above and below median road distance to the
concession borders and estimate our baseline specification. Note that almost all villages happen
to fall right next to some road, so this exercise is not simply comparing villages with roads to
those without roads. Instead, it is comparing villages with easier access to out-migrate to outside
the concessions relative to villages where it is harder to out-migrate due to differences in the road
network structure.

   If selective migration is very large, we would expect that the RD estimates for villages with
shorter road distance to the former borders (i.e. where it is easier to out-migrate) to be larger than
the estimates for villages longer road distances to the former borders (i.e. where it is harder to
out-migrate). Table F1 presents the estimates from splitting the sample within each bandwidth as
described above. The results suggest that the estimates for the negative impacts of the rubber
concession on education and wealth are very similar for both samples; in fact, the negative
estimated effect of the rubber concession seems to be slightly larger in places where the road
network makes it harder to out-migrate. Thus, areas with easier access to out-migrate are not
significantly worse off than villages with less access to out-migrate, offering suggestive evidence
against selective migration being a crucial explanation for the results in Section 3.3.

F.4. Heterogeneity by Ease of Migration Based on Ethnic Group Boundaries
In this exercise, we use the intersection the rubber concession borders with ethnic group bound-
aries to examine heterogeneity of our estimated effects by the amount of ethnic group area is
outside the concessions. The intuition is to analyze how our results differ depending on whether
a village is part of an ethnic group with many possible villages for individuals to migrate outside
the concessions, relative to villages part of an ethnic group that does not have many possible
villages for individuals to migrate to outside the concession. The idea is that it may be difficult
for individuals to migrate to villages where they are not the main ethnic group (due to cultural
differences or language differences for instance).
    We proceed in three steps. First, using the ethnic group boundaries map from Murdock (1959)
and the rubber concession boundaries, for each ethnic group with at least one DHS village within
the concessions, we calculate the share of its area that falls within the concessions. Second, we
split our DHS sample within the former concessions into those part of an ethnic group with
greater than average share of its ethnic group residing outside the concession and those with a
lower than average share of its ethnic group residing outside the concession. The average village
inside the former concessions is part of an ethnic group with approximately 50% of its area inside
the former concessions. Third, we estimate our main specification for education and wealth for
these two samples and compare the estimates. Figure F4 demonstrates which ethnic groups near
the former concessions have an above and below average share of their area outside the former
concessions, and which DHS villages belong to each group.

                                                                 Above Average
                                                                 Share of Ethnic
                                                                 Group Within
                                                                 Concessions:
                                                                    Yes
                                                                    No




   If selective migration is very large, we would expect that the RD estimates for villages with
a higher share of their ethnic group residing outside former borders (i.e. where it is easier
to out-migrate) to be larger than the estimates for villages with a lower share of their ethnic
group residing outside the former borders (i.e. where it is harder to out-migrate). Table F2
presents the estimates from splitting the sample as described above. Interestingly, as in Section F.3
the estimates suggest that the (negative) impacts of the rubber concession on education and
wealth are very similar for both samples and that the effect seems to be slightly more negative in
places where the ethnic boundary locations make it harder to out-migrate. Thus, the results offer
suggestive evidence once more that selective migration is unlikely to be a critical explanation for
the DHS results from Section 3.3.

Appendix G. Field Work

G.1. Sampling Procedure
The data were collected between July and August 2015 in Gemena, the capital of Sud-Ubangi
province (formerly a part of Equateur province). We used Google satellite imagery from June
2015 to develop a sampling frame. We divided Gemena in to enumeration areas - "polygons"
- whose shape was determined by natural boundaries, such as roads and rivers. We estimated
the population size within each polygon by counting the number of houses. See Figures G.1, G.1
and G.1 for maps showing the satellite image of Gemena, Gemena divided into sampling poly-
gons, and the sampled polygons and households that participated in the survey (indicated by
navy blue dots).

Random sample
For the random sampling, 40 out of the 89 polygons were randomly selected to be visited by
survey enumerators. The probability of a polygon being chosen was proportional to its estimated
population size. Thus, more populated polygons had a higher probability of being selected.
In other words, we used a probability-proportional-to-size (PPS) sampling method. The target
number of observations for the study was 520. The number of households visited within each
polygon is constant. Thus, 13 households were chosen to be visited in each randomly selected
polygon.39 To ensure geographic coverage of the polygon, enumerators followed a skip pattern
within each polygon that depended on the number of houses within that polygon. Due to
differences in the size of polygons, this generated a different skip pattern for each polygon. The
polygons chosen, their approximate population size, and the skip pattern for each one is shown
in Figure G.1 below. Using this sampling method, we visited 506 households within 40 randomly
selected polygons during July and August of 2015.

G.2. Data Collection
For each household that was visited, survey team members asked to speak to the head of the
household. If the head of the household was not available, the enumerator asked to interview
an adult member of the household, with a preference for older household members. In order to
avoid survey fatigue and improve engagement, we split up our survey into two parts, the first one
conducted on the first visit and the second part in the second visit, along with some behavioral
games. Below, we explain each visit in-depth.

First Visit - Main Survey
The first survey sections consisted of questions intended to identify the respondent's ethnic group
and village and territories of origin and of birth. The survey collected information on basic
demographics, migration, the institutions of the individual's village of origin, politics, values, and
religion. In addition, for a final section of the survey, enumerators asked to speak to the oldest
member of the household to collect data on her views of various historical events in the region.
Respondents' were also asked to take a picture, if willing, in order to make relocating them for
the second visit easier. The survey also contained detailed question on respondents' village of
origin ­ on the status of the village, public goods available, trade and political institutions ­ but
these were only asked to respondents who were at least somewhat familiar with their village of
 39 One polygon had to be dropped once enumeration began as most of it was a military complex and our
enumerators were not granted access inside of it.

origin to improve the quality of the data. For this first visit, 506 households were visited and 503
households agreed to participate in the first survey.40

Second Visit - Survey and Behavioral Games
During the second visit, enumerators were asked to revisit the original households if the respon-
dents' village of origin was within 200 kms of the former rubber concessions. The villages were
located on maps by the respondent and enumerator during the first visit, and the distance to the
former borders was done in R between the two visits. In total, there were 484 households out of
503 who fit this criteria and were therefore selected for the second visit. Enumerators were tasked
with finding the same respondent as in the first visit to conduct a short survey, a variant of the
Reverse Dictator Game (DG), a time and risk module, and an Implicit Association Test (IAT) on
views of local chiefs. The Reverse DG and the IAT are explained in detail in Sections G.3 and G.4.
The survey was always conducted first, and then the order of the three subsequent activities was
randomized. When enumerators were unable to track down the original respondent due to travel
or illness,they were asked to first attempt to locate another member of the same household and
arrange two visits (to conduct the survey from the first part and the second visit); if they could not
locate another household member, they were asked to use the same sampling method and skip
pattern for that polygon to attempt to find a replacement household. This method of replacement
resulted in 29 households being replaced in order to reach our target of 484 households for the
second visit.

Third Visit - Payments from Behavioral Games
Finally, enumerators conducted a final visit that only consisted of payment for the outcomes of
the Reverse DG. No survey was conducted in this visit; respondents only had to sign a receipt of
payment and, if willing, take a photo with their sealed envelope containing the payment.41
 40   Three households refused to participate in the survey and were therefore not included in the survey.
 41   The pictures were taken to verify payment.

G.3. Reverse Dictator Game
Description of Game
During the second visit, we asked participants to play a variation of the Dictator Game (DG)
proposed by (Jakiela, 2011) to experimentally measure an individual's respect for earned property
rights. In this section we first explain the basic outline of the game and then provide the detailed
experimental instructions we used.
    In the standard DG, one player (Player 1) is allocated an amount of money (budget) and asked
to allocate it between themselves (the"dictator") and another subject (Player 2). In the (Jakiela,
2011) variant, there are two differences from the standard DG: (i) instead of having an external
budget endowed to Player 1, Player 1 must perform a real effort task to earn the budget, and (ii)
instead of Player 1 being the "dictator", now Player 2 is the "dictator" and gets to decide how to
divide Player 1's earned income between themselves and Player 1.
    Variation (i) of the DG has been used before by Hoffman et al. (1994) and Cherry et al. (2002)
subjects tend to be much less generous when they earned their own income, which Farh and
Irlenbusch (2000) refer to as earned property right. Variation (ii) on its own changes the standard
DG to what is known as a Reverse DG, which has been used many times before List (2007, see).
Jakiela (2011) combines these two variations to get a measure of respect for earned property rights
and finds that subjects in the US tend to others' respect earned income much more than subjects
in Kenya. The amount Player 2 decides to take from Player 1's earned income therefore represents
a measure for the respect for earned property rights.
    In our experiment, every respondent is matched to an anonymous, randomly selected individ-
ual from Gemena. This individual was chosen from within our sample and matches remained
completely anonymous to everyone on the team except for the authors. This removed strategic
considerations from the decisions of the participants on how much income to take from others.
Additionally, every respondent plays the game twice: once as Player 2 and then as Player 1.
Respondents first learned about the general structure of the experiment, the details of the earning
task, and then decided whether to participate or not.
    Before performing the effort task (i.e. played as Player 1), subjects decide how they wanted to
take from an anonymous Player 1's income. We used the strategy method to elicit these divisions:
for each of 20 possible earnings, respondents would enter the amount they wished to take for
themselves. The share of earned income that Player 2 decides to take from Player 1's earned
income is our measure for the respect for earned property rights.
    For the earnings task, we selected a task that could be easily understood by all respondents
and in which more effort was rewarded by more income: subjects played a "clicking-game" on
touch screen tablets. In this "clicking-game", a small blue dot appears in a random location
on the screen every three seconds and the respondent has one second to click on it before it
disappears.Importantly, this effort task did not rely on physical strength or skill for effort but
instead relied more on concentration and perseverance for effort. It is purposefully a very
boring game. The game lasted five minutes and respondents were paid based on the number
of successful "clicks", earning 100 Congolese Francs (approximately $0.10) for each 10 successful
clicks. Respondent were very engaged in the task as participants earned on average 700 CF in this
task, a significant amount for this region of DRC equal to about 1 days wage. Figure G.3 provides
a picture of the basic layout of the game. The game was preformed on seven-inch Samsung
Galaxy II tablets.
    The game was conducted in private between the participant and the enumerator at the home
of the respondent. Out of the 484 second visit participants, 482 total individuals participated in
this reverse dictator game variation. Two individuals chose to skip participation, one due to poor
eyesight and the other because her husband refused giving her and the enumerator permission
to conduct the game in privacy. On average, participants chose to take close to 40% of the other

individuals' earnings when playing this game. Below, we present the experimental instructions
we used to conduct the game. These are presented in English; we translated these instructions to
french and then Lingala using back translation to verify the accuracy of the translations.

Experimental Instructions - Reverse Dictator Game

[Find a private place to meet with the same respondent whom you interviewed for the survey. It is very
important that the player will not be watched by members of his household or other people while he
or she is playing the games.]

    Now I will explain how to play this game. It is very important to pay attention because only those
who understand the rules of the game well will be able to play. Let me remind you that this project is
completely voluntary and you are free to leave at any time if you decide that you do not want to participate
in this game.
    This game is played in pairs: there is a player 1 and a player 2. Importantly, you will play both roles
today.
    You will play with someone chosen randomly from the population of Gemena. Neither you nor I will
know exactly who you are playing with. Only one person in our research office will know who plays with
who, and he will never tell anyone.
    In this game, Player 1 earns money by performing some task and Player 2 will decide how they want
to divide the money that Player 1 earns between them and the other player. Player 1 will earn money by
performing a clicking task that will explain soon. The performance in this task will determine how much
money is given to each pair of players. For example, if Player 1 earns 1000 FC, then Player 2 will decide
how to divide the 1000 FC given to the players; if Player 1 earns 100 FC, then Player 2 will decide how to
divide the 100 FC given.
    Let me explain how the task is paid out. In this game, Player 1 will earn money by playing a clicking
game on the tablet. In this game, a blue button will appear on the screen and the Player 1 must click the
button to earn a point. The button will appear in different parts of the screen and it is Player 1's job to
find it and click it before it disappears. Each time Player 1 presses the button the number of clicks on the
screen increases by one. [Show player the image of the clicking game.]
    Every time Player 1 clicks the blue button, the number goes up by one - it never decreases - and the
button will change color. So, the number at the top of the tablet will show the number of times Player 1
has clicked. In this game, Player 1 will be paid money based on the number of times she clicks. We'll give


                                                    69
Player 1 five minutes in which Player 1 can click as much as Player 1 can. Player 1 has to play the game
with only one hand. Player 1 cannot switch hands, or click with two hands. The more times Player 1 clicks
the blue button during the five minutes, the more money Player 1 will be paid.

   PAYOUTS

    How much Player 1 is paid depends on how much Player 1 clicks. For each number of times she might
click, she will earn 10 FC per click. We will then round this number to the closest hundred value. This
sheet shows you how much she will be paid. So, Player 1 will be paid 100 FC if Player 1 clicks between 50
times and 149 times. If Player 1 clicks between 150 and 249 times, she will be paid 200 FC. The more times
Player 1 clicks, the more money Player 1 earns.
   · 0-4 Cliquers: 0 FC
   · 5-14 Cliquers: 100 FC
   · 15-24 Cliquers: 200 FC

   · >195 Cliquers: 2000 FC


   [Check that the player has understood how Player 1 will be paid depending on the number of clicks.]

   Player 2 must then decide how to divide the money between himself and player 1. Player 2 must take
between 0 and 1000 FC from player 1, but the total amount possible will depend on the effort made by
Player 1. Player 2 takes home what he takes from player 1, and player 1 takes home the rest. Now, we are
going to run through some examples to show how this game can be played.

    [Take the money in your hands for these demonstrations and push the offer made to player 2 across
a line on the floor.]


   1. Here is the first example. Imagine that Player 1 earns 1000 FC. Player 2 then chooses to take 900 FC
      from Player 1. Then, Player 2 will go home with 900 FC. Player 1 will go home with 100 FC (1000 FC
      minus 900 FC equals 100 FC).
   2. Here is another example. Imagine that Player 1 earns 600 FC. Player 2 then chooses to take 200 FC
      from Player 1. Then, Player 2 will go home with 200 FC. Player 1 will go home with 400 FC (600 FC
      minus 200 FC equals 400 FC).


                                                   70
   3. Here is another example. Imagine that Player 1 earns 1000 FC. Player 2 then chooses to take 500 FC
      from Player 1. Then, Player 2 will go home with 500 FC. Player 1 will go home with 500 FC (1000 FC
      minus 500 FC equals 500 FC).
   4. Here is another example. Imagine that Player 1 earns 700 FC. Player 2 then chooses to take 700 FC
      from Player 2. Then, Player 2 will go home with 700 FC. Player 1 will go home with 0 FC (700 FC
      minus 700 FC equals 0 FC).
   5. Here is another example. Imagine that Player 1 earns 500 FC. Player 2 then chooses to take 0 FC
      from Player 1. Then, Player 2 will go home with 0 FC. Player 1 will go home with 500 FC (500 FC
      minus 0 FC equals 1000 FC).

    Now please respond to the following test questions to be sure that you have understood. Then, I will
tell you if you are a player 1 or a player 2 and you will begin to play. You will play as both Player 1 and
Player 2 today, and we will return with your payouts in the next week.

   [Use the following list as test questions. If it is necessary to ask more test questions, start again with
the first example above and write "test questions repeated" in the notes section.]

   For all the following questions, imagine Player 1 has earned 1000 FC:

   Now that you fully understand the game, do you still want to participate?

   For this activity, first you are Player 2. The Player 1 you play with will be someone chosen randomly
from the population of Gemena who has performed the clicking task. Remember that only one person in
our research office will know who plays with who, and he will never tell anyone. Now I will ask you how
much money you would take from Player 1 depending on how much they earned at the task:
   1. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?
   2. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?
   3. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?
   4. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?
   5. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?

   7. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?
   8. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?
   9. If Player 1 earned 1000 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?

  20. If Player 1 earned 100 FC, how much of this amount, if anything, would you take from Player 1?
   Now that you have told me what amounts you would take from Player 1, our research office will
calculate your payoff after comparing your responses with the amount earned by Player 1. I will return in
one or two weeks with your payment for these activities.

   Now, you are a player 1. The player 2 you play with will be someone chosen randomly from the
population of Gemena. You will never know with whom you are playing, and this player 2 will never
know that he is playing with you.
   You will earn money by clicking a game on the tablet like this (demonstrate). We will then match you
with a Player 2 who will decide how much to take from what you earn, and we will return with your
payment in two or three weeks.

   [Ask the player if he/she remembers how the clicking and payouts work. If he/she is uncertain,
explain the following:]

   Let me explain how the task is paid out. In this game, Player 1 will earn money by playing a clicking
game on the tablet. In this game, a blue button will appear on the screen and the Player 1 must click the
button to earn a point. The button will appear in different parts of the screen and it is Player 1's job to
find it and click it before it disappears. Each time Player 1 presses the button the number of clicks on the
screen increases by one. [Show player the image of the clicking game.]
   Every time Player 1 clicks the blue button, the number goes up by one - it never decreases - and the
button will change color. So, the number at the top of the tablet will show the number of times Player 1
has clicked. In this game, Player 1 will be paid money based on the number of times she clicks. We'll give
Player 1 five minutes in which Player 1 can click as much as Player 1 can. Player 1 has to play the game
with only one hand. Player 1 cannot switch hands, or click with two hands. The more times Player 1 clicks
the blue button during the five minutes, the more money Player 1 will be paid.

   PAYOUTS

    How much Player 1 is paid depends on how much Player 1 clicks. For each number of times she might
click, she will earn 10 FC per click. We will then round this number to the closest hundred value. This
sheet shows you how much she will be paid. So, Player 1 will be paid 100 FC if Player 1 clicks between 5
times and 15 times. If Player 1 clicks between 15 and 24 times, she will be paid 200 FC. The more times
Player 1 clicks, the more money Player 1 earns.

Then, go to the "Effort Task" game on the home screen. Enter the respondent's information and give
the Player the tablet. Have them play the game and, after the 5 minutes, then return to geoodk.]

   [Read the conclusion only after having administered the activity.] Thank you for participating in this
game. The player 2 you will be playing with will be drawn randomly from the population of Gemena and
will decide how to divide the money you just earned. I will return in one or two weeks to give you this
money.


G.4. Implicit Association Test (IAT)
During the second visit, we also conducted a Single-Target Implicit Association Test (ST-IAT) on
local chief authority to measure implicit attitudes towards local chiefs. The ST-IAT was developed
by Bluemke and Friese (2008) and is a variant of the original IAT. The ST-IAT was created to
measure the positivity or negativity of individuals' implicit association of a single target ­ in our
case, this is local chiefs. ST-IATs have been used very recently in similar settings in the DRC by
Lowes, Nunn, Robinson and Weigel (2015) and Lowes et al. (2017).
    The ST-IAT (henceforth IAT) asks respondents to sort words into two groups, one group on the
left side and the other on the right side of the screen. Three different sets of words are presented
audibly: words related to happiness, words related to sadness, and words related to local chiefs.
The IAT consists of two blocks: in one happy words and chiefs words are sorted left and sad
words to the right, and the other happy words are sorted to the left and chief words and sad
words are sorted to the right. The order of the blocks is randomized across individuals.
    The intuition behind the IAT is that if a respondent has a positive view of chiefs, he/she will
have an easier time sorting chief words to the left with happy words than to the right with sad
words. The respondent would be using a subconscious heuristic that good things go left and bad
things go right (Lowes et al., 2015) . If a respondent does not have a positive association with
chiefs, then this heuristic will not apply and the opposite heuristic will be used; he/she will find
it easier to sort chief words to the right instead. By examining the difference in the speed at which
the respondent sorts the words across the two blocks we can infer their implicit view of chiefs.
    Formally, we follow Lowes et al. (2015) and calculate the standard D-Score as our inferred
measure of the implicit view of chiefs for a given respondent. The D-Score is defined as: D-Score
= [M ean(latency -ve ) - M ean(latency +ve )]/SD (latency +ve and -ve ), where M ean(latency -ve ) is


                                                   73
the average response time in milliseconds for the block in which the chief words are meant to go
right, M ean(latency -ve ) is the average response time for the block in which the chief words are
meant to go left, and SD (latency +ve and -ve ) is the standard deviation in response times across
both blocks. In this D-Score. more positive values will indicate more positive implicit views.
    The IATs were played on seven-inch Samsung Galaxy II tablets with Panasonic RP-HT21
Lightweight Headphones connected to them. The respondents always played a practice block
first that asks them to sort only happy words and sad word; this allows them to get used to the
interface, the headphones and the tablet. To sort a word to the left (right), the participant presses
the red button on the left (right) side of the screen, presented in Figure ??. In every block of the
IAT, participants had to obtain a 75% success rate in sorting words to the correct side in order to
advance to the next block. If they did not meet this success rate, they had to repeat the block.
Figure ?? presents a screenshot of the practice block set-up. There is an image of a happy person
on the left and an image of a sad person on the right to help the participant with the sorting
directions.
                            Figure G6: IAT Screenshot - Practice Block




    After the practice block, the participant engages in two more blocks where three different
sets of words are presented audibly: words related to happiness, words related to sadness, and
words related to local chiefs. These serve as the main two block of the the IAT: in one happy
words and chiefs words are sorted left and sad words to the right, and the other happy words
are sorted to the left and chief words and sad words are sorted to the right. The order of the
blocks is randomized across individuals. In all blocks, happy words are sorted left and sad words
are sorted left. Each time a participant gets to sort a new word is called a trail, and each block
consists of 24 trails: 8 trails with happy words, 8 trails with sad words, and 8 trails with chief
words. The order of the trails was randomized within each block. The full list of words used is
presented in Table G1. Figures G.4 and G.4 present screenshots of the two blocks: the first image
of the block in which chiefs words are sorted with happy words, and the second one of the block
in which chief words are sorted with sad words. The screen displays the word "kapita" ­ the
word for local chief in Lingala ­ on the left or right side of the screen to help the participant with
the sorting.
    As stated earlier, examining the difference in the speed at which the respondent sorts the words
across the two blocks allows us to infer their implicit view of chiefs using the standard D-Score
as our inferred measure of the implicit view of chiefs for a given respondent. We follow Lowes et
al. (2015) and ignore data from practice blocks and repeated blocks where the participant did not
achieve a 75% success rate. We windsorize the response times (also known as latency) to 3,000



                                                 74

milliseconds. We account for incorrect replacing their latency with the block mean plus the block
standard deviation.
   The IAT instructions we used borrow heavily from Lowes et al. (2015). Lowes et al. (2015)
conducted ST-IATs in the DRC during 2014 and their findings confirm that the single-target IAT
succeeds in capturing participants' implicit attitudes in a very similar setting. These instructions
are presented below in English. We translated the instructions, the tablet audio, and the tablet-
game prompts into Lingala using back translation methods to verify the accuracy and consistency
of the translations.42
   During the second visit, 459 participated completely in the activity. Many participants refused
to participate, either due to poor eyesight, hearing problems, and/or sickness. Some participants
refused to complete the activity due to failing to achieve a 75% success rate and grew fatigued
of having to repeat blocks. Thus, we have 459 IAT observations from our second visits to test for
implicit views of chiefs.
  42 We only performed the IAT in Lingala as everyone in our sample for the second visits spoke Lingala, the Lingala

for the game is very basic, and the chief authority words have more meaning in Lingala than their equivalents in
French for the local context.

Experimental Instructions - IAT


[Find a private place to meet with the same respondent whom you interviewed for the survey.
It is very important that the player will not be watched by members of his household or other
people while he or she is playing the games.]

   Now I will explain how to play this game. It is very important to pay attention because only
those who understand the rules of the game well will be able to play.
   Let me remind you that this project is completely voluntary and you are free to leave at any
time if you decide that you do not want to participate in this game.

   First Block:

  We are going to play a computer game. Before we play I would like to ask you to put on these
headphones. If they are too loud or are uncomfortable, please let me know so I can adjust them.

   [Ask participant if he/she will put on headphones]

   [If participant doesn't want to put on headphones then wait until the start of the second
block to ask if they changed their mind. If they still decline, unplug the headphones and use
the computer's internal speakers. But make sure the volume isn't so loud that other people
can hear.]

   You are going to hear sounds when an dot appears in the middle of the screen one at a time.
Some words will be good words and some words will be bad words. If you hear a good word
like happy or nice I want you to press the left button as fast as you can. There is a smiley face on
the left side to remind you to press the left button when you hear a good word. But if you hear a
bad word like wicked or mad I want you to press the right button as fast as you can. There is a
frowny face on the right side to remind you to press the right button when you hear a bad word.
   Now, there are a few things to remember.

  1. Please use one finger for each button. [Demonstrate by holding one finger by both buttons
     and pressing each one at a time.]

  2. After you press the button be sure to take your finger off of it because if you hold it down
     [demonstrate holding it down], the button will stop working.

                                                   76
  3. Please play the game as fast as you can. It is okay if you make mistakes, I just want to see
     how quickly you can play. But if you do press the wrong button, just press the correct one
     and keep playing.


   Now that you fully understand the game, do you still want to participate?

   [If the person indicates yes, administer the game.]

   [Have participant put one finger by each button before beginning the first block.]

   Are you ready to play the game?

   [Make sure the participant has one finger by each button and is ready to begin before
starting.]

   Some sounds will be words related to happiness and words related to sadness. If you hear a
sound related to happiness, I want you to press the red button on the left as quickly as you can;
There is a picture of a smiling face on the left side to remind you to press the red when you hear
words related to happiness. Finally, if you hear a sound related to sadness, I want you to press
the right button as quickly as you can; There is a picture of a sad face on the right side to remind
you to press the red button on the right when you hear words related to sadness.

   Remember: please try to play the game as fast as you can. It is okay if you make mistakes.

   Second Block:

   This next activity will be a bit more complicated. You are going to hear words about chief
authority and hear words about happiness or sadness one at a time. If you hear a word related to
chief authority in the middle of the screen I want you to press the red button on the left side of
the screen as quickly as you can like you were doing earlier. There is a picture of the word "chief"
on the right side to remind you to press the red button on the right when you hear sounds about
chief authority. If you hear a good word I also want you to press the left button as fast as you can
like you were doing before. And if you hear a bad word I also want you to press the red button
on the right side of the screen as fast as you can like you were doing before.

  Remember: please try to play the game as fast as possible, and don't worry about making
mistakes.

   [When they get to the break in the middle, say:]

   That was great.

   Third Block:

   Now they've changed sides on you. This time, if you hear a word related to chief authority
please press the red button on the right side of the screen as quickly as you can.

  [Point out that the category reminders ­ i.e. the word for chief - has switched sides when
you are reciting the instructions].


                                                77
   But, as before if you hear a good word I also want you to press the left button as fast as you
can like you were doing before. And if you hear a bad word I also want you to press the right
button as fast as you can like you were doing before.

  Are you ready to play?

variable equal to 1 if the respondent's mother is a migrant to Gemena. Father: Migrated to Find Better Economic Opportunities is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent's
father migrated to Gemena in search of better economic opportunities. Father: Migrated to Find Better Educational Opportunities is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent's
father migrated to Gemena in search of better educational opportunities. Mother: Migrated to Find Better Economic Opportunities is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent's
mother migrated to Gemena in search of better economic opportunities. Mother: Migrated to Find Better Educational Opportunities is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent's
mother migrated to Gemena in search of better educational opportunities. Migrant Father Educational Attainment and Migrant Mother Educational Attainment are 0 to 4 categorical
variables where 0 is no education and 4 is higher education for migrant parents.

       Notes: Standard errors clustered at the origin village level. Sample includes only individuals born in Gemena. All
     regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary and use
     a triangular kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by Cattaneo
     et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Regressions include nearest concession fixed effects and control for age, age
     squared and sex. Trust Index is a summary index for the following questions: How much do you trust (1) people
     from your village of origin, (2) people of another tribe, (3) people of your own tribe, (4) people you meet for the
     first time, (5) your family, (6) your neighbors, (7) people of another nationality, and (8) people of your sub-tribe; all
     questions answered on a 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Completely) scale. Closeness to Others Index is a summary index for the
     following questions: (1) How close to you feel to people from your village of origin?, (2) How close to do you feel
     to people of Gemena?, (3) How close do you feel to people of your own tribe?, (4) How close do you feel to people
     of your age set from your origin village?, and (5) How close do you feel to people of your age set in Gemena?; all
     questions answered in a scale from 0 (Not Close at All) to 5 (Very Close). Sharing Norms Index is a summary index for
     the following questions: (1) If you get money from luck you should share it, (2) If you earn money from hard work
     you should share it, (3) If someone else earns money from luck they should share it, (4) If someone else earns money
     from hard work they should share it; all questions answered in a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly
     Agree). Sharing Norms Index Village of Origin is a summary index for the following questions, where all questions
     start with "How much would someone from your village of origin agree with the following statements", for the
     same statements listed above. Dictator Game: Amount Shared measures the amount sent to an anonymous player 2
     in the standard Dictator Game. Effort Task: Share Redistributed is the total share taken (weighted by the maximum
     budget amount possible to take) in the effort task from the anonymous player 1's earned income. It represents an
     experimental measure of respect for earned income property rights. Two individuals declined participating in the
                                                                82

      Notes: Standard errors clustered at the origin village level. Sample includes only first-generation migrants to
     Gemena. All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on each side of the concession
     boundary and use a triangular kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure
     suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Regressions include nearest concession fixed effects
     and control for age, age squared and sex. Trust Index is a summary index for the following questions: How much
     do you trust (1) people from your village of origin, (2) people of another tribe, (3) people of your own tribe, (4)
     people you meet for the first time, (5) your family, (6) your neighbors, (7) people of another nationality, and (8)
     people of your sub-tribe; all questions answered on a 0 (Not at All) to 4 (Completely) scale. Closeness to Others Index
     is a summary index for the following questions: (1) How close to you feel to people from your village of origin?,
     (2) How close to do you feel to people of Gemena?, (3) How close do you feel to people of your own tribe?, (4)
     How close do you feel to people of your age set from your origin village?, and (5) How close do you feel to people
     of your age set in Gemena?; all questions answered in a scale from 0 (Not Close at All) to 5 (Very Close). Sharing
     Norms Index is a summary index for the following questions: (1) If you get money from luck you should share it,
     (2) If you earn money from hard work you should share it, (3) If someone else earns money from luck they should
     share it, (4) If someone else earns money from hard work they should share it; all questions answered in a scale
     from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Sharing Norms Index Village of Origin is a summary index for the
     following questions, where all questions start with "How much would someone from your village of origin agree
     with the following statements", for the same statements listed above. Dictator Game: Amount Shared measures the
     amount sent to an anonymous player 2 in the standard Dictator Game. Effort Task: Share Redistributed is the total
     share taken (weighted by the maximum budget amount possible to take) in the effort task from the anonymous
     player 1's earned income. It represents an experimental measure of respect for earned income property rights. Two
                                                               83
     individuals declined participating in the Dictator Game, and one additional individual declined participating in the
     Reverse Dictator Game. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
G.7. Index Components Coefficient Plots
This section presents the coefficient plots for the ICW indexes presented in the main text. For
each index, we plot the estimated index coefficient and then plot the standardized individual
component coefficient for each component that is included in the index. The coefficient plots are
presented for regression discontinuity estimates using the MSE optimal bandwidth from Cattaneo
et al. (2020) in kms. All estimates use a local linear polynomial in distance to the concession border
estimated separately on each side of the border. Regression control for age, age squared, gender,
and include a nearest concession fixed effect. Standard errors are clustered at the village of origin
level. The plots include 95% confidence intervals for each coefficient.

Appendix H. Results using Baseline Data from an Ongoing RCT in Northern DRC

This section replicates the regression discontinuity results from Section 4 using baseline data
conducted in 302 villages in northern DRC from Lowes et al. (2016). We first describe the data
collection process. We then discuss our results using this data, and show that the results confirm
the findings in Section 4: we find that villages inside the former concession have less accountable
chiefs, but respondents have higher sharing norms.

H.1. Data
Before implementing the proposed intervention described in Lowes et al. (2016), we undertook a
round of baseline data collection in northern DRC. Our sample comprises 302 randomly-selected
villages from the territories of Gemena (102), Kungu (100) and Lisala (100), which are located in
the Northwest of the DRC.
    To select the 302 villages we first compiled a Census of villages in each territory from the
territory governor's office of each territory (where a village is defined as a collection of house-
holds managed by a village chief according to records on village chiefs compiled by territory
administrators). We then randomly selected 100 villages from each territory. A map of the
villages in the sample is shown in Figure H1.
    The first round of surveys was undertaken during the summer of 2016 and summer 2017. We
collected basic information on various political, social, and economic characteristics of the village,
as well as information about its history. We attempted to ask a similar set of questions as in the
data collection described in Appendix G. However, we did not conduct experimental games to
measure respect in authority (chief IAT), sharing norms, or altruism. We discuss these differences
more in the following sub-section
    The surveys comprised surveys of the Village Chief, the Sage, the Secretary, one notable from
each clan of the village, and 12 randomly-chosen citizens from the village (4 old men, 4 young
men, 2 old women and 2 young women). In choosing the citizens we stratified by gender and age.
On average 18 villagers were surveyed per village. In total, we surveyed over 5,400 individuals
from these 302 villages.

H.2. Variables Used & Differences with the Gemena Sample
In this sub-section, we describe the similarities and differences between the baseline data from
Lowes et al. (2016) and the Gemena data described in Section 4. Many of the questions from the
baselline data from Lowes et al. (2016) were taken from our surveys conducted in Gemena. For
questions regarding village institutions and public goods, we used the answers provided by the
village secretary.43 For questions regarding social norms, we used the answers provided by 12
randomly-chosen citizens from the villages.44
    Because the data Lowes et al. (2016) was not collected with the intention to replicate the
analysis in this paper (and instead inform an ongoing RCT), an important difference relative
to the Gemena sample is that we did not conduct any experimental games in the villages. That
means we no longer have measures for the chief IAT score, the dictator game, or the reverse
dictator game.
  43 The village secretary is a position in the village usually taken by a younger individual to help the village chief
and notables, and to keep records. Focus groups we conducted in villages suggested that the secretaries tended to be
the best informed (and less biased) individuals for these matters.
  44 We do this to avoid differences in answers by the composition/size of the local authorities. In particular, villages

have differing numbers of notables (due to different numbers of clans). For example, some villages have two notables
while others have over twelve. Therefore, to keep the sample comparable in terms of size and composition by village,
we use the answers from the 12 randomly-selected individuals.

we highlight these differences compared to what we used in Gemena survey:

   · Chief Public Good Index is a summary index for the following questions (with the number
     of components for each question in brackets): Is the chief in your village of origin respon-
     sible for providing (1) road maintenance, (2) new roads, (3) school maintenance, (4) land
     allocation, (5) protection of property rights, (6) tax collection, (7) jobs, (8) conflict arbitration
     (adultery, theft, or witchcraft), and (9) road brushing; all questions answered as a 0 to 2
     categorical variable where 0 is No, 1 is Partially, and 2 is Yes.
      These questions and associated response options matched the Gemena survey. The one
      difference is with (8), where we broke up the "conflict arbitration" task to be three separate
      types of conflict arbitration (adultery, theft or witchcraft conflict). Therefore, the index from
      the Lowes et al. (2016) sample includes three questions regarding conflict arbitration.

   · Chief Elected is an indicator variable equal to 1 if the village chief of a village is selected by
     elections according to the secretary.
      This question and response option matches the Gemena survey.

   · Village Public Goods Index is a summary index for the following questions asked to the village
     secretary (with the number of components for each question in brackets): (1) What material
     is the road in your village of origin made of? [2: 0=Sand, 1=Gravel or Pavement] (2) Is your
     village of origin on a main road? 3) Does your village of origin have a primary school? [2]
     (4) Does your village of origin have a secondary school? [2] (5) Does your village of origin
     have a Health Dispensary? [2] (6) Does your village of origin have a Health Center? [2] (7)
     Does the water in your village of origin come from a well? [2: 0=Spring water, 1=Well].
      This question and response options match the Gemena survey. The index is expanded
      however to include questions on having a primary school and a health dispensary. The
      results are very similar when we exclude these questions.45 Note that the question regarding
      road material was answered by our enumerators and not the village secretary, as we wanted
      consistent answers for this question in particular (to understand how the next phase of the
      RCT could occur).

   · Village Subjective Ratings Index is a summary index for the following questions asked to the
     village secretary (with the number of components for each question in brackets): (1) How
     would you rate the condition of the primary school in your village? [5] (2) How would you
     rate the condition of the secondary school in your village? [5] (3) How would you rate the
     quality of the health center in your village relative to other roads in the area? [5] (4) Relative
     to other villages in the area you have visited, how would your rate your village of origin
     overall? [5]
      These question, response options, and index construction matches the Gemena survey.

   · Trust in Chief Index is a summary index for the following questions to villagers (with the
     number of components for each question in brackets): (1) How much do you trust your
     village chief? [4], (2) How much does the village trust your village chief? [4].
      This index is different as it only includes two questions on trust in the chief, and no longer
      includes questions we deemed too sensitive in the field (e.g. would you keep your village
  45 we had effectively zero variation in the Gemena sample for this question, but there was more variation for some

of the very rural villages we visited, so we decided to include. The village surveys also improved the health center
question to try to break up "health center" into more components relevant in the field.


                                                        89
  chief, how would you rate your chief, how much confidence do you have in your chief) and
  no longer included questions regarding trust or confidence in the sub-tribe chief (as this was
  not of interest in the baseline survey and also potentially sensitive). The index also includes
  a new question on how much trust the village has in the chief, to try to avoid the question
  being too sensitive for an individual respondent.

· Satisfaction w/ Chief Index is a summary index for the following questions to villagers : (1)
  How satisfied are you with your village of origin chief? [4], (2) How satisfied is the village
  with your village chief? [2].
  This index is new and added to the table to proxy for the IAT scores (which we did not
  conduct in the field). It only includes two questions on satisfaction in the chief (note that
  the term satisfaction was deemed less sensitive in the field than questions on confidence
  and rating). Similar to the Trust in Chief Index, the index also includes a question on how
  satisfied the village is with the chief, to try to avoid the question being too sensitive for an
  individual respondent.

· Trust Index is a summary index for the following questions asked to the randomly selected
  villagers: How much do you trust (1) people from your village of origin, (2) people of
  another tribe, (3) people of your own tribe, (4) your family, (5) your neighbors, (6) people
  of another nationality, and (7) people of your sub-tribe; all questions answered on a 0 to 4
  scale where 0 is Not at All and 4 is Completely.
  These questions, response options, and index construction matches the Gemena sample.
  The one minor difference was that we replaced the term "sub-tribe" with "clan" to more
  accurately capture the relevant social structure in the villages (as the term "sub-tribe" can
  refer either to your clan in your village, or your clan across villages).

· Closeness to Others Index is a summary index for the following questions: (1) How close to
  you feel to people from your village of origin?, (2) How close do you feel to people of your
  age set from your origin village?; questions answered in a scale from 0 (Not Close at All) to
  5 (Very Close).
  These two questions and response options match the Gemena sample. However, in the
  villages, we no longer asked individuals about closeness with people in Gemena, people in
  your age set in Gemena, and people in your ethnic group (as villages are often homogenous,
  so it would proxy for closeness with other villagers).

· Survey Measures of Sharing Norms: Respondent is a summary index for the following ques-
  tions: (1) If you get money from luck you should share it, (2) If you earn money from hard
  work you should share it, (3) If someone else earns money from luck they should share it, (4)
  If someone else earns money from hard work they should share it; all questions answered
  in a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
  These four questions, the response options, and the index construction match the Gemena
  sample.

· Survey Measures of Sharing Norms: Village measures a respondent's answer to "How often do
  people in this village share with others", answered in a scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always).
  We did not conduct experimental games in this baseline data collection.
  This is a question that we include in the subsequent analysis to proxy for the Sharing Norms
  ­ Village of Origin index from the Gemena sample. We asked individuals one question on
  how often villagers (rather than the respondent themselves) shared with others to attempt
  to capture general village-level sharing norms to proxy for Sharing Norms ­ Village of Origin.

H.3. Results
We reproduce the results from Table 3 and Table 4 as closely as possible and present them in
Table H1 and H2, respectively.
   We find that the results are generally similar to the main results from Section 4: villages inside
the former concession have less accountable chiefs, but respondents have higher sharing norms.
This provides an additional robustness test to our results and assuages concerns that selective
migration may be driving the results in Section 4.

 Notes: Standard errors clustered at the village level. All regressions include a local linear specification estimated separately on each
side of the concession boundary and use a triangular kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure
suggested by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Village Public Goods Index is a summary index for the following questions
asked to the village secretary (with the number of components for each question in brackets): (1) What material is the road in your
village of origin made of? [2: 0=Sand, 1=Gravel or Pavement] (2) Is your village of origin on a main road? 3) Does your village of origin

[2: 0=Spring water, 1=Well]. Village Subjective Ratings Index is a summary index for the following questions asked to the village secretary:
(1) How would you rate the condition of the primary school in your village? [5] (2) How would you rate the condition of the secondary
school in your village? [5] (3) How would you rate the quality of the health center in your village relative to other roads in the area? [5]

and (9) road brushing; all questions answered as a 0 to 2 categorical variable where 0 is No, 1 is Partially, and 2 is Yes. Chief Elected is
an indicator variable equal to 1 if the village chief of a village is selected by elections according to the secretary. Trust in Chief Index is
a summary index for the following questions to villagers: (1) How much do you trust your village chief? [4], (2) How much does the
village trust your village chief? [4]. Satisfaction w/ Chief Index is a summary index for the following questions to villagers : (1) How
satisfied are you with your village of origin chief? [4], (2) How satisfied is the village with your village chief? [2]. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05,

Notes: Village Rating measures how a respondent answers the following question "Relative to other villages in the area you have
visited, how would you rate your village of origin overall?" on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1=a lot worse than other communities and
5=much better off than other communities. Public Good Index is the sum of the following public good questions (with the number of
components for each question in brackets), where each question is standardized before being included in the summation: (1) What
material is the road in your village of origin made of? [2: 0=Sand, 1=Gravel or Pavement] (2) Is your village of origin on a main road?
(3) Does your village of origin have mobile coverage? [5] (4) Does your village of origin have a secondary school? [2] (5) Does your
village of origin have a Health Dispensary? [2] (6) Does your village of origin have a Hospital? [2] (7) Does the water in your village
of origin come from a well? [2: 0=Spring water, 1=Well]. More positive values of the index indicates higher amounts of public goods
in a village of origin. Norms Index is the sum of the following sharing norms questions (with the number of components for each
question in brackets), where each question is standardized before being included in the summation: (1) If you get money from luck
you should share it [5], (2) If you earn money from hard work you should share it [5], (3) If someone else earns money from luck they
should share it [5], (4) If someone else earns money from hard work they should share it [5], (5) How close to you feel to people from
your village of origin? [5], (6) How close to do you feel to people of Gemena? [5], (7) How close do you feel to people of your own
tribe? [5], (8) How close do you feel to people of your age set from your origin village? [5], and (9) How close do you feel to people
of your age set in Gemena? [5]. More positive values of the index indicate stronger pro-social norms for an individual. The figures
are binscatters. All binscatters include district fixed effects, a linear polynomial in latitude and longitude, and baseline controls for
individuals (age, age squared and a male indicator).




I.2. Establishing a First-Stage Discontinuity - Commercial Posts in 1897 and 1905
While it is not required to show a first stage for an RD analysis, we can examine whether
the probability of having a "commercial post" is higher within the concession boundaries. A
commercial post corresponds to places where rubber is collected and traded. In Figure I2 we
present digitized maps of commercial posts and show that the former concession areas are much


                                                                                                    94
more likely to have had commercial posts. If there were no "first-stage" in the sense that the
concession areas were not more likely to be exposed to the rubber extraction, then it is unlikely
we would find effects of being inside a former concession. Additionally, if the RD were "fuzzy"
such that the concession boundaries were not perfectly respected, this would bias our coefficients
toward zero. Ideally, we would have detailed granular data of exposure to violence or rubber
production. We have been unable to find such data, though in Section I.4 we examine the
correlation between post level rubber production for a six month period of 1904 for which we
were able to find data and wealth today.
   Table I1 presents the regression discontinuity estimates for indicator variable for having a
"commercial post" is higher within the concession boundaries. The indicator is constructed at the
grid cell level as in Table 1. A commercial post corresponds to places where rubber is collected
and traded. Columns (1)-(3) present results using Figure I2 on commercial post locations in 1897
from Rouck (1945), while Columns (4)-(6) present results using Figure I3 on commercial post
locations in 1905 from Goffart (1908). The results demonstrate that the former concession areas
are much more likely to have had commercial posts compared to areas just outside the former
concession boundaries.

I.3. Wealth Inequality at the DHS Cluster Level
Table I2 presents the regression discontinuity estimates for wealth inequality for DHS clusters.
Columns (1)-(3) present results using the standard deviation in the DHS wealth factor score for
each DHS cluster as the dependent variable, while Columns (4)-(6) present results using the
inter-quartile range in the DHS wealth factor score for each DHS cluster as the dependent variable.
The results demonstrate that villages inside the former concessions have lower levels of wealth
inequality compared to villages just outside the former concession boundaries.

I.4. Analysis Using Historical Post Level Data
As a complement to the RD analysis, we analyze post-level rubber production data from 1904 for
ABIR. We combined data on rubber production from the Belgian Foreign Public Service Foreign
Affairs archives with data from the De Ryck Collection, a collection of Congo colonial manuscripts
at the University of Wisconsin library. We were able to compile data on rubber production for
19 posts within the ABIR concession between July and December 1904 (see Figure 2b for map
of post locations) (de Ryck, 1885-1954). We use these measures of production as a proxy for
intensity of exposure to extractive institutions. We match DHS clusters to rubber posts within 50
kilometers. Even though we are limited by the small number of DHS clusters near former rubber
posts, we find that individuals within DHS clusters close to posts that produced more rubber
during these 6 months of 1904 are less wealthy today, as seen in Figure I4.46 To the extent that
rubber production captures the intensive margin of exposure to colonial extraction, these results
suggest that greater exposure indeed leads to worse development outcomes, with the caveat that
these are merely correlations. As an alternative measure of intensity of exposure, we use year
of post establishment. Posts within ABIR were established between 1892 and 1903. We find that
individuals close to posts that were operating for more years are also worse off. These results
are presented in Table I3 and in Figure I4, and they suggest that some of the heterogeneity in

be more observations in the binscatters.

development outcomes near the former concessions can be explained by the intensity of extraction
during the Congo Free State period.

Notes: We use data on the amount of rubber produced in 19 posts within the ABIR concession between July and December 1904 and
match posts to DHS clusters within 50 km of the former posts. Figures (b) and (d) include controls for age, age squared, gender,
survey year, latitude and longitude. Rubber Production in 1904 is measured in tons.




I.5. On a Convergence Path?
It is important to understand whether areas inside the former rubber concessions are actually
on a path to convergence with areas outside the former concessions but have simply not caught
up yet. We test for convergence in our setting by examining whether younger cohorts inside the
former concessions are "catching up" to similar cohorts outside the former concessions in terms
of the development outcomes examined in Table 2. Effectively, we are examining how the effect
of being inside a concession varies over time.
    To do this, we compare cohorts inside and outside the concessions born within five years of
each other by estimating a regression that includes fixed effects for each 5-year cohort along with
the interactions between the RubberConcession indicator and cohort fixed effects.47 Figure I5
plots the estimated cohort coefficients for years of education, literacy, height-to-age and wealth.
  47   Formally, we estimate the following specification for DHS clusters within 200 kms of the concession borders:

                                   yi,v = RubberConcessioni,v + y Cy + y Cy × RubberConcessioni,v + Xi  +  + i,v                                                                       (a1)

where Cy are 5-year cohort fixed effects and the other variables are defined as in equation (1). Note that we are not
estimating a distinct RD polynomial for each cohort as that would be too demanding of the data given our sample
size.

 Notes: Rubber Production in 1904 measures production in tons for the last six months of 1904
for ABIR posts. We match DHS clusters to the closest ABIR post and limit the sample to
clusters within 50 kms of the former ABIR posts. We cluster standard errors at the DHS
cluster level. In columns (2) and (4) we include district fixed effects and control for age,
age squared, gender, survey year, latitude, longitude, malaria and tsetse suitability, and
distance to concession border. Literacy is an indicator variable equal to 0 if the respondent
cannot read at all and 1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an index generated by the DHS using
principle component of asset ownership. Wealth Index is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where 1
is poorest quintile and 5 is richest quintile from the Wealth Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile
is measured for a subset of female respondents divides each respondent's height by her age
and finds her percentile in the entire sample. Similarly, Child Ht/Age Percentile was asked to
a subset of children and divides each child's height by his or her age and finds his or her
percentile in the entire sample. Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. * p < 0.10,
** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

We see no evidence for convergence across cohorts: the estimated coefficients for each cohort are
similar, stable and do not get closer to zero for younger cohorts.48

Notes: These figures plot the estimated coefficient for each 5 year cohort indicator interacted with the indicator for being inside a
former concession area for observations within 200 kms of the concession borders. The regression also includes cohort fixed effects.
Standard errors are clustered at the DHS cluster level. The figures also plot 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients. All outcome
variables are from the DHS 2007 and 2014 surveys. The regressions all have 1496 observations. Wealth Factor Score is an index
generated by the DHS using principle component on asset ownership. Literacy is a 0 to 2 categorical variable where 0 is cannot read
at all and 2 is able to read a whole sentence. Ht/Age Percentile divides each respondent's height by her age and finds her percentile
in the entire sample and normalizes this percentile to be within 0 and 10000.




I.6. Market Access and Public Good Provision Since Independence
An additional potential channel of interest is differences in investment in market access and public
goods post-independence. After independence, the central government suffered from political
instability (Van Reybrouck, 2014); thus, much of the subsequent maintenance of roads and the
provision of public goods was not provided by the central government. If investment levels in
roads are significantly lower within the former concessions, this would suggest local failure of
collective action as a potential mechanism for persistence. This lack of local maintenance could
arise for many reasons. For example, local governments may not have the capacity to invest
in public goods or in infrastructure maintenance in former concession areas, or individuals in
  48 The one exception are the estimates for the health outcome, where older cohorts appear to have slightly higher
height-to-age percentiles inside the former concessions. This could potentially be explained by selective survival ­ e.g.
for the older individuals we only observe those healthy enough to survive inside the former concessions.



                                                                                                                                     101
the former concessions are less trusting of outsiders and therefore choose not to invest in public
goods and infrastructure.
   Using data from the Referentiel Geographique Commun on current road networks and bridges
in DRC today, Panel C of Table E1 examines whether areas inside the former concession have
lower market access today (Appendix B presents maps of the road networks and bridges). We
find that areas inside the former rubber concessions have fewer roads and bridges today relative
to areas outside of the former concessions. The results in Panel C of Table E1 combined with
the results in Panel B ­ in which we find no evidence of differences in road network investments
by the Belgian colonial government ­ suggest that differences in public good and infrastructure
provision since independence are a plausible channel of persistence in this setting. Because the
Belgians did not invest differentially in road infrastructure inside and outside the concessions,
road network density was similar at independence. Yet, today we find that road networks are less
dense inside the former concessions. Given that there have not been any substantial investments
in new roads in the area since independence, these results suggest that the observed differences
in road network density today are driven by a failure by local chiefs and their constituents to
maintain roads that existed at the time of independence.

I.7. Population Density
This section examines differences in population density. The results below show that the former
concession areas have lower population density. A Maluthusian model would predict higher
income per capita inside the concession areas and a simple Solow model would predict conver-
gence. Empirical evidence from other settings that experienced intense violence ­ such as Rwanda
in the 1990s (Rogall and Yanagizawa-Drott, 2014) and the 1609 Spanish expulsion of the Moriscos
(Chaney and Hornbeck, 2016) ­ suggest that the concessions would have converged to a similar
level of development by now. This suggests that differences in population density directly to the
violence are unlikely to explain the results.
   We use data from Landscan 2007 to get a measure of population density as an additional
indicator of development. Landscan 2007 data uses detailed satellite imagery to construct
measures of population density at a resolution of approximately 1 km by 1 km for the entire
world. Figure I6 is a map of population data around the rubber concession areas. Table I4
presents our results from estimating specification (1) on 20 km by 20 km grid cells constructed
with GIS.49 We find that areas inside the former rubber concessions are less populated today than
areas outside. Areas inside the former concession borders have approximately three fewer people
per 1 km by 1 km grid cell on average (this corresponds to about 25 % fewer people per square
kilometer). Thus, even though the rubber extraction and violence occurred over 100 years before
the population density measure, the areas inside the former rubber concessions continue to be
less populated today than areas outside the former concessions.
   49 We use 20 km by 20 km grid cells to match the analysis by Dell (2010). To conserve space, we present results using

only a cubic polynomial in distance to the concession border; the results are very similar for the cubic polynomial in
latitude and longitude and are available upon request. For the Landscan analysis, we drop outlier grid cells before
running our analysis; specifically, we drop any observation above the 99th percentile.

I.8. Nightlights
To explore the impacts of the rubber concessions on development outcomes available across the
entire border, we use satellite data on nightlight intensity from NOAA (in particular, the VIIRS
NDB Nighttime Lights for 2016) as a measure of development (Henderson, Storeygard and Weil,
2012). Table I5 presents estimates on differences in nightlight intensity at the former rubber
concession border. We find evidence that the former rubber concession areas have lower levels of
nightlight intensity today. These results are consistent with the DHS results and show that the
former rubber concessions areas continue to have lower development levels today.

I.9. Violence and Conflict
The intense violence experienced during the rubber extraction period might have changed social
norms for violence by making people more prone to resort to violence for conflict resolution.
These differences could have led areas inside the former concessions to experience more violence
and conflict, and this could have hindered economic development.
   We test for differences in violence using data from PRIO that documents the location and
intensity of major conflict events in the DRC since 1989. Table I6 presents estimates on differences
in violent conflict. The dependent variable is total amount of conflict in 20 km by 20 km grid
cells. We find some weak evidence that these areas experience less conflict. However, note that
this is not the ideal test of differences in social norms for violence, since most of the PRIO data
for Congo captures large-scale conflicts that were a consequence of the Congo Wars. Thus, we
cannot conclude that differences in conflict and violence explain the main results.

survey year, and nearest concession fixed effects. Literacy is an indicator variable equal to 0 if the
respondent cannot read at all and 1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an index generated by the DHS
using principle component of asset ownership. Wealth Index is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where
1 is poorest quintile and 5 is richest quintile from the Wealth Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile
is measured for a subset of female respondents divides each respondent's height by her age and
finds her percentile in the entire sample. Similarly, Child Ht/Age Percentile was asked to a subset
of children and divides each child's height by his or her age and finds his or her percentile in the
entire sample. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.

                 Notes: Standard errors clustered at the DHS cluster level. All regressions include a local linear
               specification estimated separately on each side of the concession boundary and use a triangular
               kernel. Optimal bandwidths are chosen using the MSE-minimizing procedure suggested by
               Cattaneo et al. (2020) and are reported in kms. Regressions control for age, age squared, gender,
               survey year, and nearest concession fixed effects. Literacy is an indicator variable equal to 0 if the
               respondent cannot read at all and 1 otherwise. Wealth Score is an index generated by the DHS
               using principle component of asset ownership. Wealth Index is a 1 to 5 categorical variable where
               1 is poorest quintile and 5 is richest quintile from the Wealth Score. Respondent Ht/Age Percentile
               is measured for a subset of female respondents divides each respondent's height by her age and
               finds her percentile in the entire sample. Similarly, Child Ht/Age Percentile was asked to a subset
               of children and divides each child's height by his or her age and finds his or her percentile in the
               entire sample. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
