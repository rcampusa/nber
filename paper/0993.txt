            Money Surprises and Short—Term Interest Rates:
                  Reconciling Contradictory Findings



                               ABSTRACT



     This note attempts to reconcile contradictory findings regarding

the impact of money surprises on short term interest rates. Expectations

effects regarding anticipated monetary policy and anticipated inflation

suggest a positive relationship. Liquidity and output effects of

monetary surprises suggest a negative relationship. It is shown that

intra—day data and end—of—period data will capture expectations effects

while period average data will capture liquidity/output effects.

Seemingly contradictory results are reconciled by differences in depen-

dent variables employed by various authors.

i.       introduction


         The   impact upon short—term nominal interest rates of "surprise"
or unanticipated    movements in the money supply has been the focus of

a ntimber of empirical investigations conducted since adoption in

October, 1979 by the Federal Reserve of new operating procedures.

There are, however, seemingly contradictory findings among the re—

suits of these investigations. The aim of this paper is to suggest

means   of reconciling these contradictory findings. The effort seems
justified in light of     the sharply elevated means and   variances   of money

surprises since October of 1979 reported by Roley (1982) and Makiu

(l982.a).

         Those who see a positive relationship between money surprises

and interest rates emphasize two types of expectations effects.

Grossman (1981) and Roley (1982) see positive money surprises result-

ing in   higher   nominal rates due to anticipated future tightening

moves by the monetary authority coitted to money growth targets.

Roley (1982) finds this effect far more pronounced after October,

1979. Mishkin (1982), on the other hand, links positive money sur-

prises with anticipated inflation, thereby explaining their positive

association with short term rates.

         A negative relationship between money surprises and short run

interest rates is explained by liquidity or output effects. Liquidity

effects arise from an excess money supply condition associated with

a money surprise when prices are "sticky" as suggested in Khan

(1980) and Makin (1982.a). Assuming that real income does not rise
                                      2


sufficiently to absorb excess money supply as a result of a positive

money "surprise," the expected real interest rate must fall to equate

money supply and demand.1 Alxetnattvely.,     Makin (1982.b)   argues from

a structural model that a positive money surprise elevates real

output, income and thereby saving so that a new equilibrium with

higher real investment (equal to higher real saving) requires a

lower expected, after—tax real rate.2 This in turn will see a lower

nominal interest rate at a given level of expected inflation and         at
given levels of any other variables which may affect the expected

after—tax real rate.

        Reconciliation of these findings will be seen likely to depend

upon differences in sampling intervals, different methods of measuring

unobservable money surprises and careful consideration of possible

two—way   causality   between money surprises and   interest rates.    The

intention here is not to "settle" differences in perspective regarding

the relationship between money surprises and interest rates and no

claim is made that all questions raised are satisfactorily resolved.

Rather, the questions explored will hopefully alert investigators

to the particular significance of some seemingly innocuous assumptions

and   measurement techniques.

[I.       Surprises   and Expected   polic7


          There is no conflict between the findings of Makin       (1982.a,
1982.b)    and those of Grossman (1981) and     Roley (1982) which rationalize
a rise in nominal      interest   rates during the one and   one—half hours
                                  3


following a positive money surprise as a response to expected tighten-

ing by the Fed. In Makin (1982.b) the question investigated is

whether, during the quarter in which money is above its anticipated

path, there Is downward pressure on interest rates. Failure to reject

the hypothesis that this is true is not inconsistent with discovery

of a pure expectations effect whereby an announced weekly money supply

number above the consensus forecast results in higher rates over the

period from 3:30 p.m. before the announcement to 5:00 p.m. which in

turn reflects anticipated tightening by the Fed.

         Roley and Grossman are sampling rates over only a one and one

half hour interval precisely in order to capture a pure expectations

effect by reducing to a minimum the possibility that other shocks will

impinge upon the market and occlude its appearance. Alternatively,

Makin's finding with quarterly data is simply that over a quarter

when an effort is made to control for behavior of other variables

operating on the interest rate, it is not possible to reject the hypo-

thesis embedded in his model that money surprises depress the nominal

rate.   The precise form of the quarterly data employed becomes relevant
in   discussing differences between results of Mishkin (1982) and Makin

(1982.a, 1982.b), to which we now turn.


III.    Inflationary Expectations and the Impact of
        Money Surprises


         The results of Mishkin (.1982) and Makin (l982.b) are not as

easily reconciled although a number of avenues can readily be explored
                                             4


as there exist significant differences in both their theoretical frame-

works and in the data employed to test hypotheses.

        Mishkin appears to derive his estimated equation from "the

liquidity preference approach to the demand for money." It is con-

venient to write a money demand equation in log form from which to de-

rive Nishkin's estimating equation.


(1)         (lut
                   —
                       P=             — Yit + Ct                       (B,y   >   0)


where       m = log          of money supply

            Pt =       log   of the price level

                   =   log   of real output

                   =   nominal Interest rate.

Inverting equation (1) and solving for an expression for the nominal

interest rate and for the expected nominal Interest rate as of time

"t—l"   conditional on information at time "t—l" gives:

                             e   =   —l                e               e                   e
(2)                —
                       —1

EquatIon   (2) is essentially Mishkin'S                    equation (8).      Writing a forward
rate as t—l't plus a risk premium and substituting into (2) gives
the final equation estimated by Mishkin:3
                                                                   e                   e
'(3          i_t_iFt         =
                                 _a0_a1a + y
                                                  —l




                             —
                                          1me)
                                          — t    + c ]
                                                       t
where a0+aiCY measures the risk premium.

        Equation (3) implies positive coefficients on output and price

surprises and a negative coefficient on the money surprise. Mishkin

finds the former two positive coefficients but finds a positive coef-

ficient on the money surprise. This he attributes, it appears, to

a rise in inflationary expectations associated with a positive money

surprise.

        Mishkin's result whereby a positive money surprise will elevate

nominal   interest   is not consistent with liquidity preference theory

unless a positive money surprise is taken as a measure of the level

of expected inflation. Alternatively the result may be a statistical

artifact, explainable in terms of failure to take account of relation-

ships among his "independent" explanatory variables, or in terms of

failure to consider a possible response of money surprises to shocks

to money demand (a possibility which Mishkin admits) or in terms of

simple mismeasuremexit of surprises.

        Consider first the relationship between money surprises and price

and   output   surprises, if they are positively correlated as would be

suggested by a number of theories including typical "rational" supply

equations, when the money surprise appears alone on the right—hand

side of equation (3) (as in 1.1 and 1.5 of Mishkin's Table 1) it proxies

for price and output surprises which are positively associated with

unanticipated changes in the interest rate. Indeed when the equation

is re—estimated with price and output surprises present along with

moneysurprises the coefficient on the money surprise term falls by

20 to 30 percent but remains significantly positive, Still, the
                                    6


estimated coefficient on the price surprise term is not significantly

different from zero and the large estimated standard error may be due

to multicollinearity. The best way to answer these questions would

be to look directly at the correlation matrix for the "independent"

variables examined by Mishkin (1982).

       Aiother reason for a positive estimated coefficient on the

money surprise term,   mentioned   briefly by Mishkin, relates to the

possibility that money surprises are positively related to the error

term in the money demand equation. If, during Mishkin's 1959—76 sample

period, positive shocks to money demand caused the Fed to react with

an increase in the money supply in order partially to smooth interest

rates, then the money surprise term proxies for, c, the error term

in the money demand equation which in turn ought to be positively

associated with surprise increases in the interest rate under liquidity

preference theory.

       It is important also to remember that Mishkin (1982) properly

employs end of period interest rates in an effort to capture the hy-

pothesized Impact of a money surprise upon inflationary expectations.

In contrast, to test for liquidity and output effects 1akin (1982.a,

1982.b) employs period average interest rates so that     interest   rates

during, say, the fourth quarter are related to a money surprise which

will not be known until the end of the quarter. This procedure, which

amounts to relating interest rates at time "t—l" to a money surprise

discovered at time "t"   allows    a liquidity or output effect (induced

by money being above or below its expected path over the quarter)
                                 7



to operate before the expectations effect (linked to the appearance

of a money ttsurpriset at quarterts end) appears.

       A final poasible reason for an erroneous inference that money

surprises cause a surprise increase in interest rates stems from a

difficulty inherent in all investigations of the impact of unantici-

pated changes in money or other variables. Does the Investigator's

surprise really measure the actual surprise which confronted economic

agents during the sample period under investigation? A great many

questions arise here which I have discussed at some length elsewhere

in Makin (1982.a, 1982.b). The basic problem in the context of Mishkia's

paper can be stated simply. If his surprise is mismeasured so that it

is partly anticipated then the coefficient on the mismeasured surprise

will be positively biased insofar as anticipated money growth measures

anticipated inflation which is In turn positively correlated with

interest rates. ?,fishkin's univariate model of expected money growth

is an arbitrary AR—4 process. If the residuals from that representa-

tion or from his forecasting equation used in Panel B of Table 1 are

not white noise his money surprise is partly anticipated and the

estimated coefficient on the money surprise will be positively biased.

In fact, this result is likely since Mishkin filters his seasonally

unadjusted data with an AR—4 model which very likely leaves seasonality

in his measure of money surprises. This inference is supported by

Mishkin's reference to unpublished results employing seasonally ad—

justed data for which "standard errors are somewhat larger'1 (p. 70) .4

iv.   Concluding   Remarks


      There is strong evidence that weekly money surprises result by

way of an expected policy response by the Fed, in an immediate (within

1.5 hours) rise in short term interest rates. Such a short interval

of time is required to capture the pure policy expectations effect

advanced by Grossman (1981) and Roley (1982) to explain this result.

These arguments are particularly compelling with regard to the period

since October, 1979 during which the Fed appears to have assigned

more weight to money supply targets than to interest rate targets.

       Most theories suggest that in the absence of a policy expecta-

tions effect a money surprise ought to depress nominal interest rates

either directly (based on liquidity preference theory) or by way of

negative pressure on the expected after—tax real rate required to satisfy

a simple general equilibrium model. Mishkin (1982) argues that his

finding that a positive money surprise causes an unanticipated increase

in short term interest rate is due to the new information that the

positive money surprise conveys about anticipated inflation.

       Mishkin's result is possible reconciliable with Makin's due

to his use of end of period data on interest rates which ought to

capture expectations effects in contrast with Makin's use of period

average data on interest rates which ought to capture liquidity and

output effects. Still, it is important to remember that there exist

four potential sources of positive bias (described in Section Iii)

in the estimated relationship between money surprises and interest

rates reported by Mishkin (1982), Added to this Is the fact that
                                9


better proxies than money surprises exist to measure anticipated

inflation. Makin (1982.a, l982.b) employs survey data, which is only

weakly correlated with money surprises, as a direct measure of anti-

cipated inflation. in the presence of such a direct measure of anti-

cipated inflation, it is not possible toreject the hypothesis that

a surprise increase in money depresses the expected after—tax real

rate and thereby, the nominal interest rate on 3 month Treasury bills.

                         FOOTNOTES


1.   The nominal interest rate must   fall   due to a drop in the ex-

     pected real rate since anticipated inflation will not be nega-

     tively related to a positive money surprise.


2.   The positive income effect also elevates real money demand

     thereby putting positive pressure on the real rate, but the

     impact of the saving effect is likely to dominate for typical

     values of the interest elasticity of money demand as shown in

     Makin (l982.b).


3.   Mishkin's equation actually has surprise growth rates of the

     right—hand side variables in equation (3) but this is identical

4.   Using seasonally unadjusted data, all eight oe Mishkin's reported

     money surprise terms are significant at the 5 percent level

     or better (with 6 of 8 significant at the 1 percent level).

     Using seasonally adjusted data, Mishkin (1981) reports only 1

     2 of 8 significant at the 5 percent level and 5 of 8 not

     significant at the 5 percent level.
