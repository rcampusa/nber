                                          ABSTRACT

The literature on "missing girls" suggests a net preference for sons both in China and among
Chinese immigrants to the West. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that newborn Chinese-American
girls are treated more intensively in US hospitals: they are kept longer following delivery, have
more medical procedures performed, and have more hospital charges than predicted (by the non-
Chinese gender difference). What might explain more aggressive medical treatment? We posit
that hospitals are responding to worse health at birth of Chinese-American girls. We document
higher rates of low birth weight, congenital anomalies, maternal hypertension, and lower APGAR
scores among Chinese Americans girls ­ outcomes recorded prior to intensive neonatal medical
care and relative to the non-Chinese gender gap. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
find that son preference may also compromise "survivor" health at birth. On net, compromised
newborn health seems to outweigh the benefit of more aggressive neonatal hospital care for girls.
Relative to non-Chinese gender differences, death on the first day of life and in the post-neonatal
period is more common among Chinese-American girls, i.e. later than sex selection is typically
believed to occur.

1         Introduction
It is well known that sex selection occurs not only in Asia but among Asian
immigrants to the West. If parents vary in their degree of son preference, par-
ents having daughters after sex selection becomes routine are likely to be those
parents with milder son preference. This compositional effect could lead to an
increase in parental investments in girls [Goodkind, 1996, Hu and Schlosser,
2015, Anukriti et al., 2018]. On the other hand, prenatal sex determination
allows discrimination against girls to commence before birth, which has been
found for parent-reported investments in girls in Asia [Bharadwaj and Lak-
dawala, 2013]. These competing forces mean that the health of those girls who
"survive" prenatal sex selection could either improve or deteriorate, rendering
net health impacts an empirical question. To date, the literature has been
more focussed on investment measures reported in surveys than on health it-
self, presumably because of the scarcity of administrative health microdata in
Asia.
        Immigrants to the West offer the advantage of being observed in universal,
administrative data on health [Lhila and Simon, 2008]. Nevertheless, no work
to date has shown that Asian girls are systematically in either better or worse
early childhood health following the increase in sex selection. Rates of sex se-
lection are lower among Asian immigrants to the West than in Asia, which per
se would reduce compositional effects that might benefit surviving girls.1 The
seminal study by Lhila and Simon [2008] found no evidence of gender bias in
prenatal investments among sex selection "survivors" in the US. Should com-
promised early childhood health be established for Asian girls in the West, this
might be a particular concern given the long-term developmental effects that
arise from differences in early childhood health [Barker, 1992]. Furthermore,
compromised female health would be a "modern phenomenon" appearing after
    1
   We address the question of "survivor bias" in the discussion of Table 3 results. In
sum, the relatively modest elevation of sex ratios compared to China circumscribes the
compositional effect in the US, especially for first-parity births (sex ratio of 1.07).


                                          1
the diffusion of prenatal sex determination in the 1980s and thus impacting
cohorts reaching adulthood today.
      Here we consider the perinatal health and neonatal hospital care of Chinese-
Americans, roughly 1.2% of the US population.2 Son preference has been
extensively documented for China, e.g. Sen [1992], Yi et al. [1993], Edlund
[1999], DasGupta et al. [2003], Chen et al. [2013]. High sex ratios have also
been observed among Asian immigrants to the West [Dubuc and Coleman,
2007, Lhila and Simon, 2008, Almond and Edlund, 2008, Abrevaya, 2009,
Almond, Edlund, and Milligan, 2013]. We start by confirming that sex ratios at
birth are indeed elevated for Chinese Americans in US natality data, indicating
that an average son preference persists. At these magnitudes, roughly 97% of
Chinese-American girls were not sex selected prenatally. We turn our attention
to female "survivors" and their health.
      Although newborn boys offer a ready counterfactual, they are substantially
less healthy biologically than girls [Kraemer, 2000]. Rather than expecting
equality, the gender benchmark is nuanced: how large a female heath advan-
tage should we see? In considering neonatal care provided by hospitals in the
context of better average health of girls, how much less intensive should we
expect medical treatment to be?
      To account for baseline gender differences in outcomes and medical treat-
ments, we analyze perinatal health and neonatal care in a standard difference-
in-differences framework. For binary outcomes, we also show logit specifica-
tions which allow for non-additive effects of race and gender. As a placebo
check, we also consider whether Chinese girls appear disadvantaged in the
US in the years prior to ultrasound diffusion (compared to the pre-ultrasound
gender gap among Whites). Were Whites providing a misleading estimate of
the gender gap, we should see "impacts" in the the pre-ultrasound period as
well. Second, Filipinos in the West may have less son preference and share a
  2
    The World Health Organization defines the perinatal period as spanning 22 weeks ges-
tation to 7 days after birth.



                                           2
"broadly Asian genetic" with Chinese [Almond, Edlund, and Milligan, 2013].3
While we lose precision (particularly for mortality), we show a similar ba-
sic pattern of health results when we compare Chinese Americans to Filipino
Americans. We also quantify gender gaps among White and Filipino in our
natality sample and overlay these differences in Figure 1. This pattern of simi-
lar gender gaps conditional on the specific health outcome considered supports
our identifying assumption that biological drivers of gender gaps are similar
across race.4
       Across a wide range of health measures, we find that Chinese American girls
are in compromised health. Morbidity outcomes are worse for girls, including
lower APGAR score, more congenital anomalies,5 and a greater likelihood of
low birth weight. Stillbirth is significantly more common for Chinese American
girls than we should expect. The female health disadvantage tends to be larger
in Chinese American families where the mother has less education and where
both mother and father are Chinese. "First generation" immigrant parents
make up about 90% of our sample and drive the female health disadvantage.
       Turning to hospital discharge records for New York, Chinese girls tend to
stay longer in the hospital postnatally, have higher charges, and receive more
hospital procedures, consistent with medical care attempting to counteract a
health disadvantage clinicians observe at birth. Nevertheless, death on the
first day of life and childhood deaths from age 1 month to 12 years are more
common among girls than expected, particularly for disease-related causes.6
Following discharge, Chinese American girls are less likely to be brought back
   3
      Meyer [1995] also advocates showing results that are benchmarked against multiple
control groups.
    4
      If the boy-girl differences in perinatal health are race specific, we would expect to see
large horizontal distances between gender gaps among White and Filipino. However, Figure
1 shows the opposite: the magnitudes of gender differences are similar for Whites. For
example, the gender gap for 5-minute APGAR score is around .025 for both Whites and
Filipinos and the gender gap for low birthweight is around .007.
    5
      Congenital anomalies result from both the prenatal environment and genetic causes
[Weinhold, 2009, Sarmah et al., 2016]. "Congenital" comes from the latin congenitus, mean-
ing present from birth.

      Deaths not attributed to accidents, suicide, homicide, or other "external" causes.

to the hospital. This re-admission gap grows when we factor in their worse
health at birth. To our knowledge, ours is the first evidence that Chinese girls
begin life in compromised health.
    Our paper is organized as follows. First, we provide a brief literature
review (Section 2) and describe our empirical methodology (Section 3) which
starts with and builds on a conventional difference-in-differences model. We
describe the data (Section 4), present our findings (Section 5), and conclude
with a discussion (Section 6).



2     Literature Review
Four literatures are most relevant to our study.
    First, that girls have better health than boys has been extensively docu-
mented in public health. Women are "hardier than men and, given similar
care, survive better at all ages ­ including in utero" [Sen, 1992]. For example,
boys in the US are 21% more likely to die in the first year of life than girls
[Xu et al., 2016]. Kraemer [2000] argues that the male is more "fragile" during
prenatal and neonatal periods. The sex ratio decreases from the initial excess
of around 120 male conceptions per female to 105 at birth. Perinatal brain
damage, congenital deformities, and stillbirth are also more common in boys.
    Second, son preference exists in China and persists among some Chinese
immigrants to the West. (These studies focus on the "extensive" margin and
do not consider the health of sex selection "survivors".7 ) Empirical evidence for
this preference comes chiefly from "missing girls" [Sen, 1992], which typically
follow an older sister(s) [Yi et al., 1993, Duflo, 2012]. Indeed, a demographic
regularity is that sex selection is muted for the first child, but becomes pro-
nounced at higher birth order children. Almond and Edlund [2008] document
   7
     We are aware of two exceptions. Gonzlez [2018] considered both sex selection and early
childhood health among Indian immigrants to Spain, finding no evidence of a excess gap in
infant health. A working paper by Muchomba and Chatterji [2020] considers gender gaps
in disability among Asian immigrants to the US.



                                            4
male-biased sex ratios among US-born children of Chinese, Korean, and Asian
Indian parents in a 5% sample of the 2000 US Census. These heightened sex
ratios appear at higher birth orders if there was no previous (elder) son. Al-
mond, Edlund, and Milligan [2013] document a similar pattern for Asians in
Canadian Census data, and argue that Filipinos (along with Whites) provide
a suitable control group because of similar biology and the relative absence of
son preference.8 , 9
    Third, a smaller literature has analyzed prenatal investment measures (cf.
administrative health outcomes data) in the context of son preference. Bharad-
waj and Lakdawala [2013] document preferential treatment of boys in utero
in India following ultrasound, including more frequent prenatal visits and vac-
cinations. Their context is one of substantially stronger son preference as
reflected by a sex ratio of 1.22 versus 1.08 among Chinese-Americans (and a
biological benchmark of 1.05-1.06). Our analysis can be viewed as assessing
whether female "survivors" exhibit worse health ­ as opposed to investments ­
in a less extreme context. We do not think Bharadwaj and Lakdawala [2013]'s
finding tells us what we would find for Chinese American health, particularly
as Hu and Schlosser [2015], Anukriti et al. [2018] reach the opposite conclusion
for India: surviving girls do better thanks to ultrasound (see below).
    A seminal study by Lhila and Simon [2008] considers Asian immigrants
to the US. First, they document that sex ratios increase at higher parities
for Chinese and Asian Indian births in the US. Leveraging information from
US birth certificates on reported ultrasound usage, they find no gender bias
in prenatal investments. As Lhila and Simon [2008] acknowledge, reporting
an ultrasound procedure is an imperfect indicator for knowing fetal gender, in
part because reported ultrasound use may include obstetrical ultrasounds that
   8
     Among Chinese in Canada, the sex ratio of the third child was 1.38 following 2 elder
daughters [Almond, Edlund, and Milligan, 2013, Endnote #13].
   9
     Economists have modeled son preference in Asia as child gender providing utility directly
to parents [Edlund, 1999]. If sex-selective abortion is costly (including its psychological
costs), some parents who prefer sons will continue to have daughters even if prenatal sex
determination is relatively inexpensive [Almond, Li, and Zhang, 2019].



                                              5
occur at delivery (too late for prenatal investments to respond). Additionally,
parents may be less likely to report truthfully having received an ultrasound
if it was motivated by son preference (a second source of measurement er-
ror, and one highlighted by Bharadwaj and Lakdawala [2013] for India where
prenatal sex determination is illegal). Similar concerns may exist for other
self-reported investment measures, such as the number of parental care visits.
Third, requesting an ultrasound may be endogenous to son preference, and
even absent measurement error may introduce bias to regression parameters
from endogenous control [Angrist and Pischke, 2009].10
       As we do not have an instrumental variable which might address these
econometric issues,11 we ignore individual-level information on reported ultra-
sound use and focus instead on administrative and clinical measures of health
that are not reported by parents.12 In the absence of a natural experiment,
our results may be viewed as descriptive. That said, we will take a stronger
stand insofar as the analysis of firstborn children are concerned, as their sex
ratio is relatively normal.
       Finally, we note that in the handful of studies when health outcomes
instead of investments have been considered, ultrasound has been found to
improve girls' outcomes. The increase in ultrasound availability in India led
to substantial improvements in the relative survival, i.e. under-5 mortality, of
girls after birth [Anukriti et al., 2018]. Hu and Schlosser [2015] show that an
increase in the practice of prenatal sex selection, approximated by sex ratios at
birth, leads to a reduction in the prevalence of malnutrition among surviving
girls in India. Consistent with the compositional effect posited by Goodkind
  10
       Lhila and Simon [2008] acknowledge: "The identification of the effect of knowing fetal
gender rests on the assumption that ultrasound receipt is not correlated with unobserved
factors, specifically gender preference" and "Admittedly, measurement error may have biased
our results downward to the point that we fail to capture the true effect of knowing fetal
gender on prenatal investments."
   11
      In annual American Hospital Association data on facilities, ultrasound machines that
would be used for prenatal exams are not distinguished from other ultrasound equipment,
cf. Chen et al. [2013].
   12
      By ignoring the parent-reported health investment measures, we depart from both
Bharadwaj and Lakdawala [2013] and Lhila and Simon [2008].


                                             6
[1996], these findings highlight the importance of considering the magnitude
of sex selection when analyzing gender gaps in health.



3     Methodology
We begin with a standard difference-in-difference (DD) comparison:

    yi =  + c · Chinesei +  · F emalei + c · F emalei · Chinesei + i .        (1)

Estimates of  , c , and  are reported in Tables 2 and 5. The coefficient of in-
terest, c , captures the additional gender difference among Chinese-Americans,
and is reported tables 2, 4, and 5
    Assuming the gender gap among Whites () is biological, we might worry
that differences in average birth outcomes by race complicate the (additive)
extrapolation of  to Chinese. For example, because congenital anomalies are
about half as common among Chinese as among Whites, the White female
advantage  might overstate the expected biological gender difference among
Chinese, making c an overestimate of gender discrimination among Chinese.
The magnitude (and even sign) of this DD "mistake" will differ depending
on the particular health outcome considered (we consider sixteen different
outcomes yi ).
    The simplest way to address this potential issue is to estimate logit models
for binary outcome variables. For non-binary outcomes, we could log the
dependent variable. As shown in Appendices A and B, logit and logging avoid
this potential DD "mistake" by adopting a multiplicative relationship. We note
the issue being addressed here is distinct from the conventional motivation for
a logit model over a linear probability model. In Tables 2, 4, and 5 we report
both with conventional DD (linear probability model) results alongside logit
results.
    That said, it is not necessary to adopt a logit model (or log the dependent
variable) to address this issue. In Table 6, we present "calculated effects" which

                                        7
build more directly on equation (1). For these, we assume  is a scalar of the
White male average:  =  ·  (with different 's for different health outcomes).
Carrying this assumption to Chinese implies c can be decomposed into two
parts: a biological part that depends on race ( · c ) and an unexplained
residual, which we denote 13 and refer to it as the "calculated effect". That
is:
                                     C =  · C +  .                                      (2)

If this simple multiplicative model is correct,  · c is the implied adjustment
to the ordinary DD estimate c . This adjustment is larger for outcomes with:
i) larger biological gender gaps ; ii) larger racial differences. Under the above
multiplicative assumption, the conventional DD estimate c remains "correct"
(i.e. interpretable as discrimination) if biological gender differences or racial
differences are 0.14 Estimates of  using the above procedure are equivalent
to those obtained if one normalized White outcomes by the White male mean
and Chinese outcomes by the Chinese male mean, and then regressed these on
the Chinese and gender dummy and their interaction.15 , 16
       This adjusted DD model is appropriate for both binary and continuous
outcome measures and returns estimates in absolute terms (units of the un-
transformed dependent variable) and can viewed as a decomposition of any
DD model estimated in levels. Nevertheless, we focus on the unadjusted DD
model and logit estimates due to their familiarity. Furthermore, our results
  13
      Standard errors are estimated using the  -method.
  14
      We construct a matched control group in an attempt to reduce racial differences in
male average outcomes using a subsample of White babies based on geographic informa-
tion (mother's state and county of residence) and maternal characteristics (marital status,
education, and age). We obtain similar effect estimates without applying our (gratuitous)
adjustment to DD estimates. That said, for most outcomes it is difficult to find White
subgroups with comparably good outcomes as Chinese using the available control variables.
Furthermore, we only conduct this exercise for 1989-2002, when the more precise geocodes
are available in the natality data.
   15
      With the caveat that normalization returns coefficients interpreted as percents. See
Appendix Section C for details.
   16
      Both approaches implicitly allow for Chinese girls to be discriminated against. If one
thought instead Chinese boys are discriminated for, then one would "correct" male outcomes
and normalize by female means. This alternative normalization yields similar estimates, see
Appendix Table S6.


                                             8
are similar across the two sets of approaches.



4        Data
We analyze births occurring in the US using US Vital Statistics microdata from
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and New York (NY) state
hospital discharge data (1993-2013) from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization
Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Databases (SID). We combine fetal death files
(1989-2005)17 and mortality files (1989-2015) to assess the gender composition
of mortality. We use natality files (1989-2013) for morbidity outcomes and
linked birth/infant death files (1989-1991, 1995-2010)18 for mortality. One
limitation of our data is that we cannot link natality data to hospital discharge
records. Nor can we match siblings in any dataset.
       Maternal race is reported in the natality, linked birth/infant death, and
fetal death data. Mortality data and hospital discharge records only report
race of the decedent (patient). We use race of mother where available, and the
child's race where it is unavailable.19
       We include Chinese, Whites,20 and Filipinos in our analysis. We exclude:
i) multiple births in natality, linked birth/infant death, and NY hospital dis-
charge data, for whom birth order has a distinct interpretation; ii) foreign
resident mothers in US natality and linked birth/infant death data, so as to
remove "birth tourists" who might base their travel decision in part on knowl-
  17
     Chinese is not separately identified from other Asian races in fetal death data after 2005.
  18
     NCHS did not produce Linked Birth/Infant Death Files for 1992-1994. No decedent
age is reported after 2010.
  19
     NCHS likewise adopted this race assignment rule in summary statistics beginning in
1989.
  20
     We take a 10% random sample of White births to make the sample size more manageable
for analysis.

edge of fetal gender;21 and iii) mortality records for foreign-born decedents.22
Because no subcategories of "Asian" race are reported in the hospital dis-
charge data, we omit the Filipino group and "isolate" Chinese by including
only Asian residents in zip codes with a Chinese to Asian ratio above 0.5.23
Our final analysis sample consists of: a) 7, 649, 124 White, 822, 825 Chinese,
and 785, 189 Filipino births in US Vital Statistics data, and b) 2, 415, 040
White and 136, 828 "Chinese" (out of 282, 147 Asian) births in NY hospital
discharge data.



5      Results
We organize results by health outcome: death from mortality microdata (Table
1), perinatal outcomes from birth certificates (Table 2, 3, and 4), and hospital
discharge outcomes (Table 5). We take logit estimates as our preferred measure
as they address the issue that arises from differences in average outcomes by
race. To facilitate the interpretation of effect magnitudes, we provide estimates
in absolute terms (units of the un-transformed dependent variable), i.e. our
"calculated effects" introduced in Section 3, in Table 6. Across the three
datasets, we see Chinese females appear to be at a disadvantage. First, we
note that the sex ratio at birth among Chinese in the US is 1.08, versus 1.05
for Whites (Appendix Table S1).
  21
     We are unaware of any previous analysis of this question. Foreign resident mothers
who give birth in the US are a small fraction of total US births: .17% for Whites, .09%
for Chinese, and .05% for Filipino mothers. White non-resident births are 0.4 percentage
point more likely to be male (not statistically significant), Chinese non-resident births are
2.8 percentage points more likely to be male (not statistically significant), and Filipino non-
residents 3.1 percentage points less likely to be male (not statistically significant) when
compared with the fraction of male births among US-resident mothers (of the same race).
Future research might consider the sex ratio of additional non-resident subpopulations giving
birth in the US.
  22
     Because gender-biased immigration of children could also confound our analysis.
  23
     California also has a large population of Chinese immigrants. However, California's hos-
pital discharge data do not report patients' zip code, so we are unable to narrow California's
"Asian" patients toward Chinese.

5.1       Death certificate microdata

Table 1 reports the fraction of male deaths during the late fetal (i.e. stillbirth),
neonatal, and post-neonatal periods. Compared to US Whites, the fraction
male among Chinese American decedents is 2-4 percentage points lower.24
Among 1,603 fetal deaths, the fetus is 3.8 percentage points less likely to be
male among Chinese (significant at the 1% level) than the corresponding White
gender difference. The gap in overall neonatal death (-.021, not reported) is
driven by death on the first day of life: the decedent is 4.1 percentage points
less likely to be male in their first 24 hours of life among 838 Chinese deaths
(significant at the 5% level) compared to the White gender gap. We define
post-neonatal childhood deaths as running from 1 month to 12 years of age
(1,587 Chinese deaths). The gender gap in post-neonatal death is driven by
1,289 disease-related deaths.25
       Our finding that excess female mortality occurs after birth is broadly con-
sistent with Anderson and Ray [2010], who argue that in developing countries,
"missing women" manifest later in life than commonly believed. However,
for China this gender gap emerges early in life and reappears at substantially
older ages, driven by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Thus, postnatal
childhood deaths in China play a smaller role than in India [Anderson and
Ray, 2010]. Moreover, to the extent that diffusion of diagnostic ultrasound
in China enabled prenatal discrimination and thereby worse health later in
life, affected cohorts were too young to drive the increased cardiovascular and
respiratory diseases observed by Anderson and Ray [2010]. Finally, we de-
part from Anderson and Ray [2010] by analyzing excess female morality in a
developed country, along with morbidity outcomes.
       When comparing Chinese Americans to Filipino Americans instead of Whites,
  24
     Among Asian racial groups in the US, Chinese shows the lowest fraction male for peri-
natal mortality [Almond and Cheng, 2016, Table 1]. To the extent this reflects average son
preference, we argue Chinese-Americans are of particular interest when analyzing mortality
and perinatal health outcomes (in the subsequent morbidity analysis).

we observe similar patterns but less precise point estimates due to smaller sam-
ple sizes in the control group. Nevertheless, the gender gap in fetal deaths and
death on day 1 of life differs statistically for Chinese and Filipinos. These ex-
cess female fetal deaths among Chinese Americans contribute to the high sex
ratio at birth above and beyond the effect of sex-selective abortion. Live-born
Chinese American girls also die too often, which is a new finding suggesting
morbidity at birth.


5.2      Birth certificate microdata

We examine perinatal outcomes during the post-ultrasound period (1989-2013)
using natality microdata. The DD coefficients are presented in Table 2's
top panel and logit estimates26 in the corresponding bottom panel. Linked
birth/infant death data allow us to revisit neonatal deaths with birth as the
unit of analysis.27 Consistent with the patterns in Table 1, our logit esti-
mates in Table 2 show that the probability of death within 1 day increases
by 33.2% among Chinese-American girls.28 The female advantage in neonatal
deaths among US Whites is eliminated and indeed reversed among Chinese.
However, we find no effect on death days 1 to 28 of life.29 Beyond mortality,
female Chinese American neonates have a 3.0% increase in probability of low
birth weight than projected by the US White gender gap. Low birth weight
may be a better measure than average birthweight because of the non-linear
relationship between birthweight and health [Almond, Chay, and Lee, 2005]
and because the differential adoption of c-sections will confound our estimates
  26
     Logit estimates are to be interpreted as percent change by its multiplicative feature.
See Appendix Section B for details.
  27
     We cannot perform the same analysis on fetal deaths and post-neonatal deaths (up to
age 12) due to lack of linked live-birth data.
  28
     We also explored following Clarke, Oreffice, and Quintana-Domeque [2019] and adopting
adjusted critical values for t statistics to counter over-rejection of null hypotheses with large
sample sizes [Leamer, 1978]. Our effects on perinatal outcomes remain significant except for
low birth weight.

for relatively normal birthweights.30 Five-minute APGAR scores and congen-
ital anomalies show similar disadvantages among female Chinese Americans.
The logit estimates in Table 2 show that Chinese American girls are 4.05%
more likely to have APGAR scores below 8 and their probability of having
congenital anomalies is 16.1% higher. The last two columns show effects on
pregnancy-related and chronic (pre-pregnancy) maternal hypertension. We
find that Chinese mothers in the US who are pregnant with a baby girl are
5.75% more likely to have pregnancy-related hypertension. We do not ob-
serve a corresponding difference in chronic (pre-pregnancy) hypertension, a
"placebo" outcome. While a cortisol-based measure of stress would be pre-
ferred, we hypothesize that Chinese mothers with a baby girl might experience
more stress or less support during pregnancy from their families.
       Table 3 divides our analysis sample into subgroups. Among families where
both parents are Chinese, effects on low birth weight, APGAR score, con-
genital anomalies, and pregnancy-related hypertension increase in magnitude.
The effect on death within 1 day have a slightly smaller magnitude but re-
mains significant. The elevated sex ratio among Chinese Americans generates
concern of compositional effects due to sex selection. But the sex ratio among
Chinese first parity births is 1.07, which is close to the biological normal ratio
of 1.05 or 1.06. We view the first child's sex as relatively exogenous and see
how parents respond to it [Ben-Porath and Welch, 1976].31 Most of the effects
among female Chinese Americans remain statistically significant among first
parity births. The effect on low birth weight doubles in magnitude compared
to the full sample. One exception is that the increase in the probability of
  30
      We find Chinese American boys have a 1.95% higher probability of c-section, see Al-
mond, Chee, Sviatschi, and Zhong [2015]. This leads to a mechanical reduction in gestation
length (estimated as 4.5 hours) and average birth weight. See Appendix Table S3. If we
ignore the issue of endogenous sample selection and restrict the sample to vaginal births,
we find similar results.
   31
      We know of no evidence that boys are selectively aborted among Chinese, which could
offset selective abortion of females to yield normal sex ratios. Therefore, we interpret rela-
tively normal sex ratios as reflecting low or no sex selection, and thereby a natural experi-
ment in child sex at first parity.




                                             13
death within 1 day is entirely driven by higher parity births. We also investi-
gate whether our findings differ by maternal education levels and find larger
effects among less educated Chinese mothers across all outcomes except for
APGAR score below 8. Finally, we compare effects among first generation
(foreign born) and second generation (US born) Chinese mothers (Appendix
Table S4). Not surprisingly, negative effects among Chinese American girls
are mostly concentrated among first generation families. That said, US-born
Chinese mothers are only 10% of Chinese mothers in our sample. Separately,
we lose significance on low birth wright in all groups for this shorter sample
period.32
       We repeat our analysis using natality data prior to ultrasound diffusion
(1968-1980) as a falsification test. Although coefficients in Table 4 column 1
and 2 are less precisely estimated due to the smaller sample size (the number
of Chinese births grows over time), all coefficients are substantially smaller
and indeed take the opposite sign from what "son-preference" would suggest.
This pattern is consistent with our hypothesis that female Chinese Ameri-
can babies were protected in the womb due to the possibility they might be
male. Moreover, this raises confidence that our effects are not from biolog-
ical differences between White and Chinese. Another approach to the same
issue is to use Filipino Americans as an alternative control group, following
Almond, Edlund, and Milligan [2013]. The coefficients show a very similar
pattern in Table 4 column 5 and 6 except that effects on congenital anomalies
and pregnancy-related hypertension lose their significance. Our estimates are
also robust to including maternal covariates (maternal age, education, marital
status) and birth order, as shown in Appendix Table S5.33
  32
     Since mother's birth country is reported in birth data up to 2004, we adopt a shorter
sample period in Appendix Table S4.
  33
     For example, Ahsan and Maharaj (2018) found that higher maternal education (which
differs by race) has a positive effect on neonatal health.




                                           14
5.3      Hospital discharge microdata

If health among female Chinese Americans is worse at birth than expected,
how do hospitals react? Using discharge data from New York, we see that
hospitals appear to try and counteract such adverse health. Table 5 shows
that "Chinese"34 female babies in New York stay 0.59% longer in hospital,
incur 5.08% higher total charges, and receive 25.2% more procedures when
compared to Whites.35 , 36 However, after discharge from hospital, they are less
likely to be re-admitted despite higher than expected mortality.37 The re-
admission probability during the neonatal period (28-day) is 11.0% lower for
Chinese American girls. The magnitude of this gap increases to 18.2% when
we take into account their observed health disadvantage at birth. Turning to
re-admission probability during the birth year, Chinese girls are 8.01% less
likely to be readmitted, and adding at-birth controls increases this negative
effect to 14.9%. In terms of the intensive margin, Chinese American girls
have fewer readmissions during their birth year than projected by US Whites,
reported in Appendix Table S3. This frequency gap is statistically significant
and larger after controlling for health at birth.


5.4      "Calculated effects"

Section 3 highlights that the unadjusted DD estimates may be compromised
by differential average birth outcomes by race. Logit model or log dependent
variable could address this issue and provide effect estimates in terms of per-
centage changes. To provide effect estimates in absolute terms (units of the
un-transformed dependent variable), we summarize our "calculated effects" on
  34
     See Section 4 for race designations and assignment in New York's hospital discharge
data.
  35
     Estimates are robust to including hospital fixed effects. This helps address the possibility
that our effects are driven by parents' gender-biased choice of the birth hospital. It also
helps alleviate concern about compositional effects from "birth tourists" to the extent that
mothers arriving from abroad tend to give birth at certain hospitals. See also footnote 21.
  36
     We log these outcomes because they are right-skewed [Manning and Mullahy, 2001].
  37
     Analyses of readmission are performed on data with readmission linkage, i.e. 2003-2013.


                                               15
birth outcomes in Table 6.
    Column 1 summarizes adjusted effects from the DD estimates in Table 2.
Chinese American girls have a 0.030 percentage points increase in probability
of death within 1 day, and the probability of low birth weight increases by
0.135 percentage points. APGAR score (non-binary measure) is 0.0128 lower
on average, and the probability of congenital anomalies is 0.065 percentage
points higher among Chinese American girls than projected by the US White
gender gap. Similar to the patterns in Table 3, effect magnitudes are larger
among families where both parents are Chinese except for death within 1 day
and pregnancy-related hypertension. Comparing first parity births, where we
believe the child's sex as relatively exogenous, to higher parity births, the
effect on low birth weight is completely driven by the first parity. It is worth
noting that estimated effects on APGAR score are significant and similar in
magnitude among the two birth groups despite the small point estimates on
the binary APGAR score measure. Analyses by maternal education levels
indicate larger effects among less educated Chinese mothers across most of
birth outcomes, same as shown in Table 3.



6     Discussion
Son preference in the US is not confined to sex-selective abortion. Among Chi-
nese Americans, female death is more common both in the perinatal period
and in childhood than we should expect. Moreover, perinatal health outcomes
among Chinese American girls are worse. Hospitals seem to respond to worse
neonatal health with longer stays, higher charges, and more medical proce-
dures. But these countermeasures do not eliminate the unexpected gender
gap in health (as captured by subsequent mortality). After delivery, girls are
less likely to be re-admitted to the hospital, a decision about which parents
have some discretion. This re-admission deficit grows when we factor in their
worse health at birth.


                                      16
       The strong biological advantage enjoyed by females in early childhood
health helps mask our finding.38 Gender equality is simply the wrong coun-
terfactual. Compromised perinatal health has persistent effects later in life
[Barker, 1992] even for small differences in health around birth [Almond, Cur-
rie, and Duque, 2018] and for outcomes other than adult health, e.g. wages.
The pre-ultrasound veil of ignorance that once protected girls from son prefer-
ence has been eliminated, and future gender inequality may be "programmed"
as a result. Now that prenatal sex determination is routine, sex selection
does allow those with particularly strong son preference to abort girls, which
would tend to improve outcomes for surviving girls [Goodkind, 1996, Hu and
Schlosser, 2015, Anukriti et al., 2018]. Our effects on perinatal health over-
whelm any selection effect. Rates of sex selection among Chinese Americans
(as inferred from sex ratios) are lower than in China or India, which circum-
scribes the compositional effect of sex selection.39 At first parity, the sex ratio
of 1.07 is within 2% of the biological norm, further reducing the scope for
compositional effects.
       A limitation of our study is that we do not identify the mechanism(s)
by which this detriment to female health emerges in the US. Our data do not
include administrative measures of health investments, only self-reported ones.
Moreover, some of the gender differential investment may be unconscious,
including greater feelings of stress if a girl is expected.40 Nor do we know the
share of Chinese parents that respond to fetal sex in a way that harms girls. It
would be consistent with our results if a majority of Chinese-American parents
did not react in this way.
       We hypothesize son preference extends beyond sex-selective abortion (and
  38
     For most outcomes, Chinese girls still do better than Chinese males and White females.
  39
     Nor do we leverage variation in sex selection for identification, cf. Hu and Schlosser
[2015], which would tend to accentuate the compositional effect [Bharadwaj and Lakdawala,
2013].
  40
     Bereavement stress during pregnancy, which Persson and Rossin-Slater [2018] find com-
promises the later-life mental health of the fetus, has a similar impact on low birth weight
as our preferred estimate in Table 3: .00293 versus .00358 for the death of a close relative
in [Persson and Rossin-Slater, 2018, Table 2].



                                            17
postnatal discrimination) to perinatal health in China. Absent corresponding
administrative data for China, we are unable to evaluate this hypothesis di-
rectly. Our prior is that son preference would not be strongest among Chinese
who emigrate to the US. That sex ratios at birth are higher in China than
among Chinese Americans is consistent with attenuated son preference in the
US. Compositional effects from sex selection aside, the average effects we es-
timate may then be a lower bound for the 8 million girls born each year in
China.

 Note: Analyses of readmission are performed on data with readmission linkage, i.e. 2003-2013. We include birth year fixed
effects in all regressions. At-birth covariates include insurance types, total hospital charges, length of stay, and the number of
procedures. We use log(y+1) in all log outcomes to include zero values. This will attenuate slightly estimated magnitudes, more
so for outcomes with a low mean (number of procedures). We "isolate" Chinese from other Asian races by including only Asian
residents in zip code areas with dominantly Chinese.

A       Log DD Model
We derive the correspondence between estimates of  introduced in Section 3
and coefficients from a log DD model.
      Consider a DD model of log outcomes:


 log (yi ) =  + c · Chinesei +  · F emalei + c · F emalei · Chinesei + i . (3)


Applying the approximation ex  1 + x:


yi = e +c ·Chinesei +·F emalei +c ·F emalei ·Chinesei +i ,

yi  e (1 + c · Chinesei )(1 +  · F emalei )(1 + c · F emalei · Chinesei ) + ei ,

yi = (e + e c · Chinesei )(1 +  · F emalei )(1 + c · F emalei · Chinesei ) + ei ,

yi = (e + e c · Chinesei )(1 +  · F emalei ),

         +c (e + e c · Chinesei )(1 +  · F emalei ) · F emalei · Chinesei + ei ,

yi = e + e c · Chinesei + e  · F emalei + e c  · F emalei · Chinesei ,

         +c ((e + e c )(1 + )) · F emalei · Chinesei + ei .


We have the correspondence between equations (1) and (3):  = log ( ), c =
c        

  ,   ==  , and  = c ( + c )(1 + ). That is, c identifies the effect as
a percentage of the Chinese female average.




                                            27
B        Logit DD Model
Consider the standard logistic DD regression model on a binary outcome Y :

                                                       1
            P (Yi = 1) =                                                                .   (4)
                            1+   e-( +c ·Chinesei +·F emalei +c ·F emalei ·Chinesei )

We derive the race- and gender-specific predicted odds,

                    P (Ywm = 1)                              P (Ywf = 1)
        oddswm =                = e ,           oddswf =                  = e + ,
                    P (Ywm = 0)                              P (Ywf = 0)
                 P (Ycm = 1)                                 P (Ycf = 1)
      oddscm   =             = e +c ,           oddscf     =             = e +c ++c .
                 P (Ycm = 0)                                 P (Ycf = 0)

That is, we derive a log DD model 3 on odds:


    log (oddsi ) =  + c · Chinesei +  · F emalei + c · F emalei · Chinesei .


Any interpretation of coefficients derived in Appendix A applies to logit DD
model in terms of odds.41




 41
      If the probability of occurrence is small, oddsi  P (Yi = 1).


                                               28
C      Normalized DD Model
We develop an equivalent DD specification by normalizing outcomes based on
the race-specific male average, i.e. a normalized DD model.
    Consider DD specification (1) in Section 3:


     yi =  + c · Chinesei +  · F emalei + c · F emalei · Chinesei + i .


Assuming  =  ·  and c =  · c + , we derive race-gender specific averages


          y
          ¯wm =  ,          y
                            ¯wf =  +  =  (1 + ),

          y
          ¯cm =  + c ,      y
                            ¯cf =  + c +  + c = ( + c )(1 + ) + .


Denote race-specific normalized outcomes

                  yiw
          ~iw 
          y           = 1 +  · F emaleiw + ~iw ,
                  y
                  ¯wm
                  yic                        
           y
           ~ic        = 1 +  · F emaleic +       · F emaleic + ~ic .
                  y
                  ¯cm                       + c

That is


    ~i =  + c · Chinesei +  · F emalei + c · F emalei · Chinesei + 
    y                                                              ~i ,   (5)


where  = 1,  = , c = 0, and  = c · ( + c ). That is, c identifies the
effect as a percentage of the Chinese male average.
