Municipal   unions may often use their own      votes and those of sympathetic
fellow citizens to promote increases in demand for municipal services.

If successful, this strategy can increase member employment levels

withoutsacri.ficingcompensation Municipal employeeunjonjzat sig—
nifcmntIy increases levels of annual manhours and employment per

capita, and reduces annual hours of work per employee. The net effect of

average unionization levels is to increase employees per capita by at

least 4.7,, and manhours per capita by at least 3.3/., over levels that

would prevail in the absence of municipal unions. These effects occur

almost entirely in functions with recognized bargaining units. In these

functions, employment levels are at least 9.9Y higher than they would be

in the absence of unionization.

 Unions in the private sector place positive value on member employment

 as well as on member compensation. However, private
                                                         sector unions in-

 crease only compensation. They restrict labor and output supplies in

 order to increase wages, at the same time encouraging substitution of

 nonlabor factors for union members, and reductions in total output. In

 consequence, private sector unions have negligible or negative effects

 on employment.




    Union control over labor supply and output levels contributes to

union power in the local public sector, as well. These unions also

exercise influence over output demand. Arson by firemen is, presumably,

among the most extreme techniQues b> which municipal erncloyees generate

demand for the services they provide. More often, local public sector

unions promote their services to other citi2ens through political ac-

tivities, and encourage members to exercise their own     franchise   in favor

of service expansions. Municipal unions are distinctive both for these

strateges and for the results they obtain; the> increase

employment, as well as compensation levels.




   The   first sectjor   o this study explores the relationships between

union activity and employment levels. It demonstrates that equilibrium

employment levels should increase       unions can stimulate demand for

   The second section presents rearessions which etirrae that ernpJ'—

ment per capita in municipal functions with average uricn characteris-

tics is, atrninirriurn, 4.7> greater than in functions lacHngunioniza—

tion. However1 only the strongest municipal unions achieve significant

employment gains. Employment in municipal functions represented by

recognized bargaining units is at least 9.9< greater than in unorganized

functions. This nearl' matches the 1O.7 increase in tctal compensation

per hour worked obtained in these same functions. These employment gains

are plausibly the result of increases in output demand they are nearly'

matched by increases of ?.7Y in manhours of service per capita.




                     I.   Unionization andEmployment




Local public sector employees often promote general increases in demand
for their services. They are frequently constituents as well as

employees of their local governments. They are thereby entitled to a

voice in the determination of demand for their own servces. In add—

flon, other members of their community may because of their expertise,

respect their opinions with regards to appropriate service levels. In

consequerrce, local public sector employees are likely to have important

influence on output demand. They should be able to use this influence to

improve their own job security through increases in local public sector

employment.


                                   —2--
 A. Employment and Output Demand



 Local pubHc sector workers employ a number of techniques in the exer—

 cisc o-f their influence. Arson with the intent to stimulate demand for

 protective services is both the least savory and the least common.

Teacher campaigns for increased teacher—student ratios and police cam-

paigns for larger patrol car teams are examples of more common tech-

niques. These campaigns serve two purposes; they   are at once civic—
minded attempts to arouse interest in the quality of public service, and

strategies to improve public employee job security.




     More generally, local public sector employees can wield substantial

political power. They are a powerful lobby for many reasons; they are

numerous, they take an active interest in
                                            many government decisions,
their interests are well—defined, and they are familiar with the manner

in which government business is conducted. The extent o-f their abil ity

to   affect public policy through daily occupational interactions, labor

relations negotiations and political lobbying with elected public offi-

cials is unknown. However, as an example, estimated effects of local

public employees on public spending referenda are impressive.




     As a specific example, the Boston Globe of 4 September 1981 reported
     (pg. 16) 111n a press conference yesterday, Edward O'Reilly (Presi-
     dent of the Boston Firefighter's Association) charged Boston Mayor
     (Kevin H..) White and Boston Fire Cornrnisioner George H. Paul with
     misleading the public on the issue of fire safety and said he wanted
     all 116 (recently) laid off firefighters rehired to provide 'minimum
     -fire protection for the city'." (pg. 16) O'Reilly made his remarks
     at the site of a fatal multiple—alarm fire.


                                   —   —
  Grarni ich/Rubinfeld (1982b) report that local pubi Ic sector employees

In Michigan were more likely to vote in a referendum on budget 1 imita—

tions than other citizens and more likely to vote for increased levels

of government revenues and expenditures. LaddA4ilson report similar

results for Massachusetts. These authors estimate that public employee

votes accounted for 5—7 of the difference between votes for and against

limitations. The vote of public employees, themselves, in elections that

concern them probably underestimates their total influence. They may

also generate considerable support from people not on publ Ic payroll.

          Barnum./Helburn examine the results of Texas referenda over the

ieal status of public sector bargaining. They report that, in cities

where police and fire functions cooperated in promoting legalized bar—

gaining, the total vote in favor was increased by 15.




   Union—induced increases in demand for local public services should

increase derived demands for employment, and equilibrium employment

levels, if production functions, elasticities of factor and output

supply are unexceptional. The success of local public sector employees

in this strategy depends on their level- of organisation. Organized

employees can more effectively encourage demand for public services,

because their political activities are better coordinated. Organized

employees can more effectively take advantage of increased demands for

labor, because they can control labor supply.




     simple model of surplus maximization demonstrates that local public

sector unions can increase equilibrium employment levels If they can

stimulate demand for output. Local governments choose capital and labor



                                  —4—
 levels to maximize the difference between revenues and costs subject to

production functions, known demands for output, fixed prices for capital

and union—determined wages for labor. Unions set wage demands on the

basis of their bargaining strength. They may also influence levels of

output demand, with the extent of influence again dependent of strength.




   Formally, q represents output levels, K gives the level of capital

employed, and L gives the level of labor employed. Output is produced

according to a Cobb—Douqlas production function



                                     1-p
                          q=L K

                      2
where o   <   p < •




   Demand for output is a log—linear function of output price p, and

consumer income y.            Demand also depends on a multiplicative function f

union strength, 1(u), where u is a positive index of union power. The

demand function is:




                          q     a1u) p
                                           2 y3

   The Cobb—Douglas production function is commonly used to
                                                             represent
   production in the local public sector. BorcherdinQ/Deacor, and
   Grarni ich/Rubinfeld (1982a) are examples.

   This form j commonly used to represent demand for local public
   goods (Mieszkowskj,'Stejn, Bergstrom./Goodmar, Borcherding/Deacon and
   Grarnl ich/Rubjn.feld (1982a)). Local public Qocds are effectivel>'
   private goods in consumption (Bergstrom/Goodman,
                                                       Bcrcherding/Deacon
   and Grarrlich'Rubjnfe1d (1982a)).

     Costs depend on the price of capital            r, and wages. The waQe demanded

by unions, w(u), is an increasing function of union strength. LuJaqes are

set at competitive levels in the absence of unions w(O)=w,                Local

public sector employers maximize surpluses,

subject     to equations I and 2.




     These equations give optimal local public sector employment levels in

natural logarithms as:




                          lnLe1 lnr+$2lnw(u)


      In this model, as in the private sector models of Oswald,
      Blair/Crauiford, Dertouzos./Pencavel, Farber (1978> and Pencavel
      <1984a), unions are restricted by labor demands. They may set wages,
      but employers are free to choose surplus—maximizing employment
      level s.

     Niskaner, demonstrates that public manager; seek to maximize the
     difference between budget allocations and the costs of providing
     service under typical bureaucratic incentive structures. Inman
     (1982) and Ott adopt this objective function in their appi icat ions.

Optimal local pub] ft sector employment is a neqative function of wages,

a negative function of capital prices if output demand is elastic, and       a

positive function of demand characteristics. 6 In particular, pubi ft

sector employment is a positive function of union—induced increases     in

public service demand, a1(u).




     Equation 4 predicts that local public sector unions may be able to

increase employment1 as well as wages, above levels which would prevail

in the absence of employee organization through their influence on

public service demand.            Beneck and Inman (1981) report prel irninary

evidence which supports this prediction. Benecki finds positive employ-

ment effects of municipal unions in a large sample of small cities.

However, these effects are absent or reversed in his three samples of

larger cities. Inman finds positive union employment effects for police

and 'fire functions in a small sample of big cities. The results reported

in the next section demonstrate that municipal unions increase employ—

rnent, as well as compensation levels, in a large sample of American

cit I es.




   The derivative of equation 4 with respect to u, union power,

demonstrates that public unions with greater influence over output

demand will often enjoy greater employment gains than will those with

less

       Courant/Gramlich./Rubinfeld also present a model in which, within a
       broad range of activity, local public employees can raise their oi.n
       employment levels. Theirs is a general equil ibrium model, with its
       emphasis on redistribution through local government. In contrast,
       the partial equil ibrium approach adopted here emphasizes the produc-
       tion of local public services.

  tic it>' of      wages with respect to unionization, Union power tends to

  increase employment levels through induced increases in output demand,

 but also to reduce employment through employer reactions to compensation

  increases. Equation 5 states that optimal employment levels increase

 with u if output demand is sufficiently more elastic with respect to u

 than are wages. This is morel ikely to be the case when labor is

 prominent in the production function —— P is high —— because
                                                              production
 increases require large amounts of additional labor. It is also more

 likely if output demand is insensitive to price ——           is   low —— because

 equilibrium output levels need not fall dramatically when employers

 increase prices to cover union compensation gains. Both these conditions

 are likely to hold for local public services.




       Previous studies do not offer any evidence with regard to the irn—

plicatior,s of equationS. Differences in union strength and elasticities

of local public output demand with respect to union power have not been

measured. The next section uses a new categorization of union strength

(Zax) to test these implications indirectly: If municipal union strength

does not have a signif icant, posit ive relat lonship with un ion employmm t

effects, than municipal unions do not substantially alter demand for
muri i   ci pal   services.

B. Employment and   Efficient   Contracts



Positive union effects on local public sector employment are one

manifestation of union influence or the demand for local public services.

However, positive effects do not prove conclusively that unions stimu-

late demand. Union employment effects could possibly be positive as the

result of union activity on the supply side of the local public service

market; if local public sector employment conditions a'e inefficient in

the absence of unions, and unions negotiate efficient contracts. The

empirical evidence presented in the next section does not address this

issue directly. However, comparisons between union employment eects in

the private and public sectors sucqest that it is probabi unimportant.




   Unions affect employment levels throuh the supply of output with

monopoly control over labor supply. In the exercise of that control,

they may aspire to any bargain which does not preclude employment —— any

bargain under which total employment costs do not exceed the total value

of employee product.




   Union gains may be taken as increases in wages, employment, or both.



    The value of employee product may itself, depend upon union be-
    havior. Employers, under union provocation or with union coopera-
    tion, may alter their supply behavior in output markets so as to
    increase profits. Unions can encourage employers to exercise monopo-
    ly power <i.4arren—Boulton), assist employers to collude in output
    markets (Maloney/HcCormick/Tollison), arid encourage government
    protection for cartels <this issue is one of many discussed in
    Simon). If these initiatives alter output supply functions,
    employers will alter their derived demands for labor.


                                     — 10   —
The allocation of union gains depends upon relative preferences of

unions and employers for the two, and on the bargaining process. Collec-

tive bargains will always set wage levels at or above those set by the

competitive market. In simple monopoly models of unionism, increased

wages imply reduced employment. However, employment under efficient

bargains will typically exceed competitive levels, as well.




     Unions have no effect on efficient employment levels in only the

special case where union objective functions depend exclusively on wage
          10
levels.        Here, the labor demand function is also the contract curve.

If union objective functions depend positively on employment levels, as

well as wages, the contract curve must lie to the right of the demand

curve in employment—wage space. Uiith this specification of union objec-

tives, the union effect on efficient employment levels is

positive; at any wage, efficient levels of employment exceed levels

employers would choose unilaterally.




     Union objective functions depend significantly on employment levels




10
     Fellner discusses this case at length.

     For example, Hal l/Lilien construct a model with a vertical contract
     curve the efficient employment level, at any wage, is identical
     with that established under competitive labor market conditions. In
     this case, efficient employment levels under employee unionization
     exceed those preferred by employers, though not those set under
     competition. McDonald/9olo discuss a model in which the contract
     curve must be positively sloped. Here, efficient employment levels
     not only exceed levels preferred by employers at any wage greater
     than the competitive level, but always exceed levels established ir
     competitive markets, as well.

in all empirical studies of private sector union behavior.        Studies of

unions in the local public sector would almost certainly reveal similar

objectives. If this were the case, and local public sector unions were

able to negotiate efficient contracts, they would increase local public

employment levels regardless of their effects on public service demand.




   In practices efficient contracts are probably infrequent. Most

analyses of private sector union behavior assume that collective bar-

gains are riot efficient, regardless of union preferences for employment.

   There is little private sector evidence of efficient employment

levels. Actual union employment effects appear to be negligible or

negative. Freernan/Medoff assert that, during the 1970's, unions

sacrificed employment in return for increased compensation (pg. 249).



 12 Farber (1978) finds evidence that the United Mine Workers union is
    strongly risk averse. In the context of his model, risk aversion
    implies positive valuation of employment levels. Dertouzos/Pencavel
    find that erriploxrnent enters positively, with varying weights, into
    the objective functions of all eight International Typographical
    Union locals studied. Pencavel (1984a) finds positive elasticities
    of substitution between wages and employment in most estimates of
    union objective function characteristics, based on a pooled sample
    of ten International Typographical Union locals. Farber (1984) cites
    several other studies in support of these results.
 13 Dunlop originally assumed that the range of union choice was
    restricted to wage/employment combinations on the ernployers demand
    curve for labor. Oswald supports this restriction with the assertion
    that cooperative solutions, such as those required to obtain effi-
    cient outcomes, are difficult to enforce. Blair/Crawford agree, on
    the theoretical argument that union objective functions do not yield
    well—defined maxima along employer isoprofit curves, and on the
    practical argument that actual contracts leave the employer free to
    choose employment levels. Dertouzos./Pencavel, Farber (1978) and
    Pencavel (1984a), while demonstrating positive union preferences for
    employment, adopt this restriction and enforce negative employment
    effects. More generally, Farber (1984) argues that unions and
    employers may be limited to inefficient contracts bx internal union
    p01 itics and enforcement difficulties. Pencavel (1984b) suggests
    that observed grievance levels are higher than would be expected
    under efficient contracts.

                                  — 12 —
Freeman states "In the private sector it is universally accepted that

one of the substantial responses to union wage effects is a reduction of
                       14
employment.' (pg.           The political nature of bargaining in the

local public sector distinguishes it from private sector bargaining.

However, there is no compelling argument to expect that the local public

sector will be a favorable environment for the negotiation of efficient

labor contracts, where the private sector is not.




   Explanations of positive union emplo>ment effects in the local public

sector as evidence of efficient contracts must be based on the specula-

tive proposition that public sector labor markets are distinguished by

unusual cooperation in bargaining between employer and employee. Posi-

tive union effects on output demand are the more plausible explanation

of positive union employment effects. This explanation is consistent

with the analytical and anecdotal evidence of local public employee




   Union employment effects are the subject of very few studies. Farber
   <1984:) does not discuss employment effects in his survey. l4essels
   asserts that empirical findings of moderate substitutability in
   production between labor and capital, large positive union wage and
   productivity effects imply larger negative union employrrent effects
   than have been commonly estimated. Pencavel/Hartsog find small,
   generally unimportant negative effects of unions on manhours ir
   aggregate data covering 1920—80. However, as Jonathan Leonard has
   pointed out, their regressions include relative output levels as
   exogenous variables. The effects they estimate represent substitu—
   t on
political activity.      It is based on a fundamental distinct on between

public and private sector employment; private sector employees are

factors of production, but public sector employees are constituents, as

well




                II. Municipal Employment and Union Strength




This section investigates the   effects   of   municipal unionization or
manhours per 10,000 capita, employees per 10,000 capita and annual work

hours per employee in the police, fire, sanitation, and other non—

tions in 1975, 1977 and 1979, pooled across functions and years, com-

prise the sample for statistical purposes. All result; are taken from



 15
       There is little evidence, analytical or anecdotal, of positive
       private sector union effects on output demand. Boycotts are probably
       the most dramatic of the explicit strategies private sector unions
       adopt to affect total demand for the goods they produce. The im-
       mediate purpose; of these actions are to reduce rather than increase
       demand. Union label and anti—import campaigns are the most prominent
       union efforts to increase demand for their own production. These
       strategies only encourage substitution of union for nonunion and
       foreign output. They have not been sufficiently successful to dis-
       suade students of union activity from implicitly assuming that total
       demand for output is independent of union behavior.
 16
       The municipal employment measure; analyzed here are drawn from three
       identical surveys of municipal employment and compensation, con-
       ducted in 1975, 1977 and 1979 by the International City Management
       Association (Friend and Pike, Friend and Bencivenga, Friend arid
       Lufkin). These survey; report numbers of full—time employees, stand-
       ard work schedules, vacation time, sick leave and compensation
       expenditures for employees in police, fire, sanitation, and all
       other noneducational departments. Eight hundred and thirty—nine
       cities provide complete records for at least one function in one
       year.

     These equations are, effectively, reduced forms of the structural

measures, they include as exogenous variables extensive measures of city

population characteristics, city government structure, employment condi—

municipal employment, and region—specific effects.




     Previous studies of municipal labor relations typically represent

unionization by a single measure of organization, bargaining, or con-

tract status. Zax identifies a hierarchy of 'unionization' in municipal

functions which more effectively measures variations in union strength.

This hierarchy includes six degrees of municipal unionization ma

function, based on the interactions between organization in that func-

tion and in other functions of the same municipality. Functions are

'unorganized' if no employees belong to unions, 'organized' if some



17
     All regressions reported here include dummy variables for functions
     and years.

     These variables are taken from Censusses of Population, Censusses
     and Surveys of Government, and surveys of government structure
     conducted by the International City Management Association. Further
     details with regard to the sample are contained in an Appendix,
     available from the author. It contains the complete equation es-
     timates from which the results reported here are reproduced.

belong to a union or employee associations 'organized with a bargaining

unit' if a union is recognized for bargaining purposes, and 'organized

with a contract' if a collective bargaining agreement exists. For

brevity, municipalities are designated as 'bargaining' if employees in

any function of the municipality are represented by a bargaining unit.

These cities are probably in states which prohibit public sector collec-

tive bargaining. Municipalities are 'non—bargaining' if no employees are

represented by a bargaining unit. By definition, public sector bargain-

ing is legal in these cities.




   Two degrees of unionization occur in non—bargaining cities. Unor-

ganized functions in non—bargaining cities are unambiguously non—union,

the weakest degree. The second degree, organized functions in ron—

bargaining cities, is the simplest form of union structure. If state law

denies unions the right to obtaining recognition, this degree repr€'sents

the strongest permissible form of unionization in these municipalities.

Employment in functions of this degree should be greater than in non-

union functions.




   Unorganized functions in bargaining cities represent the third degree

of municipal unionization. The relative strength of unions in the second

and third degrees is uncertain. Unorganized functions in bargaining

cities can threaten to acquire recognition as a bargaining unit. t the

same time, they are the weakest form of unionization where bargaining is

legally permitted. Empirically, Zax demonstrates that compensation

 increases obtained by unorganized functions in bargaining cities are

 indistinguishable from those obtained by organized functions in non—



                                 — 16 -
bargaining cities.




    Organized functions in bargaining cities, the fourth degree of

unionization, are stronger than the lower degrees because these func—

tions can credibly threaten to obtain recognition. The fifth degree of

unionization, organized functions with bargaining units, is comprised of

municipal unions which have obtained legal recognition. Their
                                                                advantage
over lower degrees is the entitlement to negotiate with municipalities

over terms of employment. The sixth and strongest degree includes only

organized functions with contracts. Terms of employment for employees in

these functions are legally protected. Bargaining units and contracts

can exist, by definition only in bargaining cities UniOn Str      th

increases rnonotonically across the four degrees in bargaining cities.

Employment effects should increase commensurately.




   The specification of unionization in the equations reported here

consists of four dummy variables. The first degree, unorganized func-

tions in non—bargaining cities, is not represented. Degrees two through

four are each represented by one dummy variable. The fifth and sixth

degrees, functions with bargaining units and functions with contracts,

are pooled in a single dummy —— under the heading 'bargaining units' ——

because no source reports contracts for all functions on a function—
                   19
spec ific basis.




19Empirically, dummYvariablesfor geographic divionsprovide addi-
    tional controls for legal status. Geographic and unionization
    dummies adequately account for state—specific ef-fects; coefficients
    reported here for union dummies are unchanged when divisional
    dumrriies are replaced b dummy variables for each state.
   The equations reported here will underestimate positive effects and

overestimate negative effects of municipal unionization on municipal

employment levels. Municipal cornpensaticin measures are not entered

explicitly into the equations, because they are determined   s.irnul—


taneously   with employment levels. Compensation levels in degrees two

through five are significantly greater than in degree one, non—union

functions (Zax). Compensation increases won by unions will force

municipalities up their demand curves for labor, reducing employment in

order to control total labor costs. These reductions, as well as the

direct effects of unionization on employment, will be captured by the

dummy variables for unionization.




   Table I presents estimates of union effects on three measures of

employment levels for each degree of unionization. Bargaining units have

strong effects on manhours per capita, employees per capita and annual

work hours per employee. Individual coefficients for other degrees are

usually insignificant. However, the pattern of significance in the

differences between these coefficients further confirms the hypotheses

of the previous section.




    Bargaining units, the strongest measured degree of municipal

unionization, are the only degree in which employment per capita is

significantly increased. F—tests demonstrate that bargaining unit ef-

fects on employment and manhours per capita are significantly different

in this degree also reduce annual hours of work per ernployeesubstan—

tially, by forty hours, or one full work week. This effect, though

larger than that for other degrees, is not significantly different from

that obtained by in any degree of unionization within bargaining cities.




     Employment effects in other degrees are usually insignificant. The

comparisons between effects in different degrees are revealing,

nevertheless. F—tests show no significant differences in union effects

on manhours per capita, employment per capita, and annual work hours per

employee between organized and unorganized functions in bargaining

cities. Equal it>' in reduced—form employment effects may, in fact, be

evidence that organized functions obtain employment increases above

levels for unorganized functions in these cities. Compensation increases

in the former siqnificantly exceed those in the latter. Other things

equal, barQaining municipalities should react to these differences in

compensation effects by reducing employment further in organized than in

unorganized functions. Organized functions may use their greater in-
                                                21
fluence over demand for output to compensate.




      F—tests also demonstrate that coefficients on organized functions in

non—bargaining cities are significantly different, at 5>'., from those on

unorganized functions in bargaining cities, for all three measures of

labor quantities. These tests and the coefficient values indicate that

organized functions in non—bargaining cities have more strongly positive

effects on all three measures of employment, in addition to similar

compensation effects. pparently, the advantages of organizing, where

barQaining is prohibited, outweigh those of only threatening recogni-

tion, where it is permitted.

  Table 2 restates the absolute union effects of Table        I   as elas—

ticitfes, percentages of degree—specific means. Elasticities eriphasize

the relative strength o-f bargaining units. Organized functions in bar—



                                    —   .1 -
gaining cities enjoy compensation increases of 8.2Y., but may suffer

reductions in employment per capita of up to 8.4Z. Functions with bar-

gaining units obtain employment increases of at least 9.9, as well as

compensation increases of 1O.7'..




   Elasticities also reveal that work—sharing is not the source of

employment gains. Bargaining units reduce annual hours of work per

employee by more than 27, but increase employment per capita by nearly

1O<. These effects, combined, represent an increase in nanhours of

service per municipal resident of nearly 87.. To the extent that employ-

ment gains estimated for organized functions in non—bargaining cities

are meaningful, they are also attributable to increases in service

level s.




   These estimates of degree—specific union employment effects are

entirely consistent with the hypothesis that employmert increases are

won through stimulation of output demand. Stronger unions more success-

fully reduce employment losses or obtain employment gains, within both

bargaining and non—bargaining municipalities. In addition, employment

gains are always associated with increases in manhours of service per

capita. These facts, while not inconsistent with the hypothesis that

municipal unions negotiate efficient contracts, are not predicted b'

contemporary characterizations of such contracts.

   These estimates show that, on net, average levels of labor relations

activity in a function and in a city increase manhours per capita by

more than 3>'., and employment per capita by nearly 5>'., over levels that

would obtain in the absence of any unionization. Average levels of

unionization also reduce annual work hours by 28    hours,   or nearlx four

                               III. Conclusion




The empirical results in    this   paper demonstrate that municipal unions

which achieve recognition as bargaining units are able to increase

municipal employment levels. Theoretically, municipal unions could

achieve these effects by negotiating efficient contracts, unconstrained

by municipal demand curves 4cr labor. However, the evidence here sug-

gests that they are more likely to arise from the abil ity of municipal

unions to stimulate demand for municipal services. Private sector unions

do not have positive employment effects. While there is no reason to

believe that municipal unions are more adept at achieving efficient

contracts than are unions in the private sector, there is persuasive

anecdotal evidence that municipal unions exercise distinctive influence

over demand for their output. This difference between public and private

union effects on output demand could give rise to the contrast between

public and private union employment effects.




        Benecki and Inman <1981) report similar, but less definitive
        results. Benecki does not analyze individual compensation levels.
        Inrnan finds positive union effects on p01 ice employment, no effect
        on police wages, positive effects on fire employment and a positive
        effect of marginal significance on fire wages. Both measure
        unionization with a single variable: Benecki uses athe percentage of
        employees who are organized for negotiating purposes". Inman uses
        "the percent of workers who belong to a union or employee organiza-
        tion which negotiates a labor contract.


                                      —
      These results cast some doubt over estimates of municipal labor

 demand elasticities. Estimates are misleading in the presence of posi-

 tive municipal union employment effects, regardless of the mechanism

                                                                      and

 employment levels are probably not on the municipality's demand curve

 for labor, at all.




      If, as seems more lkely municipal unions stimulate demand for

municipal output, estimated elasticities of labor demand probably under-

state true elasticities. The elasticity impl led be equation 4, holding

only the rental price of capital and consumer income constant, is:



                      in L         I       In
                                                a1(u)
                   in w(u)             2   ln w(u)
                                                        >$,.
                                  a2



The second term is positive, because w(u) and a1(u) are both increasing

functions of u. This expression demonstrates that estimated elasticities

are less negative than are true elasticities if union effects on output

demand are neglected. ctual employment levels are less sensitive to

union—induced wage increases than are employment levels given by labor

demand functions, because they are preserved through union—induced

increas     in output demand.



   These results emphasize the dual nature of
                                              municipal employment.
Municipal unions represent both employees of the municipal government
and   ar important municipal constituency. Positive union      employment
effects may derive largely from this second role, HoiAjever, this

relationship   cannot be definitively establ shed without direct evidence

of union effects on output demand. The anecdotes which provide what

evidence is currently available need to be augmented by econometric

studies from which more robust conclusions rniqht be drawn.
