Global Value Chains and Inequality with Endogenous Labor Supply

NBER Working Paper No. 24884
August 2018
JEL No. F1

                                         ABSTRACT

We assess the role of global value chains in transmitting global integration shocks to aggregate
trade, as well as distributional outcomes. We develop a multi-country general equilibrium trade
model that features multi-stage production, with different stages having different productivities
and using factors (occupations) with different intensities. The model also features a Roy
mechanism, in which heterogeneous workers endogenously choose their sector and occupation.
Country- and worker-level comparative advantages interact. A reduction in trade costs leads to
countries specializing in their comparative advantage sectors and production stages. This
specialization changes labor demand, and also leads to more workers shifting to their
comparative advantage sectors and occupations. We calibrate our model to the U.S., China, and
the rest of the world in 2000 and we simulate a decline in China's trade costs with the U.S.,
designed to mimic China's entry into the WTO. Our simulation results imply an increase in the
skill premium in both the U.S. and China, and the GVC, i.e., specialization across stages, is
critical to this outcome.

1    Introduction

One of the most signicant economic developments over the past half-century is the increased

fragmentation of production across borders. Goods are produced in sequential stages that

traverse multiple countries  a global value chain. Countries specialize in particular stages

of a good's production process.     This increase in vertical specialization has occurred un-

der a backdrop of a broad increase in international trade, one of the dening features of

globalization across the world during this period.

    Partly because of this backdrop, most of the research examining the eects of global

integration on wages, employment, and other variables has focused on total trade. Autor

et al. (2013) is a recent example. This has also been exemplied in the factor content studies

that trade and labor economists have conducted since the 1990s. The purpose of our paper

is to assess the role of global value chains as a propagation mechanism transmitting global

integration shocks, such as China joining the WTO, to aggregate trade outcomes, as well as

distributional outcomes, such as the skill premia.

    Our approach is to build a model of global value chains and international trade and

then to calibrate it and use it to study global integration shocks. We introduce global value

chains following the work of AntrÃ s and de Gortari (2017) and de Gortari (2017).         They

develop a tractable framework for incorporating multi-stage production in an international

trade model that generalizes and extends previous research on this subject. In addition, a

key feature of our model is to include multiple sectors, multiple factors, and a labor supply

channel. In particular, following Lee (2017), we include Roy selection eects, in which het-

erogeneous workers choose occupations and sectors based on their individual productivities

in these occupations and sectors, as well as on prevailing prices. Lee (2017) and others have

shown that these channels enhance our understanding of how trade aects inequality and

are quantitatively important in explaining the increase in inequality.

    The core elements of our model revolve around the production of a nal good and the

worker's choice of sector and occupation. A nal good is made in a sequence of stages. Each

stage involves labor, a composite intermediate, and output from the previous stage. There are

several labor inputs, which we call occupations. Dierent stages use these occupations with

dierent intensities.   The presence of the composite intermediate and the previous stage's

output helps generate both roundabout and snake features in production. The nal goods

have two uses, consumption and input into the composite intermediate. On the worker's side,

each worker is of an exogenous type. Within each type, a worker draws occupation and sector

specic productivities. Based on these productivities, as well as on prevailing prices, workers

choose their optimal sector and occupation. Our individual goods and workers are embedded




                                               2
in a multi-country general equilibrium framework. This framework features both country-

and worker-level comparative advantages.

   In this framework, a decline in trade costs facilitates specialization at the sector-level

and at the production stage-level. This changing specialization pattern shifts the relative

demand for occupations based on stage-specic occupation intensities. This aects the equi-

librium wage, which then aects workers' choices of occupations and sectors. Even though

workers observe the same change in wages for each sector and occupation, the individual

worker's response will dier depending on his/her idiosyncratic productivity. There are gen-

eral equilibrium feedback mechanisms at work, as well.       Ultimately, the skill premia are

aected.
                                                 5
   To develop more intuition, we also study a  2  version of the model in terms of countries,

worker types, sectors, stages, and occupations. The 2-stage version of our model illustrates

the role of GVC intensity on the skill premium. A higher GVC intensity implies a greater

reliance on the stage-one output used in stage-two production.      Numerical exercises show

that, in response to a decline in trade costs, aggregate outcomes are magnied if the GVC

intensity is higher, but the skill premium responds non-monotonically to higher GVC in-

tensity. We nd that the combined eect from sector and stage specialization on the skill

premium is larger when the GVC intensity puts larger weights on a country's comparative

advantage sector and stage.

   We then calibrate the general version of our model for three countries, China, U.S., and

constructed rest of the world (ROW); ve worker types; three sectors; two stages; and ve

occupations.   Some of our parameters draw directly from the data, others are assigned,

and the others  including the worker productivity parameters, and the production function

parameters (productivities of sector and stage, occupational intensity coecients, value-

added share, and GVC intensity parameters)  are calibrated to match moments in the

data.   Our calibrated parameters reveal several patterns.   First, based on relative endow-

ments and productivities, China has a comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector

and the downstream production stage, and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in services

and the upstream production stage.      Second, production stages have dierent occupation

intensities across countries.   For example, the downstream production stage is relatively

high-skilled-occupation-intensive in China, but low-skilled-occupation-intensive in the U.S..

Third, sectors signicantly dier in GVC intensity. Upstream production stages have rela-

tively larger value-added in the agriculture and mining sectors than in other sectors. Lastly,

workers with dierent levels of skill have a clear comparative advantage both across sectors

and occupations.

   We use our calibrated model to perform counterfactual exercises quantifying aggregate



                                              3
and distributional impacts of the China shock. We study a 50 percent decline in China's

trade costs with the U.S. When trade costs between China and the U.S. go down, all countries

specialize further in their comparative advantage stages and sectors.               In addition, we nd
                                                                                                       1
that the skill premium rises in China by 1.8 percent and in the U.S. by close to 1 percent.                In

both China and the U.S., the lower trade costs induce specialization to shift towards stages

that use high-skilled-occupations more intensively. Thus, we have a skill upgrading mecha-

nism which operates through stage specialization. In addition, the worker-level productivity

estimates imply that better educated workers are better o in the high-skilled occupations.

Hence, our rich framework is able to reproduce the stylized fact that trade liberalizations are

often associated with skill premia increases in both skill-abundant and non-skill-abundant

countries.   We conduct a number of additional counterfactuals to understand our results

better. Overall, we nd that in the absence of GVCs, we would not get both China's and the

U.S.'s skill premium to rise, and that our main explanation for the skill premium is correct.



1.1     Related Literature

Our research is connected to several strands of research. One strand is the trade and wages

research that sought to examine the eects of increased U.S. imports from developing coun-

tries on the skill premia. This research was especially active in the mid-1990s, and includes

Katz and Murphy (1992), Lawrence and Slaughter (1993), Krugman (1995), and Feenstra

and Hanson (1999) among others. All of these papers essentially employed a Heckscher-Ohlin

type (HO) framework with its Stolper-Samuelson and factor content of trade implications.

The main ndings tended to be that the eect of trade was not large. However, the survey

article by Goldberg and Pavcnik (2007) showed that the predictions of a simple Heckscher-

Ohlin (HO) framework do not hold up in the data.                In particular, skill premia tended to

rise in both developed and developing countries following trade liberalizations.                Krugman

(2008) revisits the trade and wage issues from the mid-1990s with the benet of 15 years

of additional data. In addition, Krugman argues that increased vertical specialization can

generate inequality via Stolper-Samuelson eects.            To our knowledge, Krugman's paper is

the only paper that makes a case for examining the consequences of vertical specialization

for inequality.

    There are also other papers that propose alternative mechanisms to explain the eect of

trade on inequality by departing from the standard Stolper-Samuelson eect: Bernard et al.

(2007) show real wages can increase for both abundant and scarce factors; Parro (2013)

shows that capital-skill complementarity can drive increase of the skill premium from trade

   1 For China this corresponds to about one-third of the increase in the college premium found in Ge and
Yang (2014)during 2000-2007. For the U.S. it corresponds to about one-fth of the increase during the 2000s.



                                                     4
in all countries; and Burstein and Vogel (2016) combine an HO framework in a model that

features heterogeneous rms and skill-biased productivity. Our framework is in this vein.

   In recent years, there has been a new wave of interest on the employment and wage eects

of increased trade. This is not surprising, because the emergence of China as a signicant

global economic force has only come about in the past 10-15 years. Autor et al. (2013), Pierce

and Schott (2016), and many other papers in the literature document signicant eects of

China on labor markets of major partner countries such as the U.S. With the new interest

has come an expanded set of methodologies. One new approach involves applying models

with numbers, i.e., quantitative theory.

   Our paper is also related to a literature about oshoring and skill upgrading. Feenstra

and Hanson (1995), Costinot and Vogel (2010), and Zhu and Treer (2005) discuss how

oshoring may increase the skill premium in both North and South by making both countries

specialize in high-skill-intensive sectors. This is the skill upgrading story. These papers do

not explicitly examine GVCs empirically or theoretically, i.e., employ a model with multiple

sequential stages. Our paper builds, calibrates, and simulates a model with such a structure

to examine quantitatively the importance of the GVC mechanism in transmitting changes

in trade costs to changes in skill premia.   Our framework in principle could have a skill

upgrading channel, and we nd that the calibrated model indeed does.

   A second strand of research is on documenting the extent of global value chains, vertical

specialization, value-added exports, and related concepts, as well as on building models of

these concepts.   Contributions on the documentation side include Hummels et al. (2001),

Johnson and Noguera (2012); AntrÃ s and Chor (2013), and Koopman et al. (2014). Con-

tributions on the modeling side include Yi (2003, 2010), Johnson and Moxnes (2016), and

most recently, AntrÃ s and de Gortari (2017) and de Gortari (2017). The latter two papers

develop a general framework for GVCs and show how to map special cases of this framework

into the Eaton and Kortum (2002) framework. Our modeling of GVCs draws from AntrÃ s

and de Gortari (2017); it combines that paper with Lee (2017).

   To investigate the link between trade and labor market outcomes, such as wage in-

equality and labor reallocation, increasingly, papers focus on heterogeneous workers. While

traditional trade models such as the HO model and the specic factors model assume that

workers are all homogeneous in their productivities conditional on observable characteris-

tics, this assumption misses the fact that workers dier in their productivities in reality.

This worker-level heterogeneity is important especially when we study the eect of trade on

labor market outcomes, because workers with same observable characteristics may respond

to trade shocks dierently depending on their idiosyncratic productivities. In recent years,

trade models bring the idea of the Roy (1951) model to introduce worker heterogeneity un-



                                              5
der the setting of assignment models: e.g., Teulings (2005), Ohnsorge and Treer (2007),

and Costinot and Vogel (2010, 2015). Worker heterogeneity is introduced to trade models

also based on a search and matching framework: e.g., Grossman et al. (2015), Helpman and

Itskhoki (2010), and Helpman et al. (2016).

   Our paper is also closely related to a recent strand of literature on quantitative models

with the Roy-based assignment structure. One of the key assumptions in this literature is

that workers' idiosyncratic productivity is randomly drawn from a type-II extreme value

distribution, a FrÃ©chet distribution. Hsieh et al. (2013), Burstein et al. (2015), Lagakos and

Waugh (2013), Galle et al. (2017), and Lee (2017) use this assumption to investigate the role

of worker heterogeneity in disentangling labor market outcomes in one country from labor

demand shocks such as technological change or trade liberalization. Our paper also relies on

this distributional assumption when we characterize workers' heterogeneous productivities.

Lee (2017) introduces a more general setup for worker heterogeneity than our paper, where

the degree of worker heterogeneity can vary even by country. Then the main focus of Lee

(2017) is on quantifying the eect of changes in trade costs and changes in partner country's

productivity on disaggregate labor market outcomes for a large number of countries. Lastly,

the main counterfactual exercise of Lee (2017) is actual changes in trade costs between 2000

and 2007, as well as an increase in China's manufacturing productivity. In this paper, we do

not introduce varying degree of worker heterogeneity across countries. Instead, we introduce

this Roy-based assignment framework into a multi-stage GVC model, where each stage of

production is formulated based on the EK model.        We can thus investigate the general

equilibrium relation between workers' endogenous labor supply and trade through GVC in

our model. For quantication, we focus mainly on China and the U.S. to understand the

core mechanisms.

   More papers in the literature recently focus on the occupational dimension as an im-

portant channel through which trade shocks are disseminated across workers--e.g., Autor

et al. (2015), Ebenstein et al. (2014), Traiberman (2016), Harrigan et al. (2016). Our frame-

work also allows workers to endogenously choose occupations in response to trade shocks

under the GVC setting. We show that worker heterogeneity plays also a signicant role for

occupation-level labor reallocation. The occupational dimension is important in the GVC

context, because dierent production stages have dierent occupation intensities.

   The core mechanism of our model can be further connected to the literature on trade,

inequality, and a declining labor share around the world.     A recent paper by Dao et al.

(2017) provides suggestive evidence about the eect of increased participation in GVCs on

declining labor shares in both developed and developing countries. Countries specialize in

their capital-intensive and high-skilled-task-intensive stages as they participate in GVCs



                                              6
more. Although we do not explicitly consider capital in our model, the stage specialization

pattern and stage-specic occupation intensities that we quantify in this paper can be linked

to explain declining labor shares with capital-skill complementarity as in Grossman et al.

(2017).

      The next section lays out our baseline model. This is followed by a description of a simpler

version of our model with just two stages of production, two countries, two occupations, and

two labor types. We solve the simpler version of the model and conduct several numerical

exercises to illustrate how the model works. Section 4 describes our calibration, and section

5 discusses our counterfactual exercises with the model.




2       Model

In this section, we describe our model. Because the model has many features, we provide

an overview rst. Our model draws from the general global value chain (GVC, hereafter)

model developed by AntrÃ s and de Gortari (2017). We extend their framework by adding

three features: multiple factors of production, multiple sectors, and heterogeneous workers.

All three features are essential to investigate the role of GVCs in the eect of increased trade

on inequality.

      In our model, each sector is comprised of a continuum of nal goods. Each nal good

is produced through a specic global value chain encompassing multiple stages of produc-

tion that can potentially cross multiple countries.      Each stage of production is produced

with value-added and with intermediate inputs.         Value-added consists of multiple factors

of production, called occupations.      There are two categories of intermediate inputs.     One

category is a composite aggregate good. The second category of intermediates is good and

stage-specic: the previous stage's output. The inclusion of the previous stage's output is

the key GVC component.

      Countries have comparative advantages both across sectors and stages. To distinguish

these two types of comparative advantages, we assume that the primary source of each com-

parative advantage is dierent. Sector comparative advantage is primarily from the     Ricardian
channel based on dierence in Ricardian productivities as in Eaton and Kortum (2002). On
the other hand, stage comparative advantage arises mainly from the standard           Heckscher-
Ohlin (HO) channel, as we assume that dierent stages of production have dierent factor
intensities and that countries have dierent factor endowments.

      In addition, workers are heterogeneous in their sector and occupation-specic productivi-

ties. Workers endogenously choose their occupation and sector based on their productivities:

the   Roy channel. Introducing the Roy framework into a general equilibrium trade model is


                                                 7
based on Lee (2017).               Our model will deliver interaction between the Ricardian and HO

channels, the Roy channel, and GVCs.



2.1        Preferences, Technologies, and Workers

Our model features           N    countries,         S   sectors, value chains of xed length       J , O occupations, and
T   worker types. Each country is distinguished by its production technologies and endowment

of worker types.                     s, s = 1, . . . , S , there is a continuum of nal goods
                           Within each sector
                     s
over a set â„¦ of mass 1. Each nal good Ï‰ âˆˆ [0, 1] is produced following a specic value

chain of length J . The optimal value chain for a nal good Ï‰ consumed in country n is a

J -dimensional vector of countries where each stage j of production takes place. In other
words, intermediate stages of a product can cross multiple borders along the value chain.

For each stage, the production factors are occupations (managers, clerical sta, etc.)                                    o,
o = 1, . . . , O.        Occupation intensities vary across stages of production and countries.                           As

mentioned above, the production technology also consists of two categories of intermediates,

an aggregate composite intermediate, and a good and stage-specic intermediate.

     Each country          i, i = 1, . . . , N ,         is exogenously endowed with        LÌ„i,t   workers of type   t, t =
1, . . . , T .   In our quantitative analysis, these types will be associated with observable worker

characteristics, such as education. Each worker of each type draws a matrix of sector and

occupation specic productivities, and on the basis of these productivities and prevailing

occupation-sector-specic wages, chooses to work in the occupation and sector that delivers

the highest return.


Preferences              Consumers have common nested CES preference over nal goods


                                                                    S

Production Technology                           As outlined above, each nal good         Ï‰ is produced from a specic
value chain of length             J   during production, and this value chain is potentially spread over

multiple countries.              We denote the sequence of producing countries for a product                          Ï‰   by

immediately preceding stage captures the snake" structure of production (as in Yi (2003))

and is the key feature of the value chain.

          Countries possess technologies for any intermediate stage of production from                                               j =1    to

j = J âˆ’ 1,         and also for nal assembly of stage                       J,      for all goods in all sectors. The production

function in country            i   for stage        j   of good     Ï‰   in sector         s   is Cobb-Douglas:

Focusing rst on the intermediate inputs into production,                                            xs,j

ate good used by stage                  j    producers of sector             s       in country      i. It is a nested CES aggregate
of the nal goods, and has the same structure as the utility function.                                                      This captures the

roundabout structure of production, as in Caliendo and Parro (2015) and Eaton and Ko-

rtum (2002). Our roundabout structure is simpler than that of Caliendo and Parro (2015)

and also de Gortari (2017) in that the input-output share between sectors is completely

determined by the expenditure share and the sector-specic value-added share. The other

papers consider a more general input-output structure between sectors focusing on aggregate

outcomes of the model.

          Value-added inputs into production are occupational tasks                                    Ls,j,o

cupations.           Finally, the snake structure of our model is                                described by mi         (Ï‰), the stage
j âˆ’ 1 good for Ï‰           of sector        s.    We assume a constant elasticity of substitution for all inputs to

focus on the role of GVCs in generating dierential gains from trade between worker types.

An alternative approach would be to model the complementarity between intermediate in-

puts and dierent skill levels of occupations.                                   Krusell et al. (2000) and Parro (2013) have

shown that this capital-skill complementarity is important in explaining macroeconomic and

international trade behavior.

          The three key parameters governing the importance of each of these inputs are                                                   Î²ij,o ,
Î³ s,j ,    and   Î±is .   All three parameters range from                         0   to   1. Î²ij,o   captures the importance of each

occupational input            o.    This parameter varies across occupations, stages, and countries. For

                                                            Î²ij,o = 1. 1 âˆ’ Î³ s,j

stage input in stage               j.   This parameter varies across stages and sectors. A lower value of
    s,j
Î³         corresponds to a greater importance of the snake structure, and a lower importance of
                                                                                                       2
the composite intermediate and value-added taken together.                                                   More formally, as      Î³ s,j â†’ 0,
      2 Note that these two terms constitute the typical" Eaton and Kortum (EK) structure of production;




                                                                            9
the snake or value chain term dominates the roundabout and value-added terms, and vice

versa for        Î³ s,j â†’ 1. Î±is      captures the relative importance of value-added and the composite

intermediate with higher values of                      Î±is   corresponding to greater importance of value-added.

This parameter varies across sectors and countries.                                We will call this parameter as value-

added share. Finally, we assume that the initial stage                              1   is produced using only occupations

and composite intermediates; in other words, we assume                                   Î³ s,1 â‰¡ 1    for every   s = 1, . . . , S .
    To summarize, for each stage of production, the importance of the previous stage, i.e., of

the value chain, is captured by  1 âˆ’ Î³ s,j , the importance of the composite intermediate, i.e.,
                                                 s s,j
the roundabout term, is captured by (1 âˆ’ Î±i )Î³ , and the importance of the occupations,
                                                       s s,j
taken together, i.e., value-added, is captured by Î±i Î³ .

     Factor-neutral productivity for stage j of sector-s product Ï‰ in country i is denoted by
 s,j
zi (Ï‰). We assume the productivity follows a FrÃ©chet distribution from Eaton and Kortum
                                        s,j
(hereafter, EK, 2002). Productivity zi (Ï‰) is randomly drawn from


                                                                                     s,j
                                                    Fis,j (z) = exp(âˆ’Asi z âˆ’Î½ Î³Ìƒ ),
                      QN                        0
where     Î³Ìƒ s,j â‰¡       âˆ’ Î³ s,j ) âˆˆ [0, 1]. We further assume that productivity draws are
                        j 0 =j+1 (1
                                            s
independent across sectors and stages. Ai governs the scale of productivity for sector s in
                                                                                   s,j
country i. We assume that this scale parameter does not vary by stage. Î½Î³Ìƒ             captures

the dispersion of stage j productivities. Î½ is the standard FrÃ©chet shape parameter, and

governs the common variance of stage j productivity. The eective variance of stage j is
                                 s,j
stage-specic and is based on Î³Ìƒ .
                                            s,j
   The stage-specic shape parameter Î½Î³Ìƒ        has two advantages. First, as argued in AntrÃ s

and de Gortari (2017), this probability distribution makes a sequential sourcing decision

equivalent to the case where a lead rm chooses the entire sourcing path from the beginning.

This feature provides great analytic tractability, which we will discuss in more detail in

the next subsection.                Second, we can conveniently characterize the magnication eect of

GVC as discussed in Yi (2003).                         At the equilibrium, the eective trade elasticity                       Î½Î³Ìƒ s,j   is
                                                                       s,j
larger in downstream production stages, as                        Î³Ìƒ         is monotonically increasing in            j   for every     s.
The magnication eect of GVC is thus active through                                    Î³Ìƒ s,j   and potentially dierent across
                                             s,j s,j
                                                                                                           Î³Ìƒ s,j ,
                                    P
sectors. (In addition,                  j   Î³ Î³Ìƒ       =1     for every      s   by the denition of                  and we assume

Î³Ìƒ s,J â‰¡ 1   for every        s.)
    Our rich structure provides Ricardian and HO motives for trade. The Ricardian channel

is captured by        Asi ,   and is present across sectors. The HO channel operates through                                 Î²ij,o ,   and

is mainly present across stages. Dierent stages use occupations with dierent intensities.

hence,   Î³ s,j   can also be thought of as capturing the importance of the EK structure.




                                                                   10
For example, a design stage would use more designers or engineers, while an assembly stage

would employ relatively more production workers. Note that the value-added by a particular

occupation depends on the stage, not on the sector.                                          However, the eective occupation

intensity,       Î²ij,o Î±is Î³ s,j ,   depends also on sectors.               Finally, note that our HO parameters are

country-specic.


Workers             Workers are heterogeneous in their productivities for each sector and occupation

pair   (s, o).     A characterization of worker heterogeneity is based on Lee (2017). Each worker

supplies one unit of time. Workers vary in their eciency units of that time. The number

of eciency units             s,o    that each individual worker of type                        t   can supply for a specic   (s, o)   is

randomly drawn from the following FrÃ©chet distribution:



                                                    Gs,o            s,o âˆ’Î¸t
                                                     t () = exp(âˆ’Tt       ).

We assume that these distributions do not vary by country. Worker heterogeneity charac-

terized by       Gs,o
                  t () in this model is related to fundamental complementarity between workers'
skills and sector- and occupation-specic tasks, which is not necessarily dierent across coun-
         3
tries.

    Two types of stochastic comparative advantage arise from this probabilistic assumption.

First, between-worker-type comparative advantage is governed by the relative magnitude
                s,o                T s,o     T s,o
                                                0
of parameters Tt . For example, if st0 ,o0 > st0 ,o0 holds, then it is more likely that a type t
                                  Tt        Tt0
worker has comparative advantage for sector                            s and occupation o compared to another worker
             0                                      0   0   4
of type      t   and for another pair         (s , o ). Second, within-worker-type comparative advantage
depends on the shape                   parameter Î¸t . If workers' productivities are more dispersed within

a typei.e., lower            Î¸t ,   then eects from the within-worker-type comparative advantage will

be stronger than in the case of a larger                        Î¸t .   We further assume that draws of idiosyncratic

productivity for each                 (s, o)   are independent, which gives us the following joint distribution

for a vector of worker productivity                      = (1,1 , . . . , s,o , . . . , S,O ):
                                                                         X           0   0
                                                  Gt () = exp(âˆ’                  Tts ,o âˆ’Î¸t ).
                                                                         s0 ,o0


This framework for the labor supply side is an important channel which has not been widely

   3 Lee (2017) introduces a more general setup for worker productivity, where the distribution of worker
productivity varies by country. Since the model is solved in proportional changes and the scale parameter is
assumed to be xed over time, Lee (2017) does not back out the scale parameter for each country. On the
other hand, the shape parameter is estimated separately for four countries.
   4 In the next section we show that our main numerical result does not change when we uniformly scale up
one country's productivity, as long as the relative magnitude of                         Tts,o   remains unchanged within the country.




                                                                       11
studied in the literature. While changes in trade costs operate as one of the labor demand

shocks along the GVC, workers potentially respond to these shocks dierently based on their

own comparative advantage. This Roy channel allows for a more general sorting pattern of

workers.       Instead of assuming an exact one-to-one relationship between workers skills and
                                                                                                                        5
occupations, we allow for endogenous matching between skills, sectors, and occupations.

      We illustrate the worker and goods ows in Figure 1 below for a special case of the model

with two countries, sectors, occupations (H and L), stages, and worker types (H and L).




2.2         Equilibrium Sourcing Decision

In the above model, a nal producer for Ï‰ chooses the entire path of l(Ï‰) = (l1 (Ï‰), . . . , lJ (Ï‰))
by minimizing the total cost of production across all J stages. However, this approach makes

solving the model challenging, because we can no longer take advantage of the convenient

characteristics of the FrÃ©chet distribution. To deal with this issue, AntrÃ s and de Gortari

(hereafter, AG, 2017) introduce two alternative approaches. The rst is a sequential ap-

proach in which each stage                   j    producer chooses an optimal source for the               jâˆ’1     stage by

minimizing only its stage-specic production cost. The key assumption that they introduce

is that stage          j   producers know the exact productivity draw of the stage                    jâˆ’1        producers.

On the other hand, stage   j producers know only the productivity distribution of upstream
producers up to stage j âˆ’ 2; thus, they take the expectation of productivity up to stage j âˆ’ 2

as given when they minimize the production cost for stage j . Thus, this is a limited infor-

mation approach. The second approach is a lead-rm approach in which the assumption of

a country-stage-specic FrÃ©chet productivity parameter is replaced by a single FrÃ©chet pro-

ductivity parameter for an entire GVC. So, in a world with                             N   countries and   J   stages, there

are    NJ    possible GVCs, each with its own FrÃ©chet productivity parameter. AG show that

these two approaches are equivalent at the equilibrium under the probabilistic assumption of

zis,j (Ï‰)   as previously described. Our model draws from their result and, hereafter, we apply

the sequential approach.

      Another key assumption for the sourcing problem of this model is that each stage's

tions, which eliminate the Roy channel:

      1.   Î¸t â†’ âˆž      for all worker types. In this case, workers have the same productivity conditional on their
           type and their choice of sector and occupation.

      2. Each occupation has a corresponding worker type.

      3.   Tts,o â†’ 0   for every   o 6= t   and   Tts,t = 1   for all   s   and   t.

information on upstream productivities, we can derive an analytical solution for the equi-

librium GVC probability. We assume perfect competition for nal goods and intermediate

the FrÃ©chet distribution of product-specic productivity for each stage and each country, the

forj = 1, . . . , J âˆ’ 1. Similar         to the EK model, this probability is equal to the share of stage

j goods of sector s that are             produced in country              n    and used for stage          j+1   production in

country i.

      This GVC probability clearly shows the magnication eect of hierarchical production

as we go downstream.                Because      Î³Ìƒ s,j   is monotonically increasing in               j   for a given sector   s,
                                                                         s,j
the eective elasticity of bilateral trade ows                    Î½Î³Ìƒ         is increasing in       j.   Therefore, the eect

of changes in trade costs between two countries is magnied in downstream production

compared to upstream production.                          As dierent production stages use occupations with

dierent intensities, the demand for occupations will depend on this magnication eect.

To the extent          Î³ s,j   varies across sectors, the size of the magnication eect will also vary by

sector.

      Using the GVC probability result and the independence assumption for sourcing deci-

sions, we derive the equilibrium probability of an entire GVC path. The probability that a

nal good      Ï‰ of sector s consumed in country i has followed a specic GVC path l = (l1 , . . . , lJ )

Again, in this price index,              lJ+1 = i       and also          l0J+1 = i      for all     l0 6= l âˆˆ NJ .   We assume

Ïƒ <Î½+1           so that the gamma function in the price index is well-dened.



2.3       Equilibrium Labor Supply

Workers' labor supply response Ã  la Roy model is based on Lee (2017). We assume that every

worker inelastically supplies all of their time for working. Hence, the worker's labor supply

decision is only about allocating that time to a sector, occupation pair. Each worker chooses

a pair of sector       s   and occupation          o   to maximize her potential labor income conditional on

her   (S Ã— O)-dimensional             productivity matrix                 .   In other words, worker's problem can be

written as

                                                           max wis,o s,o ,
                                                             s,o

where    wis,o   is per-unit wage for workers in sector                        s   of country   i   with occupation   o.   Workers

take the per-unit wages as given. Since                    is randomly drawn from a joint FrÃ©chet distribution

                                                                    16
Gt (), the equilibrium labor supply decision for workers of type t for sector s and occupation
o is
                                   s,o          Tts,o (wis,o )Î¸t
                                  Ï€i,t = P           s0 ,o0     0 0     ,
                                            s0 ,o0 Tt       (wis ,o )Î¸t
where       Ï€its,o   is the share of workers of type                     t in country i that work in occupation o and sector
s.       The shape parameter                 Î¸t   for type         t   workers' productivity distribution is thus the labor

supply elasticity of type                  t workers at the sector and occupation level.                     Dierent worker types

are allowed to potentially have dierent labor supply elasticity in this model. Conditional

on the optimal labor supply decision, the equilibrium average wage of type                                           t    workers can be

derived as
                                                        X s0 ,o0 s0 ,o0               1
                                               wÌ„i,t = [        Tt (wi )Î¸t ]1/Î¸t Î“(1 âˆ’ ).
                                                         s0 ,o0
                                                                                      Î¸t

If we dene worker types based on educational attainment, the relative                                            wÌ„i,t   of high-skilled

workers over low-skilled workers will be a model counterpart of the skill premium, which is

one of our core objects of interest in the quantitative exercises.



2.4          General Equilibrium

The equilibrium per-unit wages                            wis,o     and the prices       Pis   are solved in general equilibrium

from market clearing conditions for each occupation. We have occupation market clearing

conditions for each country, sector, and occupation:

where we dene

                                                  Î›ji â‰¡ {l = (l1 , . . . , lJ ) âˆˆ NJ |lj = i}

as the set of GVCs that produce the                                    j -th   stage in country     i.   The left-hand side of the

above occupation market clearing condition is the total labor income earned by workers in

sector      s   of country        i   with occupation               o.   This term should be equal to the right-hand side,

which is the total payment for those specic workers. The goods market clearing condition

is embedded in the share of sector                           s    in total income on the right-hand side.

         Let us now discuss the components of the right-hand side in more detail. A key part of

the right-hand side is total spending from the countries purchasing" the goods and services

produced by the particular country-sector-occupation.                                          The spending has two sub-parts,

spending for nal use (consumption), and spending for intermediate use. This spending is




                                                                               17
then multiplied by a factor related to the roundabout nature of production, which is in turn

multiplied by the probability        Î»sl,n   that country   i is producing stage j     of a GVC that winds up

in the purchasing country. This term is then multiplied by the sectoral consumption share,

so we now have total spending on the particular stage and sector, controlling for roundabout

eects. This is then multiplied by the value-added component of this spending, which is the

product of the relevant     Î±, Î³ ,    and     Î²   terms. Finally, the right-hand side is summed over all

stages of production.

                                                                                              wis,o = 1.
                                                                                  P
   To solve the model, we rst normalize the wages to satisfy                         i,s,o                With this

normalization, and with the occupation market clearing conditions and the exact price index

as derived above, we can solve the model for the equilibrium                  wis,o   and Pis using the Alvarez
and Lucas (2007) algorithm. We rst guess initial                wis,o   and solve for   Pis following equation
                                s,o
(1). With the initial guess of wi and the solved              Pis , we calculate all equilibrium variables of
                                                                                                           s,o
the model to construct the occupation market                clearing conditions (2). We then update wi

according to the excess demand or supply of labor calculated from (2). Iterations continue

until the excess occupational demand or supply is suciently close to zero.



2.5    Discussion

The core mechanism of our model is the interaction between country-level comparative ad-

vantage (the     Ricardian and HO channels ) and worker-level comparative advantage (the Roy
channel ) along the GVC. If trade costs change in this economy, the relative demands for
country   i's   intermediate materials and nal goods change in all sectors, which, in turn will

aect each country's specialization pattern across sectors and stages. These changes in spe-

cialization patterns, in conjunction with the relative occupation intensity of each production

stage and the sector-specic GVC intensities, induce changes in the relative labor demand for

sectors and occupations. This labor demand change, in turn, aects sector- and occupation-

specic per-unit wages.       Workers then re-optimize their choice of sector and occupation.

Even though workers observe the same change in wages for each sector and occupation, the

individual worker's response will dier depending on his/her idiosyncratic productivity. The

worker choices will then imply the change in the skill premium.

   We now discuss how particular parameters of the model map into comparative advantage

and their skill premium. For countries, there is comparative advantage at the sector-level and

at the stage-level. Sector-level comparative advantage of countries is based primarily on the

relative magnitude of    Asi , i.e., the Ricardian channel.       Under typical circumstances, Ricardian

comparative advantage would have no eect on the skill premium. However, in conjunction

with the Roy feature  type            H     workers draw from a dierent distribution of sector-by-

occupation productivities than do type                         L   workers  Ricardian comparative advantage can

impact the skill premium.               The sector that a country will have a Ricardian comparative

advantage in will draw relatively more workers from the type that has relatively higher

productivity in that sector. Moreover, these workers will choose the occupation for which

they have the relatively higher productivity. Hence, this Ricardian-Roy channel can generate

changes in skill premium.

   Relative factor endowments also indirectly shape sector-level comparative advantage of
                                  s,o
countries through    LÌ„i,t and Ti,t   ,      because sectors also use dierent occupations with dierent
                           j,o s s,j
intensities based   on Î²i Î±i Î³ .              Note that if both           Î±is   and     Î³ s,j   are the same across sectors,

then relative factor endowments do not aect sector-level comparative advantage channel.

   A country's stage-level comparative advantage is driven primarily from the HO channel.

Owing to our assumption that the occupation intensity coecients                                  Î²ij,o do not vary by sector,
the textbook HO channel is not present. However, there are two other sources of HO forces.

The rst is that the occupation intensity coecients                            Î²ij,o   vary by stage, so this variation

                                                                               LÌ„i,t , as well as
across stages, in conjunction with dierences in supplies of the types of labor,
                        s,o
their productivities, Ti,t , will generate the HO channel. Clearly, without GVCs, in the form

of multi-stage production, this channel would not exist. The second is that to the extent

the roundabout parameter           1 âˆ’ Î±is ,       and/or GVC intensity            1 âˆ’ Î³ s,j      vary across sectors, it will

generate dierences in the eective factor intensity of the occupations across sectors. This,

in turn, generates the classic HO sector-level specialization. Hence, Stolper-Samuelson eects

occur. However, since occupational intensities vary also by country, this variation by country,

in conjunction with variation across sectors in the GVC intensity,                                 1 âˆ’ Î³ s,j   can also generate

changes in skill premia that potentially go in the same direction in both skill-abundant and

skill-scarce countries.

   The Ricardian channel also shapes the stage-level comparative advantage through the

interaction between     Asi   and       Î³ s,j .   If   Î³ s,j   does not vary by sector, then the stage-level com-

parative advantage is determined entirely by the HO force. Therefore, in the most general

case without any restriction on the model parameters, we can have both sector-level and

stage-level comparative advantages, each of which is aected by both the Ricardian and the

HO forces as explained above.

   It should be clear from the above discussion that the Roy channel, building from worker

type endowments     LÌ„i,t and workers productivities, Tts,o , is closely tied to the Ricardian channel
(primarily at the sector level) and the HO channel (primarily at the stage level).                                          The
                           s,o
combination of LÌ„i,t and Tt    determines the eective labor endowment. When trade costs

decline, the eective labor endowment aects specialization patterns, which in turn aects

the fundamental wages         wis,o .


                                                                    19
   Sector-level specialization has rst-order eects on relative wages across sectors, while

stage-level specialization has rst-order eects on relative wages across occupations. These

changes in sector- and occupation-level wages, in combination with workers' comparative ad-

vantage, represented by the relative magnitudes of                    Tts,o , lead to changes in the skill premium.
We note that stage-level specialization, which occurs only because of the GVC structure of

our model, provides a potentially important margin of changes in the skill premium through

labor demand shifts at the occupation level owing to the stage-specic occupation intensities.

Also, Lee (2017) shows that workers' comparative advantage is much more clearly pronounced

across occupations than across sectors. Therefore, the GVC channel of our model captures

an important facet of the Roy mechanism by accounting for countries' specialization across

production stages.

   In order to further study the eect of GVCs, we need to focus on the role of                                  Î³ s,j . Î³ s,j
captures the relative importance of the roundabout structure over the snake structure.

Because     (1 âˆ’ Î³ s,j )   denotes the share of stage         j âˆ’1    used for production of stage           j in sector s,
                                                                                                                s,j
the sequential structure of production through GVC becomes less important                                  as Î³     â†’ 1. In
the extreme case where          Î³ s,j = 1   for all   j = 1, . . . , J ,   only stage   J   production remains active

using only domestic labor inputs and composite intermediates of nished goods through the

roundabout structure. Our baseline model would then be equivalent to the multi-sector EK

model with intermediate inputs (but with just one production stage).

   As discussed in many papers in the literature including Yi (2003, 2010) and Johnson and

Noguera (2012), introducing GVCs into standard trade models can yield magnied eects

of changes in trade costs on aggregate outcomes such as bilateral and aggregate trade ows

and prices. Our result is in line with the implication for the magnication eect from the

literature. As    Î³ s,j â†’ 0, production stages become more inter-dependent, and the eective
                        s,j
trade   elasticity Î½Î³Ìƒ      becomes larger. Thus, aggregate eects from trade liberalization are

increasingly magnied with GVC intensity.

   It should be clear from the above discussion that it is not obvious that there is a monotonic

relationship between higher GVC intensity, i.e., higher                       1 âˆ’ Î³ s,j ,   and a higher change in the

skill premium in one or both countries induced by lower trade barriers. Variation in GVC

intensity   Î³ s,j   across sectors puts dierent weights on labor demand shifts across sectors and

stages.   How much of specialization eect across sectors and stages translates into wage

responses is governed by the contribution of each stage in each sector.                           Î³ s,j   accounts for the

size of the contribution. We will further discuss interaction of distributional eects of trade

with the GVC intensity using a simple 2-stage version of our model in the next section.

3     A Simple Two" Model

In this section, we simplify our baseline model to two countries, sectors, production stages,

occupations, and worker types.                  We rst describe the set up of the simplied model and

derive the labor market equilibrium conditions. We then conduct numerical exercises with

this simplied model to convey intuition on the role of GVCs in aggregate and distributional

outcomes.



3.1       Model Setup and Equilibrium

We begin by briey reviewing the big picture of worker choice, production, and aggregation,

and then we provide two key equations, the one governing equilibrium GVCs, and the labor

market clearing condition. Each country has an exogenous supply of two types of workers.

Worker's optimization problem is the same as in the baseline model.

    Individual goods (in a given sector and country) are produced in two stages.                               First, a

composite intermediate and the occupational factor inputs are combined to make the stage

1 good. To further simplify the model, we assume that the occupation intensity                                Î² j,o   does

not vary by country in this simple Two model. Then, the stage 1 good is combined with a

composite intermediate and occupational factors to make the stage 2 good. The use of the

stage 1 good in stage 2 production captures the GVC part of our model, and its intensity                                Î³s
determines the GVC intensity for sector                   s , 1 âˆ’ Î³ s.     The production process is illustrated in

the boxes in the middle of Figure 1.

    Finally, the individual goods are aggregated (across sectors) into a composite good, which

is used for nal consumption at home and abroad, and also as a composite intermediate

in stage 1 and stage 2 production.                   The ows of the composite intermediate capture the

roundabout production part of the model.

    Again, following the AntrÃ s and de Gortari (2017) assumptions of independence for the

stage-specic productivity draws, and of limited information across stages, the equilibrium

probability that a sector-s product consumed by country                          i consumers follows a specic GVC

eective trade elasticities for stage 2 goods than for stage 1 goods.

clearing conditions. For each country i, sector                                  s, and occupation o, the labor market clearing

                          s,o
of the above equation is Ï€i,t , which, as a reminder, is the share of type t workers who choose

sector s and occupation o. On the right-hand side, the two terms are the implicit demand for

occupational service o to make stage 1 goods and stage 2 goods, respectively. For each stage,
                                                                                   P
there is the implied occupational demand from nal use (the term that includes        t wÌ„n,t LÌ„n,t ),
as well as the implied occupational demand for intermediate use (the term that includes
                  0                        0   0

this term depends on the exact expenditure from each sector                                                     s0   on intermediates, which

requires identication of the exact input-output coecients between sectors. However, the

Roy feature of our model makes that calculation straightforward. All downstream demand

can be characterized as proportional to the payments to the workers in a given sector, which

equals total expenditure in that sector in general equilibrium.



3.2            Numerical Exercises

In this section, we solve the Two" model to provide further intuition. We focus on the HO

comparative advantage channels. In other words, we eliminate the Ricardian comparative

advantage motive by setting the productivity distribution for goods production equal across

sectors and countries.

      The parameters and exogenous variables of our simple model are set so that country 1

is relatively abundant in type                           L   workers, who have a comparative advantage in sector 1

and occupation 1. Moreover, stage 1 production uses occupation 1 more intensively; hence,

country 1 has a comparative advantage in stage 1 production, as well. It should be clear

that the HO comparative advantage depends on the interaction of the endogenous labor




                                                                              22

variation across stages.

     The particular parameters and exogenous variables are given by: 1) Ricardian compara-

tive advantage parameter              Asi = 1 for all i and s; 2) type-level labor supply (LÌ„1,H , LÌ„1,L , LÌ„2,H , LÌ„2,L ) =
(0.3, 0.7, 0.7, 0.3); 3) occupation intensity for each productions stage (Î² 1,1 , Î² 1,2 , Î² 2,1 , Î² 2,2 ) =
( 32 , 31 , 13 , 32 ); 4) the scale parameter of workers' productivity distribution (TH1,1 , TH1,2 , TH2,1 , TH2,2 ) =
(1, 3, 2, 4) and (TL1,1 , TL1,2 , TL2,1 , TL2,2 ) = (4, 2, 3, 1); and 5) Î³ 1 = 0.3 and Î³ 2 = 0.7. We set the
trade elasticity (i.e., the part common across the two stages), Î½ = 4; the elasticity of sub-

stitution across products in preferences, Ïƒ = 2; and the labor supply elasticity, Î¸t = 1.5

for all t. Consumers are assumed to have the same expenditure share across sectors i.e.,

b1 = b2 = 0.5, and the roundabout parameter is the same across all sectors and countriesi.e.,
Î±is = 0.3 for all i and s.
     In the exercises below, we compare a high trade cost case to a free trade cost case.
                                                                  s
Specically, we compare the case with                            Ï„in = 2 for i 6= n and Ï„iis = 1 (high            trade cost

case) to a free trade case with Ï„in                         = 1 for all i, n, s. Given trade costs and          parameter

values, we solve the occupation market clearing conditions and the exact price indices for

the equilibrium         wis,o   and       Pis   following the Alvarez and Lucas (2007) algorithm. In so doing,

trade costs, we will experiment with dierent values of                             Î³s   and with a sector-level variation

premium.

     A reduction in trade costs enables producers to source intermediates from the lowest cost

supplier and also enables consumers to purchase nal goods from the lowest cost producer.

Consequently, not surprisingly, as trade costs fall to zero, the aggregate price index decreases

in each country  by 91% in country 1 and by 90% in country 2.

     The rst two columns of numbers in Table 1 give the prevalence of particular GVCs when
                    s
trade costs        Ï„in =2       for   i 6= n.     For example,         83.7   percent of the sector   1   GVCs whose nal

     6 Both sector- and stage-level comparative advantages come from the HO force in this numerical exercise.
Because the model assumes that the occupation intensity does not vary by sector, sector-level HO comparative
advantage is of second-order.




                                                                      23
destination is country    1   involve both stage 1 and stage 2 made in country 1. Because trade

costs are high, both countries source stage 1 materials and nal goods primarily domestically.

The next two columns show the prevalence of particular GVCs when trade costs are uniformly

reduced to zero, i.e.,   Ï„in = 1   for all   i   and     n.   Now, there is more specialization according to

comparative advantage. For example, the particular GVC mentioned above represents only

26.4   percent of all the sector    1   GVCs whose nal destination is country                       1.    By contrast, a

vertical specialization GVC, such as one in which stage 1 is made in country 1 and stage

2 is made in country 2, rises in prevalence from                     0.8     percent under high trade costs to       26.5
under free trade (for nal consumers of sector                 1    goods in country        1).
   These results mirror those in Yi (2003, 2010). One additional point to highlight is that

when trade costs fall, domestic sourcing (l1 , l2 )
                                               = (1, 1)) falls by more in sector 1 than in
                           1            2
sector 2. This is because Î³ = 0.3 < Î³ = 0.7; in other words, stage 1 goods are more

important in stage 2 production in sector 1, which implies the eective trade elasticity is

higher in sector 1.

   Table 2 shows the within-type labor allocation pattern predicted by our simple model.

The table shows that regardless of trade costs, workers are more likely to work in their

comparative advantage sector and occupation.                         Also, even though each worker type has

a comparative advantage in a particular sector and occupation, owing to heterogeneity in

productivity within each type, the within-type labor allocation does not involve complete

specialization. For example, about 8.1% of type                          H   workers in country 1 work in sector 1

in occupation 1, even though type        H   workers have on average a comparative advantage in

sector 2 and occupation 2.

   When trade costs fall, and specialization according to comparative advantage increases,

workers of both types move between sectors accordingly. For example, because country                   1
has a comparative advantage in sector 1, both type            H   and   L   workers in country 1 shift to

sector 1, and similarly in country 2. In addition, workers choose dierent occupations when

they move between sectors.       This pattern depends on worker-level comparative advantage

for occupations. For example, while some of both type             H   and   L   workers in country 1 move

from sector 2 to sector 1, type   H   workers in occupation 2 increase by 0.6 percentage points,

and type   H   workers in occupation 1 increase by 0.3 percentage points within sector 1. By

contrast, type   L workers of country 1 in occupation 1 increase by 0.8 percentage points,           and

those type workers in occupation 2 increase by 0.1 percentage points, in sector 1.

   To summarize, in response to the reduction in trade costs, the Roy channel of our model

reallocates workers across sectors and occupations within their type. Workers may stay in

the same sector, but move to a dierent occupation, an outcome not present in standard

trade models with homogeneous workers. This endogenous labor supply reallocation mirrors

what is in Lee (2017). However, what is dierent here is the importance of stage-level spe-

cialization. Owing to our choice of parameters  identical factor intensities and distribution

of productivities across sectors  in the absence of two stages of production, and the dierent

GVC intensity (1    âˆ’ Î³ s)   across sectors, there would be no Roy channel impacting the HO


                                                      25
mechanism. The GVCs provide additional propagation mechanisms for Roy and HO.

     The reduction in trade costs changes the skill premium in the direction predicted by the

Stolper-Samuelson theorem. As a reminder, country 1 is abundant in type                         L   workers, who

have a comparative advantage in occupation 1, which is used more intensively by stage 1

and sector 1.         Therefore, as trade costs go down, the relative demand for type                     L workers
increases in country 1 and decreases in country 2. The opposite is true for type                         H workers.
Hence, our model implies that as trade costs decline, the skill premium increases by 1.1% in

country 2, and decreases by 1.1% in country 1.

     In our exercise, the worker productivity distributions are the same across countries. What

would be the eect of lower trade costs if the distributions were dierent? We consider a

special case in which we uniformly scale up one country's labor productivity                     Tts,o   holding its

relative magnitude across sectors, occupations, and types xed. For example, if we multiply

every     Tts,o   by two so workers in country 2 are twice as much productive on average, then

the skill premium decreases by -1.29% in country 1 and increases by 1.06% in country 2. As

long as worker's comparative structure remains unchanged, uniform increase of the average

productivity does not change our main result, because labor market outcomes of interest such

as labor allocation and relative average wage all depend on worker's comparative advantage,

not on their absolute advantage.

     This numerical exercise is set up to highlight the Stolper-Samuelson eect through the

GVC. As we have mentioned above, our general model allows for non-Stolper-Samuelson

eects. The key parameter of our two-stage model that governs the relative importance of

the GVC is  1âˆ’Î³ s for each sector s = 1, 2. The eective GVC intensity, as well as the eective
                                s                          s
trade elasticity, decreases in Î³ . In the extreme case of Î³ = 1, the eective trade elasticity
                                                   s
for stage 1 is zero. This might suggest that the Î³ = 0 generates the strongest GVC eect.

It does for aggregate trade, but not for the skill premium, as we will see below. To illustrate

the role of       1 âˆ’ Î³ s,   we repeat the exercise of a reduction in trade costs from
                                                                                                s
                                                                                              Ï„in         s
                                                                                                  = 2 to Ï„in =1
with all the parameters the same as above, except for the values of                   Î³ s,   which range from 0

to   1   in each sector.

     Figure 2 shows that domestic sourcing (both stages are produced in the consuming coun-

try) declines as trade costs decline for all values of          Î³ s.   The key point is that in panel (a), with

lower values of        Î³ 1,   i.e., higher values of GVC intensity, the decrease in domestic sourcing in

sector     1   is larger, and similarly for sector     2   in panel (b). Again, the intuition is that with

higher values of        1 âˆ’ Î³ 1,   the elasticity of domestic sourcing in sector     1 with respect to trade
costs is larger, because more of the good-in-process crosses multiple borders. In addition,

the magnitude of changes in the probability of domestic sourcing in a certain sector depends

only on its own GVC intensity, and not on the GVC intensity of the other sector.

        Figure 3 shows that the change in the skill premium from a decline in trade costs is not

monotonic in the values of                            Î³1   and     Î³ 2.    Our interpretation is that the GVC intensity, i.e.,

1 âˆ’ Î³ s,                interacts with other factors to inuence the skill premium.                                                    Indeed, note that the
                                                                                                           1                       2
skill premium change in country                              1     is maximized when                      Î³ =0             and    Î³ = 1,      i.e., the greatest

value-added weight is placed on country 1's comparative advantage sector and stage (sector

1   and stage               1),      and similarly for country                 2.   In other words, the skill premium change is

larger if a country has a great deal of value-added in the sector and stage in which it has a

comparative advantage. More broadly, GVCs transfer country-level comparative advantages

to worker-level comparative advantages by putting dierent value-added weights on dierent

production stages in dierent sectors.                                     This mechanism makes the distributional impact

of trade shocks non-monotonic in GVC intensities.                                                        Therefore, we should expect sectoral

variation in the GVC intensity to play an important role in the skill premium response to

changes in trade costs.



        In summary, the results from our numerical exercises show how GVC intensities and

the Roy mechanism interact with standard HO comparative advantage.                                                                                First, as trade

costs decline, countries specialize in their comparative advantage production stage, which

shifts relative labor demand for occupations in our model. Second, depending on dierent

GVC intensities across sectors, sector-level labor demand is also aected. Third, the Roy

mechanism makes workers respond to trade shocks dierently across sectors and occupations,

even though workers are exposed to the same trade shock. Fourth, as predicted in existing

papers in the literature, aggregate eects of reduction in trade costs on trade ows and

prices are monotonically increasing in the GVC intensity.                                                                Fifth, the distributional eects

4                                      Calibration

Our numerical exercise above shows the basic mechanism of our model in a simple two-stage

case with only two countries, worker types, occupations, and sectors.                                                                                                               We now calibrate

the general version of our model to data.                                                                 Our goal is to assess the role of GVCs as a

propagation mechanism transmitting global integration shocks, such as China joining the

WTO, for aggregate trade outcomes, as well as distributional outcomes, such as the skill

premia. In particular, our focus is on the role of the GVC intensity.

    Following the calibrated framework, we turn to the parameters.                                                                                                          Some parameters are

assigned, some are directly estimated from the data, and some are set to match moments in

the data. Specically, the trade elasticity                                                       Î½   , the elasticity of substitution of product varieties

Ïƒ are assigned; type-level labor supply LÌ„i,t , nal good expenditure shares bs , and trade costs
 s
Ï„in are estimated from the data; the Roy worker productivity parameters are assigned and

calibrated based on Lee (2017); and the production function parameters - the sector-specic

GVC intensity                                             Î³ s,   the value-added share            Î±is ,   Ricardian productivities                                          Asi ,   and country- and
                                    j,o
stage-specic occupation intensity Î²i . - are set to match moments in the data.

4.1        Countries, Worker Types, Occupations, and Production Stages

We calibrate the model to three countriesChina, U.S., and a constructed rest-of-the-world

(ROW) for the year 2000, the year before China joined the WTO. Workers are classied by

T = 5        types, dened by educational attainment: 1) high school dropouts; 2) high school

graduates; 3) workers with some college education; 4) college graduates; and 5) workers

with advanced degrees.            When we calculate the skill premium, we dene skilled workers

as those who have at least some college education.                  We dene ve occupation categories

(O   = 5)     following Dorn (2009): 1) low-skilled service occupations and agricultural workers;

2) assemblers and machine operators; 3) precision production and crafts occupations; 4) ad-

ministrative, clerical, and sales occupations; and 5) managers, professionals, and technicians.

This categorization is based on both skill levels required by occupation and the routineness

of occupation.

     In addition, we use the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) for 2000.                               We reduce

the WIOD tables for that year into one with China, U.S., and the ROW, and with three

sectors (S       = 3):   agriculture and mining, manufacturing, and services. AG and de Gortari

(2017) show how to map the GVC concepts into input-output ows. We will do this from

our framework with two stages of production. In AG, the number of stages that t their

data the best is         J = 2.   Accordingly, we calibrate our model with two production stages,
         7
J = 2.


4.2        Assigned Parameters, Labor Supply and Expenditure Shares

We assign     Î½ = 4 from Simonovska and Waugh (2014) for the common stage-invariant part of
trade    elasticity. Conditional on the assigned value of Î½ , we calibrate bilateral trade costs for

each country pair and each sector using bilateral trade ows of nal goods in the WIOD 2000.

We set  Ïƒ = 2 for the elasticity of substitution between within-sector product varieties. Type-
level labor supply (LÌ„i,t ) is obtained from Barro and Lee (2013), and the sector expenditure
        s
share b is calibrated to exactly match the sector expenditure share in the WIOD.



4.3        Calibration of Bilateral Trade Costs

Our model delivers a mapping from the GVC probability                      Î»sl,n   to bilateral trade ows of

goods. Similarly to AG, trade ows of nal goods from country                      i   to country   n   are dened
     F,s
                      Î»sl,n , where Î›Ji is a set of all GVC paths which perform the nal production
                 P
by Î»Ìƒin      =    lâˆˆÎ›J
                     i
stage in      country i. We obtain the data counterparts to these bilateral trade ows from the

   7 In a more general version of calibration,   J   can be also jointly calibrated with other parameters of the
model.

                                    in    from the WIOD to calibrate bilateral trade costs, we impose two

identifying assumptions. First, there is no trade cost for domestic transactionsi.e.,                                                     Ï„iis = 1
                                                                                                                   s     s
for every   i   and   s.   Second, bilateral trade costs are symmetrici.e.,                                      Ï„in = Ï„ni      for   every (i, n)

and   s.
   Using the expression of                Î»sl,n     from the model, the common trade elasticity                                    Î½,   and these

two identifying assumptions, we can back out bilateral trade costs                                               Ï„in   by following the Head

Table 3 summarizes calibrated trade costs for each country-pair and sector. Not surprisingly,

bilateral trade costs are lowest in the manufacturing sector and highest in the service sector

on average. We will use these trade costs to calibrate other parameters of the model from

the 2000 WIOD.

4.4        Calibration of the Roy Parameters

Our framework for heterogeneous worker productivities yield the same analytic form of the

equilibrium wage distribution as that of Lee (2017).                                                Using the independence assumption

between productivity draws and the characteristics of FrÃ©chet distribution, we can derive

the distribution of the equilibrium observed wage                                        wÌƒ    for each worker type       t8 :

   Lee (2017) estimates                   s0 ,o0                              and        Î¸t   for four countries including the U.S. In

our paper, we assume that the productivity distribution of workers does not vary by country.

  8 The observed wage       wÌƒ   is dierent from per-unit wage                      wis,o .   Wages we observe in data are not          wis,o   but   wÌƒ
which takes both per-unit wage and worker productivity into account.



                                                                             30
Thus, we take the estimates for the U.S. from Lee (2017) and assume that China and ROW

have the same parameter values. The estimates of                      Î¸t    range from 1.48 to 1.97 and are lower

for more educated worker types. These estimates suggest that better-educated workers have

more dispersed productivity distributions within their type.                         Because     Î¸t    is also the shape

parameter of the distribution of equilibrium observed wages, this result also suggests that the

wage distribution of high-skilled workers is more dispersed than that of low-skilled workers.

This feature can be easily conrmed with individual wage proles data as documented by

Lee (2017).

because we compare ratios, not levels, of Tt    to shape worker-level comparative advantage.

identied across both sectors and occupations.               While all worker types are more produc-

tive in absolute terms when they are in the service sector than in the agriculture sector,

better-educated workers have a comparative advantage in the service sector. On the other

hand, low-skilled workers have a comparative advantage in agriculture and mining sectors.

Worker-level comparative advantage is much more clearly pronounced across occupations.

While the average values of           Tts,o range from 0.87 to 2.72 across ve occupations for high
                                         s,o
school graduates,          the average Tt    of workers with advanced degrees for managerial and pro-

fessional occupations is about 155 times larger than their average for low-skill service jobs. In

other words, better educated workers have a much larger advantage for having high-skilled

occupations than for being in the service sector.              In addition, the relative magnitudes of

Tts,o show that, for better educated workers, having high-skilled occupations is much more
benecial if they are in the service sector than in other sectors.

   Î¸t   and   Tts,o   shape worker-level comparative advantage within and across types, which is

the Roy channel in our model. Because workers have dierent productivities across sectors

and occupations, the same trade shocks can generate dierent sector- and occupation-level

responses among workers, as we showed in the previous section.                     In addition, the relative
               s,o
magnitude of Tt , along with the type-level labor supply                  LÌ„i,t , Tts,o ,   aects the eective

occupation-level labor endowment, which shapes the Heckscher-Ohlin comparative advantage

across sectors and production stages.



4.5     Calibration of the Production Parameters

After we calibrate the trade costs, the common trade elasticity, the type-level labor supply,

the Roy parameters, and the demand parameters, we calibrate the remaining production

side parameters,           Î³ s , Î±is , Asi , and Î²ij,o for the year 2000. This is a total of 45 parameters,
                  Î²ij,o
          P
because       o           = 1 for every (i, j). We calibrate these parameters to match data moments
as closely as possible.           For the rst three sets of parameters, we follow AG by targeting

similar sets of moments. Because our model has multiple sectors, we target sector-specic

moments. Each set of targeted moments discussed below can be linked to each parameter.

However, the relationship between targeted moments and parameters is not one-to-one, of

course. All of the calibrated parameters are jointly related to all of the targeted moments

through the general equilibrium.

   First, we calibrate the expressions for domestic absorption of nal goods and intermediate

goods from the corresponding WIOD 2000 data. The model expression for bilateral trade

ows of nal goods is           Î»ÌƒF,s
                                  in    as derived above. Intermediate trade ows can be a part of the

roundabout structure or a part of the GVC structure.                 We denote bilateral trade ows of

Taking both roundabout and GVC production structures into account, bilateral trade ows
                                                                                             I,s

                          s
intensity Î³ . Unlike in AG, we also exploit sector-level variation in domestic absorption to

obtain the sector-specic GVC intensity.

     The WIOD also reports value-added and gross output in each industry and each country.

We aggregate the tables to three countries and three sectors. We then compute the ratio

of value-added to gross output in each sector and each country.                                                    We use this moment to

help calibrate the country- and sector-specic value-added shares                                                 Î±is .    We also calibrate the
                                   s
Ricardian productivity parameters Ai by targeting the share of GDP of each sector within

each country and the share of each country's aggregate GDP in total world GDP.

     The occupation intensity            Î²ij,o   at each production stage in each country is identied from

a combination of the diagonal entries of the                         Î»ÌƒF,s
                                                                       in      and      Î»ÌƒI,s
                                                                                          ik    matrices, the share of value-added

to gross output, and the share of wage payment to a particular occupation within each

sector in each country. This last moment is obtained from the ILOSTAT database from the

International Labor Organization (ILO.)

     Summarizing, we jointly calibrate                       Î³ s , Î±is , Asi ,     and      Î²ij,o    to match as closely as possible

the model moments to their data counterparts. There are 75 data moments in total, as the

occupation payment share adds up to 1 for each country and sector. Table A1 and Table

A2 in the Appendix report the calibration results for                                    Î³ s , Î±is , Asi ,       and      Î²ij,o   for the year 2000.

The model-generated moments t the targeted moments reasonably well. The correlation

between these two sets of moments is 0.91. Our model is moderately successful at matching

non-targeted moments. For example, the correlation coecient between the model-predicted

o-diagonal entries of the           Î»ÌƒF,s
                                       in    and    Î»ÌƒI,s
                                                      ik      matrices and their data counterparts is 0.56.

     We highlight several features of our calibrated parameters.                                                 First, there is variation in

Î³s   across sectors. The range is from 0.13 for agriculture and mining, with 0.80 and 0.65 for

manufacturing and services, respectively. As a reminder, lower values of                                                          Î³s       imply a greater

share of stage-two production is coming from the stage-one good. For example, agriculture




                                                                     33
stage-two production depends greatly on its stage-one input.

        Second, the calibrated value-added shares   Î±is vary a great deal across countries and sectors
with a mean of 0.38 with a standard deviation of 0.22. Third, the Ricardian productivity

parameters      Asi   suggest that China has a comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector,
                                                                             9
and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in the services sector.                 This Ricardian comparative

advantage will shape the sector-level specialization patterns, while the endowment-based

comparative advantage from the Roy channel will mainly determine stage-level specialization

pattern.

        Fourth, the calibrated occupation intensities     Î²ij,o   indicate that a production stage has

dierent interpretations across countries in terms of occupation intensity. In relative terms,

stage one uses high-skilled occupations more intensively than stage two in the U.S. In China,

stage two uses high-skilled occupations more intensively than stage one. If the U.S. specializes

in stage 1 and China specializes in stage 2 following a trade liberalization, this pattern in

Î²ij,o   will be consistent with the skill upgrading story of Feenstra and Hanson (1995), Zhu and

Treer (2005), and Costinot and Vogel (2010). This is one implication of our model that goes

beyond that of Lee (2017). In addition, in our model, with its explicit vertical production

structure, occupation intensities carry dierent weights based on the GVC intensity for each

sector.     In previous research on oshoring without a vertical production structure, factor

intensities essentially carry the same weight in the entire value chain. From the lens of our

GVC structure, the calibrated        Î³s   shows that the condition of the same weight across stages

is not satised. In other words, the role of occupation intensity is more or less important

across stages and sectors depending on the magnitude of               Î³ s.       We will further discuss this

mechanism in the next section.




5         Counterfactuals

Based on the calibrated and estimated parameters from Section 4, we perform counterfactual

exercises in order to quantitatively assess the aggregate and distributional impacts of trade

liberalization.       We solve the model with bilateral trade costs and other model parameters

calibrated to the year 2000. We then introduce exogenous changes in bilateral trade costs

to the model. The main counterfactual scenario we look at is a 50% decline in trade costs

for China-U.S. only. The goal of this counterfactual is to quantitatively assess the aggregate

and distributional eects of China's integration into world economy  focusing on its trade

with the U.S.  in an explicit GVC setting.

        This shock is especially relevant for our paper, because following China's entry into the

    9 They also suggest China has a comparative advantage in agriculture.

WTO in 2001, it has had an enormous impact on the global economy, and, as part of that

impact, it has heavily specialized in global value chains.                     Our model should capture the

multiple facets in which the China shock aects labor demand and labor supply in dierent

countries through sector- and stage-level specialization, interaction between country- and

worker-level comparative advantages, and the relative GVC intensity across sectors.

    We then perform several counterfactual exercises designed to understand the main mech-

anisms, as well as the role of our GVC parameter                   Î³ s,   behind our results. We also conduct

three robustness exercises with alternative specications for the production function coef-

cients    Î±, Î²       and    Î³.   We note that all of the results presented below are quantitative, not

qualitative. They depend on the general equilibrium interaction of all the mechanisms we

have discussed in our paper, with the specic magnitude of each mechanism dictated by the

calibrated values of the parameters.



5.1       Baseline Counterfactual Results

In our baseline counterfactual exercise, we use our model calibrated to the year 2000 and then

reduce the trade costs between China and the U.S. We briey review some of the aggregate

implications, and then we turn to the specialization patterns, and the distributional impacts.

Our primary measure of distributional impact will be the skill premium, which we dened

earlier in the data as the wage premium of workers who have at least some college education

over workers without any college education. The model counterpart of the skill premium is

wÌ„i,H /wÌ„i,L ,   where worker types        H   and   L   are dened as some college education and higher,
                                                                  10
and high school graduates and lower, respectively.

    Owing to the lower trade costs between China and the U.S. real wages, and hence, welfare,

increases for each type of worker in each country. The increases across types in China range

from   15%       to   18%.   In the U.S., the welfare increases range from        4%   to   5%   across types. The

welfare gains in ROW are all less than               0.2%, because ROW is not experiencing a direct trade
shock in our counterfactual. In addition, not surprisingly, trade shares of output increase.

We nd, for example, that China's export share of gross output in the manufacturing sector

increases (in log terms) by             22%.   The U.S. export share of gross output in manufacturing

increases (in log terms) by            34%.
    We now turn to the sector and stage specialization patterns. Table 5 below shows the

baseline changes in the share of each sector's value-added out of the aggregate value added of

  10 We can compute other measures of inequality, such as the Theil index, the 90th-50th percentile wage
gap, and/or the 50th-10th percentile wage gap. However, owing to our estimates of            Î¸t ,   which are all   < 2,
the variance of the wage distribution is technically        âˆž.   Hence, measures of inequality that are related to
variances, such as all the measures mentioned above, will likely not yield meaningful numbers.

a country. This table shows that China's manufacturing value-added share increases. In the

United States, the services value-added share increases. This is the sense in which China's

comparative advantage is in manufacturing, and the U.S.'s is in services.

   To illustrate the importance of stage-level specialization in response to the decline in

trade costs between China and the U.S., Table 6 shows for each country-sector pair the

percentage change in stage 1 output as a share of total output across both stages. The table

shows that China specializes in stage 2 in all sectors and the United States specializes in

stage 1 in all sectors. Looking at Tables 5 and 6, note that the U.S. comparative advantage

in stage 1 of services dominates its disadvantage in stage 2 of services, so that, in total,

the U.S. service sector value-added share rises. Similarly, China's comparative advantage in

stage 2 of manufacturing dominates its disadvantage in stage 1 of manufacturing, so that in

total, China's manufacturing sector value-added share rises.

   Our model also yields the labor reallocation patterns within each worker type in response

to the China trade integration shock. Figure 4 shows the labor reallocation across sectors and

occupations for high school dropouts and workers with advanced degrees in China and the

U.S. Each country's comparative advantage across sectors is a major factor that determines

workers' reallocation across sectors. In China, both worker types tend to reallocate to the

manufacturing sector. In the U.S., both worker types are likely to move to the service sector.


                                             36
While sector-level reallocation is similar between worker types, dierent worker types tend

to choose dierent occupations even when they are moving into the same sector.                                                                                                                                   This
                                                                                 s,o
occupation-level labor reallocation is determined by the relative magnitude of Tt    across

occupations. For example, in the U.S., even though both worker types are likely to move into

the service sector, less educated workers are moving to low-skill service occupations, while

higher educated workers are more likely to move into managerial and professional occupations

in the service sector. Lastly, our model predicts more reallocation for less educated workers,

which is related to their larger labor allocation elasticity                                                                                                         Î¸t      from our estimation.

   How do all the changing specializations and reallocations show up in the skill premium?

The rst row of Table 7 shows the skill premium results for each country. Our model implies

that decline in China's trade costs with the U.S. leads to an increase of the skill premia


                                                                                                              37
in China and the United States by       1.81%   and    0.95%,   respectively. The ROW has a slight

decline in its skill premium.

   The increase in the skill premium in China reects two osetting forces. At the sector

level, China has a comparative advantage in manufacturing. Less educated workers in China

have a comparative advantage in the manufacturing sector. Hence, the sector level leads to

a decrease in the skill premium in China. On the other hand, at the stage level, China has

a comparative advantage in stage 2 production. Stage 2 production in China is high-skilled

occupation intensive; moreover, higher educated workers have a comparative advantage in

high-skilled occupations.    Hence, the stage level channel leads to an increase in the skill

premium. In other words, the stage specialization introduced by our GVC structure delivers

the skill upgrading story from the literature.         Overall, our model predicts that the stage

specialization dominates the sector specialization, leading to an increase in China's skill

premium.

   The increase in the U.S. is driven by sector and stage specialization forces, both of which

go in the same direction.       The U.S. has a comparative advantage in the service sector.

Moreover, highly educated workers in the U.S. have a comparative advantage in the services

sector. Hence, the sector channel leads to an increase in the skill premium. The U.S. also has

a comparative advantage in stage 1 production. Stage 1 production in the U.S. is high-skilled

occupation intensive; moreover, higher educated workers have a comparative advantage in

high-skilled occupations.    Hence, the stage channel also leads to an increase in the skill

premium.

   To provide support for our above intuition, as well as to further understand our results,

we conduct several additional counterfactuals in which we remove the transmission channels,

are focusing on understanding the transmission channels.

   In the rst additional counterfactual, we remove the Ricardian trade mechanism by set-

ting the Ricardian productivity parameters for each country-sector pair to be the geometric
                                                              s 1/I

mean across the countries within the sector, i.e., AÌ„ = Î i=1 Ai     . The second row of Table

7 provides the eects of the lower Chinese trade costs with the U.S. on the skill premium in

each country. The skill premium in China increases by more than in the baseline case, while

the skill premium in the U.S. now declines.

   With the Ricardian channel removed, our model generates sector specialization patterns

that are opposite to what we observe in the data. The lower trade costs now allow China to

specialize in manufacturing and services. As discussed above in the Roy parameter estimation

results, highly educated worker types like to sort into services. Hence, the increase in demand

for Chinese services leads to increased demand for highly educated Chinese workers, which

then leads to an increase in the skill premium that is larger than in the baseline case.

Put dierently, China's Ricardian comparative advantage in manufacturing allows China to

specialize only in manufacturing when trade costs decline, which has a dampening eect

on its skill premium owing to the forces described above.                     Turning to the U.S., in this

counterfactual, the U.S. specializes in agriculture and mining  its value-added shares in

both manufacturing and services decline. On the worker side, from Table 4 it can be seen

that less educated workers have a comparative advantage in agriculture and mining. Hence,

the U.S. skill premium declines. Overall, this counterfactual shows the central importance

of sector specialization in understanding our results.

   In the second additional counterfactual, we remove the country-specic feature of the

production function occupation coecients by setting                 Î²ij,o   equal to the arithmetic mean
                               j,o
                                         PI    j,o
across countries, i.e.,   Î²Ì„         =    i=1 Î²i . In other words, in this counterfactual, we will have the
usual HO mechanism operating across stages, and nothing more. Thus, the skill upgrading

story plays no role.      The third row of Table 7 shows that, in response to the lower trade

costs, China's skill premium rises by less than in the baseline, and the U.S. has a decline its

skill premium, again the opposite sign of the baseline result.

   In this counterfactual, the sector specialization pattern, which is determined largely by

the Ricardian productivity parameters, is similar to that of the baseline.                  Moreover, the

stage specialization pattern is also similar to that of the baseline. Recall that China's stage

2 occupation coecients were overall more skill intensive than in stage 1. The arithmetic

means across countries of the stage 2 occupation coecients are similar to China's stage 2

coecients. However, the arithmetic means across countries of the stage 1 occupation coef-

cients are more skill-intensive than China's stage 1 occupation coecients. This means the

gap in China's skill intensity between stage 1 and stage 2 is much smaller in this counter-



                                                         39
factual (than in the baseline). Hence, the same changes in specialization patterns will result

in a smaller change in the skill premium. Turning to the U.S., we have a similar argument.

The arithmetic means of the stage 2 occupation coecients are similar to those of the U.S.

However, the arithmetic means of the stage 1 occupation coecients are less skill-intensive

than those of the U.S. Hence, to the extent that the U.S. still specializes in stage 1 goods,

this is going to reward less-skilled labor and lead to a decline in the skill premium. Why

does the U.S. continue to specialize in stage 1 when the trade costs decline? This is because

the U.S. specializes in services, owing to Ricardian comparative advantage, and, because          Î³s
for services is lower than    Î³s    for the manufacturing, this means the U.S. will focus relatively

more on stage 1 in services than in the manufacturing.

   In the third additional counterfactual, we restrict the Roy mechanism. Specically, start-

ing from the initial high trade cost equilibrium, we impose the restriction that the share of

type   t   workers in country   i   in occupation   o   remains xed when trade costs are lowered.

In other words, the share of Chinese college educated workers working as managers does

not change when trade costs decline. Note that these workers can still switch sectors. The

fourth row of Table 7 shows that China's skill premium increases by much more than in the

baseline, while the U.S. skill premium increases by less than in the baseline.

   The U.S. result may seem counterintuitive from a perspective that Roy forces, by facili-

tating labor reallocation across occupations, mitigate wage changes, and hence, lead to small

changes in the skill premium; removing such forces, then, should lead to larger changes in the

skill premium. To understand this result, it is useful to start from the baseline simulation.

When trade costs decline, highly educated workers tend to switch sectors, but not occupa-

tions.     However, less educated workers switch both sectors and occupations.           In China, it

turns out that the less educated workers upgrade from very low-skilled occupations in agri-

culture to less low-skilled occupations in manufacturing. This tends to raise the return to

the less educated workers, thus mitigating the increase in the skill premium. Hence, when

workers are not allowed to switch occupations, this eect is absent, thus leading to a larger

increase in the skill premium than in the baseline scenario. In the United States baseline sce-

nario, the occupation switch involves the less educated workers downgrading from medium

skilled occupations in manufacturing to low skilled jobs in services. This tends to increase

the skill premium. Hence, when workers are not allowed to switch occupations, this eect is

absent, thus leading to a smaller increase in the skill premium than in the baseline scenario.

   In the fourth additional counterfactual, we restrict the GVC mechanism by setting            Î³s =
0.999 âˆ€s.      Now, all (but a small share of ) value-added is from stage 2. This case is essentially

a one-stage model with no GVC mechanism in eect. The nal row of Table 7 shows that

in China the skill premium increase is smaller than in the baseline,            0.42%.    and in the



                                                    40
U.S. the skill premium declines by   5.38%.   In this counterfactual, the absence of stage-level

specialization, which, as we discussed above, is essential for the skill premium to rise in both

countries, it is not surprising that the change in the skill premium is less positive for both

countries. However, why does the skill premium decline in the U.S.? With all value-added

coming from stage 2, it turns out that the U.S. comparative advantage is now in agriculture.

The share of value-added rises in this sector, and falls in manufacturing and services, which

is again the opposite to what we observe in the data. As mentioned above, less educated

workers have a comparative advantage in agriculture. Hence, the shift to agriculture leads

to these workers' wages rising, and a fall in the skill premium.

   To summarize, there are a number of intricate mechanisms underlying our results. But,

our counterfactuals serve to reinforce and support our primary story, which is that the

stage-level specialization facilitates increases in the skill premium in both China and the

U.S., and, for China, the eect is large enough to oset the skill premium reducing eect

of from its specialization in the manufacturing sector. The stage level specialization is the

key mechanism that enables the skill-upgrading in both countries to be realized when trade

costs decline.



5.2    Additional Counterfactuals

We now conduct four further sets of counterfactuals. Our focus continues to be understand-

ing our main results, so we do not re-calibrate the parameters.        First, we seek to further

understand why in China the stage specialization dominates the sector specialization to

yield a skill premium increase.    The top row of Table 8 gives the change in the skill pre-

mium in response to the baseline trade cost decline when all the occupational coecients

in the stage 1 and stage 2 production functions for China are set to        0.2.   Hence, China's

comparative advantage in stage 2 is weaker than before; moreover, any labor demand shift

across stages will be equally distributed across occupations in China. We indeed see that

China's skill premium increase is much smaller than in the baseline, while that of the U.S.

is virtually unchanged.

   In a related exercise, we set China's occupational coecients to be equal to that of the

U.S. in both stages. The results are shown in the second row of Table 8. Now, China's skill

premium declines slightly. Clearly, the coecients matter in driving both the extent of stage

specialization and the impact of that specialization on wages and the skill premium. As dis-

cussed above, it is the relatively high skill occupational intensity of stage 2 and the relatively

low skill occupational intensity of stage 1 that drives China's skill premium increase.

   We also examine the eect of a broader trade cost decline, one in which China's trade




                                               41
costs with the U.S. and the ROW both decline by                  50%.   The third row of Table 8 presents

the results.     The skill premium in China and the U.S. rise by more than in the baseline

exercise. This is partly because the ROW has a large weight in the global economy, and the

forces that applied to China and the U.S. now apply to China and the ROW.

        Finally, we examine the eects of a            10%   increase in China's overall TFP, i.e., a 10%

increase of    AsCHN   for all   s.   We conduct this exercise to contrast it with our primary trade

cost decline exercise. The table shows that the TFP increase leads to an increase in the skill

premium in China of roughly the same magnitude as the trade cost decline. However, there

are very small spillover eects to the U.S. and the ROW.

        In summary, the rst two additional counterfactual exercises show that dierences in

occupational intensities across stages and countries matter for our skill premium results. Of

course, without our GVC channel, we could not have dierences across stages. The latter

two additional counterfactuals show that a wider set of forces could be driving China's and

the U.S.'s skill premium increase in the 2000s. We oer one additional point. It would be

very useful to be able to have a result like  y % of the skill premium increase in China is

because of channel      x   and  z % of the skill premium increase in China is because of channel

w.     However, the complicated non-linear forces in our model preclude doing this.



5.3        Counterfactuals with Re-calibrated Parameters

As a way to further understand the transmission channels of our model, all of the preceding

counterfactuals did not involve re-calibrating the model. In this sub-section, we now change

parameters, and re-calibrate the other production parameters  the Ricardian productivites,

Asi ,   the value-added shares,       Î±is ,   and the occupational coecients   Î²ij,o    to ensure as close a

t as possible to the data moments. We then conduct our                 50% China-U.S. trade cost decline
counterfactual.

       We rst consider the case where the GVC channel is shut down by setting                  Î³ s = 0.999 for
all sectors   s;   virtually all value-added comes only from stage 2 production. The rst row of

Table 9 shows that in the absence of GVCs, and with the rest of the production parameters

re-calibrated, the eects on the skill premium from the China-U.S. trade cost decline are

considerably smaller than in our baseline. These results again point to the importance of

explicitly modeling GVCs to obtain an appropriate measure of the eect of trade cost declines

on the skill premium. We then consider a case in which the value-added shares                        Î±is = 0.999.
In other words, those intermediate goods involved in roundabout production are essentially

eliminated. When the model is re-calibrated and the trade costs decline, the second row of

Table 9 shows that the eect of the trade cost shock on the skill premium is considerably less

positive, and the eect becomes even negative for the U.S. Thus, we conclude that both the

GVC and the roundabout mechanisms are important to quantify the eect of trade shocks

on skill premia.

       A key part of our calibration is calibrating country-specic production function occupa-

tional coecients. In our nal re-calibration, we calibrate sector-specic production function

occupational coecients. That is, instead of calibrating          Î²ij,o , we calibrate Î² s,j,o .12   This frame-

work is closer to the traditional HO framework. The calibrated parameters suggest that stage

2 of both manufacturing and services is very high skill-intensive, while stage 1 of these two

sectors is very low skill-intensive. In addition, the intensity of production-related occupa-

tions is very high in stage 1, which is not consistent with usual task intensities in upstream

and downstream stages. Thus, our model with sector-specic occupational coecients is not

able to capture the way that tasks are usually thought to be spread over stages, at least

in manufacturing.        The third row of Table 9 shows that China's skill premium increases,

and the U.S. skill premium decreases, by about one-half percent. One reason the absolute

magnitudes are smaller in response to the trade cost decline is because the change in special-

  12  In principle, we could have calibrated a production function with sector and country-specicity, i.e.,
Î²is,j,o . However, this would imply calibrating 93 parameters, instead of the 45 in our baseline calibration.
We would need to add many more data moments to the 75 that we already have. Our goal with the baseline
framework is to have the minimal framework that allows for both sector and stage specialization.




                                                     43
ization (value-added shares) is smaller. In addition, the U.S. continues to specialize in stage

1 across all sectors; this is mainly low skill intensive; hence, the U.S. skill premium declines.

We conclude from this exercise that allowing for country-specic occupational coecients is

essential to have skill upgrading.




6    Conclusion

The increasing prevalence of vertical specialization through global value chains has attracted

a great deal of attention in the literature.   However, the role of GVCs as a propagating

mechanism of distributional impacts of trade shocks has been surprisingly understudied.

In this paper, we provide new insight on the eect of GVCs on aggregate outcomes, such

as trade ows and prices, and more importantly, on the skill premium, by introducing a

new quantitative general equilibrium model of GVCs with Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin

motives for trade, and with Roy heterogeneous worker mechanisms.

    Our model shows how country-level comparative advantage and worker-level compara-

tive advantage interacts with each other through GVCs. When trade shocks are transmitted

through GVCs, countries specialize in sectors and stages where they have a comparative

advantage. Dierent sectors depend dierently on each production stage, and dierent pro-

duction stages have dierent occupation intensities. Therefore, the eect on relative labor

demand varies by sector and occupation. Workers respond to this change in labor demand by

reallocating their labor based on their own comparative advantage in sector and occupation.

    We calibrate our model to the U.S., China, and the rest of the world in 2000.            We

study the eect of a decline in trade costs between China and the U.S. to capture the

eect of China's entry into the WTO on the U.S., China's largest trade partner in 2000,

and China.   When trade costs are lowered, each country specializes in their comparative

advantage sectors and stages.     In particular, the trade shock leads both China and the

U.S. to specialize in stages where high-skilled occupations are used more intensively. As a

consequence, the relative demand for high-skilled occupations for which high-skilled workers

have a comparative advantage increases in both China and the U.S. Therefore, the skill

premium increases in both countries.     Thus, GVCs allow our model to generate the skill

upgrading story from the trade literature.     In addition to governing the direction of the

change in the skill premium, the GVC channel governs the magnitude of the change in the

skill premium. Our calibrated model shows that the sector-specic GVC intensity determines

how much of the specialization eect from trade liberalization translates into relative wage

responses.

    Our model can serve as a good toolkit to quantify the distributional impacts of changes



                                               44
in trade environment through global value chains.   While our model features a rich inter-

action between country-level comparative advantage, worker-level comparative advantage,

and global value chains, it does not have varying length of value chains across sectors or a

more general sectoral input-output linkage structure for the composite intermediate good.

We leave these two features for future research.
