                                     ABSTRACT


    This paper develops an overlapping generations general equilibrium growth

model with an explicit characterization of the role of capital goods in the

production process.     The model is rich enough in structure to evaluate and

measure simultaneously the different distortions associated with capital

income taxation (across sectors, across assets and across time) yet simple

enough to   yield   intuitive analytical results as well.

    The main result is that uniform capital income taxation is almost

certainly suboptimal, theoretically, but that empirically, optimal deviations

from uniform taxation are inconsequential.      We also find that though the gains

from a move to uniform taxation are not large in absolute magnitude these

                                                                          of
gains would be offset only by an overall rise in capital income tax rates

several percentage points.

     A separate contribution of the paper is the development of a technique

for distinguishing intergenerational transfers from efficiency gains in

analyzing the effects of policy changes on long—run welfare.

1.   Introduction

     Capital income taxation distorts economic behavior in many         ways.   Since

the work of Harberger (1966), economists have been concerned with the

inefficient allocation of capital caused by taxing capital income from

different sectors of the economy at different rates (e.g. Shoven 1976).

Others (e.g.   Feldstein 1978,   Boskin 1978) have considered the savings

disincentives that even uniform capital income taxes impose.           In recent years,

one type of distortion has received substantial attention           that caused by the

nonuniform taxation of different assets, attributable to such factors as

investment incentives.    An international comparison of capital income taxation

in four countries (King and Fullerton 1984) stressed the great variation in

effective tax rates in each country, and many        authors   (e.g. Auerbach 1983,

Gravelle 1981, Fullerton and Henderson 1986) have estimated the excess burden

caused by such distortions.      Indeed, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 had as one of

its explicit objectives a 'levelling of the playing field          among various

capital investments.
                                                       that the efficiency
      Many have criticized the 1986 Act on the grounds
                                                               to be more than
gains from more uniform business taxation are small and likely

offset by the distortions induced by the increase in business taxes overall,

associated with the widening gap between the taxation of business capital and

owner—occupied housing and the increase in the tax burden on saving (see,

                         Such criticism              that it is important to know the
e.g. • Summers 1987).                     suggests

relative magnitudes of the three different types of distortions.

                                                                     tax
Unfortunately, previous growth models used to measure capital income

distortions have lacked the interasset and intersectoral detail required to

measure the first two of these distortions, while those models possessing such

detail have lacked an adequate treatment of intertemporal decisions or general
equilibrium effects.   This paper develops a general equilibrium growth model

which is rich enough in structure to evaluate and measure simultaneously these

different distortions yet simple enough to yield intuitive analytical results

as well.

     Few critics of the recent tax changes have disputed the argument that, by

itself, a move toward uniform business taxation would increase economic

efficiency, if not by a substantial amount.     Yet this presumption could be

unwarranted.   It is a well—known   principle of "second—best" welfare economics

that, in the presence of some distortions, the introduction of others need not

worsen the allocation of social resources.    What distinguishes differential

capital income taxation from other potential distortions is that it is a

2tio       distortion, a type of distortion that should be eschewed even in

cases where other distortions exist, if the government taxes away pure profits

and has the ability to tax households on all transactions with the production

sector and does so in an optimal manner (Diamond and Mirrlees 1971, Stiglitz

and Dasgupta 1971).    Even without such optimal consumption taxes, results from

a model with a Single production sector suggest that uniform capital income

taxation is still optimal if different types of capital are equally

complementary to labor in production, as would be true if the production

function were separable into capital and labor and exhibited constant returns

to scale (Auerbach 1979).

     At the theoretical level, this paper demonstrates that in a more

realistic model of the production process the conditions under which uniform

capital income taxation is optimal will almost certainly be violated.     Even if

every production function in the economy is separable into capital and other

factors and exhibits constant returns to scale, the location of capital goods

in the chain of production and the composition of the capital goods themselves
                                        —3—



                                                               sore heavily
play a role in determining which capital goods should be taxed

than others in order to minimize deadweight loss.     At the empirical level.

however, we find that the optimal deviation from uniform taxation generates

welfare gains that are quite small relative to those generated by a move to

uniform taxation from a tax system like that prevailing in the U.S. before

1986.

     All of the paper's welfare analysis is based on changes in steady State

utility.    A problem that has plagued such analysis in the past is that tax

                                                      but also
policy changes induce not only behavioral distortions

intergenerational transfers.     Without resorting to numerical simulation models

(as in Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987) it    has   t been possible to distinguish

the steady State welfare changes arising from each source.     Selow, we develop

a simple technique for doing so, which at the same time provides insight into

the intergenerational incidence of taxation.     This technique should be of

general use for measuring efficiency gains in steady state models.



2.   The Model

        There have been many previous approaches to the measurement of deadweight

loss from capital income taxation in models with a complex production

structure, but each lacks at least one attribute needed for our current

objectives.      In several papers, Diewert (1981, 1983, 1985) carefully analyzed

the deadweight loss caused by capital income taxes in a price—taking

production sector.     While quite useful in many contexts, particularly for

individual sectors of production or small open economies, such results were

nor intended and cannot be used to evaluate the consumption and savings

distortions induced by such taxes in general equilibrium.      Using a large—scale

numerical general equilibrium model, Fullerton and Henderson (1986,     1987) have
                                      —4—




considered cspiral income tax distortions in s model with chsnging consumer

prices but have focused primsrily on static deadweight loss measures, with

saving not really considered and capital viewed as a primary factor of

production.   The model considered hers is a general equilibrium model in which

there is a complex structure of production and dynamic issues are incorporsted

in a consistent manner.

     The notation used in describing the model is summsrized in Table        1.   We

consider the steady state of an overlapping generations closed economy in

which individuals live for two periods and there are two primary factors of

production, labor and land, each of which in homogeneous.      There are N

                                                                       as
production sectors, with outputs produced using land and labor as well

intermediate goods and capital goods which are, themselves, produced by the N

sectors.   Each generation has a single representative household that supplies

labor in the first period of life and purchases the N commodities in each

period, subject to preferences defined over these 2N +   1   goods (including

labor).

     The population is assumed to grow exogenously at rate n, and the supply

of land is also taken to be exogenous.   To make these two assumptions

consistent with the existence of a steady state, we must allow land to grow at

rate n as well.   This is accomplished in the model by aasuming that each

person entering old age receives n unite of land per existing unit, with this

receipt viewed as a lump—sum transfer.   Although not entirely satisfactory,

this seeme preferable to the more standard practices of omitting land entirely

or treating it as s type of reproducible capital.

     The N production sectors each behave competitively subject to constant

returns to scale.   We aseume thst ntermediste inputs enter the production

                                                          but that capital,
process according to a fixed relationship to gross output
                                                       —5—




labor and land may be           varied.       There are N capital goods, each of which is a

linear combination of the N outputs.1                   These include fixed capital goods as

well as inventories.            Each capital good i is assumed to depreciate

exponentially at rate                    0.
        Let A be the NAN input output matrix, each column i giving the input

requirements of goods           j     1,...N         per unit of output i.    Let 3 be the NAN

capital    goods definition matrix, each column                i   giving the composition (with

column entries summing to One) of capital good i.                     We let K be the MAN      capital
requirements matrix, with column i giving the amount of each type of capital j

(   1   ,...,M) needed to produce a unit of good i.                  We let h and     2    be the N—

vectors, the 1th entry of which are the labor and land requirements per unit

of output.     By assumption, K, h and                   are variable but A and 3 are fixed.

        The N—vector of gross outputs (per capita young) is y.                      The corresponding


consumption goods vector is z.                 Let           a +      be the ratio of gross

investment to capital of type i needed to maintain the steady state level of

capital per capita, and define a corresponding diagonal matrix                         C    with

eLement ii equal to                  Then the relationship between gross output y and

that    is, gross output equals consumption pius intermediate purchase plus

investment.      The second term would be omitted in a GNP calculation, so y

exceeds GNP in value.

        Total labor and land requirements corresponding to y are:

(3)               L =

        The gross wage is chosen              as numeraire,    so that prices are all in units of

labor productivity.         The net (of tax) wage is denoted w.               Let r be the net

rate of return to capital, and                       the net land rent per unit of land.

        The government in thia model ia aasumed to rebate all tax revenuea to

conaumera, with proportional income taxea being aaaesaed on labor, land, and

each type of capital.            Because of our focus on the long—run conaequencea of

the tax ayatem, we assume capital income taxea are on true economic income,

and that there ia therefore no diatinction in the treatment of new and old

capital.2

        By the zero profits assumption, we may solve for the pricea of output and

capital goods.        The price of output i equals the coat of its intermediate

inputs plus the required before—tax returns to labor, capital and land,                                        or:


(4)              p'        p'A +   h' +    q'CK +sg'
where the capital goods price vector q must satisfy:

(5)              q'        p'B

        Combining (4) and (5), we obtain:

(6)              p'        (h'   + az')(I—A—BCK)                 (h'   +

where          has the same form as                    but is based on C rather than C.                          It

Ic also useful to define                     based in analogous fashion upon C0.

        The revenue raised and rebated is, per young individual:

(7)              1    —                    + (1—w)E + (s—s0)L
                          q'(C—C0)ICy

With two representative households alive at any date, we must specify how the

tax proceeds are distributed.                We let          be the fraction of revenue
distributed to the old, and defer until later a discussion of how                                           B       is

determined.        In the households budget constraint at birth, the value of

revenue received is therefore:

                                  +               (1—s) +                                  ÷
(8)                 P.
                                                                   BR(-)             [1                   1)1

The (l+n) term in second—period transfers                             P.2      is due to the fact that                   R   is

measured per capita

        The other element of the household's lump sum income is receipts of new

land,    nL.     In capital market equilibrium, the price per unit of land must be:



                    L =—
so we    may    express      the household's indirect utility function as:


(10)                U        V[p, --—, w,         P.   +
                                                           npLLl

where the first three elements are the 2N +                               I   prices corresponding to first—

period consumption, second—period consumption, and labor, respectively.



3.     Deadweight Loss

        We consider the change in utility caused by the introduction of a small

set of taxes        dr, drL and dt(dt1                         dtM)    beginning from a zero—tax steady

state.        This focus on small taxes is restrictive but permits the use of

comparative statics.              Total differentiation of (10) yields:


(11)                dU        —Adp'           +            —                    +   AdWE   + AdR +

where     z         +    z2/(l+n)         is total consumption per capital young (as

       Again by the    envelope theorem,    if one starts at a Pareto—optimum the

first—order change in utility resulting from the introduction of taxes is

zero; there is no first—order deadweight loss.                   Examining (16). however, we

see that dU       0 only if. in addition,     r       n in the initial steady state.                 This

extra condition is present because dU is not the change in utility in a single

consumer static model but rather the change in steady—state utility in an

overlapping generations model.          Unless this          Golden   Rule      condition is

satisfied, the introduction of small taxes has first—order effects on steady

state utility.        In a dynamically efficient economy                  (r > n),    these changes

represent movements alone the Pareto frontier; if utility increases in the

steady state, it must be reduced for some transitional generations.                           In

general, each tax policy change induces intergenerational transfers.                           To

measure the magnitude of a tax policys distortion, one most account for such

transfers, which mey be large relative to changes due to efficiency gains or

losses (Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987).

       Indeed, after a few lines of algebra, expression (16) may be rewritten in

a way that indicates the         contribution of      intergenerational transfers to

changes in steady state utility

The term in brackets in (17) has a straightforward interpretation.                            It equals

the real incoi loss the household experiences in the second period due to

changes in the prices of consumption goods and assets, the rate of return to

savings, and government transfers.            If this term is negative, then the tax


burden is being shifted toward the older generation, a shift that will

increase steady state utility if           r > n.         To neutralize this      term,      it is


necessary to rebate enough of the tax revenue to the old,                    dR2,       to offset the

income effect experienced in the second period.                   Because   dR2         5dR(1+n),

this amounts to choosing        f    so that:

                  2
        8             —
(18)        {dp'-1-       dr(q'Ky+pL)_(dq'Ky+dpL)(1+r)]/1q'd(C_C0)Ky+d(1_w)E+d(s_s0)L]

       The term   8   is interesting in its own right, for it indicates what the

incidence of the tax change is across generations.                   For example, in a simple

model with no land and only uniform capital income taxes, if these taxes were

fully borne by capital via a decline in r, then dp, dw and dq would all equal

zero and              would equal         —dri;     hence     8   would equal 1:        the tax would
            d(C—C0)
be borne fully by the elderly.            In other studies        of capital income tax


incidence in the two—period overlapping generations model (e.g. Diamond 1970,

Kotlikoff and Summers 1979), it has been customary to set                    8      1    ,   and indeed

the value one chooses for        8   has been discussed in terms of what- the "right

"experiment is to derive a "compensated" elasticity of aaving with respect to

the interest rate (Sandi 1981).            Our analysis suggests that the appropriate

generational distribution of tax compensation in turn depends on the incidence

of the tax.


       Using the definition of        8    in (18), we obtain a very simple expression

for first—order deadweight loss, which equals zero under the assumption that

taxes are initially zero.        Calculation of the deadweight loss from taxation

thus requires a second—order Taylor approximation:

                         -[dU

From (17), (18) and (19), and the assumption that                                is varied to keep the

second term        iii   (17)      equal to zero, we obtain:


(20)          AU             1/2dTdE +      I/2q'dTd(Ky)        1/2d1dt +    l/2Edtqd(Ky)
where    T     C — C0.             Note that       (Ky)1
                                                              is the economy's total capital stock of

type i.      This expression is very mich in the spirit of Harberger's (1966)

original formulation of the problem of measuring the deadweight loss from

capital income taxation, although the sources of change in the capital stock

are more complicated here.                    As shown in (14), d(Ky) incorporates changes in

capital resulting from altered production levels of consumption and capital

goods and altered capital—output ratios.                             It is worth rioting that, because


land is in fixed supply, it is absent from expression (20).

        It is possible             to express this deadweight loss in a form more useful for

determining the additional efficiency cost of nonuniform capital income

taxation.      Define             dt    to be the uniform capital income tax rate that would


yield the same revenue (and,                      since there is no first—order deadweight loss,

the same costs of production) as the actual taxes imposed on capital.                             Let

c      r +   t and       C        ci.   Sy the definition of           dt,   we have:


                         q'(dC—dC0)Ky             q'dTKy      dtq'Ky


and, defining                dT     dT —    dti    as the differential capital income tax matrix

with diagonal terms                          dti
                                                   —   dt,

                                              —12--




Finally, define


(23>               d'     p'BdTKc


ote     that, when r      n (and    c   ), d        is the change in p, holding a and          c

constant, due to the tax perturbation              dT.    Also note     that,   by (22),


(24)               d"z    p'BdTKy       q'dTKy      0



        Using these definitions, we rewrite (20) as:


(25)         U     l/2q'dTd(Kyz) + i/2d'dz + 1/2dtq'd(Ky) + 1/2ddE


where     d(Kyz)      is the change in Ky, holding z fixed.              To simplify (25),    note

that total differentiation of the second—period budget constraint (given in

(13)), combined with the assumption that the second term in (17) equals to

zero, yields:


(26)        12._dz2      q'd(Ky)(l+n)


which says that the change in expenditures on second—priced consumption equals

the change in saving, consistent with the method of choosing                         above.

        Substitution of (26) into (25) yields:

(27)         U      1/2q'dTd(Kyjz) + 1I2d"z + (1+ )(1÷ )dZ + 1/2dTdE

The last two terms in (27) represent the deadweight loss from uniform capital

income taxation and labor income taxation, based on the tax wedges and

behavioral changes aesociated with each.                 The first two terms each vanish when

capital taxes are uniform and           dl    0.    We may therefore interpret their sum

as (minus) the deadweight loss from differential capital income taxation.                       If


these terms were negative for any            dl     0     and did not affect the last two

terms regardless of the values chosen for                 t.        and t,   it would be optimal

to have uniform capital income taxation.              However, it is easy to see that this

may not be so.           Each of the first two terms has another condition under which

it   vanishes;     for the first, that       d(Kyz)    is proportional to   Ky (by (22)) and

for the second, that da is proportional to z (by (24)).                Unless these

equiproportional reductions in capital Ky and             output   z coincide with uniform

                                                                       terms
taxation, there will be two separate ways to Set these deadweight loss

to zero.      Moreover, starting from uniform taxation, it seems likely that one

could cause the terms to become positive by introducing negative differential

taxes          or   price perturbations          for capital goods or final consumption

goods whose proportional reductions are particularly large.                 The intuition is

that   optimal tax        rules typically call for equiproportional reductions in taxed

activities.         If this does not occur under uniform capital taxation,

differential taxation may improve efficiency even while introducing a new set

of distortions.



4. The Desirability of Uniform Taxation

        To   simplify the discussion of       when such 'second—best"    gains will   be

available,     we limit our consideration in this section to the special case in

which    rn.       Relaxing this restriction would simply reinforce the negative

theoretical results that obtain.

        Define:

net and gross interest rates, respectively.              Also, let

be the distortion           to         associated with nonuniform capital income taxation.

Also, note that

        Using (28), (29) and (30), we rewrite (27) as:

labor and land and the column for labor, and

            in Appendix A we prove the following result, which indicates that the

conditions that guarantee the optimality of uniform taxation are quite

restrictive.                    Note that under uniform capital taxation we may characterize all

behavioral changes in terum of response to changes in                                                      c, 8,   r,   and w,        since

changes in p and q are themselves functions of changes in                                                      c and a.

Proposition    1:   For an initial steady state in which           rn,    and arbitrary taxes

 dt,   d and drL,     it is optimal to set    dT    0       if the following


proportionality conditions are met:


(1)                   Ky


(2)



(3)                   Ky


(4)                   Ky


The first of these conditions represents restrictions on technology and (since

c     and a affect p) preferences together, while the last two represent

restrictions only on preferences, since r and w do not affect producers.

        If the conditions set out by Proposition        1   are satisfied, then we have an

easily calculable measure of the additional deadweight loss caused by

differential capital income taxation, with a piece due to distorted production

and one due to distorted consumption:


(39)         DWL    —1/2(AdTq)'H(AdTq)     -1/2d'Sd

Previous measures that were based only on production distortions (e.g.,

Auerbach 1983, Gravelle 1981) had nothing analogous to the second term in

(39).     The customary treatment of capital as a primary factor of production is

equivalent to assuming that       A   I,    that capital goods prices are given and

that capital is not used in the production of other capital.

        The validity of this deadweight loss measure is subject to question,

however, because some of the proportionality conditions of Proposition                    1   are

quite stringent.       Conditions (3) and (4) do not seem particularly

unreasonable.       They would be satisfied if     dz/dw       z    and    dz/dr —   z,   i.e.,
                                                    —17—



if a change in the wage rate or the interest rate had                       rio   effect on the

composition of goods purchased by consumers.                   Under such conditions, the

government would not wish to tax goods differentially in order to alleviate

distortions introduced by changes in r and w.                      Pu   example of a utility

function that would satisfy these conditions is:


(40>          U   U{(z1),       (2)        EJ


where         is a homogeneous function.             Here, only changes in p will affect the

composition of demand among commodities.

        The other two conditions, however, are more restrictive.                       These are the

conditions under which the government would not wish to use differential

capital taxes to improve the distortions caused by changing the relative (to

labor> producer prices of capital and land,                    C    and a, respectively.         Consider

condition (1).      Expanding                     we have,
                                      dc

term,     'HAq.    if there were no land, and              we ignored       A,    then the remaining

term     Hq   would be proportional to Ky if, in every production function,

capital goods were of equal complementarity to labor and did                         riot   depreciate

(or depreciated at the          sa    rate).       This would follow from the fact that              dcq

would be proportional to         cq       ,   so that relative prices among capital goods

would not change.       This is the condition needed in a one—sector model

(Auerbach 1979) to ensure the optimality of uniform taxation.                           Even this

condition will fail to be met with such equal complementarity to labor once we

consider the terms       A' and A.5             These vary according to a capital good's place

in the production process.                  One may measure these differences in production

chsrscteristics in the following manner.                          Suppose that     Hq       Ky.   Then

A'HAq        Ky    if     Aq     q    and    ft'Ky     Ky.        Element i of    Aq     equals   d(cq)/dc,
and exceeds                to the extent that                     itself depends on the cost of

aggregate capital atock of type i with respect to an equiproportional change

in the capital intensity of production, aa measured by the matrix K.                                     Since

the derivative holding output fixed would be Ky, the ratio of

                               meaauras the importance of capital good                      in the production
(P'Ky) to (Ky)                                                                          i


capital.          The usa of a capital good may go down proportionally more than other

capital goods if either of these ratios is large, suggesting that if capital

taxation is "ton high," we might wish to tax such capital goods less heavily.6

        A similar difficulty              is posed by the second term            on the right—hand side

of   (41),        KclScl'1K'q. One would like this term to be proportional to Ky.
                                                             —
The matrix          S    multiplied by p equals                        (see (37)).      Thus, if one ignores

                  then    Kc't'SQ'1K'q         Kn1Sp                          which is proportional to Ky

if        —   z.     We have argued that this latter proportionality condition is not
     -r
unreasonable.            However, unless        n'K'Bp             is proportional to p, the whole term

will still not be proportional to                    Ky.     Since      2''K'8p      equals the derivative

of p with respect to                 c,   the term                               measures the elasticity
                                                       c(c'1K'Bp)/p
of good i's price with respect to a change in the interest rate.                                  Goods whoae

production is capital intensive may have their demand especially

discouraged.             We may then,       following the previous argument, wish to tax lees

heavily the capital used especially in the production of such consumption

goods.

        Thus, even with "standard" restrictions on preferences and technology
                                               —19--




(which themselves are undoubtedly violated but may be seen as reasonable

benchmarks) there are three reasons why                      is not likely to   be

proportional to Ky and hence some form of nonuniform capital taxation may be

desirable7:

         (1)    capital goods vary in capital intensity (direct and indirect

          (Ac   I' q);
         (2)    capital goods enter in different ways into the production of

         other capital goods          (fl'Ky i Ky);    and

         (3)    consumption goods vary in their capital intensity (direct and

         indirect)       (cc2'1K'Bp      p).

These complications all disappear in a One—Sector model.

     Adding land to the analysis does not make uniform taxation any more

likely, of course.       One can go through the same type of analysis and derive

the same sort of reasons why          -----    is   not proportional to Ky, even if

capital goods are equal complements to land in production.               Similarly, making

some capital income taxes equal but different to others (for example, owner—

occupied housing capital) need not be desirable.

    We now return briefly to the discussion of production efficiency in our

introduction.    We have not shown the "production efficiency" theorem to be

false, only that if its conditions are not satisfied, production efficiency is

unlikely to remain optimal.       In this model, however, these conditions are

quite restrictive.       They require a 100 percent tax on land rent which is

equivalent to pure profits, plus optimal commodity taxes on each of the ZN

consumption goods (if labor is chosen as numeraire) (see Auerbach 1985).

These 2N taxes can only be achieved using the two taxes              dt and dr       if it is


optimal to tax goods in each period uniformly.               Then, the optimal price

distortions would consist of a uniform tax on second period consumption and a

uniform tax, perhapa at a different rate, on firat period consumption,

these could be simulated exactly by varying the wags rate and the interest

tate in the household's budget constraint.
                                                                           were

auth that all gooda (in first and second periods) were equal complements

labor.        It would then be optimal to aet         dt =   o   and have a wage tax.   With

                                                     ratio or the ratio of
households, and hence no change in the capital—labor

gross factor returns.        Hence,   do      0.   With do =      0,   the first two pieces of

the last term in (38) would vanish.            The remaining piece would vanish, and dr

would remain unaffected by        dT,       because auth preferences would lead to the

      Under auth cirtumatancea, however, taxing capital at all would be taxing

capital "too much."        The presence of a capital income tax would make it

                                    is of more than theoretical intereet.                      To

address this and related questions, we consider a simplified model of the

private U.S. economy which is sufficiently disaggregate to capture the

important aspects of the model.         There are three factors of production, labor,

land and capital, and nine production sectors.          Aaiong the capital goods (which

also include inventories) are three fixed          capital   goods: equipment,

nonresidential structures, and residential structures.            The industries, based

on standard national income accounting definitions, are:


1.    Agriculture

2.    Mining

3.    Construction

4.    iurable goods manufacturing

5.    Nondurable goods manufacturing

6.    Transportation, communication and utilities

7.    Wholesale and    retail   trade

8.    Finance, insurance and real estate

9.    Other services


Note that housing services, including the imputed rent on owner—occupied

housing, are the primary component of industry 8.            Our base year for

calculations is 1981, the latest year for which input—output data were

available.     In that year, total production (y) ranged among the industries

from approximately 200 billion dollars each in agriculture and mining to

approximately one trillion dollars each in durable and nondurable goods

manufacturing.      The corresponding matrices A, B, K and        C   and the vector

I   are presented in Appendix B along with an explanation of their derivation.

This appendix also sketches the method of solving for the change in

equilibrium resulting from taxation.

        We assume throughout that S                      r   initially, which is simply a choice of

land units that makes                        1.        We let       r   .06       and     n      .03       for the base
                                                                                      -


case,

        The production function for each sector is assumed to be of the nested

CES form, with the elasticity of substitution among land and capital goods

equal to       u    and the elasticity between each of these and labor to be                                         a   In

the base case        calculation,       each is set equal to                  1   (yielding the Cobb—Douglas

form) for every industry.               The        assumption about               a   is empirically

reasonable.         There has been little research about the magnitude of                                      u.

        The household's utility function is also assumed to be of the nested CES

form, with leisure in the first—period nest, an intratemporal elasticity of

substitution         r     in each period (with equal consumption weights) and an

intertemporsl elasticity of substitution                            .    The labor supply elasticity is a

function not only of                  and         ''

leisure in the utility function.                        it is convenient here to choose this

parameter indirectly by specifying the fraction of hours worked in the initial

equilibrium,         A.    Given            and v,       a higher       A    implies          a smaller      labor   supply

elasticity,        since    the   leisure         demand elasticity           is unaffected and the labor—


leisure ratio increases.

        Our base case parameters are                     1      .25,     =    1   and x =       .6.    As discussed by

Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), this value of                             I        is consistent with the

empirical literature, though some outlying estimates approach 1.                                             The values

cycle model of the household, assumed a similar value for                                             and a Cobb—

Douglas utility function among first—period commodities and then found an

elasticity of substitution between goods and leisure also near                                         I   to be

consistent with observed uncompensated labor supply elasticities.

6.   Basic Results and Sensitivity Analysis

     We begin with a description of our base        case,   "pre—tax reform'

simulation.    The tax parameters used are .45 for inventories, .4 for

nonresidential structures, .05 for equipment,        .15 for residential structures,

.4 for land, and .25 for labor.     The business tax rates sre representative of

those measured for the pre—1986 period (e.g., Auerbach 1987, Fullerton and

Henderson 1987).     The residential tax rate may be viewed as a weighted average

of 0 for owner—occupied housing end .4 for rental housing, although one could

argue that the former number is too low (homeowners do pay property taxes, for

example) end the letter too high (given the use of rental housing as s tea

ehelter).     The tax rate on labor is consistent with aggregate statistics

relating personal taxes to personal income.        The nondietortionary tax on land

matters only in the calculation of       •   the   compensation parameter.

     The deadweight loss in this case equals 1.003 percent of the present

value of each individual's consumption.        This is smaller than other estimates

of the total deadweight loss of the tax system (e.g., Ballard, Shoven snd

Whslley 1985), for which there are several potential explanations, including

differences in modelling and parameter sasumptiona and the omission here of

several specific taxes (such as social security snd excise taxes).             However,

our msin concern here is with the magnitude of deadweight loss resulting from

nonuniform capital income taxation.

     Setting all nonresidential capital income tsxes equal to the sversge rate

for these taxes, .280, causes a reduction in deadweight losa to .925 percent

of lifetime consumption, representing a gain of only .078 percent.             Such small

gains, which translate into a few billion dollars per year, are consistent

with earlier results.    Moving to fully uniform capital income taxes, including
                                                —24—



residential capital, at an equal—revenue—yield rate of .222,            yields a further

efficiency gain of just .030 percent of lifetime consumption, perhaps a

billion dollara per year.            Thus, moving to uniform taxation yields a total

welfare gain of .108 percent of lifetime consumption.             Although these

efficiency gains are amall, an are the efficiency losses associated with small

changes in capital income tax rates.            For example, it would take a nearly 9

percentage point increase in the average tax rate on nonresidential capital to

offset the utility gain from shifting to uniform nonresidential capital

taxation.         This gain is of the rough. order of magnitude of the increase that

occurred with the introduction of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

        Next, we consider the robuatnesa of our reaulta.          In Table   2, we present

the total deadweight loss for each of the three tax configurations juat

presented, for a variety of parameter variations.             The baae case results are

repeated at the top for convenience.

        The parameter variations are intended to be extreme ones.            (Note that

halving       x    is   equivalent to doubling the assumed labor aupply elasticity).

The smallest welfare gains, about 40 percent the size of those in the base

caae, occur when r =          .03.    It is clear why lowering the rate of return lowers

the estimated gain from equalizing taxes based on that rate of return.               The

"correct" real return to use is unclear given the absence of uncertainty from

this model and the divergence between observed marginal products of capital

and real interest rates.             The largest welfare gains are estimated for the caae

where     y       1,    nearly double those estimated for the base caae.     However,

halving or doubling the magnitude of the welfare gains reported for the base

case does not change the basic qualitative result:             gaina from equalizing tax

rates on nonresidential capital are small, and gains from going beyond thia to

equalize tax rates for residential and nonresidential capital are smaller

still.



7.   Optimal Capital Taxation

     The Proposition in Section 4 showed how unlikely it is for uniform

capital income taxes to be necessarily optimal.       But it is not yet clear how

important this result is empirically.      Even though the utility function chosen

satisfies expression (40),      and hence the third and fourth conditions of

Proposition    1   are satisfied, the other two conditions are not.   This is quite

evident from Table 3, which reports the capital intensity of capital and

consumption goods.       As one would expect, housing is snich mre capital

intensive than other consumption goods.       Likewise, equipment is clearly the

most capital intensive capital good.

      Indeed, it is possible to increase utility by deviating from uniform

taxation.     Starting from a position with all capital taxes equal to .22 (the

equal—yield uniform tax case considered above), a grid search algorithm

located a maximum utility Level at a tax rate of .16 on equipment, .23 on

nonresidential and residential structures, and .27 on inventories.        While this

deviation is reasonably large,      and is not surprising given the very high

capital intensity of equipment, the utility gain is small, about .005 percent

of consumption, or less than 5 percent of the size of moving from the initial

tax system to unifrom taxation.       Put another way, virtually all of the

increase in utility that can be achieved through the manipulation of capital

income taxes is achieved through moving to uniform taxation.

      By coincidence, the case for uniform taxation is strengthened if only

nonresidential tax rates may be varied.       This is probably because the

residential tax rate being too low justifies heavier taxation of the capital

good used most heavily in building housing, equipment.       Starting from the
                                      —26—




equal yield nonreaidential tax rate of .28, we find an optimum tax rate of .26

for equipment, .28 for nonreaidential structurea and .30 for inventories, with

an additional welfare gain of only .0005 percent of consumption.

     Given the inevitable uncertainty that must exist about the correct model

specification, these results represent a fairly strong argument against

attempting to vary capital income tax rates from a uniform atructure for

"optimal taxation" purposes.   They indicate that the indirect effects of

capital taxation on capital allocation that work through capital goode prices

and consumption goode pricea are unimportant relative to the direct effects of

taxation considered in the existing literature.     Perhaps this should not be a

complete surprise, since the indirect price effects of capital coats are

attenuated by any specific capital good's amall ahate of value added and value

added'a fractional contribution to the price of grosa output.         It is

relatively difficult to alter relative output or capital goode prices

significantly using differential capital taxes, an the potential benefits of

doing an ate small relative to the direct deadweight costa of doing so.



8.   The Generational Tax Burden

     Aa diacuaaed above, the compensation term      f   ia interesting in ita own


right, for it tells us what ftsction of the tax system is botne by the old and

what fraction by the young.    Thia is of particular importance when a shift in

the structure of taxation is contemplated.

      In the initial tax system considered above,       B   .32;   the old must

receive just under one—third of the revenue collected to offset the aecond—

period loss in real income induced by taxation.      By comparison,    the    old

account for .38 of all consumption.   Each component of the overall tax system

haa a very different age—based burden.   Labor income taxes alone would require
                                        —27—



3   .09,   indicating that only a small fraction of these taxes are shifted to

the elderly.    A some what higher fraction of capital income taxes are shifted

to the young, with    3   .82   when only capital income taxes are inposed.    Land

taxes are not shifted at all, of course, and so for them       3   1.


     The shift in capital income taxes to uniform taxation reduces the overall

value of   3   very slightly to .31, as the interest rate increases, but this is

smaller than the incidence shift that would attend a change in the tax base,

from income to consumption, for example (assuming that     3   for a 000suoption

tax would be roughly equal to the older cohort's consumption share).



9. Conclusion

     The main result of this paper is that uniform capital income taxation is

almost certainly suboptimal from a theoretical standpoint because capital

goods enter the production process at different levels and through the

production of different commodities, but that uniform taxation is empirically

close in efficiency terns t     the "optimal" system of differential capital

income taxes.    This empirical result is unlikely to be sensitive to reasonably

parameter variations within the model, though one may conceive of other codeis

in which it migho not hold.     However, the benefits of deviations from oniform

taxation remain to be demonstrated.

     Though the gains from a move to uniform taxation from a typical tax

system are not large, either, they do produce an efficiency gain that would be

offset only by a rise in capital income tax rates of several percentage

points.    This suggests that, in broad terms st least, the recent U.S. tax

reform is unlikely to have caused a major net change in long—run efficiency

through its changes in capital income taxation.

                                             Appendix A

       This appendix presents a proof of Proposition I.                       Our strategy will be to

show that, under conditions (1) through (4),                    dc, ds, dr and dw             are all

invariant with respect to          dT    .   Combined with the conditions themselves, this

will imply that the entire last term in              (38) always vanishes and that                     dir


does not depend on       dT.

       Note that, aince      dr       is assumed fixed,         dw = —dir       does not depend on

dT.    Also, since   dc =    dr   +   dt,    dc   is invariant to changes in                  dT if and

only if dr is.

       The proof relies on the assumption that r                     n, the asving--investment


identity (26) and the fact that land is fixed.                    Expanding (26), we obtain:


(Al)    fr(S21S22)d
                         =   (l+n)(q'A'Hdp + p'BKfl l[Sll             +
                                                                          2l'         l2
                                                                                           ÷



       Since this must hold regardless of                dT,    if    dc and ds are to remain

fixed as    dT   changes it must be true that:


(A2)                     = (l+n)(q'A'HAdTq + p'BKn                                            +
        -1-—(S21S22)d;                             1ES11÷ r42l'                        i2

       But the right—hand side of (A2) equals9                  (q'dTi-i)'        ,    which equals zero
                                                                           Ic
by (22) and assumption (1) of the proposition.

       The left—hand side of (A2) equals1°                —(l+r)(d'a)'.               Since

d'a = q'dT14Zl        (ass (24)), this term must equal zero by assumption (3).

Thus, holding ds and         de    constant as      dT changes            is consistent       with the

assumptions of the proposition.              Using an expression based on the conservation

of land, we will show that this is also the case there.                          This will give us two

independent equations in changes in               dc and ds          for which constant           dc     snd ds are

consistent with the assumptions.              Since these equations are both linear, this must

be the unique solution.           We know that      dL =       dz'Q1z     +   '4(BdKy+dz)          =     0.

necessary for the general optimality or uniform capital income taxation.

However,          it   seems     unlikely        that less restrictive sufficient conditions
exist.        For example,             if   only condition (a) is violated, one                          may iotuitivey

see how       to vary           dT     and improve          welfare.         In that case, the  last term in (38,
reduces to             d(r0)'Sd)3                   Also,         d      and hence       d(00)'Sd is independent
of dT. Thus, one should choose a perturbation                                        dT     in a       direction that

causes     d(0—00)'Sd   to be positive.    By scaling down the size of this

perturbation, one can make the two quadratic forms in (38) arbitrarily small

in absolute value compared to this positive term, since they are second—order

terms.     This will increase   tU   over its value when capital income taxes are

uniform.

                                          Appendix B

    This appendix presents snd describes the calculstion of the various

matrices and vectors that summarize the U.S. economy's 1981 production

structure.       It then outlines how these sre used to solve for the economy's

equilibrium.

A

    The      9   x   9   input—output matrix   A   was taken directly from a machine

readable version of the table given in Planting (1987), with the 79               basic

industries aggregated into nine.          We ignored the inputs and outputs from tne

remaining "industries" that are appended to the input—output table for

national income accounting purposes.           The only one of these that is not

negligible is government industry, which is just over 5 percent of total

commodity output and does not enter as an intermediate input.

    Adding each aggregate industry's value added              to the sum of its


intermediate inputs gives its total output, which is then divided into the

input levela to obtain input coefficients.              By construction, therefore, each

industry's output price is set to unity.              The resulting matrix is:

K

        Aside from the three fixed capital goods, we allow nine inventory stucks,

one for each industry.        This distinction permits each industry's inventories

to have a different commodity composition.                The nonresidential stocks of

equipment and structures were obtained from machine—readable data kindly

provided by Matthew Shapiro, obtained by him originally from the Bureau of

Economic Analysis end corresponding to the aggregate statistics given in

Muegrave (1986).      We used the average of the 1980 end 1981 end of year capital

stocks, deflated to put them into current 1981 rather then constant 1982

dollars.      The residential capital stocks were obtsined directly from Musgrsve

(1986).       The 1980 and 1981 end of year current dollar inventory stocks fur

1983 issue of the Survey of Current Business, and averaged.               The industry

breakdown for the remaining industries (representing about one—tenth of all

inventories) was kindly provided us by the BEA.               All capital stocks were then

divided by the appropriate industry output, to obtain K:

Total Capital—
Output Ratio


     Note the enormous differences among industries in capital—output ratios,

from .21 in the construction industry to 5.00 in the industry composed mostly

of housing services.         Also, the major type of capital used varies across

industries:     structures in mining and housing, equipment in manufacturing and

construction, and inventories in trade.

     The 8 matrix was obtained from two sources.       For fixed capital, we used

Table 3 in Silversteir.   (1985).   From this table, one may infer that virtually

all capital produced      by the construction industry is structures and that

virtually all structures are produced by this industry.           Given this,    one may

calculate the source of equipment production from the output of capital goods

by the remaining industries.

     For inventories, a breakdown of inventories by stage of fabrication is

available only for manufacturing in the February 1986 Survey of Current

Business.    For these industries, we assumed that all finished goods and half

of work in process inventories were produced by that industry, while the


remaining work in process stocks and all new materials inventories had the

sama composition as the industry's intermediate inputs.           For the other seven

industries, we Simply assumed that all inventory stocks were produced by the

industry itself, equivalent to assuming then to be entirely finished goods.

     The resulting B matrix is:

     The stocks of nonresidential land by industry for 1977 were kindly

provided by Don Fullerton and Yolanda Henderson who obtained the unpublished

data from Barbara Fraumeni and Dale Jorgenaon.      Earlier aggregate land

estimatea and a description of the methodology used to calculate them is

provided in Frauineni and Jorgenson (1980).     The 1977 stocks were inflated to

1981 prices using the GNP deflator.      To obtain an estimate of residential

land, we multiplied the 1980 and 1981 land to structures ratios for owner—

occupied housing provided by the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheets for the U.S.

Economy by our estimated residential capital stocks for each year.      This

calculation assumes that rental housing, representing about one—third of all

housing, has the same land to structures ratio as owner—occupied housing.

     The resulting vector       is:

housing, but is quite important in those industries.

C

     To obtain the matrix      C,   we need depreciation rates. We assume         to

be zero for inventories.      For nonresidential equipment and atructures, we uae

the aggregate values estimated by Auerbach and Hines (1987), .137 and .003,

respectively.   For residential atructures, we use the value of .013 estimated

by Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981).



Solution of the Model

     A   step that   ist   be taken before solution of the model is to expreaa all

flow variables in units consistent with the two—period overlapping generationa

model.    Letting T be the number of years per period (assumed to be 30

throughout), we multiply the flow vectors y and z and the rates r, n, a and

by T, and divide the atock—flow ratios K and        p   by T.   This change in unita

has no direct effect on the production side of the economy.         It is needed to

make sense of the assumption that the stock of national wealth is held for

second—period consumption.

     In addition to the parameters given above, we specify the rate of

interest (and growth) and the Hessian and Slutaky matrices.         The parametera of

the Slutaky matrix are chosen to incorporate the constraint that second—period

consumption equal principal plus interest on the stock of national wealth.          We

also constrain expression (1) in the text to hold exsctly by starting with

observed consumption z and solving for y.        This is necessary because the

steady—state assumptions about rates of return and depreciation need not hold

exactly in any given year.       Industries 1—3 have virtually no final sales to

consumers, so for convenience consumption of these goods is set to zero.

     Through the use of various substitutions, the change in the economy in

response to taxation reduces to two linear equations, based on the aavings
                                        —37—



investrnent identity (Al) and the conservation of land identfty (A3), in two

variables, dr and ds (when   r    n,   the terms    9' and t'   in these equations

are based on n, while the terms    9 and A     appearing in the text in (35) are

based on r).   Once these are obtained, all other endogenous variables can be

calculated.                                                                   /

1.    This is not a restrictive assumption, as one could specify a unique and

                                                                      of the N

efficiency unit, would differ from that of a comparable unit

for tax reasons.     Such taxes are clearly important in considering the short—

run affects of tax reforms, as the effects of the 1981 and 1986 tax changes

clearly demonstrate (Auerbach 1983, 1986, Auerbach                      They may

alen affect the economy in the long run if changes in the relative value of

old to new capital, which one may view as a change in government assets, are

not offset by explicit debt policy (Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987).     Such lung

run effects are attributable to changes in the intergenerational burden of

taxation rather than the magnitude of distortions.     In the analysis presented

below, such tax induced changes in capital gooda prices would automatically be

offset via government transfers, so that only the marginal tax rates matter

for long—run analysis.     Hence, it is not a further reetriction to focus only

on income taxes.

6.     The idea that we might wish to tax less heavily capital at the bottom of

the production chain was suggested by Willig (1983) in a model where the other

factor was absent because capital was not itself produced.

7.     Conditions (1) and (3) are slightly different.                                                           then
                                                                                   If      cO'1KB'p       p,

q'dT>.            Adding the two yields                q'dTSZ2              (see (25).

10.    To see this, note that since by the symmetry of                                S,            s1   [p'(S21S22)d1

equals    d'(S12+ 1-S22)p               —d'[S12+                                           -d'-<1+r)2.
11.    By analogy to the previous case, it is clear that the second part of (A4)

equals                  (see (37)).          Likewise, the first part equals
           (d'-!)'                                                                                  (q'dT)'
(see (35)).

12.    Using (28), we have
