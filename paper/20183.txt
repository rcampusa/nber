                                              ABSTRACT

The financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession left the U.S. economy in an injured state. In 2013,
output was 13 percent below its trend path from 1990 through 2007. Part of this shortfall—2.2 percentage
points out of the 13—was the result of lingering slackness in the labor market in the form of abnormal
unemployment and substandard weekly hours of work. The single biggest contributor was a shortfall
in business capital, which accounted for 3.9 percentage points. The second largest was a shortfall of
3.5 percentage points in total factor productivity. The fourth was a shortfall of 2.4 percentage points
in labor-force participation. I discuss these four sources of the injury in detail, focusing on identifying
state variables that may or may not return to earlier growth paths. The conclusion is optimistic about
the capital stock and slackness in the labor market and pessimistic about reversing the declines in total
factor productivity and the part of the participation shortfall not associated with the weak labor market.

      The years since 2007 have been a macroeconomic disaster for the United States of a mag-
nitude unprecedented since the Great Depression. The disaster has spawned a literature in
macroeconomics that emphasizes the collapse of product and labor demand and the inability
to offset the collapse with conventional monetary expansion because of the zero lower bound.
For a discussion along these lines with cites to that literature, see Hall (2013).
      Here I take for granted that the financial crisis was the cause of the collapse in product
and labor demand and that expansionary policy was unable to offset the collapse. I offer a
complementary analysis of other aspects of the post-crisis economy, focusing on the durable
effects of the crisis that a boost in product demand would not correct quickly. These effects
are

      • Lost total factor productivity

      • Lost investment resulting in a lower capital stock

      • Unemployment and short weekly hours of work lingering after job-creation incentives
        have returned to normal

      • A persistent decline in labor-force participation

      Table 1 provides estimates of these and other changes in the economy following the crisis
(an appendix and accompanying spreadsheets describe the calculations in detail). For the
U.S. business sector, it calculates the shortfall of output from trend after 2007 and breaks
the shortfall into components of total factor productivity, capital, and labor, using Solow’s
growth accounting formula. The trend for each variable is measured from 1990 through
2007. The rows for years show the values of variables as the difference the variable would
have contributed to output growth, had the variable continued on its pre-crisis trend, and
its actual contribution in each year. For example, output in 2009 grew 7.4 percent less
than its pre-crisis trend. The bottom panel shows the cumulative shortfall, in percentage
points, over the three and six years following end of the year prior to the crisis, 2007. For
example, as of 2013, output was 13.3 percent below trend, the sum of the numbers in the first
column of the top panel. The basic data come from John Fernald’s calculations of annual
total factor productivity—see Fernald (2012). Fernald breaks productivity growth into a
component reflecting changes in factor utilization and a residual, but I combine the two into
an overall measure of productivity change. He reports labor input as total hours worked.

See Appendix A and spreadsheets




Using additional data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, I have decomposed the total
into those arising from changes in population, labor-force participation, the employment
rate (one minus the unemployment rate), hours per week, labor quality (from Fernald),
and the fraction of total labor input that the business economy employs (as opposed to
government and households). I calculate hours per week as a residual, by dividing total
hours by the product of the population growth factor, the participation growth factor, and
the employment rate growth factor. The change in the resulting measure has a correlation
of 0.81 with the change in weekly hours from the Current Population Survey. The sources
of this moderate discrepancy is mainly that Fernald uses hours per job and I use hours per
worker. These differ because a fraction of workers have two or more jobs.
     The shortfall shown in the bottom panel is on a different conceptual basis from the
output gap. The gap is usually viewed as the amount that output would rise if frictions and
distortions suddenly disappeared. It may also be the amount that expansionary monetary
and fiscal policy could raise output. In measuring the output gap, key state variables, such
as total factor productivity and the capital stock, are taken at their actual current values,
not at hypothetical values that would have prevailed if earlier frictions and distortions had
not impaired the performance of the economy. My framework uses those hypothetical values.
The values are extrapolations of pre-crisis trends, to provide a benchmark for understanding
the effects of the crisis. I do not take a stand on the economic cost of the crisis, a concept
with meaning only by describing a superior policy that could have avoided some of the


                                                                            3
effects of the crisis. Even to begin to think about the cost, it would be essential to focus on
consumption rather than output.
   The column headed Capital contribution is the elasticity of the production function with
respect to the capital stock (about 0.38) times the log-change in the stock. Similarly, the
columns relating to the components of labor input report the product of the labor elasticity
(about 0.62) times the percentage shortfall in those components.
   The sum of the effects in 2008 through 2010 captures the Great Recession. I depart
from the NBER’s identification of the end of the recession in 2009 because the labor-market
indicators continued to decline through 2010. During the three-year period, the shortfall
in output cumulated to 12.4 percent. Shortfalls in output occurred because of higher un-
employment and a correspondingly lower employment rate (3.5 percentage points), lower
productivity (3.1 percentage points), the reduction in the capital contribution on account
of the collapse of investment (2.1 percentage points), declining labor-force participation (1.2
percentage points), and declining weekly hours of work (1.6 percentage points). The only
component moving in the opposite direction was rising labor quality, which cut the shortfall
by 0.6 percentage points.
   By 2013, the picture changed. The total shortfall in output was only slightly larger,
at 13.3 percentage points compared to 12.4 two years earlier. The continuing shortfall in
plant and equipment investment cumulated to account for 3.9 percentage points, well above
its earlier contribution of 2.1 percentage points.The shortfall in labor-force participation
grew to 2.4 percentage points. On the other hand, the part of the shortfall associated with
unemployment declined, from 3.5 percentage points to 2.2. Hours per week returned to
0.8 percent below its trend path in 2012. Low utilization of labor, in the form of high
unemployment and low hours, subsided, while depleted capital and a shift of the population
away from the labor market cut more sharply into output growth.
   This paper concentrates on four of the larger components in the bottom line of Table 1:
productivity, capital, unemployment, and participation.
   The analysis reaches the following conclusions:
   Productivity: The post-crisis slowdown in total factor productivity growth may be a result
of the crisis, but the evidence is weak. Similar slowdowns over 6-year periods have been
common. A study of detailed industries does not point toward diminished factor utilization




                                              4
or any other causal mechanism. A boost to product demand seems unlikely to induce a
catch-up in productivity.
   Capital stock : Discount rates applicable to capital formation rose sharply during the
crisis and have remained high in the following years, notwithstanding a drop in low-risk
interest rates. This force and the other adverse forces unleashed in the crisis lowered output,
compounding the adverse effect on investment from the rise in the discount. The result is
a capital stock 13.2 percent below its level had the economy grown along its earlier trend
during the post-crisis years and a capital contribution 10.2 percent below trend (growth in
capital’s share accounts for the difference). Despite this shortfall, the capital/output ratio
was above its trend value in 2013. Only when output begins to grow fast enough to offset the
large output shortfall will investment begin to move back to its pre-crisis trend path. Because
the capital stock is a state variable incapable of making jumps, it would be impossible for
a boost to product demand to restore the crisis-induced shortfall in capital. As time passes
and the adverse effects of the crisis on product demand and discount rates dissipate, capital
will return to its pre-crisis growth path.
   Unemployment: Job-creation incentives returned to normal soon after the crisis. Hours
of work of employed individuals also returned a good part of the way back to normal. These
two facts would normally coincide with a return to normal unemployment rates in the range
of 5.5 to 6.0 percent. And the unemployment rate in April 2014, at 6.3 percent, was most of
the way back toward its normal range. But the labor market looked different to jobseekers in
the post-crisis years than it did to employers and employed individuals. In 2013, the average
job-finding rate of the unemployed was only barely higher than at the trough of the recession
in 2009. The decline in that rate is entirely the result of a dramatic shift—arguably the result
of the crisis—in the composition of the unemployed, toward those with low job-finding rates
even in normal times. A boost to product demand would quickly tighten the labor market and
reduce unemployment, but the crisis-induced decline in matching efficiency would remain in
place and dissipate only slowly. An unusually tight market from the perspective of employers
and employed individuals would accompany the decline in unemployment.
   Labor-force participation: The labor-force participation rate was essentially constant be-
tween 1990 and 2007, then plunged by 3 percentage points from the crisis through 2013. It
has shown no sign of flattening out, much less returning to its pre-crisis level. About one per-
centage point of this fall is demographic—during the post-crisis period, baby-boomers began



                                               5
to reach the age when participation drops rapidly through retirement. About 0.5 percent-
age points arise from low job-finding rates, which result in the classification of many people
as out of the labor force when they are actually searching, as is apparent from their job-
finding rates. Dependence on disability benefits has risen by almost another half percent of
the working-age population. Dependence on earnings-contingent benefit programs—mainly
food stamps and Medicaid—rose substantially after the crisis and has not declined as the
labor market has tightened. These programs impose tax rates on earnings that, according
to a model of participation, could account for some part of the remaining one percentage
point decline in participation. The effect of low job-finding rates would respond to a boost in
product demand. The relation between labor-market conditions and disability-food stamps-
Medicaid dependence is uncertain. Thus the reversal of the decline in participation resulting
from these programs by a boost in product demand is equally uncertain.


1     Total Factor Productivity
Fernald (2014) discusses many aspects of productivity growth in the post-crisis years. I
confine my treatment to a limited set of observations incremental to his.
    Table 1 shows that total factor productivity (TFP)—inclusive of utilization fluctuations—
contributed a shortfall in output through 2010 of 3.1 percentage points, nothwithstanding
growth above trend in 2010. Productivity growth was essentially on its normal track in 2011
through 2013. Though the real business cycle model launched a tradition of treating TFP as
an exogenous driving force, there seems a potential case that the crisis caused the shortfall
in TFP in the years immediately following the crisis.
    The statistical evidence on this point is remarkably weak. The standard deviation of
6-year changes in Fernald’s measure of TFP over the period 1948 through 2007 was 4.4
percentage points, so the 3.5 percentage point shortfall during the years following the crisis
is well under one standard deviation.
    Given the volatility of medium-term TFP growth, Fernald’s hypothesis is plausible that
rapid TFP growth in the decade before the crisis was the result of an unsustainable burst of
production and adoption of information technology, so part of the post-crisis slowdown was
not the result of the crisis.
    Because TFP evolves as a trended random walk, any shock, such as the shortfall below
trend that cumulated to 3.5 percentage points by 2013, is presumptively permanent or nearly


                                              6
so. Technological advance is cumulative. The interruption that apparently—but hardly
conclusively—resulted from the crisis will hold back output well into the future. Some
theories of productivity growth predict gradual reversion to a growth path and others predict
that shocks have permanent effects.


2     Capital Contribution
I noted in the introduction that one of the most important legacies of the disaster that began
in 2008 is the shortfall in capital resulting from the cumulation of low investment after the
crisis. The business capital stock at the end of 2013 was 13.2 percent below its trend path.
Here I include three kinds of business investment—plant, equipment, and intellectual prop-
erty. I also discuss two kinds of household investment—housing and consumer durables—but
these are not included in the capital stock in Table 1, which refers to business and excludes
both capital and output in households and government.
    Investment theory emphasizes two key factors in capital accumulation: the risk-adjusted
cost of capital and the demand for output. Although exceptions to the Modigliani-Miller
principle abound, it remains the case that the cost of funds, hurdle rate, or discount appro-
priate for a given type of investment depends on the financial risk of the investment, not
the mode of financing. Financial risk involves the correlation of the return with returns in
general or with the marginal utility of consumption.

2.1    Risk premiums in the stock market
The stock market appears to be the best source of information about risk premiums for
business earnings. The discount applicable to the earnings of a publicly traded corporation
is the expected return to an investor holding the corporation’s securities. The expected
return is the sum of the safe return on default-free debt plus an equity or risk premium
Although it has been common to take the risk premium as essentially a constant, around
6 percent per year, modern thinking in finance stresses variations over time—see Cochrane
(2011) for a recent review of this issue. In particular, when the level of the stock market
is high, relative to a benchmark such as dividends, expected returns are lower. Normalized
consumption is another reliable predictor of returns. Figure 1 shows the risk premium for
the S&P stock-price index from a regression of annual returns on those two variables (see

Hall (2014) for further discussion and details of its construction). The risk premium spiked
in 2009, an event surely of importance to investment.

2.2    The capital wedge
The risk premium is one component of the wedge between the return to business capital
and the risk-free interest rate. Other components are taxes, financial frictions, and liquidity
premiums. To measure the total wedge, I calculate the annual return to capital and subtract
the one-year safe interest rate from it.
   The calculation of the return to capital uses the following thought experiment: A firm
purchases one extra unit of investment. It incurs a marginal adjustment cost to install the
investment as capital. During the year, the firm earns incremental gross profit from the
extra unit. At the end of the year, the firm owns the depreciated remainder of the one extra
unit of installed capital. Installed capital has a shadow value measured by Tobin’s q.
   Installation incurs a marginal cost at the beginning of the period of κ(kt /kt−1 − 1). Thus
the shadow value of a unit of installed capital at the beginning of the year is
                                                    
                                             kt
                                   qt = κ        −1 +1                                                  (1)

                                                      8
units of capital. From its investment of a unit of capital at the beginning of year t together
with the marginal installation cost—with a total cost of qt pk,t —the firm’s nominal return
ratio is the gross profit per unit of capital πt /kt plus the depreciated value of the capital in
year t + 1, all divided by its original investment:
                                                                       

                                      qt pk,t kt
Gross profit includes pre-tax accounting profit, interest payments, and accounting depreci-
ation. In principle, some of proprietors’ income is also a return to capital— non-corporate
business owns significant amounts of capital—but attempts to impute capital income to the
sector result in an obvious shortfall in labor compensation measured as a residual. The
reported revenue of the non-corporate business sector is insufficient to justify its observed
use of human and other capital. Note that corporate capital as measured in the NIPAs now
includes a wide variety of intangible components in addition to plant and equipment.
   The implied wedge between the return to capital and the risk-free real interest rate rf,t
is the difference between the nominal rate of return to capital and the one-year safe nominal
interest rate:
                                          gt = rk,t − rf,t .                                   (3)

This calculation is on the same conceptual footing as the investment wedge in Chari, Kehoe
and McGrattan (2007), stated as an interest spread. Note that gt is in real units—the rate
of inflation drops out in the subtraction.
   Figure 2 shows the values of the business capital wedge for two values of the adjustment
cost parameter κ, calculated from equation (3), combining plant, equipment, and intellectual
property. On the left, κ is taken as zero and on the right, as 2. The former value accords with
the evidence in Hall (2004) and the latter with the consensus of other research on capital
adjustment costs. The value κ = 2 corresponds to a quarterly parameter of 8.
   The two versions agree about the qualitative movements of the wedge since 1990, but
differ substantially in volatility. The wedge was roughly steady or falling somewhat during
the slow recovery from the recession of 1990, rose to a high level in the recession of 2001,
declined in the recovery, and then rose to its highest level after the crisis. The two calculations
agree that the wedge remained at a high level of about 18 percent per year through 2013.
   Hall (2011) discusses the surprising power of the financial wedge over general economic
activity. In an economy with a significant fraction of workers near the margin of market-

participation, the adverse effect of the wedge on capital formation cuts market activity in
much the same way as taxes on consumption or work effort.
     A comparison of the stock-market risk premium in Figure 1 with the capital wedge in
Figure 2 suggests that the effect of the financial crisis on the stock-market premium was
transitory while its effect on the capital-formation risk premium was persistent. Hall (2014)
discusses recent thinking in finance that emphasizes the weights that different investments
give to near, intermediate, and distant cash-flow claims. The stock market values flows that
grow over time, so it emphasizes distant claims. Business capital pays off over intermediate
terms—its average life is currently 8 years. Investments in job creation last about 3 years,
the expected duration of a new hire. All are subject to large fluctuations in annual discount
rates—there appears to be no tendency for the volatility of annual forward discount rates to
rise with futurity. And discount rates at different futurities appear to be only moderately
positively correlated. Thus it is entirely possible that, soon after the crisis, the long forward
discounts for the stock market returned to normal, while the short and medium discounts
for capital and job creation remained high.

2.3        Investment
Modern investment theory, combining the ideas of Jorgenson and Tobin, views investment
in general equilibrium as satisfying equation (3) with a value of the wedge reflecting the
financial risk of rk and any other factors such as taxes and frictions that separate rk from


                                                                             10
the safe real rate rf . In particular, forces that result in a low value of output will depress
investment, along with those that raise the risk premium or frictions. And a decline in the
safe rate will stimulate investment to the extent that it does not widen the spread.
   Figure 3 shows the paths of the five categories of investment in 2009 dollars, along with
trends fitted by least squares to the data for the period 1990 through 2007. All show a
negative response to the crisis sufficient to depress them below trend. The bulk of the
decline below trend occurred in business equipment and in housing. Business investment
plunged in 2009 at the same time that the discount in the stock market spiked. As that
discount returned to normal and output began to grow, business investment returned to close
to its growth path, as did consumer durable investment. However, none of those categories
of investment has yet begun to make up for the shortfall in the overall capital stock described
in the introduction.
   By 2012, the shortfall of housing investment below trend remained huge, and accounted
for most of the total shortfall in investment. The bulge in housing capital that occurred in
the middle of the previous decade and the long lifetimes of houses presumably account for
this fact.

2.4     Evolution of the capital/output ratio
In balanced growth, the capital/output ratio is constant. After a disturbance, the ratio
will return to normal—the ratio is mean-reverting, a basic property of almost all growth
models. Over U.S. history since World War II, the ratio for the business sector has grown
slowly from 0.8 to 1.1, with strong mean reversion to the trend path. Figure 4 shows the
ratio and the trend path, fitted as elsewhere in the paper over the period from 1990 through
2007. Immediately after the crisis, in 2009, the ratio jumped upward. Even though capital
formation dropped precipitately, the capital stock remained about constant while output
fell, so the ratio rose. Since then, through 2013, the normal pattern of mean-reversion
has operated, as output has grown faster than has the capital stock, thanks to depressed
investment.
   The figure also shows a ten-year forecast for the capital/output ratio, based on the CBO’s
February 2014 forecast. I say “based on” because the CBO does not forecast real business
output, the relevant concept according to a growth model, but rather real GDP, including
government and household production. I apply the CBO’s growth rates for GDP to the 2013

level of real business output in the figure. The forecast has the capital/output ratio deviating
from its normal pattern of mean reversion and, rather, converging to a higher growth path.
In effect, the forecast applies normal growth rates to both capital and output, rather than
having output grow relative to capital. A growth model would have output grow faster than
in the forecast.

2.5       Conclusions about the capital stock
The capital stock is an unambiguous state variable. At the end of 2013, it was 13.2 percent
below its trend path. The crisis and Great Recession, including amplification mechanisms,
appear to be responsible for the shortfall. Restoration of the shortfall can only occur gradu-
ally over a decade or more. Restoration will occur naturally because of the mean-reversion
tendencies of the economy. A policy or other force that stimulates product demand may
hasten the move, through the accelerator effect. On the other hand, the stimulus may raise
the discount rate for investment and thereby slow down the process of putting the capital
stock back on its normal growth path.




                                                                   13
3     Unemployment
The fraction of the labor force actually at work declined in the Great Recession as unem-
ployment rose. On account of lower labor input attributable to unemployment, output was
2.2 percent lower in 2013 than it would have been along its earlier trend.
    The Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model provides a coherent account of labor-
market tightness and its various indicators, including the unemployment rate. The model, as
presented in Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), takes θ = V /U , the vacancy/unemployment
ratio, as the central indicator. Two other indicators, the vacancy-filling rate for employers
and the job-finding rate for jobseekers, are functions of θ. Unemployment, on the other
hand, is a state variable that converges over time to a value determined by θ. Compared
to the other state variables considered in this paper, unemployment converges rapidly to
that target. Even with the low job-finding rates that occurred during the Great Recession,
unemployment moves almost all the way to the value consistent with the rates of flow into
and out of unemployment within a year after a shock.Unemployment is not a state variable
when considering changes in the labor market over a span of more than than a year.
    The simplest DMP model treats the working-age population as homogeneous. U.S. expe-
rience since 2007 has made clear that heterogeneity has important roles in the labor market.
I begin this section by contrasting tightness in the market from the points of views of three
classes of agents: employers, employees, and jobseekers. Unifying the three apparently di-
vergent views requires consideration of the heterogeneity of the labor force.

3.1    Labor-market tightness from the point of view of an employer
The employer encounters a flow of new hires per posted vacancy equal to the market-wide
average, the vacancy-filling rate H/V . Its reciprocal, T = V /H, is the expected time to fill
a job. T is a natural measure of tightness from the perspective of the employer. In a tight
market, jobs take longer to fill. Starting at the end of 2000, the BLS has conducted the Job
Opportunities and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), to gather data on vacancies, hires, and
related variables. Figure 5 shows the history of this measure of labor-market tightness.
    Tightness by the T measure was high in the strong labor market of 2000, fell steeply in
the recession of 2001, rose to a peak in 2006, fell sharply to a trough in 2008, and then rose
back to a high value in 2012. From the employer’s perspective, the labor market was as tight
in 2012 as in the boom year of 2006 and a bit higher than in the boom year of 2000. Business

profitability has reached high levels. Incentives to create jobs are strong. Businesses have
responded by recruiting aggressively and driving up the vacancy rate. The DMP model with
a homogeneous labor force would say that jobs are easy to find. The job-finding rate should
be high, the time to find a job short, and the unemployment rate low.

3.2        Tightness from the point of view of the employed
The hours of work of the employed are assumed constant in the basic DMP model, but
a straightforward extension can include endogenous hours. It assumes that workers and
employers agree on the efficient number of hours for the worker to put in each week. Efficient
means that the worker’s marginal rate of substitution between hours and pay is the same as
the employer’s value of the marginal product of an hour of work. The efficient number of
hours rises if a transitory increase in the marginal product of labor occurs.
     As Figure 6 shows, American workers’ weekly time on the job fell along a pronounced
trend from 1948 until 1980 and has been stable except for cyclical movements since then.
Workers spend more time on their jobs when the labor market is tight than when it is slack.
Hours reveal the tightness of the labor market as it affects people with jobs—hours are not
subject to the friction of matching jobseekers and job openings. In the severe recession

of 1981-82, average weekly hours fell by about one, and the fall was even greater in 2008.
In both cases, recovery of hours occurred fairly quickly, though it is uncertain what the
counterfactual normal level of hours would have been absent the crisis.
     Many discussions of hours use data on hours per job, from payroll data. From the
perspective of employment theory, however, hours per worker, as measured in the Current
Population Survey (CPS), is more appropriate. Note that Figure 6 uses the CPS numbers
directly, whereas Table 1 uses the hours figure implicit in Fernald’s data.

3.3       Labor-market tightness from the point of view of the unem-
          ployed
The CPS includes data on the monthly fraction of the unemployed who are employed in
the subsequent month—the job-finding rate. This rate is the natural measure of market
tightness for the unemployed. Figure 7 shows that the rate in 1990, a recession year, was
about 22 percent per month, so the average duration of unemployment was 1/0.22 = 4.5
months. During the long boom of the 1990s, the rate rose to a peak of 32 percent. The
recession of 2001 and ensuing period of slack labor-market conditions saw it decline to 24
percent in 2003. In the following boom, it rose to 28 percent in 2007, then collapsed to a

low point of 17 percent in 2009 and 2010. By 2013 it had recovered slightly to 18 percent.
Although it is hard to discern over the period covered in the figure what the normal job-
finding rate would have been in 2013 absent the disaster, it seems reasonable to say that this
measure was below normal even five years after the crisis.
     The failure of the job-finding rate to return to normal, despite high job-vacancy rates and
recovering weekly hours, is the central topic of this section of the paper. The phenomenon
has attracted attention in another form—unemployment is high in relation to the vacancy
rate, meaning that the labor market is off its normal Beveridge curve. Because the Beveridge
curve has one axis, the vacancy rate, that is a jump variable, and another, the unemployment
rate, that is a state variable, it incorporates the dynamics I mentioned earlier. The Beveridge
curve tells two stories simultaneously, so I avoid casting the discussion in its form.

3.4       Flows back and forth between unemployment and out-of-labor-
          force
The boundary between unemployment and out of the labor force is inherently ambiguous,
whereas the boundaries with employment are well defined—an individual is employed who
worked at least one hour in the week before the survey. Those not employed are classified


                                                                   17
as unemployed if they have done any of a list of specific job-seeking activities in the four
weeks before the survey. The remainder are out of the labor force. But some are close to
the boundary of jobseeker or employment—it is common for an individual who is out of the
labor force to be looking actively in the following month or to be in a job. One of the most
common errors in interpreting data on the work status of the population is to presume that
exit from the labor force is permanent—that out of the labor force is an absorbing state.
The process goes both ways: It is common for a jobseeker in one month to be out of the
labor force in the succeeding month. Krueger, Cramer and Cho (2014) provide useful new
evidence on this point, by tabulating all 16 months of each respondent’s data in the CPS.
   Figure 8 shows the flows back and forth between unemployment and out of the labor
force. The first is the percent of unemployed workers who leave the labor force each month.
The fraction is fairly stable around 20 percent. It declines in recessions and rises in recoveries.
In 2013, it was at its normal value. Though one might think that leaving the labor force
while searching for work occurs when individuals become discouraged about the prospects
of finding a job, the evidence points in a different direction—a fraction of the population
tends to oscillate between job search and other activities when not at work. Graph (b) of
the figure shows the reverse flow, from out of the labor force to job search. This flow rises
sharply in recessions; the rise was particularly large after the crisis in 2008. It appears that
contractions increase the fraction of the population in the oscillation mode. The increase
in the unemployment to out of labor force flow is not long-term exit from the labor force,
but a move that may well be reversed soon. Unfortunately, the CPS is not well suited to
confirming this view, because its panel dimension is so short.

3.5    Heterogeneity among jobseekers
Two dimensions of observable heterogeneity among jobseekers are important in understand-
ing the puzzles of labor-market tightness and unemployment in the post-crisis U.S. economy:
duration of unemployment and the source of joblessness. By source, I mean specifically a
six-way breakdown in the CPS of the events leading to job search: on layoff (with distinct
possibility of recall), lost job permanently, temporary job ended, quit, new entrant, and
reentrant.
   Job-finding rates tend to be higher among workers who became unemployed recently
compared to those who have been unemployed for many months. Further, the decline in

high-duration rates tends to be greater in a recession than the decline in low-duration rates.
The BLS does not report the rates by duration directly, but the agency has reported unem-
ployment by duration categories for many years. The ratio of the number unemployed for
less than 5 weeks to the number unemployed for 5 to 15 weeks is an index of job-finding rates
for the low-duration unemployed—when the rate is high, few of the unemployed will remain
in that state for, say, 10 weeks, so the higher-duration category will be depleted in relation to
the low-duration category. Similarly the ratio of those unemployed 27 to 51 weeks to those
unemployed 52 weeks or more is an index of the job-finding rate among the high-duration
unemployed. Figure 9 compares the two indexes.
   The figure shows that the proportional decline in the job-finding rate was much higher for
long-duration unemployment than for short-duration unemployment. To put it differently,
the monthly rate of exit from unemployment shifted down much more after the crisis for
high durations than for short durations. It is generally the case that exit rates decline with
duration, but the decline was much greater in 2009 than in normal years.
   The downward trend in the job-finding rate is one aspect of the general phenomenon of
declining turnover in U.S. life. Separation rates in the labor market are on a long downward
trend, as is geographic mobility. Jobs are harder to find, but they last correspondingly
longer, so unemployment has no upward trend. Now that the recovery from the crisis is
more than 5 years old, it is important to keep trends in mind in studying post-crisis data to
understand the effect of the crisis.

3.6        The crisis-induced change in the mix of sources of unemploy-
           ment
Figure 10 describes the second type of observable heterogeneity, that associated with the
event that resulted in the onset of jobseeking. Since 1994 the CPS has recorded the event in
a six-way classification. Graph (a) shows the number of unemployed workers who are off work
at their employers’ initiative, as a percent of all unemployment. They have suffered either
permanent job loss, with no indicated likelihood of recall, or are on layoff, with a likelihood
of recall. Permanent job loss rose from about 25 percent of total unemployment in 2006 to
almost 45 percent in 2009, just after the crisis. Layoff unemployment—never a large fraction
of the total–fell slightly as a percent of total unemployment after the crisis. Graph (b) shows
categories reflecting decisions by individuals to enter unemployment, either by moving into
the labor force (reentrants) or by leaving jobs voluntarily (quits). Reentrant unemployment
fell sharply around the crisis and then rose back to a normal level. Quit unemployment–also
not a large fraction of the total—fell almost in half at the crisis and has returned partway
to its normal fraction. Graph (c) shows the remaining two source categories, temporary job
ended and new entrant. These are generally small fractions of unemployment and did not
respond much to the crisis.
     Table 2 shows that the composition of the unemployed shifted dramatically in the direc-
tion of permanent job loss and away from layoffs, reentrants, and quits. The composition
shift matters a lot because exit rates from unemployment are considerably lower for per-

manent job losers than for other sources of unemployment, as the left column of the table
shows. The exit rate is the sum of the flow rate from unemployment to jobs and the rate
from unemployment to out of labor force. The composition effect would have lowered the
exit rate by 2.5 percentage points had it occurred with the normal set of exit rates shown in
the table, calculated as the averages over 2004 through 2007.
     The shift of jobseekers toward types less likely to exit unemployment each month resulted
in higher unemployment as long as the composition shift lasted. Figure 10 shows that the
composition gradually moved back to normal, but was probably not complete even five
years after the crisis, in 2013. The composition is, in effect, a state variable that keeps
unemployment high for a number of years but eventually returns to normal.

3.7     Long-duration unemployment and the decline in matching ef-
        ficiency
My discussion of the changing composition of unemployment toward high-duration jobseekers
uses measures of matching efficiency, a concept rooted in the search-and-matching model.
The model portrays the process of filling jobs in terms of a production function, the matching
function, with output taken as the flow of hires H and factor inputs taken as the stocks of
jobseekers X and vacancies V :
                                            Ht = mt (Xt , Vt ).                            (4)

Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) suggest that the matching function is well approximated
by
                                                        p
                                            Ht = µt      Xt Vt .                           (5)

                                                      22
The quantity µt is the efficiency of matching, analogous to the index of total factor produc-
tivity in the case of a production function. To simplify the discussion, I assume this form, but
none of the conclusions here depends on this particular choice. See Hall and Schulhofer-Wohl
(2013) (HS-W) for a more extensive treatment.
   The jobseeker faces a monthly probability of finding and taking a job equal to H/X.
Labor-market statistics for the U.S. do not include direct measures of the number of job-
seekers. Those counted as unemployed in the Current Population Survey—who did not work
in the week prior to the survey and who looked actively for work in the four weeks prior to
the survey—are presumably included in X. But the CPS shows that only a minority of new
hires were unemployed prior to being hired. The majority moved directly from earlier jobs
or were out of the labor force.
   Under conditions laid out in HS-W, data from JOLTS make up for the absence of data
on the total jobseeker count X. In the total labor market, counting jobseekers who are
unemployed, employed, or out of the labor market, we normalize efficiency at one, so the
total volume of hires is
                                                 p
                                        Ht =      Xt Vt .                                   (6)

The effect of the normalization is to define the aggregate Xt as measured in efficiency units.
Thus
                                                      Ht2
                                           Xt =                                             (7)
                                                      Vt
and, in consequence,
                                        Ht   Vt
                                           =    = Tt .                                      (8)
                                        Xt   Ht
The job-finding rate for unemployed jobseekers is
                                                 Ht
                                      f t = µt      = µt Tt                                 (9)
                                                 Xt
so to calculate the efficiency of matching for unemployed jobseekers, we divide the job-finding
rate by the tightness measure Tt :
                                                      ft
                                           µt =          .                                 (10)
                                                      Tt
This calculation treats jobseekers as homogeneous.
   Figure 11 shows the results of the calculation. Matching efficiency declined gradually
until the crisis, then fell dramatically, reaching a low point in 2012 and rising slightly in
2013. Neglect of heterogeneity turns out to be a huge influence in these movements.

     To deal with heterogeneity, we apply the same approach but to jobseekers differentiated
by permanent demographic characteristics and changing personal state variables, notably the
six categories of unemployment source and multiple categories of duration of unemployment
to date. We fit seven trinomial logit models to the job-finding hazards for the six unemploy-
ment source categories and for out-of-the-labor-force, with variables capturing demographics
and unemployment duration to date. Our work studies other transition probabilities, but
for the purposes of this paper, only the job-finding hazard equations are relevant.
     In this setup, we define a set I of buckets, crossing the seven categories of jobseekers
with five categories of unemployment duration. Then for each i ∈ I, we calculate specific
matching efficiency,
                                               fi,t
                                                    .      µi,t =                                      (11)
                                               Tt
To measure overall matching efficiency, we form a fixed-weight index,
                                                                X
                                                        µ̄t =         wi µi,t .                        (12)

The weights are the population fractions in the base period before the crisis. Figure 12 shows
the resulting index of overall matching efficiency. The index has a downward trend, but rose
in the 2001 recession and again in 2009. The collapse of matching efficiency in Figure 11

               Figure 12: Overall Composition-Adjusted Matching Efficiency

is entirely the result of a sudden shift in the composition of unemployment toward hard-to-
match groups, not a true decline in efficiency. Figures in the HS-W paper show that each of
the seven groups had fairly smoothly declining matching efficiency from 2000 through 2012,
with no significant special decline in the post-crisis years.
   The finding that the large decline in matching efficiency is entirely a mix effect implies
that, as the legacy of unemployment works off, efficiency should return to its gradually
declining path of the pre-crisis years. Historically, another gradual decline, in the inflow to
unemployment, has offset the gradual decline in efficiency and the unemployment rate has
remained remarkably steady.
   The bulge in long-duration unemployment is partly the result of the crisis-induced shift
toward permanent job loss. Jobseekers in this category have lower exit rates from unem-
ployment and so are more likely to advance to higher duration categories, with even lower
exit rates.

3.8    Flow from jobs to unemployment
The unemployment rate depends on the inflow to unemployment from jobs and from the
out-of-the-labor-market population as well as the exit rate just discussed. Figure 13 shows
the more volatile of the two components, the fraction of people employed in one month who
are unemployed the next month. Like many turnover measures, this one has a noticeable
downward trend, interrupted by a spike in 2009. In 2013, this flow was back to its trend.
Remaining excess unemployment is not the result of continuing high flows from jobs into
unemployment, but from low flow rates out of unemployment, as shown in Figure 7.

3.9      Unemployment-conditioned benefits
A jobseeker taking a job loses benefits from unemployment insurance. Recent papers by
Nakajima (2012), Valletta and Kuang (2010), Fujita (2011),and Daly, Hobijn, Şahin and
Valletta (2011), culminating in Farber and Valletta (2013), ask whether higher UI benefits
result in lower search effort and higher reservation wages, both of which would raise un-
employment in a standard DMP model. This research compares the job-finding rates of
covered workers to uncovered workers. The answer is fairly uniformly that the effects of UI
enhancements during times of high unemployment in raising unemployment still further are
quite small, in the range of 0.3 percentage points of extra unemployment.
    Hagedorn, Karahan, Manovskii and Mitman (2013) (HKMM) tackle a more challenging
question, whether more generous UI benefits result in higher wages and higher unemployment
by raising the flow value of unemployment and thus shrinking the gap between productivity
and that flow value. They compare labor markets with arguably similar conditions apart
from the UI benefits regime. In their work, the markets are defined as counties and the
similarity arises because they focus on pairs of adjacent counties. The difference in the
UI regimes arises because the two counties are in different states and UI benefits are set
at the state level and often differ across state boundaries. The research uses a regression-

                                                                26
discontinuity design, where the discontinuity is the state boundary and the window is the
area of the two adjacent counties. The authors conclude that, absent the increase in UI
benefits, unemployment in 2010 would have been about 3 percentage points lower.
   Many commentators have dismissed HKMM’s conclusion on the grounds that the research
implies that unemployment would have hardly risen at all absent the financial crisis and
resulting collapse of product demand. But that dismissal is unwarranted. HKMM’s work
fully recognizes that the enhancements of UI benefits was itself the result of the forces that
caused the Great Recession. The proper interpretation, within the framework of the paper,
is that feedback from enhanced UI benefits was a powerful amplification mechanism of a
negative impulse arising from the crisis.
   The issues that arise in evaluating the paper are those for any regression-discontinuity
research design: (1) Are there any other sources of discontinuous changes at the designated
discontinuity points that might be correlated with the one of interest? (2) Is the window
small enough to avoid contamination from differences that do not occur at the discontinuity
point but rather elsewhere in the window? The authors explore a number of state-level
economic policies that could generate cross-border effects that might be correlated with the
UI effects, but none seem to matter. The authors are less persuasive on the second point.
Many counties are large enough to create substantial contamination. Far from being atoms,
single counties are often large parts of their states, both geographically and in terms of the
share of the population. The extreme case is Washington, DC, treated as a state with only
one county.
   Hagedorn, Karahan, Manovskii and Mitman (2014) treat the termination of extended
UI benefits in North Carolina as a case study for their research. These benefits ended in
June 2013. In the neighboring states of South Carolina and Virginia, extended benefits
continued until the end of 2013. Employment expanded and unemployment contracted in
North Carolina in the second half of 2013. To study the difference between North Carolina
and the two other states, I estimated the expectation of North Carolina’s values of the labor-
market variables conditional on the variables in the two other states, together with a shift
variable for the six months in 2013 when North Carolina’s UI policy changed. I obtained
the data from a spreadsheet posted on Mitman’s website. Table 3 shows the results. The
top panel uses the three available measures of employment, from the BLS’s payroll survey,
its Local Area Unemployment Statistics database, and the CPS. The left-hand variable is in

natural-log form—I multiply the coefficient of the dummy variable by 100 so that its units
are percents. The regressions cover 1990 through 2013 for the payroll survey and LAUS data
and 2000 through 2013 for the household survey. They include an AR(1) term to account
for the high serial correlation of the disturbances. The estimated effects for employment
are close to zero for the payroll and LAUS data and are precisely estimated, as shown by
the small standard errors. The hypothesis of no difference during the policy-change period
is easily accepted. For the household survey, the point estimate also close to zero, but the
standard error implies that the confidence interval includes many negative values as well as
positive values. Overall, there is no evidence of an important employment effect.
   The middle panel in the table gives results for the unemployment rate, in percentage
points, from the two sources that measure unemployment. Both show small reductions of
fractions of a percentage point, measured precisely for the LAUS and imprecisely for the
household survey. Again, there is no evidence of an important effect. The bottom line in
the table reports a small negative difference in the labor-force participation rate between
North Carolina and the neighboring states, with a standard error of nearly one percentage
point. This finding rules out large participation effects and gives no positive support to any
meaningful effect.
   Overall, the case study of North Carolina does not appear to support HKMM’s finding
of large effects from changes in UI benefits. But HKMM have ignited an important debate.
Further discussion may help resolve the issue of the reliability of their finding of such large
effects on wages and unemployment.

   Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (2013) study movements of a variety of unemploy-
ment-conditioned benefits including UI. They conclude that both the level and movements of
the effective subsidy for unemployment are trivial. From microdata, they measure the effect
of unemployment on the opportunity cost of taking a job, stated as a percent of average
worker productivity. One component is the loss of benefits that occurs upon taking a job.
On average, the loss of benefits—UI, food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid—contributes only
3.5 percentage points to the opportunity cost. Although that contribution is higher when
unemployment is high, the fluctuations are necessarily small and other components of the
opportunity cost offset them.
   With respect to UI, the authors observe that only around a third of the unemployed
receive benefits. The others are ineligible or unwilling to apply. Further, about a quarter of
UI benefits go to people who are not unemployed because they do not meet the standard
criterion of search effort or because they work part time but earn less than the applicable
cap. Almost all of the increase in benefits in general arises from UI, however, as they find
that the unemployment-conditioned part of food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid is tiny. The
first two of these programs are fairly small, and Medicaid, though large, goes mainly to
people who are disabled or elderly.
   Figure 14 shows the findings of the paper for UI and for other benefits. The highest
line shows the results of the regression at the micro level of UI benefits on the incidence of
unemployment (annual UI receipts divided by fraction of the year unemployed). The lower
line, labeled “UI, after adjustment” adjusts downward dramatically to account for (1) the
probability that benefits will exhaust before the individual finds a later job, if the individual
declines a job offer while receiving UI benefits, and (2) the costs to the individual of partici-
pating in UI. UI benefits spike in recessions, reaching around four percent of productivity in
those of 1973-1975, 2001, and 2007-2009. The spike in the Great Recession was only about
0.5 percentage points above the two earlier major spikes. By 2012, the benefit rate was
about halfway back to its pre-crisis level. The behavior of the unemployment-conditioned
component of food stamps, welfare, and Medicaid combined was altogether different. It had
a steep upward trend from 1982 through 2005, then fell substantially during the period this
paper studies.
   The magnitude of the downward adjustment to UI benefits is surprisingly large. Most
of it reflects an imputation of compliance cost to the UI recipient. The authors make this

adjustment by asking why so many eligible workers decline to apply for UI benefits. They
fit a convex cost function to time-series data on the takeup rate for benefits. They believe
that their imputation is in line with the findings of earlier research on UI benefits, based on
how much reported reservation wages respond to benefit levels.
   Though Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis focus on measuring the benefits lost when a
worker moves from unemployment to employment as a topic in fluctuations modeling, their
findings are important for broader issues. First, their findings appear to be quite inconsistent
with the mechanism that HKMM describe. Not only is the UI effect small and transitory,
but the decline in unemployment-conditioning for other benefits offsets a good part of that
effect. The small remaining net effect of increased attraction to remaining unemployed seems
incapable of explaining the wage increase that HKMM found, along with declines in vacancies
and increases in unemployment caused by that increase, according to the HKMM model.
   Second, CRK’s results—and even more, results that a related research strategy might
generate—bear on the role of benefits in the substantial decline in labor-force participation
that followed the crisis. CRK ask what would be on the mind of an unemployed individual
considering a job offer. A similar strategy could study what would be on the mind of an




                                                                              30
individual not currently in the labor force who was considering entering the labor force by
starting a job search.

3.10     Conclusions about unemployment
Although unemployment is a state variable in the search-and-matching model with homo-
geneous jobseekers, exit rates from unemployment are so high, even after a shock as great
as the crisis in 2008, that unemployment melts away rapidly once the labor market returns
to normal tightness. In a model that recognizes the role of heterogeneity, a force that shifts
the inflow to unemployment toward individuals with low exit rates will cause elevated un-
employment as long as that shift lasts. Further, the decline in exit rates with unemployment
duration amplifies the effect. The evidence is compelling that this mechanism kept unem-
ployment high for at least five years after the crisis.
    The response of policy to high unemployment through the extension of UI benefits is
another amplification mechanism. Its strength is a matter of intense debate, but all research
and economic logic confirms that some amplification occurred.


4      Labor-force Participation
Table 1 shows a growing shortfall of the labor-force participation rate during the post-crisis
period. Unlike the employment rate and hours per week, which closed some of their shortfalls
by 2010 or 2011, participation has continued to shrink. A key issue in the analysis of the
effects of the crisis is whether participation will ever return to normal once the adverse effects
of the crisis dissipate, or whether participation will remain at its current low level or fall
even more.
    Figure 15 shows two measures of the labor-force participation rate. The upper line is the
standard measure—the ratio of the number of people over age 16 in the labor force (employed
+ unemployed) to the population over 16. The measure includes mix effects. Most of these
arise from the oldest age group, which accounts for a growing fraction of the population.
That group also has the lowest participation rate. So part of the decline in the standard
measure arises from the aging of the population associated with declining mortality rates for
people in their sixties and seventies.
    The thin line in the upper part of the figure is the linear trend fitted by least squares for
the years 1990 through 2007, as in Table 1. The standard measure follows a slight downward

trend with mild cyclical movements through 2007, then drops by 3.0 percentage points from
2007 to 2013. Note that this figure exceeds the one in Table 1, which is multiplied by labor’s
factor share.
   The lower line in the figure, with scale on the right, shows a fixed-weight index that is
immune to sex and age mix effects (age is 16 through 19, 20 through 24, 25 through 34, 35
through 45, 45 through 54, and 55 and older). It applies the average population fraction over
the period 1990 though 2013 to the participation rates within each of the 12 demographic
groups. Its trend is noticeably upward. During the post-crisis period, it drops below trend
by 1.9 percentage points.
   The conclusion is that mix effects special to the post-crisis period account for 1.1 per-
centage points of the decline in participation. The increase in the population fraction from
2007 to 2013 was 2.0 percentage points for men 55 and over and 1.9 percentage points for
women in that age group. The youngest member of the group in 2007 was born in 1952
and the youngest in 2013 was born in 1958. The extra 1.1 percentage points were the effect
of the entry of the baby-boomers to the lower-participation age group. Forecasts of future
participation rates show similar declines as the boomers retire in larger numbers.

     Figure 16 shows the participation rates for the 12 demographic groups, along with linear
least-squares trend lines estimated from 1990 through 2007. During the post-crisis period,
the declines below trend occurred among those aged 16 through 34 and women aged 25
through 54. During the crisis period starting in 2008, the upward trend in participation
among both men and women aged 55 and above was only slightly less than in the period
from 1990 through 2007.
     Table 4 shows that people aged 45 and above contributed disproportionately to the post-
2007 shortfall of participation relative to trend, and that women played a larger role in the
disproportion than men. Rising take-up rates for disability may play a role among the older
groups.
     Figure 17 shows a comparison of the trend of pre-crisis participation by education groups
(less than high-school graduation, high-school graduation only, some college, and college
graduation) to post-crisis participation. The figure displays a fixed-weight index over the
period from 1992 through 2013. Note that the trend of the fixed-weight index is downward
whereas the fixed-weight index based on sex-age groups, in Figure 15, is upward. Participa-
tion rises sharply with education, and education advanced steadily during the three decades.
The shortfall from trend in 2013 based on education was 2.4 percentage points. This figure
overlaps somewhat but not entirely with the earlier one based on sex and age. Calcula-
tions based on sex-age-education groups would yield a larger estimate of the participation
shortfall, I believe.

4.1        Turnover and participation
As the participation rate has continued to decline at the same time as unemployment, many
commentators have concluded that unemployment is declining because unemployed individ-
uals are leaving the labor force rather than taking jobs. But this view is a drastic oversimpli-
fication that overlooks high rates of turnover among activities in the working-age population.
In the typical month of 2013, 2.5 million people left the labor force while unemployed, more
than the 2.2 million who took jobs. But 3.7 million people who were previously out of the
labor force took jobs without intervening unemployment and another 2.6 million started to
search for work. Many people counted as out of the labor force will move back into the labor
force quite soon.
     Though many discussions of labor-market dynamics refer to a population that is always
in the labor force and move between employment and unemployment, the two-activity model
cannot possibly describe the U.S. labor market. On the other hand, a three-activity model—
not in the labor force (N), unemployed (U), and employed (E)—is a useful way to understand
the basics of the turnover process. The model has 6 transition rates, designated NE, NU,
UE, UN, EN, and EU, in an obvious notation. The fraction of people in an activity who

remain in that activity in the following month are residuals—for example, NN = 1 - NE -
NU.
     Table 5 shows, on the left, the 6 transition rates for the average month in 2013 and the
average month in the pre-crisis years 2005 through 2007. The data come from the Current
Population Survey. The corresponding stationary distributions across activities appear in
the upper-right-hand corner of the table. Note that U is the fraction of the population that
is unemployed, not the standard unemployment rate stated as a fraction of the labor force,
which is U/(U+E). In 2013, U was 1.4 percentage points higher than in 2005-2007, but N
was 3.3 percentage points higher. The reduction in participation was more than twice as
large as the increase in unemployment.
     The lower right-hand block in Table 5 shows the separate influences of each of the 6
transition rates. Each row shows the implied distribution across activities if all but one of
the transition rates had its pre-crisis value and the one named at the left had its 2013 value.
Thus the figures in the block would be the same as in the line above for 2005 through 2007
except for the role of the single transition rate for the line, shown at the left.
     In the top line of the lower right-hand block of the figure, for the NE job-finding transition,
lowering the rate to 4.1 percent per month from its pre-crisis level of 5.1 percent boosts the
non-participating N fraction from 33.5 percent to 37.0 percent, just above its actual 2013
level. In other words, the decline in participation as of 2013 was entirely the result of the

                                                              36
one-percentage-point decline in the job-finding rate of non-participants. It’s not that more
people were dropping out of unemployment and leaving the labor force permanently—in fact,
the UN transition rate was a bit lower in 2013 than before the crisis. Rather, the rate of
job-finding among non-participants, NE, was lower. This finding coincides with the general
belief that a fraction of people classified as out of the labor force are actually job-seekers
and, in normal times, succeed in finding jobs in large volumes despite exerting search efforts
insufficient to meet the survey’s criteria for classification as unemployed. In 2006, more than
twice as many non-participants found jobs in the typical month as did those classified as
unemployed.
   Most of the other lines in Table 5 are similar to the actual figures for the pre-crisis
years, 2005 through 2007. One exception is an obvious one—the job-finding rate for the
unemployed, UE, at 19.3 percent per month, was substantially below its pre-crisis level of
27.5 percent, which accounts for a good part of the elevation of the unemployment rate
in 2013 (4.5 percent of the population) over its pre-crisis level (3.1 percent). The other
contributor was the elevation of the transition rate NU, from out of the labor force to
unemployed. In the slacker labor market of 2013, it was more likely that a person out of
the labor force who decided to seek work would go through a period of active search and be
counted as unemployed, rather than finding a job without intervening unemployment.
   This examination of labor-market dynamics suggests that some part, perhaps fairly large,
of the decline in measured participation is actually the result of the slowing down of the
process of finding work among people who are interested in working but whose search efforts
do not place them among the unemployed, as defined in the CPS.

4.2    The extended labor force
The standard measure of the labor force that underlies the measurement of participation
excludes many people who have a demonstrated interest in working, but do not satisfy the
survey’s definition of active search. The definition calls for explicit job-seeking actions in the
four weeks prior to the survey. For example, Hall and Schulhofer-Wohl (2013) show that the
number of people who take new jobs, having been out of the labor force in the prior month,
is larger than the number who were counted as unemployed. The BLS tabulates additional
candidates from among those classified as out of the labor force. One is called marginally
attached. It brings in people who want to work and are available to work, but who have not

searched actively in the past four weeks. The other, rather smaller, is called discouraged —its
members want to work but believe no jobs are available.
     An obvious question is how measures of participation are affected by adding these groups
to those in the conventional labor force who worked in the survey week or were actively
searching in the prior four weeks. Figure 18 graphs the data. It seems fair to say that the
same factors influence the extended labor force. It displays the same downward trend as the
conventional measure starting in 2008 and continuing to decline at the same rate even after
unemployment and other measures of slack turned around.
     Table 6 shows the increments, in fractions of percentage points, to the participation
rate if either or both of the additional groups were included in the labor force. In 2013,
including both would raise the participation rate by half a percentage point. This amount
is a non-trivial component of the roughly two percentage point decline in the mix-adjusted
participation rate.

the 75th percentile (series LEU0252911800 and LEU0252912200), and the 90th percentile
(series LEU0252911900 and LEU0252912300). The comparable participation rates are se-
ries LNS11300001 and LNS11300002. Figure 19 shows the distributions for the years 2000
through 2012. The thin black lines show the levels in each quantile in 2000, to make the
movements by year easier to spot. The figure confirms widely reported facts about earnings
in recent decades—the dispersion of earnings rose, with earnings at the bottom of the dis-
tributions remaining constant in real terms and those at the top growing moderately. The
distribution in the figure overstates the earnings opportunities of the population because it
includes only those who have found jobs. Note that earnings growth is generally substantially
higher for women than for men.
    The widening of the earnings distribution has a role in discouraging participation. Par-
ticipation among high-wage workers is close to saturation—the increase in wages that has
taken place in recent years could not have raised their participation much. On the other
hand, two factors combine to reduce participation among low-wage workers: the stagnation
of their wages and the fact that some of them are in households containing higher-wage
workers who generate the bulk of household income. The rise in household income lowers
participation among low-wage household members through an income effect. An implication
of the widening earnings distribution is that more specialization occurs in the labor market.
In particular, a declining fraction of teenagers work or look for work because, in some cases,
their parents are earning more and the contribution to family income from the low wages

available to teenagers is too low to attract them to the market or to make their parents push
them to work.

4.4        Job-finding rates and participation
A low job-finding rate discourages labor-force participation by raising the difficulty of finding
market employment. Historically, the effect was quite small. Participation hardly declined
in recessions prior to the crisis.
     In a survey of UI benefits recipients with detailed weekly recording of search effort,
Krueger and Mueller (2011) found that search time is about 1.7 hours per day or 12 hours
per week. This figure is somewhat higher than found in time-use studies. Search time is close
to constant across all the duration categories in the survey. From the same survey, Mueller
and Hall (2014) find a weekly frequency of job offers of 5.8 percent with an acceptance rate
of 72 percent. After adjustment for offers not yet accepted or rejected (21 percent), we
calculate a job-finding rate of 4.8 percent per week. Thus the expected duration of search
to find a job is 1/0.048 = 21 weeks. Expected search time to find a job is 21 × 7 × 1.7 =
244 hours. Job-finding rates fell approximately to half their normal levels in 2009 and 2010.
Thus the extra search time was 122 hours.
     A typical job lasts about 3 years, or 6,000 hours at 2,000 hours per year. To state search
cost as a tax on work effort, one needs the value of time diverted from other non-work
activities stated as a ratio to the earnings from work. Research on this ratio, often called


                                                                                 40
z, has been active recently, but without achieving a consensus. One source of information
is reported reservation wages. These tend to be close to actual wages. Krueger and Mueller
(2013), Figure 2b, report that the average ratio of reservation wages to prior actual wages in
their survey is 0.92. The optimal reservation wage can be higher than the opportunity cost
of work, if taking a job forecloses the option of finding a higher wage. But the reservation
wage can never be below the opportunity cost. The finding of high stated reservation wages
is inconclusive. Further, Mueller and Hall (2014) show a substantial upward bias in stated
reservation wages in the Krueger-Mueller survey—respondents frequently take jobs paying
less than their earlier reported reservation wage but more rarely decline jobs paying more.
   As Hornstein, Krusell and Violante (2011) point out, the opportunity cost inferred from
data on search behavior is generally low, even negative. Jobseekers accept jobs with such a
high frequency that they must impute a low benefit to remaining unemployed.
   The research discussed above deals with the opportunity cost of moving from no work
to a fulltime work schedule, which presumably drives up the marginal value of non-search
time spent at home, as it declines by a substantial amount, say 40 hours per week. The
opportunity cost of about 12 hours of weekly search should logically be lower. Aguiar, Hurst
and Karabarbounis (2013) show that the displaced activities are mainly socializing, watching
TV, and sleeping.
   If the opportunity cost of search is 0.5 times the wage of the subsequent job, the tax arising
from the increase in search time is 0.5 × 122/6000 or 1.0 percent. For workers aged 25 to 55
without child-care responsibilities, the tax probably has small effects on participation—the
income effect offsets the substitution effect. But for younger and older people, who are closer
to the margin between work and non-work, that tax could be part of the story of declining
participation during the years when job-finding rates were seriously depressed. Table 4 shows
that a disproportionate share of the decrease in participation occurred outside of the middle
age groups. With job-finding rates returning to near-normal levels by mid-2014, this effect
has reversed itself, however.

4.5    Disability benefits under Social Security
Two programs under Social Security pay benefits to disabled individuals. Recipients lose
some or all of the benefits if they work, so the programs discourage participation in the labor
force by recipients who are capable of work, a group thought to be a growing fraction. The

Old Age, Survivors, and Disability program covers those meeting certain criteria based on
prior contributions to Social Security, and Supplemental Security Income covers additional
recipients, almost all disabled. Some receive benefits from both programs.
   Figure 20 shows the number of recipients of benefits from the two programs, without
double counting. The data also exclude people aged 65 and over. The straight line shows
the trend, fitted to the years 1996 through 2007. The recipient count tracks the trend quite
closely until the crisis, and then jumps upward. There is no sign of a return toward the
trend line in recent years as the labor market has approached normal conditions.
   A full analysis of the role of disability benefits in the post-crisis years would encounter
the challenging issue of what fraction of the beneficiaries would be in the labor force but for
the benefit programs. An upper-bound calculation of the role is available on the hypothesis
that all of the added recipients would have been in the labor force. The gap between the
trend line and the actual recipient count in 2013 was 770,000 people, which was 0.4 percent
of the population aged 18 through 64. This amount is a potentially important fraction of
the 1.9 percentage points of the post-crisis shortfall of labor-force participation calculated
earlier in this section.

Reports/ MedicareMedicaidStatSupp/2011.html , Table 13.4




4.6       Other safety-net benefits
Two other components of the U.S. social safety net are large enough to be candidates for
effects on participation. First is Medicaid, which provides medical care mainly to families
with children. Figure 21 shows the number of people receiving Medicaid benefits in the
standard format of this paper, with a trend fitted to data from 1990 through 2007, projected
to 2013. Beneficiaries are on a steep upward trajectory, but the bulge in the post-crisis years
appears to be in line with those that occurred after the two previous recessions. Note that
the bulge appeared to shrink in 2012 and 2013—as the labor market recovered, beneficiaries
reverted toward the previous growth path. It seems unlikely that anything like a significant
permanent shift in the path occurred as a result of the crisis.
     The other major program is food stamps, now called SNAP. This program pays a large
number of families fairly small benefits, averaging $281 per month in 2011. Figure 22 shows
the number of beneficiaries, again in the standard format (from http:// www.fns.usda.gov/
pd/snapsummary.htm). Growth in beneficiaries was zero during the pre-crisis period from
1990 through 2007. In 2013, 22 million more people received food stamps than would have
received them based on the pre-crisis level. In 2011, with 44.1 million beneficiaries, 20.8
million households received benefits, so the average household had just over two members.

10.1 million beneficiaries were single. Among the 20.4 million beneficiaries aged 18 through
59, 6.4 million faced work requirements. 5.7 million were employed and 5.8 million were
looking for work, for an unemployment rate of 50.1 percent and a labor-force participation
rate of 55.9 percent.
   The rules of the food-stamp program discourage work among those electing to enroll
and, on the other hand, discourage enrollment in the program for those with any significant
earning power. Eligibility currently requires that gross monthly income not exceed $1,681 per
month for the typical household of one adult and one child (see http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligibility).
Earnings reduce benefits at a tax rate of 30 percent. The earnings level sufficient to reduce
benefits to zero, for a household with no other source of reportable gross income, is $281/0.30
= $938 per month, about half a month’s pay at $10 per hour. Actual average earned income
was $312 per month in 2011, four days of work at $10 per hour (see Strayer, Eslami and
Leftin (2012)).
   Under the assumption that the age mix of food-stamp beneficiaries was the same in 2013
as in 2011, the increase in food-stamp beneficiaries in the age group of potential labor-force
participation was 10.3 million. Of these, 6.4 million were women and 3.9 million were men.
Food stamps may be part of the explanation for the higher shortfall in participation among



                                                                        44

women compared to men, shown earlier in Table 4. The 10.3 million increment was 4.2
percent of the labor force aged 16 and higher.
   The expansion of food stamps resulted from some crisis-related extensions of eligibility.
Mulligan (2012b) describes these in detail. These effectively removed the asset-conditioning
of benefits and suspended work requirements. Higher job-finding frictions made food stamps
more attractive as well. Dependence on food stamps seems to have substantial inertia,
because the beneficiary population has continued to rise despite the partial return to normal
conditions in the labor market.

4.7    Conclusions about the decline in participation
Table 7 pulls together the results of the analysis of labor-force participation. The starting
point is the decline relative to trend of 3.0 percent of the population, shown in Figure 15.
The same figure also shows the sex-age mix effect of 1.1 percentage points. Table 6 describes
the 0.5 percentage point effect of increases in marginal and discouraged individuals, who
appear likely to find jobs or enter unemployment even though the CPS classifies them as out
of the labor force. Figure 20 and its explanation in the text suggest that rising dependence
on Social-Security disability benefits may account for as much as 0.4 percentage points of
the decline in labor-force participation. Rising earnings of primary family earners may result
in lower participation of other family members. A modest increase in implicit taxes from
food stamps could cause important declines in participation. The last two, along with other
influences, may explain the residual of 1.0 percentage points of participation decline.

                        Table 8: Effects of Boost to Product Demand

5     Concluding Remarks
Table 8 summarizes the findings of the paper. There is no reason to expect that the cumu-
lative shortfall in productivity growth of 3.4 percentage points of output could be reversed
by a sudden increase in product demand. That shortfall seems to be the result of a period
of reduced innovation, possibly the result of the crisis. The level of technology is a state
variable, and thus not moveable by immediate policy. These statements are not intended
as a forecast about productivity growth, however. Productivity forecasts have had no suc-
cess historically. Productivity growth is a noisy process. Whether the return to a normal
economy will result in a catchup in productivity growth in the longer term is an unsettled
question of growth economics.
    The conclusions for the capital stock are the most focused in the paper. It is unambiguous
that the capital stock is an important state variable of the economy. It is responsible for the
largest part of the output shortfall, 5.0 percentage points. It can’t respond immediately to a
boost to product demand, but a boost would probably trigger an accelerator response that
would close some part of the shortfall. In the longer run, the strong mean reversion in the
historical capita/output ratio should work to close the entire gap.
    Employment was held back in the post-crisis period by high unemployment, which can be
seen as a reduction in labor supply. Unemployment dropped slowly to 1.3 percentage points
above normal in 2013, contributing 0.9 percentage points to the shortfall in output in that
year. The return to normal has been slower than in previous post-recession episodes because
the crisis shifted the composition of jobseekers toward those with low job-finding rates and
low exit rates from unemployment. An increase in product demand would accelerate the
remaining move back to normal. Mean reversion of unemployment is a well-established
feature of the U.S. economy and there seems little reason to think that the crisis would
affect the unemployment rate in any highly persistent way.

   Labor-force participation fell substantially after the crisis, contributing 2.5 percentage
points to the shortfall in output. The decline showed no sign of reverting as of 2013. Part is
demographic and will stabilize, and part reflects low job-finding rates, which should return
to normal slowly. But an important part may be related to the large growth in beneficia-
ries of disability and food-stamp programs. Bulges in their enrollments appear to be highly
persistent. Both programs place high taxes on earnings and so discourage labor-force partic-
ipation among beneficiaries. The bulge in program dependence is a state variable arguably
resulting from the crisis that may impede output and employment growth for some years
into the future.

    Appendix

A      Calculations in Table 1
The calculations embody the basic identity:

       Output growth = productivity growth + capital contribution+labor contribution.

In turn,

             capital contribution = capital share × change in log per capita input

and

                  labor contribution = labor share × change in log labor input.

Finally,

                     Change in log labor input = change in log population
              + change in log participation rate + change in log employment rate
                 + change in log hours per week + change in log labor quality
                      + change in log of business fraction of labor input.

    I do these calculations first for a counterfactual situation where the growth rates are equal
to pre-crisis trends and second for the actual experience. The table shows the differences
between the two calculations, interpreted as the post-crisis shortfall. I use the actual shares
for the counterfactual calculations. Data sources and details of the calculations appear in a
spreadsheet in the backup materials for the paper at stanford.edu/∼rehall .
    The unemployment rate in 2007, at 4.6 percent, was 1.2 percentage points below the
value I use as normal, 5.8 percent (the average from 1948 through 2013). The calculations
in the table treat the counterfactual unemployment rates in 2010 and 2013 as 4.6 percent,
although unemployment is mean-reverting to its normal level.


B      Related Research
Congressional Budget Office (2014) describes the agency’s updates of its estimates of poten-
tial output since 2007. Although the focus of the study is on all changes, the document gives
some indications of the CBO’s views about the effect of the crisis on potential output. In

                                               52
2007, the last year of the estimate was 2017. As a result of all changes, the CBO’s 2014 esti-
mate of potential GDP in 2017, adjusted for intervening changes in the NIPAs, is 7.3 percent
below its estimate for the same year, made in 2007. The CBO breaks down the 7.3 percent
into four categories, of which two, recession and weak recovery and reassessment of trends
account for the bulk, 1.8 and 4.8 percentage points, respectively. The CBO explains that
severe recessions following financial crises “...dampen investment, raise the rate and average
duration of unemployment, and reduce the number of hours that people work,” and thus cut
potential output. The CBO concludes that the unemployment rate will be 0.5 percentage
points higher than normal and the labor-force participation rate 0.4 percentage points lower
than normal in 2017 because of lingering effects of the crisis in the labor market. The effect
on potential output is 0.7 percentage points. The estimated reduction in 2017 potential
output from lost investment on account of the crisis and recession is 0.6 percent and the
reduction from lost productivity growth (taken to be a permanent effect) is 0.5 percentage
points.
   All of these effects of the crisis as of 2017 are smaller—especially the effect of lost
investment—than those in this paper, in Table 1, for 2013. The combined loss of out-
put from investment, labor-force participation, and TFP is 10.9 percentage points. Though
the effects of investment and participation will decline somewhat over four years, the total
in this paper is obviously much larger than the CBO estimates.
   The second major category in the CBO study is reassessment of trends, which accounts
for 4.8 percentage points of decline in 2017 potential output. The CBO explains “...although
already in progress before the business cycle peaked in 2007, did not become apparent until
after that peak had been identified.” With the NBER’s determination of a peak at the end
of 2007 and other changes in CBO’s trend-measurement techniques, the rapid growth of the
1990s became less influential and the slower growth from 2000 through 2007 correspondingly
more influential in later CBO projections. The change in the CBO’s projections of total
labor input to the business sector accounted for a decline of 3.0 percentage points in 2017
potential output. Lower investment and lower TFP growth each accounted for 0.7 percentage
points of decline in 2017 potential output.
   By far the most important difference between CBO’s analysis and mine is the tiny role
CBO assigns to the shortfall in capital, which I find accounts for 5.0 percentage points of
output shortfall in 2013 while the CBO assigns it 1.3 percentage points in 2016. The CBO



                                              53
splits this into 0.6 percentage points from the crisis and 0.7 points from their reassessment of
trends. For other components of the shortfall, the CBO’s estimates are roughly in agreement
with mine. For TFP, the CBO has a total effect of 1.2 percentage points compared to my
3.4 points, but I do not take much of a stand on how much of the 3.4 point shortfall resulted
from the crisis. For labor input, CBO assigns 0.7 percentage points to the crisis, mostly in
reduced labor-force participation, but 3.0 percentage points to a declining trend that began
before the crisis. The total is comparable to my findings, but I assign somewhat more to the
crisis.

B.1       Unemployment
Ravn and Sterk (2012) develop a model with two types of unemployment and a changing
mix depending on driving forces. In normal times, much of the flow into unemployment
comprises workers whose terminations lead to easy placement in new jobs, but, following a
major uncertainty shock, the mix shifts towards those who are much harder to place. These
shocks result in large increases in unemployment. The model accounts for the declining
measured matching efficiency.

B.2       Labor-force Participation
Erceg and Levin (2013) conclude that the shortfall of labor-force participation from its pre-
crisis trend was about two percentage points, in line with the findings here. They measure
the trend as the BLS’s forecast made in November 2007. They make the case that the
shortfall was the result of a slack labor market. They use a regression of state-level changes
in the LFPR between 2007 and 2012 on the changes in the unemployment rate between 2007
and 2010. They use the longer span for the LFPR based on evidence that historically the
rate has had inertia relative to the unemployment rate. A variety of specifications agree
that the coefficient is −0.3 with a standard error of 0.1. Given a 5-percentage point increase
in the unemployment rate post-crisis, the coefficient implies a decline in the LFPR of 1.5
percentage points. The authors conclude, “...the state-level data indicates that the aggregate
decline in prime-age LFPR since 2007 can be fully explained by the persistent shortfall in
labor demand.” (emphasis in original, p. 15). They do not take a stand on the size of the
decline in the trend-adjusted prime-age LFPR other than calling it “nearly two percentage
points” (p. 12).


                                              54
    The standard error of the estimate of 5 times the coefficient is 0.5 percentage points, so the
95-percent confidence interval for the part of the decline attributable to rising unemployment
is [1.5 − 2 × 0.5, 1.5 − 2 × 0.5] = [0.5, 2.5], so the evidence is consistent with a rather smaller
role of unemployment and with a role so large as to over-explain the decline in the LFPR.
    In Table 7, the line for marginal and discouraged individuals, at 0.5 percentage points of
reduction in the LFPR, is explicitly a result of a slack labor market. Some part of the last
line, the residual, may also be a result of slack. Thus the results in this paper are within
the confidence interval, but probably near its lower boundary and therefore inconsistent the
Erceg and Levin’s estimate at a lower confidence level.
    The authors also estimate that the rise Social-Security disability dependence above its
trend is 0.4 percentage points, the same as in Table 7.
    With respect to the prime-age individuals whom the authors believe withdrew from the
labor market for reasons other than disability, the authors write, “Evidently, the remainder
represents roughly a million individuals who have given up searching for a job and instead
are engaged in other activities such as child care, home renovation projects, etc.” (p. 19) I
believe this statement is mistaken for two reasons. First, there is evidence that the rise in
non-participation has added mostly to the groups who are engaging in job search at a low
level, but will ultimately find jobs, or will begin search fairly soon. Their number is swollen
by low current success rates for search. Second, the evidence on time use shows little increase
in home production in slack labor markets—leisure activities tend to absorb the extra time.
    Autor (2011) is a recent and complete discussion of Social-Security disability and the
reasons for the expansion of dependence relative to the health of the labor force. Hanel
(2012) finds substantial reductions in labor supply from the implicit taxation of earnings in
the German disability program.
    Congressional Budget Office (2012) is an extensive discussion of the economics of food
stamps, including forecasts of gradually declining dependence after 2012. Ganong and Lieb-
man (2013) decompose the recent growth of food-stamp beneficiaries into a large component
associated with slack labor market and a smaller component associated with expanded eli-
gibility.
    Baicker, Finkelstein, Song and Taubman (2013) rule out the possibility that access to
Medicaid depresses labor-force participation by more than a small amount and show that
zero effect is consistent with the results of a random-assignment experiment.



                                                55
   Mulligan (2012a), Figure 2, describes his calculations of eligibility for three major safety-
net programs: During the period from 2007 through 2011, he finds no change in eligibility
standards for Medicaid and large extensions for food stamps and UI benefits.
   Bitler and Hoynes (2013) present evidence that the expansion of safety-net dependence
after 2007 was comparable to expansions in previous slumps, given adjustments for the
magnitudes of the slumps.
   Mueller, Rothstein and von Wachter (2013) study the relation between UI benefits and
Social-Security disability claims. They reject the possibility that individuals move in mean-
ingful numbers from UI to disability programs when UI benefits expire.
   Hotchkiss, Pitts and Rios-Avila (2012) finds non-work activities identified as “school”
and “other” grew during the period of decline in labor-force participation. They conclude
that these are probably temporary and, as they return to normal, participation will rise.
   Elsby, Hobijn and Şahin (2013) show the importance of studying the gross flows of in-
dividuals among employment, search, and out-of-labor-force, in understanding fluctuations
in participation. They present evidence of the heterogeneity of those classified as out of the
labor force—the distribution of the job-finding hazard ranges from zero to levels similar to
those classified as unemployed. Krusell, Mukoyama, Rogerson and Şahin (2012) construct a
model with explicit treatment of the flows among the three activities.
