                                          ABSTRACT

Over the last few years, marijuana has become legally available for recreational use to roughly a
quarter of Americans. Policy makers have long expressed concerns about the substantial external
costs of alcohol, and similar costs could come with the liberalization of marijuana policy. Indeed,
the fraction of fatal accidents in which at least one driver tested positive for THC has increased
nationwide by an average of 10 percent from 2013 to 2016. For Colorado and Washington, both
of which legalized marijuana in 2014, these increases were 92 percent and 28 percent,
respectively. However, identifying a causal effect is difficult due to the presence of significant
confounding factors. We test for a causal effect of marijuana legalization on traffic fatalities in
Colorado and Washington with a synthetic control approach using records on fatal traffic
accidents from 2000-2016. We find the synthetic control groups saw similar changes in
marijuana-related, alcohol-related and overall traffic fatality rates despite not legalizing
recreational marijuana.

1       Introduction

The landscape of marijuana regulation is changing rapidly. Marijuana is or will soon be

legal for recreational use for a quarter of the United States population, and several countries

worldwide have legalized marijuana in some form. Though legalization has reached record

levels of popular support, significant opposition remains. The potential for an increase in

traffic fatalities caused by impaired drivers remains at the forefront of the debate among pol-

icy makers and in the media (Aaronson, 2017; Guion and Higgs, 2018; Leblanc, 2018; Elliot,

2018). Indeed, initial reports have identified significant increases in collision frequencies in

Colorado, Washington, and Oregon after marijuana markets opened in those states (Highway

Loss Data Institute, 2017), as well as increases in the nominal number of drivers involved in

fatal crashes who test positive for marijuana—also referred to as marijuana-related fatalities

(Migoya, 2017).1

    Researchers across disciplines have responded to this public interest. Several authors

have examined trends in traffic fatalities in individual states following various liberaliza-

tions in marijuana policy and have generally found increases in the rates of THC-positive

drivers (Salomonsen-Sautel et al., 2014; Pollini et al., 2015; Aydelotte et al., 2017). How-

ever, throughout this literature, researchers have faced a consistent set of methodological

challenges. Contemporaneous trends in the state-level price of, and demand for, intoxicat-

ing substances make it difficult to find a clean event study. Achieving identification with

a differences-in-differences approach is hampered by state-level variation in reporting prac-

    1
     Note that, unlike alcohol, the link between particular levels of THC in the bloodstream and increases
in the risk of fatal traffic accidents has not yet been precisely determined (Bondallaz et al., 2017). We follow
the existing literature and media coverage by using the term “marijuana-related fatalities” while noting that
“marijuana-related” does not mean “marijuana-caused.”

                                                       1
tices, regional-level variation in preferences for substance consumption, and spillover effects

of legalization efforts (Hansen et al., 2017a) – all of which make choosing an appropriate

control group a priori difficult (Romano et al., 2017).

   We resolve these challenges by using a synthetic control approach. We create a control

group by choosing weights for states which have not legalized marijuana to match moments

of key variables in the pre-legalization period including testing rates for drugs and alcohol,

trends in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), urbanicity, macroeconomic conditions, and pre-

treatment trends of our outcome variables. We analyze our treated states relative to their

synthetic controls in the post period to estimate the causal impact of legalizing marijuana

for recreational use on traffic fatalities.

   We find that states that legalized marijuana have not experienced significantly different

rates of marijuana- or alcohol-related traffic fatalities relative to their synthetic controls. To

ensure our results are not driven by an idiosyncratic selection of control weights, we show

that we obtain similar results across reasonable variations in the pre-period specification used

to created the weights that generate the synthetic control counter-factual. In addition to

examining fatalities identified by states as drug- or alcohol-related, we also look for changes

in the overall fatality rate to avoid state-level differences in classification (as opposed to

state-level differences in testing) and find a similar null result.

   We proceed in Section 2 with a brief summary of the history of marijuana policy in the

United States and the existing research on the risks of impaired driving. In Section 3, we

discuss the Fatal Analysis and Reporting System data and our synthetic control approach.

We present our results in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5 with a discussion of the policy

implications of our findings.

2        Background

2.1        The legal status of marijuana

Marijuana was legal in the United States until the passage of the Marijuana Taxation Act

of 1938 – though many states had banned the substance earlier (Sanna, 2014, p. 88). The

Controlled Substances Act of 1970 significantly strengthened the prohibition of marijuana:

the substance was classified as a Schedule I drug with a ‘high potential for abuse and little

known medical benefit.’2

    Public attitudes about marijuana consumption have become more favorable over the past

century, particularly shifting towards support for medical uses of the substance. In 1973,

Oregon became the first state to decriminalize marijuana possession, though cultivation

and distribution of the drug remained felony offenses. A number of ballot initiatives and

legislative efforts across states culminated with California voting to legalize marijuana for

medical use (so-called “medical marijuana”) in 1996. The other west coast states, Oregon

and Washington, followed suit in 1998. Today, 27 states and regions permit broad forms of

medical marijuana, despite the continued nominal prohibition at the federal level. Indeed,

in 2009, the Department of Justice responded to changes in state laws and public opinion

by declaring that “federal resources in States [with medical marijuana laws]” should not be

focused “on individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with [those

laws]” (Ogden, 2009, p.2).

    The liberalization of marijuana policy reached another milestone in 2012, when voters in

Washington and Colorado approved ballot initiatives which explicitly legalized the produc-

    2
        Other Schedule I substances include heroin and methamphetamine.

                                                    3
tion and consumption of marijuana for recreational use (recreational marijuana). Alaska and

Oregon followed suit with similar ballot measures in 2014, and California, Nevada, Maine,

and Massachusetts legalized marijuana with ballot measures in 2016. In 2018, Vermont

became the first state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana via legislative action.

Figure 1 illustrates the current legal status of marijuana by state.

   In 2013, during the implementation of Colorado and Washington’s legalization initiatives,

the Department of Justice responded to the Washington and Colorado efforts by providing

enforcement guidance to U.S. Attorneys in the form of specific priorities (Cole, 2013). One

major priority was “preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public

health consequences associated with marijuana use.”3 States have responded by bolstering

efforts to monitor and prevent marijuana-impaired driving (Rocky Mountain High Intensity

Drug Trafficking Area, 2017; Hillstrom, 2018).



2.2     Research on impaired driving

Given that traffic accidents are a leading cause of death in the United States, there has been

considerable interest in understanding the relationship between various intoxicants, including

marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs, and driving performance, accidents, and fatalities. A

number of interdisciplinary efforts have studied the risks of intoxicated driving using a variety

of approaches, which we outline in this section.

   One approach examines impaired driving in a laboratory setting by putting intoxicated

subjects into driving simulators and comparing their performance to the performance of
   3
     Another key priority was “preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under
state law in some form to other states.” Hansen et al. (2017a) study this question by examining the change
in sales along the Washington-Oregon border when Oregon’s market opened, and conclude that roughly 7%
of marijuana grown in Washington was trafficked out-of-state before Oregon’s retailers opened.

                                                    4
sober subjects under a variety of traffic and road conditions (Smiley et al., 1981; Liguori

et al., 1998). Due to the Schedule I status of marijuana in the U.S., this approach has

been used most often in Europe (Veldstra et al., 2015). Bondallaz et al. (2017) review this

literature and find that marijuana use impairs driving primarily by increasing lane weaving

and decreasing the mean distance between vehicles. However, they also find significant dis-

crepancies between studies and note that the “the neurobiological mechanisms underlying

the effects... remain poorly understood, as does the correlation between body fluids concen-

trations and psychoactive effects of THC.” Hostiuc et al. (2018) performed a meta-analysis

of epidemiological studies of marijuana consumption and driving performance and found a

statistically insignificant effect size and substantial publication bias.

   Another series of studies uses roadside surveys to estimate the proportion of drivers who

are intoxicated with various substances. These efforts are often sponsored by law enforcement

agencies or other government bodies due to the expense involved. For example, the National

Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States has conducted several

national surveys of weekend nighttime drivers, with the most recent survey conducted from

2013-2014 (Burning et al., 2015). The results show that the percentage of drivers with

non-zero blood-alcohol levels has decreased, while the percentage of drivers with THC in

their blood has increased. NHTSA also conducted a “crash risk” study in which data was

collected from 3,000 crash-involved drivers and 6,000 control drivers selected by location,

time of day, and direction of travel (Compton et al., 2015). They conclude that the presence

of any THC in the bloodstream leads to a 25% increase in the probability of a crash of any

severity. Taken together, these results suggest that concerns about increases in fatalities as

a consequence of marijuana liberalization are well-founded, but cannot demonstrate a causal

                                                5
effect themselves.

   A third line of research uses the well-known differences-in-differences approach to study

the impact of particular laws on fatalities by analyzing crash data collected by the federal

and state governments. In addition to those efforts mentioned previously, Anderson et al.

(2013) studied the impact of medical marijuana laws and found that such laws led to de-

creases in traffic fatalities. Their results were replicated with additional years of data in

2017 (Santaella-Tenorio et al., 2017). Hansen (2015) provides evidence with a regression

discontinuity design (derived from BAC legal limits) that harsher punishments are effective

in reducing drunk driving, though Anderson and Rees (2015) studied per se drugged driving

laws and found that such laws do not lead to decreases in fatalities.

   A final approach, introduced by Levitt and Porter (2001), takes advantage of the fact

that fatal crashes typically involve multiple vehicles. By examining the relative frequency of

accidents involving drivers of different types (i.e. intoxicated and sober), one can separately

identify the fraction of drivers who are of different types and the relative risks of causing

a fatal accident. Levitt and Porter focused on alcohol intoxication and found that drivers

with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.10 or higher are 13 times more likely to be the cause

of fatal accidents. However, this approach has been difficult to adapt to the question of

marijuana-related accidents due to the variation in testing standards across states and the

poorly understood relationship between THC blood test results and driving behaviors.




                                              6
3     Data and Methodology

To study the relation between recreational marijuana and traffic fatalities, we obtain data

from the Fatal Analysis and Reporting System (FARS), which is a system maintained by

the federal government that records every fatal car accident in the United States. For each

accident reported, the system records information on the circumstances, total injuries and

fatalities, and demographics of the drivers. Each entry in the system also includes additional

reports on the results from tests for illegal drugs and alcohol, if such tests occurred.

    We obtain FARS data from 2000-2016 and construct a state level panel of several key

variables to measure the impacts of recreational marijuana legalization on traffic fatalities.

We focus on six outcomes. The first is the fraction of fatal accidents that involve at least

one driver with a positive drug test for marijuana, which we refer to as marijuana-related

fatalities. We also examine the fraction of fatal accidents that involve at least one driver

with a positive alcohol test, which we refer to as alcohol-related fatalities. As accidents are

related to the overall amount of traffic in a region, we construct the total marijuana-related

fatalities per billion VMT and the total alcohol-related fatalities per billion VMT to test

whether legalizing recreational marijuana creates spillover effects for drunk driving. Lastly,

in part because test rates vary from 40-60 percent for drugs and alcohol in most states, we

also estimate the impact of recreational marijuana laws on the total number of fatalities per

billion VMT and the fraction of deaths that are “sober” (i.e. those in which none of the

drivers test positive for marijuana or alcohol).

    Four states—Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska—legalized recreational mari-

juana before 2016, which is the last year currently covered by FARS. As discussed in Sec-


                                               7
tion 2, Washington and Colorado voted to legalize in 2012 and recreational marijuana re-

tailers in those states began operation in 2014. Alaska and Oregon voted to legalize in 2014

and retail operations in those states began in 2015. Because FARS only provides a year of

post-legalization data for Alaska and Oregon, we focus on Colorado and Washington as our

treated states.4

    Figures 2, 3, and 4 plot the trend of each of our outcomes separately for Washington,

Colorado, and all other states (excluding Oregon and Alaska). The data that drive the

results of previous research efforts immediately jump out: marijuana-related deaths go up

significantly in both Washington and Colorado after marijuana is legalized in 2012 and these

deaths are going up much faster than in the rest of the United States. However, finding

appropriate control groups for states such as Washington and Colorado is difficult. Figures

2, 3, and 4 highlight that using the rest of the United States as a comparison group is highly

suspect as the outcomes for Washington and Colorado do not move closely with the rest of

the United States, nor do they even move closely with each other (i.e. parallel trends do

not hold). Moreover, if we were to narrow the comparison group down, many of Colorado’s

neighbors have different levels and trends of drunk and high driving. And, while Oregon

might seem like a natural counterfactual for Washington, Oregon legalized shortly after

Washington. Furthermore, recent evidence from Hansen et al. (2017a) suggests inter-state

spill-overs would prevent nearby states from serving as reasonable control groups.

    To address this concern, we turn to a synthetic control approach inspired by Abadie

et al. (2010). The approach uses state-level data to create a counter-factual group that can
   4
      Furthermore, Oregon passed legislation in 2015 which substantially increased speed limits on many of
its freeways. Higher speeds are associated with increased traffic fatalities, which would bias any estimates
examining the effect of recreational marijuana legalization in Oregon upwards (Ashenfelter and Greenstone,
2004; van Benthem, 2015; DeAngelo and Hansen, 2014).

resemble both the averages and trajectories of treated units experiencing a change a discrete

change in policy. This approach has been used to study a wide variety of policy changes in-

cluding the decriminalization of prostitution (Cunningham and Shah, ming), highway police

budget cuts (DeAngelo and Hansen, 2014), minimum wage increases (Jardim et al., 2017),

and economic liberalization (Billmeier and Nannicini, 2013).

    Consider a setting with Yit where i represents a unit, such as a state, and t represents a

time period, such as a year. The estimator estimates the impact of a treatment for unit i in
                                        PS
time period t by estimating Yit −          j6=i   Yjt Wj , where Wj is a weight for unit j. While any

potential weighted average of control units is a synthetic control, the standard approach is

to choose weights based on minimizing the distance of selected variables between the treated

unit and the potential synthetic control units. For each of our exercise, we create a synthetic

control with the lagged values of the dependent variable from 2000-2013 (in two year bins),

local economic conditions as measured by the unemployment rate, alcohol and marijuana

testing rates, VMT5 , and the fraction of VMT driven on urban as opposed to rural roads.

    To conduct hypothesis tests, we use the placebo based inference approach suggested

by Abadie et al. (2010). We estimate the same synthetic control design model for every

placebo state. We then compare the ratio of the mean squared error ( PPostM SP E
                                                                       reM SP E
                                                                                 ) of the

actual values less the synthetic control predictions for the actual treated units (Colorado

and Washington) to the distribution of the placebo units. The ranking of the treated units

relative to the placebo units for those ratios provides an empirical p-value as a permutation

based test.

    Given that the onset of the great recession was accompanied by a simultaneous drop in VMT, we match
on VMT flexibly. We include an average over the years 2000-2007 (pre-recession), 2008-2010 (the recession),
and 2011-2013(post recession).

4     Results

4.1    Marijuana-related fatalities

Figure 5 illustrates the prevalence of marijuana-related fatalities in Colorado and its synthetic

counterpart from 2000-2016. Panel (a) of the figure illustrates the fraction of accidents that

are marijuana-related while Panel (b) illustrates the number of marijuana-related traffic

fatalities per billion VMT. Over the 14 year window from 2000-2013 (prior to Colorado’s

legalization), the trends and levels of synthetic group closely mirrors Colorado’s. In the

period following legalization, the synthetic region still tracks Colorado’s. This suggests that

the upward trend in marijuana-related fatalities in Colorado would have taken place whether

or not recreational marijuana was legalized. The point estimates corresponding with the

Figure are in Table 6, with permutation based p-values in the brackets. The permutation

tests suggest that the small deviations we observe in the data are likely due to noise, and

there is little evidence supporting a causal interpretation. Panels (c) and (d) of Figure 5

visually illustrate the statistical precision of the synthetic control estimates. The solid black

lines represent the difference between Colorado and its synthetic counterpart. The black line

hovers around zero both before and after legalization. Moreover, the slight increase apparent

for high fatalities per billion VMT is well within the deviations we see in the post period for

placebo states.

    We repeat the analysis for Washington in Figure 6. Panel (a) illustrates a consistent

upward trend in the fraction of fatal accidents involving marijuana, although Washington

displays more volatility than Colorado. The synthetic control for Washington shows a similar

trend prior to legalization and, although it dips relative to Washington in 2014, similar levels

                                               10
in 2015 and 2016. In Panel (b), the synthetic counterpart struggles to match the overall

levels and trends of Washington during the pre-treatment period. While the trend of the

synthetic control is similar to Washington’s overall trend upward and then back down before

legalization, Washington’s data are volatile and the overall fit is relatively poor compared to

Colorado’s. For this reason, despite a somewhat sizable percentage increase in high traffic

fatalities per VMT, the placebo-based p-value seen in Table 6 is still 0.404, and indeed

as shown in Panel (d), many placebo units had more volatility in the post period than

Washington. Furthermore, most of Washington’s estimated average increase in the fraction

of fatalities that are marijuana-related is driven by a large increase in 2014. Notably, in this

year marijuana sales were only 3,991 pounds in Washington, while they increased to 66,390

pounds in 2015 and 179,301 pounds in 2016. So while recreational sales were increasing

over those years, the synthetic unit caught up with and more closely tracked Washington’s

marijuana-related traffic fatalities during the same period.

   Our synthetic control estimates suggest that marijuana-related fatalities increased in

states without recreational legalization. So while marijuana-related fatalities per billion

VMT went up by more than 60 percent in the years after legalization, our point estimates

suggest that only 45 to 60 percent of this increase is caused by the legalization of marijuana—

though the effect is not statistically distinguishable from zero. While these synthetic control

analyses do not provide compelling evidence that marijuana-related fatalities rose, it could

be that other types of fatal accidents shifted.




                                              11
4.2    Alcohol-related fatalities

Researchers have long debated the potential substitutability or complementarity between

alcohol and marijuana (Miller and Seo, 2018). Indeed a naive examination of drunk related

deaths in Colorado and Washington would lead to the conclusion that fraction of deaths that

involve alcohol fell by roughly 10 percentage points in Colorado and Washington after legal-

ization. With that in mind, we turn to examining alcohol-related fatalities in Washington

and Colorado.

   Figure 7 plots alcohol-related traffic fatality data for Colorado and its synthetic coun-

terpart from 2000-2016. Panel (a) of the figure illustrates the fraction of all fatalities that

are alcohol-related while Panel (b) depicts alcohol related traffic fatalities per billion VMT.

The trends and levels of synthetic group closely follows Colorado’s for the years leading into

marijuana legalization. While the fraction of accidents that are alcohol related drops after

Colorado’s legalization, a similar drop is predicted for Colorado’s synthetic counterpart. Ta-

ble 2 contains the point estimates and the permutation-based p-values in the brackets. The

permutation tests also suggests that the small deviations we estimate are more likely due to

noise, and there is little evidence supporting an actual causal deviation. Panels (c) and (d) of

Figure 7 illustrate the precision of the synthetic control estimates. Similar to the figures for

high driving, the solid black lines represent the difference between Colorado and its synthetic

counterpart. The black line hovers around zero both before and after legalization. Moreover,

the deviations for either measure of alcohol related fatalities is well within the deviations we

see in the post period for placebo states.

   The analogous analysis for Washington is shown in Figure 8. The synthetic control



                                              12
approach performs admirably in matching the trends and levels of the fraction of accidents

that are alcohol related in Panel (a). In Panel (b), the synthetic control for Washington

matches both the levels and the time trends. While there is a gap between Washington and

its synthetic control during the post period, the gap develops a few years earlier. If we were

to take it at face value, it has almost equal magnitude (with opposite sign) to the increase

in high related traffic fatalities based on the point estimates in Tables 6 and 2 (0.389 and

-.0479 traffic fatalities per billion VMT). The p-values for both the fraction of fatalities that

are alcohol-related and alcohol-related fatalities per VMT indicate that we cannot reject the

null hypothesis that legalization caused no changes. As with the Colorado exercise, the plots

in Panels (c) and (d) suggest that model fit for the treated states did not deviate sharply

after treatment began.



4.3    Overall Fatalities

Our analyses of marijuana- and alcohol-related fatalities provide little evidence to support

the hypothesis that recreational marijuana laws increase traffic fatalities. However, several

confounding factors remain. Despite our efforts to adjust for differences in testing rates, it

could be the case that fatality measures could shift in response to changes in testing regimes

purely as a reporting effect. If this were the case, we would expect as testing for marijuana-

related fatalities rises, sober fatalities fall. Whatever the testing regime, many individuals in

traffic accidents are never tested for drugs or alcohol, so it could be the case that individuals

involved in a fatal crash are impaired by substances but our prior measures would fail to

capture that impairment.



                                               13
   At the same time, many individuals who test positive for marijuana may not be impaired

at the time of driving even if they test positive for THC or cannabinoids as those chemicals

persist in the bloodstream for days after use (Odell et al., 2015).6 For this reason, we might

expect to see marijuana-related fatalities increasing due to an increasing prevalence of use—

use which may or may not be associated with risky driving behaviors. Indeed, in Figure 9,

we compare fatal accident rates at different times of day across marijuana-related, alcohol-

related, and substance-free accidents. Alcohol-related fatalities follow a distinct temporal

pattern with most accidents occurring in the evening. Accidents without marijuana or alcohol

show a time of day pattern consistent with commuting times, with increase in the morning

and in the late afternoon and early evening. Marijuana related fatalities show a time of day

pattern that more closely resembles sober driving. While there are more early morning fatal

accidents, this hourly distribution is actually what one might expect if marijuana-related

fatalities are driven by a latent mixture of drivers who are truly impaired by marijuana

(who have a similar time-of-day pattern to drunk drivers), and drivers who test positive

for marijuana but who are actually sober at the time of the accident (who have similar a

time-of-day pattern to sober drivers).

   As a consequence, we now focus on the overall traffic fatality rate and the rate of sober

fatalities (those not involving the presence of either alcohol or marijuana). Indeed, despite

our high p-values, given that we tested multiple hypotheses in the previous section, one

natural solution to multiple hypothesis testing is aggregation. Lastly, analyzing the total

number of fatalities informs us about the net impact of legalization including any substitution

or complementary effects that may exist.

   Figure 10 contains plots for overall traffic fatalities and sober driving in Colorado and

its synthetic counterpart from 2000-2016. Panel (a) of the figure focuses on the fraction

of “sober” accidents – those that do not involve alcohol or marijuana – and Panel (b)

illustrates total traffic fatalities per million VMT. Over the window from 2000-2013, prior

to legalization in Colorado, the trends and levels of the synthetic group closely mirrors

Colorado’s, particularly for overall traffic fatalities. The same is true for the fraction of fatal

accidents that are sober. In the period following legalization, the synthetic region shows a

slight up-tick, as does Colorado. This suggests that the overall slight upward trend in traffic

fatalities per VMT would have been expected in the absence of legalization. The point

estimates corresponding with Figure 10 are in Table 3, with permutation based p-values in

the brackets. The permutation tests also suggests that the small deviations we estimate are

more likely due to noise, and there is little evidence supporting an actual causal deviation.

Panels (c) and (d) of the figure illustrate the relative statistical precision of the synthetic

control estimates. The solid black lines represent the difference between Colorado and its

synthetic counterpart, while the light grey lines are difference between the placebo states

and their synthetic counterparts The black line hovers around zero both before and after

legalization. Moreover, the slight increase apparent for high fatalities per billion VMT is

well within the deviations we see in the post period for placebo states. Indeed even if we

were to take the point estimate at face value, it would suggest traffic fatalities per billion

VMT in Colorado have increased by a little over 3 percent. However the placebo derived

p-value would suggest the we fail to reject the null hypothesis that this effect is zero.

   The analogous plots for Washington are depicted in Figure 11. As shown in Panel (a),

                                                15
the trend of fraction of fatalities that are sober is relative stable leading in to marijuana le-

galization. While it increases by roughly 10 percentage points in 2014, the synthetic control

shows a similar jump. The total fatalities per VMT shown in Panel (b) fall fairly sharply

from 2000 to 2010, and then level out for the remain years leading into legalization. Wash-

ington’s synthetic control unit shows a very similar pattern and trend. After legalization,

Washington’s fatalities rise, and the synthetic counterpart also shows a notable increase.

The point estimate in Table 3 suggest that on average traffic fatalities per billion VMT in

WA rose by 8.4 percent. However the p-value of .340 suggests we again fail to reject the null

hypothesis that there was no effect of legalization. Likewise the model fits in Panels (c) and

(d) suggest that difference between Washington and its synthetic control group was typically

nearly the center of distribution provided by the placebo models. Furthermore, the average

8.4 percent increase is largely driven by 2015 alone. This might be more likely due to noise,

when we consider the growth of the recreational marijuana market. Indeed, total sales of

marijuana more than doubled in 2016, and yet the synthetic control group and Washington

converged rather than diverging as the recreational market grew.

   In summary, the similar trajectory of traffic fatalities in Washington and Colorado relative

to their synthetic control counterparts yield little evidence that the total rate of traffic

fatalities has increased significantly as a consequence of recreational marijuana legalization.



4.4    Robustness

Our estimates yield little evidence to support the notion that the legalization of recreational

marijuana caused traffic fatalities to double, as has been suggested in the media (Migoya,



                                               16
2017). However, we made several model choices which could have influenced the results.

In this section, we measure the sensitivity of our estimates to these choices by replicating

Tables 1, 2, and 3 under a different set of choices we could have reasonably made.

   In the earlier analyses we assumed treatment began in 2014, which is when retail stores

began selling recreational marijuana in both Colorado and Washington. However, the ballot

measures in both states passed in 2012 and immediately legalized possession and consump-

tion of small amounts of the substance, which may have lead individuals to increase their

consumption of black market or medical marijuana at that time. In other words, a case could

be made that treatment truly began in 2012 rather than later in 2014. As shown in the first

panel of Table 4, the estimated impact on the fraction of fatal accidents involving marijuana

remains relatively unchanged in both Colorado and Washington, with p-values that remain

insignificant. Likewise the marijuana-related fatalities per VMT remain effectively constant

in Colorado, and fall to -0.086, or roughly a 10 percent decrease (as opposed to the original

25 percent increase). However this estimate remains insignificant, and should be viewed as

additional evidence that the earlier estimates may indeed be more consistent with a null

effect. In the first panel of Tables 5 and 6 we report estimates for alcohol-related and overall

traffic fatalities, respectively. Broadly, we find similar estimates with large p-values, suggest-

ing that even if we consider treatment as beginning in 2012, recreational marijuana has had

a limited impact on drunk driving and overall traffic fatalities in both states.

   Our primary specifications allow all states other than Washington and Colorado to enter

the synthetic control.7 However, legalization in one state may lead to substantial spill-over

effects in bordering states due to the opportunity for trafficking Hansen et al. (2017a). In

   7
       Oregon and Alaska were also excluded as they legalized marijuana in 2015.

                                                     17
the second panel of Tables 4, 5, and 6 we replicate the analyses of Tables 1, 2, and 3 while

excluding any states that share a border with any state that legalized recreational marijuana

prior to the end of the post period. This includes California, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, New

Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. This does have potential to affect our

estimates as some of these states received positive weight as seen in Appendix Tables 1-4.

However, we find similar point estimates and p-values for marijuana-related fatalities, as

shown in Table 4. Likewise, the point estimates with this restricted synthetic control set are

similar for both alcohol-related and overall traffic fatalities.

   Another potential concern could be how sensitive the synthetic control models are to the

inclusion of predetermined factors such as economic conditions, VMT, and the marijuana

and alcohol testing rates. Including these may seem reasonable, but at the same time, these

variables do not share the same importance as predetermined lagged values of the dependent

variable in predicting the outcome variables. In the third panel of Tables 4,5, and 6, the

point estimates reported reflect models where only predetermined variables were used to

select the synthetic control group. For most outcomes, the p-values grew marginally larger.

Moreover in some instances the estimated average impact shrunk while in other cases in

grew. The estimates were of similar magnitude in most cases, and in all case the p-values

remained statistically insignificant.

   Lastly, another concern could be the suitability of states adopting medical marijuana as

control groups for Colorado and Washington. On one hand, because Colorado and Wash-

ington had medical marijuana to begin with, they might be the most natural comparison

group. On the other hand, perhaps states that adopted medical marijuana close to the time

Colorado and Washington legalized could see their own surge in marijuana use. With this

                                                18
in mind, in the final panel of Tables 4, 5, and 6, we exclude any states that adopt a medical

marijuana policy between 2012 and 2016. Generally the estimates are similar qualitatively,

as some get a bit larger while others are smaller. Moreover, the p-values are consistently in-

significant, suggesting again that the relative changes Colorado and Washington experience

are within the expectations for any state which did not change marijuana policy.




5     Policy Implications and Conclusions

The broad trend towards the legalization of marijuana has led to a high degree of interest

in social, economic, and public health consequences, both positive and negative. Faced

with a steep increase in the fraction of traffic fatalities in which at least one driver tested

positive for marijuana, the media and researchers alike have been eager to sound the alarm

about this potentially dangerous side effect of the policy (Chen, 2016; Banta-Green et al.,

2016; Migoya, 2017; Krieger, 2017). However, these early reports of steep increases are

confounded by a number of factors. We contribute to this discussion by using a synthetic

control method to compare the outcomes in Washington and Colorado to other states with

similar pre-legalization economic and traffic trends. We find the synthetic control groups

saw similar increases despite not legalizing marijuana. Moreover, the p-values suggest that

the deviations Colorado and Washington did show from their synthetic counterparts are well

with the range of deviations seen due to year to year variation.

    Several mechanisms may be driving these results. The amount of marijuana sold in

recreational stores has grown dramatically, increasing from 3,991 pounds in Washington in

2014 to 179,301 pounds in 2017, while in Colorado it grew from 36,031 pounds in 2014


                                              19
to 102,871 pounds in 2016. However, it is difficult to discern how much of this growth in

legal recreational weed came at the expense of sales in black market or medical marijuana.

Indeed recreational marijuana can be viewed as a close substitute to black market or medical

marijuana, with differences in price, quality, and ease of access. The relatively small effects

we estimate are consistent with crowding-out, and could explain why we don’t observe spill-

over effects on alcohol-related traffic accidents as other studies have found (Anderson et al.,

2013). Furthermore, Colorado has recently allowed consumption of marijuana in public

spaces. This might increase the potential for negative externalities of recreational marijuana

relative to medical marijuana. Despite that concern, we find limited overall evidence the

fatalities are significantly increasing in Colorado and Washington following the legalization

of recreational marijuana.

   These results also inform optimal tax policy due to the potential externalities associated

with marijuana (Hansen et al., 2017b). We show that it may be reasonable to question if

recreational marijuana was responsible for the recent increase in traffic fatalities in Colorado

and Washington. However, future research might consider other potential externalities such

as effects on hospital admissions, crime, and drug overdoses. Accounting for the universe of

externalities would help guide tax rates set to internalize externalities, although most states

are likely setting tax rates with revenue in mind rather than optimal Pigovian goals.

   While our results suggest that the marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington did

not lead to discernible increases in traffic fatalities, estimating the externalities of marijuana

abuse and high driving is still crucial in determining future policy. Indeed, while Colorado

and Washington have set the legal limit for high driving at 5 nanograms of THC per milliliter

of blood, we don’t yet know if the sanctions for high driving will be effective in discouraging

                                               20
high driving given the local population of drivers affected by that threshold (Hansen, 2015).

Furthermore, there is still ample debate about what the right legal threshold would be, and

if the threshold should even be based on THC. While the use of BAC is common today for

measuring impairment in drunk driving, it took nearly decades of research and innovation

from the passage of the first drunk driving laws to the creation of the first breathalyzers

(Novak, 2013). Science and policy alike are playing catch up in both measuring the relative

risks of high driving, and high driving itself.
