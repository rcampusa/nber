This research note combines two national Taiwanese datasets to investigate the relationship between
low birth weight (LBW) babies, their family background and their future academic outcomes. We
find that LBW is negatively correlated with the probability of such children attending university at
the age of 18; however, when both parents are college or senior high school graduates, such negative
effects may be partially offset. We also show that discrimination against daughters does occur, but
only in those cases where the daughters were LBW babies. Moreover, high parental education (HPE)
can only buffer the LBW shock among moderately-LBW children (as compared to very-LBW children)
and full term-LBW children (as compared to preterm-LBW children).

1.   INTRODUCTION

In their studies of the short-term consequences of low birth weight (LBW), Perlman

(2001) and Hack et al. (2002) demonstrated that LBW infants were at greater risk of

suffering later developmental difficulties, arguing that they were more likely to

suffer, for example, from brain dysfunction or neuro-sensory impairment. Almond et

al. (2005) also found that higher infant mortality rates and higher hospital costs were

further consequences of LBW.

     Although subject to the ‘stringent longitudinal linkage between information at

birth and many years later’ (Boardman et al., 2002), there has been rapid growth

over recent years in studies on the long-term developmental outcomes of LBW

babies. Examples include McCormick et al. (1992), Breslau et al. (1994) and Hack

et al. (2002), who found that LBW children had lower IQs, health and behavioral

problems, and Conley and Bennett (2000) who found a negative association between

LBW and timely high school graduation. Low test scores have also been found to be

associated with LBW (Hack et al., 2002; and Boardman et al., 2002), while Bonjour

et al (2003) suggested that families with low average birth weight had low average

schooling. Finally, Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004) found that augmented birth

weight had significant effects on height, schooling and wages. In summary, viewing

birth weight as an ‘input’ into the production function (or the initial endowment of

human capita), the prior studies have generally established a negative association

between LBW and subsequent outcomes.

     In this paper, we are particularly interested in the interactive effects of parental

education and LBW on the academic outcomes of children, a channel rarely

discussed within the literature. Previously, Currie and Hyson (1999) found that

although the ‘high social economic status’ of parents could buffer the negative effects


                                             3
of LBW on self-reported female health conditions, it could not buffer test scores and

wages. However, Kandel and Mednick (1991), Raine et al. (1994) and Tibbetts and

Piquero (1999) all found that the interactions between LBW and parental rejection (or

inferior family background) were associated with higher probability of being arrested

and committing violent crime.

     As to the interaction effect between LBW and parental education, Currie and

Hyson (1999) provided two hypotheses on the subject. The first was that if parents were

faced with credit constraints, the LBW children of those parents who were designated as

having low parental education (LPE) 1would receive less human capital investment

than their LBW-HPE (high parental education) counterparts. Their second hypothesis

was that if HPE and LPE parents differed in terms of their tastes – which decide both

their investment in pregnancy and hence, the probability of LBW – and their subsequent

investment in their children, then the underinvestment in the human capital of a LBW

child would be greatest within an LPE environment.

      The major concern with regard to these hypotheses is that they can only explain

why parental investment might rise with HPE; they cannot explain why such an

increase should benefit LBW children more than NBW children.2 Whether the LBW

children benefit more from HPE depends on parental investment and the exact shapes

of the production function.3 Thus, the interactive effect between LBW and parental

education must be determined empirically.

     Finally, LBW and LPE may be proxies for an unobserved variable, such as

    In our paper, LPE refer to low parental education,, including elementary and junior high school education,
and HPE refers to high parental education, including college and senior high school.

    We would like to express our appreciation to the anonymous referee who raised this valuable point.

     For example, if parents invest equally in their LBW and NBW children, and LBW children have a
lower marginal return to parental investment, the gap between LBW and NBW children will rise as HPE
rises. On the other hand, if LBW children have lower marginal returns to investment, but their parents
have strong preferences for equality of outcomes, and hence devote more resources to their LBW
children than their NBW children, the gap could also decrease with HPE.

                                                        4
genetic factor, that is causing low health endowments and children’s lower academic

performance. In such a case, the association between LBW, parental education and

subsequent academic outcome is not causal; all variables are merely indicators of the

underlying genetic endowment. In this paper, we do not attempt to sort out these

causal relationships. Rather we intend to provide descriptive information on whether

high parental education is a potential mechanism to mediate the negative impact of

LBW.

     Another interesting issue is parental attitudes towards differences in gender.

Becker (1981) suggested that parents may discriminate against daughters if the returns

from investing in sons are higher. Using data from Taiwan, Greenhalgh (1985) argued

that the secondary status of women, as measured by schooling, occupation and income

level, was caused by the interaction between economic institutions and patriarchal

family institutions, which is essentially rooted in the different types of inter-generational

contracts and expectations of mutual obligations in raising sons and daughters.4

     Parish and Willis (1993) found that investment in children in Taiwanese families

was often frustrated by credit constraints, with earlier born female children doing

particularly poorly because of the need for them to start work at an early age to

support their younger siblings. Finally, Yu and Su (2006) found that firstborn males in

Taiwan had additional leverage in the sibling competition for family resources;

however, the privilege for firstborns did not extend to daughters. Using Japan as an

illustrative case, Brinton (1988, 1993) also argued that it was the structure of the

Japanese employment system and the implicit intra-familial contract that shaped the

human capital development system and encouraged the maintenance of different roles

for men and women, with such gender stratification being the systematic result of a

4
    In Taiwan, parents basically rely upon their sons to look after them in their old age, while daughters
generally contribute resources to the extended family of the husband.

sequence of choices made across the life cycle.

     In the present study, we combine two national population datasets from Taiwan,

with a total of 1.3 million observations. In doing so, we extend the literature in several

ways. First, the large sample size and the high quality of our datasets enable us to

overcome the problems of measurement error and lack of statistical power, especially

for LBW children. Second, we also explore the relationship between LBW, parental

education and academic outcome by gender. Finally, we account for the heterogeneity

within the group of LBW children by using the detailed information on gestational age

and birth weight.


2.   DATASETS

The first dataset used was the birth certificate records, which contain information on

birth weight, gestational age, birth county, gender, and the age and education of both

parents at the time of the birth, for all children born between September 1978 and

August 1982, a period during which there were over 300,000 births per year in Taiwan.

Following the normal path, those born between September 1978 and August 1979

would take the college entrance examinations held in 1997; hence, we matched these

birth certificate records against the College Entrance Examination files from 1997 to

2000, which allowed us to identify who had entered college from our sample cohort.

The summary statistics of the variables are provided in Appendix Table A-1.

     After dropping observations for those who had died before the age of 18 and those

with missing values on the explanatory variables, the linkage between the two national

datasets yielded a sample of 1,296,308. Table 1 presents detail on university attendance,

by birth weight and by the mother’s educational attainment, with senior high school and




                                             6
above being referred to as ‘HPE’ and the remainder being designated as ‘LPE’.5

Consistent with the prior literature, educational achievements are strongly correlated

with parental education. Students with HPE mothers had a much higher probability of

attending university (32.1 percent vs. 10.7 percent) than those with LPE mothers.

                                     <Table 1 is inserted about here>

     On the other hand, LBW students had lower test outcomes than normal birth

weight (NBW) students; for example, the proportion of the sample attending any

university was 32.4 (10.8) percent for NBW with HPE (LPE), while for their LBW

counterparts, this figure was only 26.6 (7.7) percent. In summary, parental education

is positively and LBW is negatively associated with academic achievement...


3.   MAIN RESULTS

In order to estimate the interaction effects of LBW and parental education on

educational attainment, we regress the following logit model:

                     Yijt = α + β1LBW + β 2 HPEF + β 3 HPEM + γ 1 LBW                                       (1)
                     × HPEF + γ 2 LBW × HPEM + δX ijt + μ j + ν t + ε ijt .

where Yijt is the university attendance of individual i born in county/city j in year t.

     The regressors included a LBW dummy, mother’s education (HPEM = 1 if

mother’s education is senior high school or above), father’s education (HPEF = 1 if

father’s education is senior high school or above) and their interaction terms. Other

explanatory variables ( X ) included gender (male = 1), twin dummy, birth order

dummies, mothers’ age dummies, birth county ( μ j ) and birth year ( ν t ) dummies (all

of these are available from the birth certificate records), family income (in log), and


5
    We also divided parental education into five categories; the results (not shown in this note) are similar to
those shown in Tables 1 and 2.

                                                        7
government-employed household.6 ε ijt represents the disturbance term.

      Equation (1) indicates that the marginal effect of LBW on university attendance

depends upon LBW (β 1) itself (which should be negative) and its interaction with

parental education (γ 1 and        γ 2). Hence, the marginal effect of LBW is β 1 + γ 1* HPE
Father + γ 2 * HPE Mother. Positive measures of               γ 1 and γ 2 (mean parental education)
can ‘buffer’ the negative effect of LBW for a child. The logit estimations and

marginal effects are reported in Table 2, for both the whole sample and by gender.

                                 <Table 2 is inserted about here>

     Our results suggest that for those students with parents designated as LPE, the

probability of attending any university is 4.5 percent lower for those with LBW;

however, since a college or senior high school-educated father (mother) can buffer

the LBW shock by raising the probability of attending university by 0.7 (1.0) percent,

the marginal effect of LBW for those who have HPE parents is only – 2.6 percent but

is statistically significant. This implies that a HPE father and mother can together

offset around 40 percent (1.7/4.5) of the negative effect of LBW. Furthermore, Table

2 also suggests that parental education, family income, government-employed

households are all positively correlated, and birth order is negatively correlated, with

the probability of attending university.

     As to gender effect, Table 2 would seem to indicate that the coefficient of gender

is small and insignificant at first glance. Furthermore, differences in the estimations

between the male and female regressions are small and not always in favor of boys;

nevertheless, the coefficients of the interaction between LBW and an HPE mother

were larger in the male regression (1.49 percent, significant) than in the female

6
    Income and parental occupations data were obtained from the Government Employee Insurance files, Labor
Insurance files and Farmers Insurance files. The monthly wages of the insured parents were then aggregated to
obtain the household income.

regression (0.6 percent, insignificant). It therefore seems clear that HPE mothers still

discriminate against daughters with lower health endowments.


4.    SENSITIVITY TESTS

McCormick et al (1992), Boardman et al (2002) and Hack et al (2002) found that

adverse birth outcomes were more profound within the ‘very low birth weight’ (VLBW)

group than in the ‘moderately low birth weight’ (MLBW) group (1,500gm-2,500gm).

Table 3-1 explores this issue by using VLBW, MLBW and their interactions with

parental education as the independent variables. We find that VLBW can reduce the

probability of attending university by 11 percent, while MLBW reduces this probability

by only 4.7 percent. Furthermore, the negative effect of VLBW is not buffered at all by

HPE parents. Clearly, therefore, VLBW represents an index of high risk.

                                   <Table 3-1 is inserted about here>

      Gestational age also provides useful information for predicting problems in

newborn babies. For example, babies whose gestation period lasted the full 40

weeks are less likely to develop negative syndromes than premature-term babies.

We can therefore categorize LBW babies into two groups, full-term (gestation age

>38weeks) or preterm (<38 weeks). Full-term LBW babies are defined here as those

likely to experience intra-uterine growth retardation. 7 As Table 3-2 shows, as

compared to a NBW baby, the likelihood of a ‘preterm low birth weight’ (PLBW)

baby attending university is 4.8 percent lower, while the likelihood of a full-term

LBW (FLBW) baby attending university is 4.6 percent lower. A parent designated as

HPE can buffer the negative effect of a FLBW by 0.8 to 1.2 percent; however, neither

the father nor the mother can buffer the negative effect of LBW for PLBW babies.


7
     We are grateful to the editors for providing this perspective.

                         <Table 3-2 is inserted about here>

     The final sensitivity test checks whether the strong correlation between parental

education levels would affect our results using three different model specifications:

father’s education only, mother’s education only, and either parent with senior high

school education (or above) as the independent variables. Table 3-3 shows that the

marginal effect of LBW and its interaction terms, with different parental education

variables, remains at -4.4 percent to -4.6 percent, and 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent,

respectively. These results are similar to those obtained from Table 2. Hence the

potential problem of multi-colinearity does not jeopardize our previous estimations.

                         <Table 3-3 is inserted about here>


5.   CONCLUSION

This study has combined two unique national Taiwanese datasets to present evidence

on the ways in which LBW and parental education are associated with academic

outcomes. Our results suggest that LBW is significantly and negatively associated

with university attendance which is consistent with previous literature; however,

having HPE parents can offset the LBW shock by as much as 40 percent.

Furthermore, the buffering effects are only significant for sons, not for daughters,

which suggest that HPE parents discriminate against LBW daughters. Finally,

parents with high levels of education can only buffer the LBW shock among

moderately-LBW children (as compared to very-LBW children) and full term-LBW

children (as compared to preterm-LBW children). These results suggest the

importance to consider the heterogeneity within LBW children. VLBW and

preterm-LBW children may face very different developmental process than do

MLBW and full-term-LBW children


                                           10
    The next step is to bring in more structured and detailed data to the analysis of

the problem -- either from a standpoint of the production function of health on future

outcomes, or on the ways in which parents allocate resources within the household –

to help us to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in this

bio-social link. For example, an implicit assumption through our research is that

LBW, or VLBW with preterm status are risk factors because they make the children

less likely to benefit from parental investment. However, it is also likely that parents

invest less in children with these risk factors because they anticipate not getting high

return. In addition, for our finding that gender is also a risk factor, the latter

mechanism seems to be more plausible. In order to investigate these complex

mechanisms, we need to know more about the production function that can

transform parental investment into outcomes, the preferences of parents that govern

the intra-household distribution of resources, and the ways in which these factors

interact with parental education. Unfortunately, our dataset contains no detailed

information that would allow us to identify either the different investments in LBW

and NBW children, or their preferences with regard to intra-household resource

distribution. The strong buffering effect found in this study does, however, point to a

potentially intriguing research direction if appropriate data can be obtained to

identify these mechanisms.
