The “Federalist financial revolution” may have jump-started the U.S. economy into modern growth,
but the Free Banking System (1837-1862) did not play a direct role in sustaining it. Despite lowering
entry barriers and extending banking into developing regions, we find in county-level data that free
banks had little or no effect on growth. The result is not just a symptom of the era, as state-chartered
banks seem to have strong and positive effects on manufacturing and urbanization.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

          A half century ago, Phillip Cagan (1963, 20) wrote that the United States “could not so

easily have achieved its rapid industrial and commercial expansion during the second half of the

nineteenth century with the fragmented currency system it had during the first half.” Despite its

assertiveness, the statement remains largely untested. Rousseau and Sylla (2005) implicitly cast

doubt on its breadth by showing that the “Federalist financial revolution” of the 1790s and its

system of state-chartered banks helped to set the nation on a path of modern economic growth,

but Cagan’s statement was more likely aimed at note issues associated with the later “free”

banking system that operated in various states and times between 1837 and 1862. Free banking

lowered entry barriers and extended capital into new areas, yet nearly a third of free banks ever

created had closed by 1863. Did the diffusion of financial services facilitated by free banks

compensate for their propensity to fail? Using a unique combination of county-level data from

Haines (2004) and Weber (2005, 2008), we examine whether free banks had measurable effects

on the growth of agriculture, manufacturing, and urbanization, and compare these with the

effects of banks chartered by specific legislative acts over the same period.

          A rich empirical literature now explores the paths of finance-led growth described by

Goldsmith (1969) and McKinnon (1973). Cross-country and panel studies such as King and

Levine (1993), among many others, tend to support a finance-growth nexus, while time series

studies such as Demetriades and Hussein (1996) and Rousseau and Wachtel (1998) are more

nuanced in their conclusions.1 Rousseau and Wachtel (2011) even show that links found in early

cross-country studies break down when estimated with post-1990 data, and attribute this to a

decline in the quality of finance as economies pursue the expansion of credit. This leads one to

question whether all finance is good finance, and whether weak finance lowers growth.

1
    Levine (2005) provides a thorough survey of this literature.


                                                   1
       The antebellum United States offers a fertile environment for addressing questions of this

nature. Rousseau (2002), for example, focuses on the Panic of 1837 and President Jackson’s

monetary policies leading up to it as a case of weak finance. The free banking period, upon

which we focus here, is also well suited to investigation because it did not involve large changes

in financial regimes. Indeed, not only did charter and free banks operate together, but new

charter banks continued to form after free banking laws were passed. The period thus offers the

earliest side-by-side comparison of banks that provided similar credit allocating functions, albeit

to possibly different clients, but were subject to different regulations.

       Rockoff (1972, 1974), Rolnick and Weber (1983, 1984, 1986), and Jaremski (2010)

investigate why free banks were prone to financial distress, but these as well as growth studies

such as Bodenhorn (2000) and Rousseau and Sylla (2005) do not explicitly address the real

effects of free banking. Here we make a first attempt to disentangle growth effects of free and

charter banks by merging two micro-level bank databases collected by Weber (2005, 2008): the

first provides the name, location, and dates of operation of each antebellum bank, and the second

contains each bank’s annual balance sheet items. When merged, these data allow us to examine

the number and loans of both free and charter banks by county over time. We link financial

factors to growth with Census data collected by Haines (2004), using two specific measures of

growth—manufacturing capital and farm capital—and one indirect measure—urbanization—also

at the county level. Together, these data allow us to address the extent to which banking could

have affected the industrialization described by Cagan.

       The empirical analysis indicates that free banking did not have a direct impact on

economic growth. This does not seem to be just a symptom of the era, as charter banks had

positive effects on manufacturing and urbanization. Even our most optimistic estimates indicate

that a 10% increase in the number of free banks would have increased the growth of



                                                  2
manufacturing capital by less than 0.5% per decade, compared to a 3.3% increase in growth for a

10% increase in charter banks. The results lead one to ask if the National Banking Acts of 1863

and 1864 and the 10% tax on state bank notes that followed had significant impacts on economic

development by encouraging the exit of banks that were not growth promoting and replacing

them with new banks that were.2 They also suggest that any positive effects of free banking must

have operated indirectly and over the long term by establishing banks for the first time in areas

that previously lacked access to financial services.


                     II. THE ANTEBELLUM DUAL BANKING SYSTEM

       Under the Articles of Confederation, the young United States by 1785 was awash in debts

from the Revolutionary War and lacked a stable currency. These conditions were consequences

of systems of currencies issued by state legislatures and un-backed paper money issued by the

Continental Congress at the start of the war that had depreciated to virtual worthlessness,

requiring foreign and domestic debt issues to finance the struggle. The Federal Constitution,

ratified in 1789, addressed these weaknesses by forbidding states legislatures from issuing notes

and by implicitly authorizing Alexander Hamilton to establish the nation’s first quasi-central

bank.3 Rousseau and Sylla (2005) point to this “Federalist financial revolution” as a pivotal event

in the path of relative prosperity experienced over the next sixty years. As the label suggests, the

“revolution” involved construction of the nation’s banking and financial sectors.

       While the system worked well when the population was concentrated in large cities, the

Federalist system of bank incorporation did not fully anticipate the nation’s growth potential and

2
 Jaremski (2011) demonstrates that the tax on notes issued by state banks scheduled to take
effect in 1866 led in the vast majority of cases to the exit of state banks rather than their
conversion to national charters.

 Rousseau (2011, 146-147) describes the Constitutional basis used by Hamilton to obtain a
federal charter for the Bank of the United States.


                                                 3
quickly became constrictive. Early banks needed to obtain unique charters from state legislatures

to begin business rather than being free to enter under a fixed set of standards. The chartering

process was tedious and approval depended on political influence as much as financial

resources.4 Hammond (1957, 574), for example, describes the situation in New York:

                 “It had long been difficult to get new bank charters in New York, because the

                 [Albany] Regency kept the number down conservatively. And whenever a new

                 one was decided on . . . opportunities were afforded the public to purchase

                 stock—provided of course that most of the stock went into the possession of

                 Democrats.”5

Seeking to advance their political and economic fortunes, legislatures protected existing banks

and prevented the market from expanding to meet the rising demand for banking services.

Together with the lack of a low denomination currency, the situation led to an intense need for

liquidity in developing areas.6

          State legislatures responded by passing acts that are now collectively known as Free

Banking Laws. Starting with Michigan in 1837 and continuing through 1860 in Pennsylvania,

these laws replaced legislative approval for starting banks with a defined set of capital, reserve,

and note issue requirements that varied from state to state. Contrary to its name, however, free

banking was far from laissez-faire; rather, the term “free” meant that any individual or group of

4
    Bodenhorn (2006) provides a detailed description of the charter process.
5
 The Albany Regency was a group of politicians that held considerable power in New York
during the 1820s and 1830s. They are most associated with the Jackson Democrats and Martin
Van Buren. The state did not pass a free banking law until the Regency lost support.
6
  As quoted by Bodenhorn (2003a, 188), A. C. Flagg, a former comptroller of New York State,
recalls that merchants, manufacturers, and bankers regularly appealed to politicians for more
banks. Delegations were often led by powerful and well-respected individuals such as Albert
Gallatin, the nation’s longest-serving Secretary of the Treasury (1801-1814).



                                                  4
individuals that met the state’s requirements was “free” to open a bank. Most laws permitted

rapid entry with relatively small sunk costs. Banks and liquidity could thus expand with

population and demand without political interference. In total, 18 states passed free banking

laws, but most were not passed until the early 1850s.7

         The new laws did not eliminate existing banks or prevent new ones from obtaining a

legislative charter. Indeed, roughly the same number of new charter banks (858) started up after

1837 as free banks (861), with new charter banks locating more in the developed Northeast and

free banks more in the developing Midwest.8 Even those charter banks outside of the Northeast

were typically found in major cities such as Atlanta, Detroit, and Nashville or on major trading

routes such as Louisville, Memphis, and St. Louis. This suggests that charter banks required

some level of economic development in their vicinities to operate effectively. The only example

where free and charter banks seemed to operate interchangeably was in New York State, where

most charter banks switched to a free bank charter after the Safety Fund collapse in the early

1840s.

         The differences between free and charter bank locations were not only based on

geography. Looking at Census data for 1860 in Table 1, banking types seem related to the

population and industrial composition of a given location. Counties with charter banks tended to

be manufacturing areas, whereas those with free banks were more focused on agriculture. For

7
 Rolnick and Weber (1983, 1082) date the passage of free banking laws as follows: Michigan
1837 (repealed 1839) and 1857; Georgia 1838; New York 1838; Alabama 1849; New Jersey
1850; Illinois 1851; Massachusetts 1851; Ohio 1851; Vermont 1851; Connecticut 1852; Indiana
1852; Tennessee 1852; Wisconsin 1852; Florida 1853; Louisiana 1853; Iowa 1858; Minnesota
1858; Pennsylvania 1860. Among these, very little free banking was actually done in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Vermont. The downturn of
1839-43 seems to have interrupted the passage of new free banking laws, as only 175 banks were
created in the entire United States between 1840 and 1847.
8
 As such, the majority of free banks (51%) were in the Midwest, whereas 74% of charter banks
were in the Northeast.


                                                5
example, the average county in the Northeast with a charter bank had $56 of manufacturing

capital per person and $39 of farm capital, compared to the average free bank county that had

$28 and $52 respectively. Counties with a charter bank also had a higher percentage of their

populations in urban areas than counties with no banks or only free banks. Differences in total

population are most pronounced in the Midwest, where counties with a charter bank had 64%

more residents than counties with only free banks.

       Despite establishing liquidity on the frontier, it is not clear that free banks promoted

development in their immediate locations. A lack of available high-return investments in rural

free banking locations might partly explain this. But free banks also had a greater unconditional

propensity to close than charter banks, and sometimes before they could have had any positive

effect on their communities. In total, 58% of the 861 free banks ever started had closed by 1863,

and 15.6% of free banks operated for less than a year. This stands in stark contrast to the 27% of

the 857 charter banks created during the free banking era (1837-1862) that closed. Rolnick and

Weber (1983, 1984, 1986) and Dwyer and Hasan (2007) show that this was not because free

banking was an inherently unstable institutional arrangement, but rather a result of fluctuations in

the value of collateral bonds required by individual states for securing notes.9 Because the

quality of bonds acceptable for securing notes varied across states, with some even allowing non-

government bonds such as railroad securities to secure notes, free banks in states with looser

collateral standards were more vulnerable to negative business cycle fluctuations or particular

industry-specific shocks.

       Statements by contemporaries also suggest that at least some free banks did not promote

local development because they were insufficiently engaged in traditional banking services. For

example, a Michigan state bank commissioner in 1837 reported that individuals sought to
9
 Jaremski (2010) shows that free banks which issued loans often survived declines in the prices
of collateral bonds.


                                                 6
establish free banks “in situations the most inaccessible and remote from trade.”10 Despite the

polemic nature of such statements, however, the importance of so-called “wildcat banking” is

surely overstated. Most telling is that even though many free banks did close, a typical free bank

note was really quite safe and the recovery rate on the notes of the few free banks that actually

failed, with the exception of those in Minnesota, averaged between 75 and 90 cents on the dollar

depending on the state.11

         The fact remains, however, that free banks did not make as many loans per capita, even

in rural areas, as charter banks did. Figure 2 shows that charter banks in 1860 not only issued

more loans per person in counties with smaller populations, but also loaned a much larger

proportion of their assets. For example, in a county with a population of 8,000, an average free

bank held $134 in assets per capita but only loaned out $7 while an average charter bank held

$146 assets per capita and loaned out $51. Figure 2 also shows free banks in 1860 lent less per

capita in low population areas than in high population areas.

         The data and anecdotal evidence suggest that the effects of free banks on county-level

growth may have been limited. Because there are no direct empirical studies of free banking and

growth, we proceed to investigate the role of free banks in growth and compare their effects to

those attributable to charter banks.

and officered by straw men.” A contributor in the January 1861 edition of Banker's Magazine

capital and doing no business at their normal locations.”

       A number of studies document the connection between finance and growth in early U.S.

history. Rousseau and Sylla (2005) show that nation-wide financial development increased

domestic investment and non-financial business incorporations before 1850. Bodenhorn (2000)

shows that states with more financial development in 1850 grew faster than those with less

financial development. Bodenhorn and Cuberes (2010) relate cities with a bank in 1837 to higher

subsequent population growth. Rousseau and Wachtel (1998) and Fulford (2010) show that

finance had a positive impact on growth after the Civil War. At the same time, a lack of

disaggregated data for banks has prevented studies of whether free banks affected growth

separately from charter banks.12 We address this question by constructing a county-level dataset

that differentiates between the two bank types.

       We begin with two antebellum databases collected by Weber (2005, 2008). The first

contains a census of banks prior to the Civil War and the second contains items from their annual

balance sheets. The census provides the type (i.e., free or charter), location, and dates of

operation for each bank and the balance sheets provide information on size and portfolio

composition. We can therefore aggregate banks based on their incorporation type.

       Because the balance sheet database is missing information for 215 banks that we know

existed in either 1850 and 1860, we fill in their missing decadal observations using the average

balance sheet values of the lower quartile of their closest geographic neighbors.13 The process

begins by matching banks in the same county. Those banks without an immediate match are then

12
  Rousseau and Sylla (2005) end their study at 1850. Bodenhorn (2000) uses initial values of
banking in 1850 which eliminates most free banks from the sample, and Bodenhorn and Cuberes
(2010) focus on bank measures before 1840.
13
 Because banks in a given area often had similar compositions, the matching process minimizes
measurement errors.



                                                  8
matched with banks in the same state. We then aggregate the balance sheets to obtain the number

of banks and the total value of loans per person in each county.14 These variables reflect the

presence of banks and the intensity of banking intermediation.

          We obtain three county-level measures of economic growth from Haines (2004).

Urbanization, defined as the percentage of a county’s population that lives in an area with more

than 2,500 residents, is a rough measure of economic development.15 Manufacturing capital per

person reflects the development of factories and mechanization as described in Sokoloff (1984).

Farm capital per person, which is defined as the value of tools and livestock, accounts for

expansion of productive agricultural resources such as the purchase of a mechanical reaper.16 The

range of variables thus covers the broad sectors through which banking could have influenced

the real economy.

         We modify the panel in two ways for the regression analysis. First, we exclude

observations for counties that were not present in the Census for 1850, 1860, and 1870. This

ensures that any estimated empirical relationship between banks and economic growth is not a

result of added or subtracted counties. Second, we eliminate observations from states established

after 1860 and the early western states of California, Oregon, and Texas. This avoids logarithmic

biases associated with newly established or soon to be established states. The resulting balanced

panel contains decadal observations from 1,481 counties in 30 states between 1850 and 1870. 17

14
  Bank capital or assets could also proxy for the spread of banking, and we find that they
perform similarly to the number of banks in our analysis, so we do not report the results here.
15
  As described by DeLong and Shleifer (1993), urban areas are likely to be centers of industry,
and the number of people living therein proxies for their level of development.

                                    IV. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

          The main challenge encountered when testing for an effect of financial development on

growth is the possibility that banks opened in areas that were already growing. There is also the

possibility that banks only moved into areas that were about to grow.18 These simultaneity issues

mean that part of the correlation that we find between measures of banking and growth could be

due to reverse causation, thereby overstating support found for a hypothesis of finance-led

growth. Following King and Levine (1993) and Bodenhorn (2000), we reduce simultaneity bias

by using initial values of the banking variables, which are at least predetermined, in our growth

regressions whenever possible rather than contemporaneous ones.

          The county-level data themselves also lend some support for identification. Indeed, the

coefficient of autocorrelation for decadal county-level growth in manufacturing capital across the

1840s and 1850s is -0.38, and the autocorrelation is -0.41 for growth across the 1850s and 1860s.

Similarly, the autocorrelation for growth in farm capital is -0.20 across the 1850s and 1860s.19

These negative correlations suggest that if banks tended to spring up in areas that were already

growing, their benefits would need to overcome a negative tendency for subsequent growth to

show a positive relation with it. Moreover, banks formed in locations that were growing slowly

may well have contributed to the negative autocorrelation in growth that we observe by

promoting real activity.

18
   While the growth regressions that we consider try to control for the preemptive entry of banks
by including variables for urbanization and access to railroads and waterways, we recognize that
this unobservable source of reverse causation probably leads to overstatement of banks’ effects
on growth. It is striking, however, that even with this potential positive bias we find that free
banks were largely unrelated to growth.
19
     Growth rates of farm capital by county are not available for the 1840s.

A. Banking and Growth

          We begin by aggregating both free and charter banks to determine whether the overall

relation between banking and growth is positive. The dependent variables are the growth rates of

real manufacturing capital and real agricultural capital per person, and the percentage point

change in urbanization in county i over the 1850s or the 1860s. The natural logarithms of the

number of banks and the real value of bank loans per capita alternate as the variables of interest

on the right hand side.20 The baseline regression specification is

                   %∆    ,                  ,              ,           ,              ,   ,   1

where      ,   is the economic outcome of interest,            ,    is one of our aggregate banking

measures, ηs is a vector of state dummies, and        ,    is the error term. We include the initial log

level of the dependent variable      ,   on the right hand side to account for the possibility of

convergence across counties. The vector         ,     contains the initial values of the non-financial

county variables that could have influenced growth. The literacy rate, defined as the proportion

of a county’s population that can read, proxies for education and human capital.21 The fraction of

black persons in a county’s population controls for racial composition. Separate dummy

variables for rails and waterways control somewhat for reverse causation associated with access

to distant markets, and the log of total population controls for overall county size.

          We estimate Equation (1) separately for the 1850s and 1860s and report the results in

Table 2. The initial number of banks, which reflects the extent of banking, is related to growth in

manufacturing capital and urbanization in both decades, with coefficients that are statistically

significant. The coefficients associate 10% more banks in 1850 with 1.89% faster growth in a


20
  We express all money values in 1860 dollars using the deflator in Officer (2008), and add
unity before computing logarithms where appropriate.
21
     Because literacy was not reported in 1860, we impute it using the average of 1850 and 1870.

county’s manufacturing capital and a rise of 0.28 percentage points in its urban population share

over the decade. For the 1860s the coefficients relate 10% more banks with 1.1% higher capital

growth and an urban share that is 0.3 percentage points higher. Loans per capita, which reflect

the intensity of banking, are also statistically significant for growth in manufacturing capital and

urbanization across both decades. On the other hand, neither banking variable is statistically

significant for growth with farm capital as the dependent variable. Consistent with convergence

across counties, the coefficients on the levels of the dependent variables are negative throughout

and statistically significant in all but two regressions. Banks thus have their strongest and most

persistent effects on manufacturing during the height of the free banking era.


B. Baseline Regression Models for Charter Banks, Free Banks, and Growth

       We now estimate our baseline regressions with variables for free and charter banks

entering separately on the right hand side, reserving variations on the baseline specifications for

Sections IV.C and IV.D. The timing of free banking presents a challenge when we disaggregate

by bank type because there were very few free banks in 1850 and free banking was virtually

extinct by 1870. With only two decadal observations from the Census for measuring outcomes,

this means that the initial value of free banking would be zero for nearly every county in the

regression for the 1850s, and that survivorship bias could affect the regressions for the 1860s.

For the 1850s regressions, we must therefore use percent changes in the banking variables over

the 1850s on the right hand side. This opens the door for reverse causation to influence the

coefficient estimates but at least allows us to examine whether free banking was correlated with

growth before the Civil War. For the 1860s regressions, we accept the possibility of survivorship

bias and continue to use 1860 values for the banking variables on the right hand side just as we

did with the aggregated data. The combination of the two approaches provides upper and lower

bounds on the relationships between free banks, charter banks and growth in sense that will


                                                 12
become clear as we describe the findings.

        For each approach, we estimate regressions with all available counties in the full sample

of states and with a sample restricted to the 17 states that passed free banking laws before 1860

(see fn. 7). The restricted sample is important for comparing the effects of free and charter banks

in the same state because it controls for state-specific factors that could have affected both banks

and growth. Because the passage of a free banking law was itself a consequence of limited

charter bank development, however, the within-state comparison underestimates the benefits of

charter banks more generally.


Disaggregated banks and growth, 1850-1860. We first estimate the relationship between

changes in banking variables and economic growth between 1850 and 1860 to obtain an upper

bound on the effects of charter and free banking on real activity.22 The regression equation is:

     %∆   ,                    %∆           ,              %∆        ,              ,            2

                           ,                ,


where           ,        and        ,           are measures for each bank type, and the other

variables are defined as before.

        Table 3 shows that only charter banks had statistically significant effects on growth in

manufacturing capital during the 1850s. For example, a 10% increase in the number of charter

banks relates to growth in manufacturing capital of about 3.3% for all states (upper panel), 4.6%

for free bank states (center panel), and 4.4% for counties without a bank in 1850 (lower panel).23


22
  We do not pool these data with those from the Civil War decade because of the large number
of the Midwest free bank and Southern charter bank closures after 1860.
23
  The regressions in the lower panel of Table 3 restrict the sample to counties without a bank
before 1850 to compare counties with similar initial conditions. We do this because our finding
that free banks had little effect on county-level economic growth relative to charter banks could
be the result of pre-existing charter banks and the limited time frame that free banks were


                                                    13
At the same time, the number of free banks and their loans are negatively related to growth in

farm capital in these regressions including all states or only states that passed free banking

laws.24 Charter banks are unrelated to growth in farm capital in all but one regression with a

negative relation that is statistically significant at the 10% level. There is also evidence that both

charter and free banks are positively related to urbanization, though the possibility of reverse

causation seems strongest here. The finding that the free bank coefficients on loans are not

statistically significant for growth in manufacturing and farm capital suggests that even free

banks that were active in their communities struggled to influence growth in their communities

during the 1850s.

       Table 4 presents regressions for the 1850s with two alternative measures of charter and

free bank activity. The first is the number of cumulative bank-years by county for each banking

type. For example, if a county established its first free bank in 1853 and another in 1855, than the

county’s cumulative years for free banks in the 1850s would be 12. The second is the total

number of new free banks and new charter banks established in a given county over the 1850s,

which is meant to capture the effects of entry and account for banks that closed before the end of

the decade. The upper panel of Table 4, which includes all states in our sample, shows that new

charter banks and their cumulative years have positive effects on manufacturing capital that are

statistically significant at the 1% level, but neither free banking measure has a significant

present. Because it takes time to establish information capital and lending relationships, a bank
that existed before 1850 could have a greater effect than one established later. The restriction
also reduces observations from developed areas where other types of financial institutions could
exist.
24
  The standard deviation of the number of free banks by county across the decade also seems to
explain poor performance in raising farm capital, though we do not report the results here. The
sample standard deviation, however, is mostly attributable to the extent of the rise in the number
of free banks from zero at the start of the decade, and a few closings near the end of the 1850s
does little to mute the high correlation between the two. In Section IV.D below we find that free
bank defaults and closures perform more reliably as measures of bank quality.



                                                  14
positive effect on manufacturing. At the same time, the cumulative years of free and charter

banks have no effects on farm capital, whereas the effects of new banks of either type are

strongly negative. Again, both charter and free banks have positive and statistically significant

effects on urbanization, and the restricted estimates for free bank states in the lower panel are

qualitatively similar to those for the full sample.25

       The findings for the 1850s send a clear message: banking in general did not help grow

farm capital whereas only charter banks relate to growth in manufacturing capital. Further, banks

may have encouraged new and old residents to locate in urban areas.


Disaggregated banks and growth, 1860-1870. We now return to the model of banking and

growth for the 1860s that reduces simultaneity bias by using initial values of the measures of

banks by type as explanatory variables rather than contemporaneous changes. Because free

banks were an important part of the financial landscape by 1860, the pre-determinedness of the

right hand side variables renders causal inferences somewhat better grounded. It also allows us to

investigate whether the lack of a relation between free banking and growth that we found for the

1850s was just a symptom of the period. The estimation equation is:

     %∆   ,                             ,               ,          ,            ,             3

                         ,


       The upper panel of Table 5 presents the results for all states in the sample. The initial

number and loans of charter banks have positive and statistically significant relationships with

subsequent growth in manufacturing capital and urbanization, but free banks do not. The

estimates suggest that a typical county with 10% more charter banks in 1860 would see


25
  The results are qualitatively similar when we use the numbers of years since a county
established its first bank of each type as explanatory variables rather than cumulative years.



                                                  15
manufacturing capital grow 1.4% faster and see the urban population share rise by 0.4 percentage

points. Neither free banks nor charter banks affect growth in farm capital except for a negative

coefficient for charter banks that is statistically significant at the 10% level. The results change

very little when we restrict the sample to free bank states in the center panel or exclude the

Confederate states in the lower panel.26 So while the number of free banks no longer shows the

strongly negative association with growth in farm capital present for the 1850s, it is fair to say

that their effects on growth were at best neutral for the 1860s.


C. Identifying Local Effects

       The bank comparisons presented in Tables 3-5 would not capture purely local effects to

the extent that free and charter banks tended to select into different communities. For example, if

free banks located primarily in rural areas and charter banks located in urban ones, as seems to

be the case, differences that we find between the two types in promoting growth could partly

reflect unobserved rural and urban characteristics. In the presence of population-based non-

linearities in the relation between free banks and growth, our regressions could also understate

the absolute effects of free banks. To address these possibilities, Table 6 includes regressions that

disaggregate banks by type and whether they are located in rural or urban counties, with rural

counties defined as those with less than 24.1 inhabitants per square mile.27 Our sampling on

population density leaves too little variation in urbanization to use it on the left-hand side, so the

regressions focus on growth in manufacturing and farm capital only.

       The upper panel of Table 6 reports results for the 1850s. For rural counties, the positive

26
  We exclude the Confederate states in the lower panel of Table 5 to ensure that the economic
disturbances related to the Civil War are not affecting our results.
27
 The cutoff point was defined by the population density that divided the sample roughly in half.
Adjusting the cutoff slightly up or down does not affect the findings in any significant way.



                                                  16
relation between charter banks and growth in manufacturing capital and the negative relation

between the number of free banks and growth in farm capital are stronger than those reported for

the sample with counties aggregated (see upper panel of Table 3). For urban counties, the

positive relation between charter banks and manufacturing capital and the negative relation

between the number of free banks and farm capital are only somewhat stronger than in the

aggregated sample (see lower panel of Table 3), whereas the negative relation between free bank

loans and farm capital is no longer statistically significant.

       The results for the 1860s reported in the lower panel of Table 6 are similar to those found

in the aggregated sample (see upper panel of Table 5). In particular, charter banks in both rural

and urban counties retain their positive and statistically significant effects on manufacturing

capital, whereas free banks continue to have small and statistically insignificant effects on

growth in either type of capital.

       Overall, the regressions in Table 6 suggest that our main results are not driven by the

pooling of rural and urban counties.

       Table 7 restricts the growth regressions to a region where both charter and free banks

were prevalent, which includes the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Because

all three are in the Northeast, we would expect the regressions to capture local effects while

reducing unobserved regional variation.28 For the 1850s (upper panel) we find that neither free

nor charter banks relate to growth in manufacturing or farm capital, whereas only free banks

relate positively to urbanization at the 10% level. This suggests that the links between charter

banks and manufacturing capital found in the full sample for the 1850s did not emanate from the

Northeast. For the 1860s (lower panel), however, both free and charter bank variables have

28
  Of course free and charter banks may have operated differently in the Northeast than in other
parts of the country, but we believe that the check is still worthwhile.



                                                  17
positive and statistically significant effects on manufacturing capital, and the number of free

banks even have a positive effect on farm capital that is statistically significant at nearly the 5%

level. The latter suggests that free banks in these states did ultimately succeed in mobilizing

agricultural capital.


D. Banking Quality and Growth

        Our findings in Table 7 for New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, all locations where

free banking is believed to have operated reasonably well, leads us to consider further whether

the quality of intermediation by free and charter banks affected growth. We do this by

differentiating free banks based on whether they ended up defaulting (i.e., with losses to note

holders) at some time before 1863, and then estimating our baseline models for both the 1850s

and 1860s.29 The underlying hypothesis is that non-defaulting banks provided higher quality

intermediation than those that defaulted.

        Table 8 presents the results. For the 1850s, the number and loans of charter banks as well

as the number of non-defaulting free banks have a positive and statistically significant relation

with growth in manufacturing capital. On the other hand, only the numbers of charter banks and

defaulting free banks have a negative relation with growth in farm capital. In other words, only

“good” free banks are positively related to manufacturing capital while only “bad” free banks are

responsible for the negative relation with agricultural capital. For the 1860s, we find similar

effects for charter banks as those found for the 1850s, but free banks do not have any statistically

significant effect on growth. We note, however, that the number and loans of non-defaulting free

banks, at least, have a positive coefficient for growth in manufacturing capital.

        In addition to the regressions in Table 8, we estimated models for the 1860s that
29
  We consider defaults through 1862 because the causes for individual free bank closings (i.e.,
default or not) are known clearly up to this time.



                                                 18
disaggregate 1860 banks by type and by survival through 1868 (i.e., controlling for banks that

would eventually close but not necessarily default).30 We are able to extend the event window in

this case because we know the number of once-free banks that closed through 1868 but not

whether they fully redeemed their notes. Regardless, the results with closures as the explanatory

variable rather than default, not reported here, are similar to those in the lower panel of Table 8.


                                          V. CONCLUSION

          The data indicate that free banking had little or no positive relation with U.S. economic

growth before 1870. And while the estimates from our econometric models cannot be taken as

causal, their emphasis on local effects shed some light on the likely effects of endogeneity.

Indeed, even when positively biased by simultaneity and endogenous entry, free banks are not

robustly correlated with cross-county growth in agricultural or manufacturing capital, though

there are some signals that free banks promoted growth in areas where they were less prone to

failure. The lack of a relation does not seem to be a function of banking in general, as non-free

banks continued to have significant and positive effects on capital formation. The results raise an

important question: why did the innovation of free banking – an early form of what we might

today call financial liberalization – fail to have a measurable effect on growth?

          Standardizing entry requirements may have encouraged new banks, but those established

as a result were often small and located in rural areas. Bodenhorn (2003b) illustrates that

antebellum loan portfolios represented the underlying composition of the bank’s surrounding

area. Rural free banks thus would have invested in agriculture rather than manufacturing. As

farmers used loans to bridge growing seasons, any additional liquidity might only have sustained

small family farms rather than expanding their capital stock and productive capacity.

30
     State banks that converted to national charters were considered to have survived the period.



                                                  19
          The liberalization itself was also problematic as some states did not ensure that the notes

issued by their free banks were backed by stable collateral. This led many free banks to close

over the period, with many closures occurring shortly after opening. And because the potential

costs of recovering claims made individuals less likely to place deposits or hold notes in banks

that were more likely to close, this may have dampened the effect of free banks on growth.

          Our findings cast new light on the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864. While Davis

(1965), Sylla (1969), and James (1978) focus on the restrictiveness of their regulations late in the

National Banking period, we find that these banks may have been initially growth promoting.

This may have occurred because the new legislation retained the enabling aspects of free banks,

but took steps to improve the quality of required collateral and create a uniform currency.31 In

response to the legislation, more charter banks that existed in 1860 (almost 60%) converted to a

national charter than free banks (only 42%). Maybe more importantly, nearly half of free banks

ended up closing, relative to less than a third of charter banks. Table 9 shows that the legislation

closed only certain types of banks. Even across charter banks, banks that closed typically had

small capital stocks, held few deposits, issued few loans, and were located in rural areas. In this

way, the legislation seemed to have ended those banks that were unlikely to have a large effect

on their communities regardless of whether they were free or charter banks.

          On the other hand, free banks did form in many areas of the country that had previously

gone without banks, and though we find that they did not have much of an immediate and direct

impact on growth, they left a footprint of banking in rural areas that would eventually be filled

by the national banks that followed. Perhaps this is the true legacy of free banking and it is in this

sense that free banks did affect long-run growth.




31
     Jaremski (2010, 2011) discusses the nature of the National Banking Acts in more detail.


                                                   20
       Figure 3 illustrates that the majority of closed banks were in rural areas in the Midwest

and South. The National Banking Acts therefore emulated the spirit of free banking but closed

the very banks that the system had established. Our results suggest that these losses were not

economically relevant in the short term as the closed banks were not growth promoting, whereas

the gains by new national banks provided the impetus necessary to affect local growth. Cagan's

(1963) argument thus seems to be sound: the National Banking legislation spread liquidity along

the Manufacturing Belt and created banks capable of influencing the extraordinary rise in

manufacturing and urbanization that was to come.

Note: The figure illustrates the average number of assets and loans per person as a function of a county's
population. The balance sheet information is from Weber (2008), and county populations are from Haines (2004).
Because there were few free banks in areas with more than 50,000 people, we censor the figure at that point.

Note: The figure maps the location of each state bank that closed between 1860 and 1868.
The size of the dot denotes the number of banks in the county, whereas the underlying
shading displays the population of that county in 1870. County-level population was taken
from Haines (2004). Due to the few banks west of the Mississippi River, we censored the
map at that point. County boundaries obtained from National Historical Geographic
Information System (2004).

Note: The dependent variables for each decade are percentage growth rates for manufacturing capital and farm capital and
percentage point changes for urbanization, which is defined as the share of a county's population residing in an area with
more than 2,500 inhabitants. Explanatory variables are measured at the start of each decade. The number of banks enters in
logs and bank loans in log per capita terms. Money values are deflated to 1860 dollars using Officer (2008). In addition to
dummy variables for states, each regression also contains the following county-level variables measured in the first year of
each decade: literacy rate (%), black population (%), log of total population, and dummy variables for access to rails and
waterways. The equations for manufacturing and farm capital also control for urbanization (%). Standard errors clustered at
the state level appear in brackets beneath the coefficient estimates. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%
percent, and 1% levels respectively.

Note: The dependent variables are the percentage growth rates for manufacturing capital and farm capital and percentage point changes
for urbanization across the 1850s. The regressions in the upper panel include counties from all states in our sample, those in the center
panel exclude states that never passed a free bank law, and those in the lower panel exclude counties that already had a bank in 1850.
Other control variables enter the regressions as described in the note to Table 2. Standard errors clustered by state appear in brackets
beneath the coefficients. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels respectively.

Note: The dependent variables are the percentage growth rates for manufacturing capital and farm capital and percentage point
changes for urbanization across the 1850s. The cumulative years variable denotes the total number of years each type of bank
operated in the county, whereas the number of new banks is log total of all bank entries in the county during the decade. The
regressions in the upper panel include counties from all states in our sample, those in the bottom panel exclude observations from
states that never passed a free bank law. Other control variables enter the regressions as described in the note to Table 2. Standard
errors clustered by state appear in brackets beneath the coefficients. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%

Note: The dependent variables are the percentage growth rates for manufacturing capital and farm capital and percentage point changes for
urbanization across the 1860s. Explanatory variables are measured in 1860. The regressions in the upper panel include counties from all
states in our sample, those in the center exclude observations from states that never passed a free bank law, and those in the lower panel
exclude Confederate States. Other control variables enter the regressions as described in the note to Table 2. Standard errors clustered by
state appear in brackets beneath the coefficients. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels respectively.

Note: The dependent variables are the percentage growth rates for manufacturing capital and farm capital and percentage point changes for urbanization
over the reported decade. The sample is divided into rural and urban counties based on median population density (24.1) across the two decades. The right-
hand side variables are measured either at the change in each variable across the 1850s or the level in 1860. Other control variables enter the regressions as
described in the note to Table 2. Standard errors clustered by state appear in brackets beneath the coefficients. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance
at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels respectively.

Notes: The dependent variables are the percentage growth rates for manufacturing capital and farm capital and percentage
point changes for urbanization over the reported decade. The sample only contains counties in states that had a large number
of both charter and free banks (i.e., New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut). The right-hand side variables are measured
either as the change in each variable across the 1850s or the level in 1860. Due to the small number of counties, we exclude
state fixed effects, but all other county-level control variables enter the regressions as described in the note to Table 2. We
report robust standard errors in brackets beneath the coefficients. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at 10%, 5%,
and 1% levels respectively.
