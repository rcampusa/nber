                 Corporate Financing and Investment
                Decisions When Firms Have Information
                     That Investors Do Not Have




                              ABSTRACT




   This paper considers a firm that must issue common stock to raise
cash to undertake a valuable investment opportunity.     Management is

assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors.
Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally.     An equilibrium
model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions.
The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may
pass up valuable investment opportunities.     The model suggests explana-
tions for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including
the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt
to equity if external financing is required.     Extensions and

applications of the model are discussed.

              CORPORATE FINANCING AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS WHEN FIRMS
                    HAVE INFORMATION THAT INVESTORS DO NOT HAVE


                     Stewart C. Myers and Nicholas S. Majluf1



      Consider a firm that has assets in place and also a valuable real

investment opportunity.    However, it has to issue common shares to raise part

or all of the cash required to undertake the investment project.    If it does

not launch the project promptly, the opportunity will evaporate.    There are o

taxes, transaction costs or other capital market imperfections.

      Finance theory would advise this firm to evaluate the investment

opportunity as if it already had plenty of cash on hand.    In an efficient

capital market, securities can always be sold at a fair price; the net present

value of selling securities is always zero, because the cash raised exactly

balances the present value of the liability created.    Thus, the decision rule

is:    take every positive—NPV project, regardless of whether internal or

external funds are used to pay for it.

      What if the firm's managers know more about the value of its assets and

opportunities than outside investors do?    As we will show, nothing fundamental

is changed so long as managers invest in every project they know to have

positive NPV.    If they do this, the shares investors buy will be correctly

priced on average, although a particular issue will be over or underpriced.

The manager's inside information creates a side bet between old and new

stockholders, but the equilibrium issue price is unaffected.

      However, if managers have inside information there must be some cases in

which that information is so favorable that management, if it acts in the

interest of the old stockholders, will refuse to issue shares even if it means
                                      —4—




passing up a good investment opportunity.        That is, the cost to old

shareholders of issuing shares at a bargain price may outweigh the project's

NPV.     This possibility makes the problem interesting:     investors, aware of

their relative ignorance, will reason that a decision not to issue shares

signals "good news."     The news conveyed by an Issue is bad or at least less

good.     This affects the price investors are willing to pay for the issue,

which in turn, affects the issue—investment decision.

       If the firm finally decides not to issue and therefore not to invest—and

we will show formally how this can happen——real capital investment Is

misallocated and firm value reduced.        Of course, we would also expect

management to try to rearrange the firm's capital structure to avoid being

caught in this "financing trap" the next time the firm has a positive—NPV

investment.     Thus, our analysis of how asymmetric information affects firm's

Issue—Investment decisions may lead us to explain some corporate financing

choices as attempts by firms to avoid the problems we have just introduced.

       The first problem is to figure out the equilibrium share price conditional

on the issue—investment decision, assuming rational investors, and also a

rational firm which bases the issue—investment decision on the price it

faces.     This paper addresses that problem, and solves it under reasonable

simplifying assumptions.

       The assumptions are set out and discussed in Section 1. This section also

contains a numerical example.     A general formulation and solution Is given in

Section 2.

       However, Section 2's results raise deeper issues.    Our solution assumes

that management acts in the interests of "old" (existing) stockholders.        It

also assumes those stockholders are passive, and do not adjust their
                                       —5—




portfolios in response to the firm's Issue—invest decision, except possLbly to

buy a predetermined fraction of any new issue.

    This assumption makes financing matter.      A firm with ample financial

slack——e.g., large holdings of cash or marketable securities, or the ability

to issue default—risk free debt——would take all positive—NPV opportunities.

The same firm without slack would pass sóme up.      Also, with this assumption

about management's objective, our model predicts firms will prefer debt to

equity if they need external funds.

    If old shareholders are assumed to be active, and to rebalance their

portfolios in response to what they learn from the firm's actions, then

financing does not matter:      financial slack has no impact on Investment

decisions.      Even with ample slack, the firm will pass up some positive—NPV

I nvestments.

    We can choose from three statements about management's objective under

asymmetrical information:

    1.   Management acts in the interests of all shareholders, and ignores any

    conflict of interest between old and new shareholders.

    2.   Management acts in old shareholders' interest, and assumes they are

    passive.

    3.   Management acts in old shareholders' interest, but assumes they

    rationally rebalance their portfolios as they learn from the firm's

    actions.

    We have so far found no compelling theoretical justification for favoring

any one of these statements over the other two.      A theory, or at least a

story, could be developed to support any one of the three statements.         We will

suggest some of these stories as we go along.      However, we do not claim to
                                    —6—




have a theory of managerial behavior fully supporting our model.      We treat the

three statements as possible assumptions about managerial behavior.      Since we

cannot. judge the assumptions' realism, we turn instead to their positive

implications.

    The three statements yield substantially different empirical predictions.

Statement (2) leads at this stage of the empirical race, because it explains

why stock prices fall, on average, when firms announce an equity issue.

Moreover, it explains why debt issues have less price impact than stock

issues.   We briefly review this evidence in Section 3.

    A model based on   (a) asymmetric information and     (b) management acting in

the interests of passive, old stockholders may explain several aspects of

corporate behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of

funds and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required.      Some of

the model's implications are discussed in Parts 4 and 5 of the paper.      We

defer the customary introductory review of the literature until the end of

Section 1, after our assumptions have been more fully explained.




                          1.   ASSUMPTIONS AND EXAMPLE

    We assume the firm (i.e., its managers) has information that investors do

not have, and that both managers and investors realize this.     We take this

information asymmetry as given——a fact of life.   We side—step the question of

how much information managers should release, except to note the underlying

assumption that transmitting information is costly.      Our problem disappears if

managers can costlessly convey their special information to the market.

       The firm has one existing asset and one opportunity requiring investment

I.     The investment can be financed by issuing stock, drawing down the firm's

cash balance or selling marketable securities.                      The sum of cash on hand and

marketable securities will be referred to as financial slack                      CS).

       Financial slack chould also include the amount of default—risk free debt

the firm can issue.               (Discussion of risky debt is deferred to Section 2.)

However, it's simpler for our purposes to let the firm use risk—free borrowing

to reduce the required investment I.                    We thus interpret I as required equity

investment.

       The investment opportunity evaporates if the firm does not go ahead at

time     t =     0.        (We could just as well say that delay of investment reduces the

project's net present value.)                  If     S < I, going ahead requires a stock issue

of     E =   I   —    S.     Also, the project is "all or nothing"——the firm can't take

part of it.

       We assume capital markets are perfect and efficient with respect to

publicly available information.                     There are no transaction costs in issuing

stock.       We also assume that market value of the firm's shares equals their

expected future value conditional on whatever information the market has.                        The

future values could be discounted for the time value of money without changing

anything essential.2               Discounting for risk is not considered, because the

only uncertainty important in this problem stems from managers' special

information.               Investors at time        t = 0   do not know whether the firm's stock

price will go up or down when that special information is revealed at                     .t =   1.

However, the risk is assumed to be diversifiable.3

       We    can now give a detailed statement of who knows what when.

A Three—Date Model

     1.    There are three dates,                        t = —1, 0 and           +1.     At   t = —1,       the market has

the same Information the management does.                                   At   t =    0, management receives

additional information about the value of the firm's asset—in—place and

Investment opportunity, and updates their values accordingly.                                           The market does'

not receive this information until                              t =   +1.

     2.    The   value of the asset—in—place at                              t    —1     Is   the expected future

value     A =          the distribution of                       'X    represents        the asset's possible

(updated) values at               t =    0.     Management's updated estimate at                        t         0        Is        a,

                            r'J


the realization of          A.4

     3.    The net present value (NPV) at                             t = —l      of the investment

opportunity is        B =   E().              The distribution of                       represents the asset's

possible updated NPVs at                  t         0.     Management's updated estimate at                           t         0


is   b, the realization of

     4.    Negative values for                  a        and     b    are ruled out.          This makes sense for

the asset—in—place because of limited liability.                                       It makes sense for the

Investment opportunity because the opportunity is discarded If it turns out to

have a negative NPV at                  t =    0.        In other words, the distributIon of                                    is

truncated at zero.

     5.    Management acts in the interest of the "old" shareholders, those

owning shares at the start of                        t =    0.       That is, they maximize

      =   V(a,b,E),    the "intrinsic" value of the old shares conditional on

the Issue—invest decision and knowledge of the realizations                                        a        and           b.

However, the market value of these shares will not generally equal

since investors know only the distribution of
                                         —9—




   and       and whether shares are issued.       Let

    P' = market value at     t   =0    of old stockholders' shares

          if stock is issued.

     P = market value at     t = 0     if stock is not issued.

    Old stockholders are assumed passive.         They "sit tight" if stock is

issued; thus the issue goes to a different group of investors.         If the

firm has ample slack, and thus does not need to issue shares In order to

invest, old shareholders also sit tight if the investment is made.           Thus,

acting in old stockholders' interest amounts to maximizing the true or

intrinsic value of the existing shares.        (Here "true" or "intrinsic"

value means what the shares would sell for, conditional on the firms'

issue—invest decision, if investors knew everything that managers know.)

    We realize this passive—stockholder assumption may be controversial.

We will discuss it further in Section 3 below.

    6.   Slack,   S, is fixed and known by both managers and the market.

    The information available to management and the market Is summarized

below:

Example

       The following example should give a better understanding of the problem

just posed and the steps required to solve it.                        Also, the example shows why a

firm may pass up a positive—NPV opportunity in a rational expectations

equilibrium.

       There are two equally probable states of nature.                           The true state is

revealed to management at                t    0   and to investors at               t      +1.   Asset values

are:

                                                         State 1                    State 2

Asset—in—Place                                           a = 150                    a = 50

Investment Opportunity (NPV)                              b =   20                  •b =   10


The firm has no cash or marketable securities                         (S      0),       The investment

opportunity requires              I     100, so the firm must issue stock to raise                     E   100

if it goes ahead.

       Consider a trial solution in which the firm Issues stock and undertakes

the project regardless of whether the favorable or unfavorable


state occurs.            In that case,       P'    115      because        A + B = 115.

       In state 1, the true value of the firm, Including 100 raised from the

stock issue, is 270.              That is     V             +   new   =    270.     The market value

at     t     0     is    P' + E       (the old shares' market value is                  P', the new shares'

is     E).       Thus,
                                                               —11—




                                     P
              void       =                               V =           . 270      =   144.42

                                             E            =


In state 2,

                                     v =         void     +    new     =    160

                                     V               —-y       . 160


                                                     =         . 160 =      74.42


Note that both old and new shares are correctly priced to investors, who

regard the two states as equally probable.

                                 =   1/2(144.42                +   85.58)    = 115


                             E       1/2(125.58 +                  74.42)    = 100



Because the firm issues stock In both states, the decision to issue tells

investors nothing about the true state.

    But this trial solution is not the equilibrium solution.                                             Look at the

payoffs to old stockholders:

                                                         Issue and                             Do Nothing

With these payoffs, the optimal strategy is to issue and Invest only In state

2, because in state 1, the market value of the old stockholders' shares Is

lower when shares are Issued.                            However, If the firm follows this strategy,
issuing stock signals state 2 and                 P'    drops to 60.    The equilibrium payoffs

are:




                                              Issue and                      Do Nothing

            state 2


Thus the firm passes up a good investment project                      CNPv     +20)        in state 1.

Its market values at           t     0    will be      P' = 60 (state 2)       and     P        150 (state

1).     The average payoff to old stockholders is                  1/2(150 + 60)            105.        There is

a loss of 10 in ex ante firm value——i.e., at                   t     —1, V      105 vs. a potential

value of 115.

       In general, whether the firm decides to issue and invest depends on the

relative values of         a       and   b   in the two states.        For example, suppose we had

started with the following table:

                                                           State 1                          State 2

Asset—in—Place                                             a = 150                          a      50

Investment Opportunity (NPV)                               b = 100                          b = 10




If you work through this case, you will find that the trial solution, in which

the firm is assumed to issue and invest in both states, is also the

equilibrium solution.              The investment opportunity is so valuable in state 1

that the firm cannot afford to pass It up, even though new shares must be sold
                                      —13—




for less than they are really worth.     Since shares are issued in both states,

the decision to issue conveys no information, and        P' = A + B = 155.

    But now let us go back to the original project values, which force the

firm not to Issue or invest in state 1.       In this case we can show that the

firm Is better off with cash in the bank.       If   S = 100, the payoffs, net of

the additional cash investment, are:

                Payoff                 Invest                  Do Noth1
                void in                 170                        150
                state 1

                void in                  60                         50
                state 2


The firm invests in both states5 and the ex ante value of the firm's real

assets is 115, 10 higher than before, because the firm avoids a 50 percent

chance of being forced to pass up investment with an NPV of 20.          You could say

that putting 100 in the bank at   t     —l    has an ex ante NPV of 10.




Discussion

   The conventional rationale for iolding financial slack——cash, liquid

assets, or unused borrowing power——is that the firm doesn't want to have to

issue stock on short notice in order to pursue a valuable investment

opportunity.   Managers point to the red tape, delays and underwriting costs

encountered in stock issues.   They also typically say, "We don't want to be

forced to issue stock when our firm is undervalued by the market."

   A financial economist might respond by asking, "Managers may have superior

information, but why should that be a disadvantage?       if we admit that the firm

is sometimes undervalued, then sometimes it must be overvalued.          Why   can't
                                     —14—




firms take advantage of the market by issuing securities only when the firm is

overpriced? •'

    Our examples suggest answers for these questions:     slack has value because

without it the firm is sometimes unwilling to issue stock and therefore passes

up a good investment opportunity.     Slack does not allow the firm to take

advantage of investors by issuing only when stock is overvalued:     if investors

know the firm does not have to issue to invest, then an attempt to issue sends

a strong pessimistic signal.

    Slack is clearly unnecessary If the firm has a "private line" to existing

stockholders.     However, private communication to old stockholders would be

difficult and also illegal.     Slack is also unnecessary if the firm can compel

its old stockholders to buy and hold the new issue; In this case, the conflict

between old and new stockholders does not exist.

    Our examples suggest that slack allows the firm to avoid external

financing, and thereby to avoid entangling its investment decisions in

possible conflicts of interest between old and new shareholders.6     Slack

therefore allows the firm to avoid the consequences of managers' Inside

information.     Unfortunately, this conclusion is not as neat as it appears at

first, for it rests on assuming that old stockholders are passive, and do not

rebalance their portfolios when they learn whether the firm invests.     If they

do rebalance, conflicts of interest between old and new shareholders occur

even if the firm has ample slack.    We return to this point in Section 3.
                                      —15—




Information   Costs

      The value of slack disappears if the firm can costlessly convey its

special knowledge to all investors, new as well as old.     One way to justify

our contrary assumption is to think of cases in which values depend on

proprietary information which, if released to the market, would be released t

competitors also, consequently reducing either the value of its

asset—in—place, the NPV of its investment opportunity, or both.

      The firm cannot convey that information by saying, "We have great

prospects, but we can't tell you the details."     In our model, the firm always

has the incentive to do this, so such statements carry no information.        The

firm has to supply verifiable detail sufficient to indicate the true state of

nature. The costs of supplying, absorbing and verifying this information may

be significant.     Yet making it public will in most cases tell the firm's

competitors all they want to know.7

      There can also be information asymmetries when there is no need to guard

proprietary information.     Educating investors takes time and money.   After

all, the managers' information advantage goes beyond having more facts than

investors do.     Managers also know better what those facts mean for the firm.

They have an insider's view of their organization and what it can and cannot

do.   This organizational knowledge is part of managers' human capital; they

acquire it as they work, by conscious effort as well as by trial and error.

An outside investor who tried to match an equally intelligent manager on this

dimension would probably fail.     By this argument, the separation of ownership

from professional management naturally creates asymmetric information,
                                      —16—




Related Work

    Our problem is similar to the one addressed by Akerlof (1970), who showed

how markets can break down when potential buyers cannot verify the quality of

the product they are offered.     Faced with the risk of buying a lemon, the

buyer will demand a discount, which in turn discourages the potential sellers

who do not have lemons.     However, in our paper, the seller Is not offering a

single good, but a partial claim on two, the asset—in—place and the new

project.     Moreover, the seller gives up one of them (the new project) if the

partial claim is not sold.     Without this more complex structure, we would have

little to say, beyond noting that securities can be lemons too.

    Akerlof's paper was one of the first Investigations of the economics of

unevenly distributed information.     The assumption of asymmetric information

underlies extensive recent work on agency costs, signalling, adverse

selection, etc.     A detailed review of all that is not needed here.   However,

several articles are directly relevant to our problem:

    1.     Campbell (1979) assumes that firms have proprietary Information that

would be costly to convey to the market.     He describes the resulting financing

difficulties and possible remedies.     His main point is to provide a new

rationale for debt financing through financial intermediaries.     It may, for

example, be possible to reveal proprietary information to a bank without

revealing it to competitors; the bank could then finance a new project on

terms which are fair to old stockholders.     This line of analysis is further

explored in Campbell and Kracaw (1980).

           However, Campbell does not consider what happens if a firm with

proprietary information does attempt a public Issue.     He presents no formal

equilibrium model of security pricing and of the financing and investment
                                    —17--




decisions of the firm.

    2.   Leland and Pyle (1977) consider an entrepreneur seeking additional

equity financing for a single venture.      The entrepreneur knows the projects

expected return but outside investors do not.      However, the outside investors

observe the fraction of the entrepreneur's personal wealth committed to the

project, and set their valuation accordingly.      The greater the entrepreneurs

willingness to take a personal stake in the project, the more Investors are

willing to pay for their share of it.8

         This suggests a possible extension to our model.    If managers also are

(old) stockholders, then managers' inside information may be conveyed by the

amount of the new issue they are willing to buy for their personal portfolios.

    3.   Bhattacharya and Ritter (1983) pose a problem similar to ours, but end

up pursuing a different Issue.   We fix the extent of managers' inside

information and examine the equilibrium Issue—investment decision.     They ask

how much information the firm should reveal, assuming that each revelation

provides information to competitors as well as Investors, and therefore

reduces the value of the firm.   They show that the firm may be able to convey

its true value to investors without revealing everything Its competitors would

like to know.   However, their search for signalling equilibria carries them a

long way from this paper's analysis.

    4.   Rendleman (1980) also sets a problem similar to ours,    His Investors

may over— or undervalue the firm's assets or investment opportunities or

misassess its risk.   He focuses on the choice between debt and equity

financing, but does not derive a full equllibriummodel.      For example, he

shows that undervalued firms will typically prefer debt, but does not model

the market's response to the firm's choice of debt over equity.     In general
                                     —18—




management's choice of financing must convey information about the firm's

intrinsic value and actual risk.     In our model however, the firm never issues

equity when it has the option to issue debt, regardless of whether the firm Is

over— or undervalued,     We prove this later in the paper.

    5.    Giammarino and Neave (1982) present a model in which the firm and

investors have different perceptions of the risk——e.g., variance——of the

return on an investment opportunity, but agree on the mean return.     They

concentrate on the choice among financing instruments, and develop a rationale

for convertibles.    Our model is in most respects more general, since we allow

different information about any aspect of the distributions of asset values.

However, we do not consider convertibles as such.     We have further comments on

these authors' results in Section 3.

    6.    Miller and Rock (1982) present a model of dividend policy under

asymmetric information.     If the amount of investment and external financing is

held fixed, the cash dividend paid by the firm reveals its operating cash

flow.    Thus, a larger—than—expected dividend reveals larger—than—expected cash

flow, and stock price increases.    A larger—than—expected external financing

reveals lower—than—expected cash flow, which is bad news for investors.       Thus

Miller and Rock's model predicts that announcements of new security issues

will, on average, depress stock price.      So does our model, as we will show in

Section 2.    However, ours also yields more specific hypotheses about what

kinds of securities firms choose to issue and how that choice affects the

magnitude of the stock price change.     These issues, and the relevant empirical

evidence, are discussed further in Section 3.

    7.    There are other theoretical papers exploring how managers' inside

information is signalled to investors.      They include Bhattacharya's work on
                                                                _____

dividend policy (1979), Grossman and Hart's (1981) work on takeover bids, and

Ross's papers on "financial incentive sigialling" (1977,1978), In which a

manger's employment contract leads him to convey information about the firii's

prospects through a choice of its capital structure.                                         There are also tempting

analogies between our paper and the literature on credit rationing.                                                See, for

example,    Jaffee and. Russell (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981).




                                    2.    THE FORNAL MODEL

    In this section, we give a formal statement and solution of the model

introduced in Section 1.        We assume             0 <   S       <    I     so that some or all of the

project must be financed by a stock issue.                              By varying slack                 S, we vary the

size of the required issue,         E =   I       —   S.

    If the firm, knowing the true values                        a        and        b, does not issue, it
                                                                old
forfeits the investment opportunity, so                     V                  S +      a.       The slack remains In

cash or liquid assets.     If it does issue and Invest,                                      E     I —   S   and


                          VOld=p,;;(E+S+a+b)
Old stockholders are better off (or will be at                                 t        +1) If the firm issues

The condition can also be written:

Thus the line

                                 (E/P')(S+a)E+b                                                       Cia)


divides the joint probability distribution of                           and          into     two regions,

as shown in Figure 1.              If the actual outcome          (a, b)      falls in region            M', the

firm issues and invests.                 If the outcome falls in region              M, the firm does

nothing:        it is willing to give up the NPV of its investment opportunity

rather than sell shares for less than the shares are really worth.                                  (Figure 2

displays the numerical example presented above in the format of Figure 1.)

       Remember that the joint probability distribution of                       a     and     b    is

restricted to the Northeast quadrant of Figure 1.                       RegIon       M'      is at the top

left of this quadrant.              The firm Is most likely to issue when                    b, the

realization of project NPV, Is high and                      a, the realization of value of the

asset—in—place, is low.              The higher      b   is, the more old stockholders gain

from issuing and investing.                  The lower   a     is, the more attractive the issue

price     P'.


       Of course       P'      itself depends on the probability densities of                      ('X,')      in
the regions        M     and     M', and the boundaries of          M   and    M'     depend on          P'.

Thus     P', M     and      M'    are simultaneously determined.              The stock issue will be

fairly priced to investors if

                   lO-—i.e., where   (a,b)=(50,lO).  It does not issue or invest
                   in state 2, where   (a,b)=(150,20). The states are assumed
                   equally probable. Firm value conditional on issue is P'60.

investors that the true values                    a   and        b       satisfy Inequality (1).




Properties of Equilibrium

      These equilibrium conditions imply that the firm may pass up good

opportunities rather than selling stock to raise funds.                                        This occurs with

probability       F(M).       The ex ante loss in value is                          L      F(M)B(M)           There is

no loss when the firm has sufficient slack to finance the investment—-that is,

L     0    when   S >   I.     If on the other hand,                     S <   I,       as we will assume in

the following discussion, the ex ante loss increases as                                        E, the size of the

required equity issue, increases.                     Since          E      I — S, the loss also increase.'

with the required investment                  I    and decreases with slack available                           S.9



      Special cases.          "Corner solutions,'                in which the firm always issues stock

or never issues stock, are rarely encountered in this model given


reasonable joint probability distributions for                                      and .            This   occurs

because both            and          are random and have positive means, and because the

investment decision cannot be postponed.                             The following special cases do give

corner solutions, however.                  First, if        a       is known by investors as well as

managers, then stock is always issued when                               b >   0, and thus

L =   0.   To show this, first substitute                        a    for      A(M')       in Equation (2)
                                                      —22—




                                        =    S+   a   + B(M')


Since       B(M') >    0,   P' >   S+       a.   The firm will issue stock if

                                   E(S+a)<E+b

This condition must be satisfied, because                        (S + a)IP' < 1         and b> 0.
The firm will issue whenever the investment opportunity has zero or positive

NPV     (b> 0).        The market value of the old stockholders' stake in the

firm, conditional on issue, is therefore                        P' =    S   + a + B.

      In our model, asymmetric information restricted to investment

opportunities never prevents a stock issue.                        The terms of sale may be

favorable to the firm (if               b <           or unfavorable (if          b >   ), but   even in

the latter case the firm Is better off Issuing than losing the project

entirely.

      This suggests that some firms would be better off splitting assets in

place away from growth opportunities.                        For example, if the asset—in—place can

be sold for        a, without affecting               b, then the problems addressed in this

paper evaporate.10          If the investment opportunity has zero or positive NPV

(b> 0), then the firm sells the asset—in—place.                             If the proceeds cover the

investment required           (a> I), it goes ahead.                   However, it also goes ahead

if    a <   I,   because selling the asset—in—place reveals its true value.                         As we

have just shown, asymmetric information restricted to investment opportunities

never prevents a stock issue.11

      On the other hand, the firm might simply spin off its asset—in—place as a

separately—financed company.                  In our model, stockholders are better off ex

ante holding          two firms rather than one, providing that the spinoff does not
                                                              —23--




 reduce the values of the distributions X                                      and/or    .
       Now consider the case in which the firm has no investment opportunities



(3         0     In all states of the world).                       Here things break down totally:12

stock is never issued, except possibly when                                      a     is at a definite lower bound.

Let        amin           denote the lower bound:              assume that both investors and the firm

know that                 a       cannot be less than         amin.        (Note we have reintroduced

asymmetric information about                        a.)       Then        P'     cannot be less than            amin + S,

because everyone would then know the firm's shares were underpriced.                                                  But

P' >       a          +       S    can also be ruled out, for it leads to a contradiction.                                 To
               m in

see why, substitute                     P'     a1 +       S   + e        in Inequality (1).             Witi    e >   0,

the firm issues only if                       a< amin + e.            Therefore,             A(M') <    aj     + e,

and        P' >       S    + A(M'), which violates Equation (2).

       So the only possibility for                    P'        when           b = 0    is     P'      amin + S.      In

that case, the firm only issues when .a = amin.                                        It never issues when

a >    a         ,    because then:
           mm
                                                    +a          >   E,
                                               E(



which violates Inequality (1).

       If        b        is positive and investors know its value, the firm will issue and

invest in at least some states where                                a>                 It may Issue in all

states—that is, if                      b    is large enough, it may issue even if                        a    is far out

on the right hand tail of its distribution.

       One insight of this model is that you need asymmetric information about

both assets in place and investment opportunities to get interesting

solutions.                For example, without asymmetric information about assets in place,
                                                                           —24--




stock is always issued when the firm has a positive—NPV opportunity;

asymmetric information does not affect real investment decisions.



         The impact of stock issues on stock price.                                          In our model, the decision to

issue stock always reduces stock price, unless the issue is a foregone

conclusion.                         That is equivalent to saying that                        P' <   P     if the probability

of issue is less than                                 1.0.        (Note that this rules out the "corner solution"

in which investors know what managers know about the value of assets in

place.)                If the firm is sure to issue, then the issue conveys no information,

and          P'            P.


         The proof is simple.                              Note that          P    A(M) + S, the expected value of

assets in place and slack conditional on not Is suing, or in other words,

conditional on the realizations                                        a    and     b   falling in region               M   in Figure

1.       Assume                 M        Is not empty——there is some probability of no issue.                                  Then a

glance at Figure 1 shows that all realizations of                                               a       which fall In           N


exceed            P' — S, and                    ACM)         must exceed          P' — S.   Since        P —   S   =

P    —   S    >       P'    —       S,     and       P >    P'.
         Or look at It this way:                                  the reason a firm decides notto issue is that

a >      P'(l          + b/E) — S.                   (This follows from reversing and rearranging

Inequality (1).)                            Since          b/E> 0, the decision not, to issue signals

a >      P'       —    S        or        a ÷ S>       P' •       In   other words, it signals that the true

value of slack and assets in place exceed                                               P', the price of the "old" shares


if new shares are issued.                                     Since          = A(M) + S, P      must exceed P', and price

must fall when the issue—invest decision Is revealed.

         Note that both                          P    and      P'      incorporate all information' available to
                                                        —25—




 investors.        They are rationally—formed, unbiased estimates of the firm's

 intrinsic value.             They reflect knowledge of the firm's decision rule as weil

as its decision.              P    exceeds    P'        because investors rationally interpret the

decision not to issue as good news about the true value of the firm.13



        Comment.     Why should stock issues always convey bad news?                             Might not

investors view some issues as confirming the existence of a positive—NpV

opportunity?         That ought to be good news, not bad.

        We will now explain why our model rules out this optimistic response.                                    To

do so requires a bit of backtracking, however.

        We have assumed that ', the NPV of the firm's investment opportunity at

t   =   0, is nonnegative.            Negative—NPV investments                   ('   < 0)   would never be

undertaken.         Even if the firm encountered a negative—NPV investment and raised

sufficient money to undertake it, it would never go ahead.                                    It would put the

money in the bank instead, or into some other zero—NPV investment.                                     (It can

buy other firms' shares, for example.)                               Thus, the distribution of              is
truncated at             =    0.

        There may, however, be a high probability that the realization                                 b     will be
exactly zero.        What does the firm do when this happens (when                             b =   0)?
Answer:      it follows the rule stated above, Issuing if:

                                    (E/P')(S +     a)    <       E + b                                     (1)

or, with      b =   0,       if    P' > S + a      or a< P' — S.                 In Figure 1, the points

(a,b) for which          b = 0       and     a <   P'    —       S    lie on the horizontal axis to the

left of the line separating regions                          N       and   M'.   In other words,     M'

includes (its share of) the horizontal axis.
                                          —26—




      Since the firm issues whenever (a,b) falls in region          M', even when it has

only zero—NPV opportunities, the decision to issue does not signal

'positive—NPV investment" but only "Region M'."            We have already shown that

the rational investor reaction to Region M' Is "bad news."

      This does not imply that the firm will always Issue when it has no

positive—NPV opportunity     (b =   0).       It issues only when the value of its

assets in place is low enough to make the issue attractive——i.e., when

a< P'      S.   Moreover, the higher the probability that         b =   0, other things

equal,14 the lower     P', and the lower the probability of issue.           In the

limit, when b> 0       is ruled out entirely, the firm will never issue, except

possibly when the realization of          a    falls at a definite lower bound.       (This

is one of the corner solutions discussed above.)

      The intuition that stock issues confirm the existence of positive—NPV

projects must therefore be rejected if our model Is right.              That Intuition

might be borne out If managers could commit to refrain from issuing when

b =   0, but this is not a credible policy if managers act in the old
shareholders' interests.




Numerical Solutions

      The analysis presented so far establishes that the firm may rationally

forego a valuable investment opportunity if common stock must be issued to

finance It.     We would also like to have some indication of the probability of

this event and the magnitude of the ex ante loss in firm value.             For that we

have to turn numerical methods.
                                                              —27—




       The key to a numerical solution is of course                                         P':       once we know it, we can

use Equation (2) to separate regions                                M'     and        M.    Unfortunately, we cannot

guarantee a unique                    P'—--it depends on the joint probability distribution of

a     and    b25           Nor can we give a more specific analytical expression for P,

although calculating                   P'        by numerical methods is not difficult.                            The niethod

we have used is:


       1.    Start by setting                    P' =   S   + A + B.        This assumes the firm always issu's

       stock      if       b >   0.
       2.    Then determine the regions                         M    and        M'        assuming the firm faces this

       trial value for                P'     and acts in the old stockholders' interest.

       3.    Calculate a new trial value of                              P' =    S    +    A(M') + (M')          based on the

       regions         M     and      M'     from step 2.

       4.    Continue until                 P'     converges.

This procedure gives the highest equilibrium                                         P'.     In our numerical experim:'

this value has always been a unique solution for joint lognormal distributiors

of     A    and        B, and also forjoint normal distributions truncated to exclude

negative X's and 's.

       Table 1 illustrates the results obtained in extensive numerical

experiments.16               It shows            L, loss in market value at                       t   = —1, as


a percent of               B, the average NPV of the investment opportunity.                                      It also

from zero to the required investment                                I.    Note that:

       a.    Increasing slack reduces                         L/B    and increases                F(M').

       b.    lacreasing project NPV                         (B/I)    reduces           L/B.

Debt Financing

    So far, we have assumed that the firm can raise external funds only by

issuing stock.   Now we will adapt the model to include the choice between debt

and equity issues.

    If the firm can Issue default—risk free debt, our problem disappears:                               the

firm never passes up a positlve—NPV investment.                   If it can only issue risky

debt, our problem is only alleviated:              the firm sometimes passes up

positive—NPV investments, but the average opportunity loss is less with debt

than with equity financing.       The general rule seems to be:                       better to issue

safe securities than risky ones.

    This requires more careful discussion.                  Assume the money needed for the

Investment opportunity     (I — S)        can be financed by debt,                D, or equity,     E.

Assume for the moment that these are two distinct policies announced at

t = —l   and adhered to In    t      0.    That is, the firm must choose debt or

equity before managers know the true values                  a   and   b.

                                                old
    The firm issues and invests If          V         ,   the intrinsic value of the old

stockholders' equity, is higher with the issue than without it.                            If it does

Issue,         equals total firm value less the value of the newly—issued

securities.
                                                —29--




      Suppose equity is issued.            Then     void = a + b +        I   — E1, where

is the newly issued shares' market value at                  t =    +1, when investors learn                        a

and     b.    The issue price of these shares is just                E =      I   —   S   at       t        0.    Thus

v0=s+a+b_(E1_E)=s+a+b_AE;                                     AE isthenew
shareholders' capital gain or loss when the truth comes out at                                 t        +1,

conditional on the firm's issue of shares at                  t =    0.

      The firm will issue and invest only if

                         S+a<S+a+b—AE                                                                       (3)

or if        b> AE.   The investment's NPv must equal or exceed the capital gain

on newly—issued shares.           (Note:       AE   may be positive or negative.                       At

equilibrium investors expect it to be zero.                  The firm knows the true value.)

      If debt is issued, we follow exactly the same argument, with                                 D    and

      substituted for       E    and   E1, and reach the same conclusion:                          the firm

will issue and invest only if              b    equals or exceeds AD D1 — D.                       Of

course if the debt is default—risk free,                AD    o,17        and the firm always

issues and invests when b> 0.                  Thus, the ability to issue risk—free debt

is as good as financial slack.             If the debt is not default risk—free, AD

may be positive or negative.           Option pricing theory tells us that AD will

have the same sign as           AE, but that its absolute value will always be

less.18       We so assume for the moment.

      Now compare the issue—invest decisions for debt vs. equity financing.

Since     b> 0, the firm will always invest when AD                       and AE          are zero or

negative.       Suppose AD       and AE        are positive (good news in store for

investors at       t =   +1).    If the firm is willing to issue equity and invest, it

is. also willing to issue debt CD< AE, so b>AE implies

b> AD).        However, debt is issued in some states where equity is not
                                               —30—




(AD < b <    AE).     Thus, the ex ante value of the firm is higher under

the debt—financing policy, because the loss in market value                              (L)    due to

under—investment is less.

     Now suppose the choice of debt or equity is not preannounced, but chosen

at   t =   0, after the firm knows the values                    a    and   b.   This seems a more

complicated problem, for the choice could give an additional signal to

investors.     It's tempting to say the overvalued firm would issue equity and

the undervalued firm debt.19

     In our model, however, the firm never issues equity.                             If it issues and

invests, it always       issues      debt, regardless of whether the firm is over— or

undervalued.        A proof follows.

     The payoff to old stockholders                 (yOU)        if neither debt or equity is

issued is     a + S.     The additional payoffs to issuing and investing are                             b —

AE   with equity financing and              b — AD     with debt financing.             An equity

issue therefore signals that               b — AE > b — AD, that is              AE < AD.

     Remember that      AE     and    AD    are the gains realized by new stock or

bondholders at        t = +1       when the firm's true value is revealed.                     They depend

on   a,b,S   and the decision to issue and invest.                      If there is an equilibrium

in which equity is issued, there is a price                      E at which investors can.

rationally expect       AE = 0.        For debt, the equilibrium firm value Is

     and investors expect            AD = 0.       Given       a,b    and   S,   AE     and

AD   have the same sign, but            IAEI   >     ADI   .




     However, there is no equilibrium price                      P;    at which the firm can

issue stock.        It prefers stock to debt only if                        is high enough that

AE < AD.     This occurs only if            AE <    0, implying a sure cita1 loss
for new stockholders.          Therefore, there can be no price                   PE     at which
                                          —31—



(1) the firm is willing to issue stock rather than debt and          (2) investors are

willing to buy.

    To put it another way:       suppose the firm announced at     t = —l     that it

would issue debt if it issued any security.          It could not change its mind and

issue equity at    t    0, because investors would assume this meant tE< 0

and refuse to buy.     On the other hand, a firm which announced a policy of

equity financing at     t   —1       would be forced to change its mind, and to issue

debt at   t = 0   if it issued at all.        Equity would be issued at     t = 0   only

if absolutely ruled out at       t      1; yet we showed above that precommitting to

equity financing is always inferior to precommitting to debt.

    Thus, our model may explain why many firms seem to prefer internal

financing to financing by security issues and, when they do issue, why they

seem to prefer bonds to stock.          This has been interpreted as managerial

capitalism——an attempt by managers to avoid the discipline of capital markets

and to cut the ties that bind managers' to stockholders' interests.            In our

model, this behavior is in the stockholders' interest.




Equity Issues in Asymmetric Information Models

   The chief difficulty with this analysis of the debt—equity choice is that

we end up leaving no room at all for stock issues.          We could of course

recreate a role for them by introducing agency or bankruptcy costs of debt, as

discussed in, for example, Jensen and Meckling (1976), Myers (1977), and Smith

and Warner (1979).     But it is also possible to rationalize equity issues in

models based on information asymmetries alone.

   Our proof that debt dominates equity uses the standard option—pricing
                                    —32—




assumption that percentage changes in wilue are lognormally distributed with a

constant variance rate known by everyone.    However, suppose there is a large

information asymmetry about the (future) variance rate.    If investors

underestimate the variance rate, the firm will be tempted to issue debt, but

if they overestimate it, the firm will be tempted to issue equity, other

things equal.    Thus, a decision to issue equity may not signal a sure capital

loss for new stockholders, but simply that the firm is safer than prospective

bondholders think.    Thus equity issues are not completely ruled out in

equilibrium.

    Ciammarino and Neave (1982) set up a model in which the managers and

investors share the same information about everything except risk.       In this

case, equity issues dominate debt issues, because the only time the firm wants

to issue debt is when they know the firm is riskier than investors think.

Investors, realizing this, refuse to buy.    Only equity, or perhaps a

convertible security, is issued in equilibrium.

    Firms actually seem to favor debt over equity issues, not the reverse.         We

believe asymmetric information about firm value is a stronger determinant of

financing behavior than asymmetric information about risk, and we will so

assume in subsequent comments, although future empirical research could of

course prove us wrong.    On the theoretical side, an obvious next step is to

analyze the debt—equity choice in a version of our model which explicitly

allows information asymmetry on the two dimensions of firm value and firm
            20
variance.

                      3.   ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MANAGEMENT'S OBJECTIVES

         We have shown that ample financial slack allows the firm to avoid external

    financing and to disentangle investment decisions from conflicts of interest

    between old stockholders and new investors.         However, this result depends on

    management's acting in the interest of                stockholders.   We will now

    consider how rational stockholders react to the firm's investment decision.

    We show that, in frictionless capital markets, their reaction does riot depend

    on whether the investment is financed with internal or external funds.21




    The Irrelevance of Financing

         Take the simplest case, in which the firm can only issue stock.          When the

    firm has inadequate slack    (S <   I),   we showed that the firm may pass up

    valuable investment opportunities.        This loss would be avoided if old

    stockholders could be compelled to buy and hold the new issue—-in other words,

    to accept the new asset in their own portfolios.           In general, this will not be

    their optimal portfolio strategy, however, so new shareholders enter, creating

    the conflict.

         Now suppose the firm has ample slack        (5> I).    Old stockholders arrive

    at   t   0   with shares representing a portfolio of three items:        an asset in

    place, a growth opportunity and cash.         If the growth opportunity is taken, the

    cash vanishes, and the portfolio changes to two assets in place.          The old

•
    stockholders "buy" all of the new asset via the firm's internal financing.

    However, there is nothing to force them to hold it.          The same portfolio

    motives that would prevent them from buying all of a new issue should prompt

    them to sell part of their shares if the firm uses its cash to buy a risky
                                                —34—




real asset.

       There is no deadweight loss so long as the firm buys this asset whenever

it has positive NPV             (b > 0).     However, suppose managers start to worry

about the price old shareholders trade at when they rebalance their portfol:tos

after an internally—financed investment is made.                     Table 2 sets out equil5brui

conditions for this case.               The left—hand,block (Case I) shows old

shareholders' payoffs if the firm has no slack.                     We assume old shareholders

could buy all of the new issue.                Therefore, we earmark        C =   I     dollars of ash

and other securities and take it as potentially available for investment.

However, their optimal portfolio calls for investing al                       in the new issues

The resulting equilibrium conditions are slight generalizations of those given

in Section      above (we previously took              cj   = 0).
       In the right—hand block (Case II), the firm holds the same amount of cash

on behalf of old shareholders.                If the firm invests this cash, they recoui

part of It by selling shares to raise                  (1 —a)I.      Their fractional ownerdhip

thus    ends up as        (P" — (1 —     ct)I)1P.   Note that       P", the market price of the

firm conditional on investment, includes the investment                     I.        It's convenient

to substitute        P
                         net
                               E P" —   I.

       At equilibrium,          net = A(M") + B(M"), where           M"   indicates the

states in which investment by the firm is in the old shareholders' interest

given the price net               facing them when they sell.

       The equilibrium conditions for the two cases shown in Table 2 are

identical.     The firm's Investment decision is independent of whether cash

starts out in the shareholders' bank accounts or the firm's.                           The firm passes

up good investment opportunities in the same states, so the ex ante loss                           L

is the same for the two cases.22                So are the market prices conditional on
                                      —35—




the decision to invest: "
                              = net
    The choice between debt and equity financing should not matter either.

Suppose the starting position is Case I in Table 2.       The firm borrows     C =   I
dollars from its stockholders.    That transforms Case I into II, if the debt is

default—risk free.    The final equilibrium investment decision and stock price

are unaffected.

    If the debt carries default risk, old shareholders are exposed to the

firm's business risk through their new debt securities as well as their

stock.   Therefore, when the firm invests, they will raise      (1 —   ct)I   by

selling a mixture of debt and equity securities——the same fraction of their

holdings of each.    However, the same final equilibrium Is reached again.

    If the risky debt is sold to outsiders, old shareholders would buy part of

the debt issue, and sell some of their shares.       However, as long as capital

markets are frictionless, and all traders understand what is going on, the

final result is the same.

    We thus obtain an (MM) proposition of financial irrelevance, where all the

action comes from the firm's decision to invest.       If this tack is taken, our

model's empirical implications change.       We could not explain firms' demand for

slack, their apparent preference for internal financing, or for debt over

equity issues.    A fall in stock price on announcement of a stock issue would

be explained as an Information effect.       That is, the issue would not matter in

itself, but only as a signal of the decision to invest.

    However, before we turn to the empirical evidence, we will devote a few

more words to the competing descriptions of management objectives and

shareholder responses when managers know more than shareholders do.

Ex Ante Optimal Policies

     Old shareholders are better off ex ante, and on average ex post, if

management takes all positive—NPV projects.       Perhaps compensation packages

have features that prompt managers to follow this rule.       Social conventions or

corporate cultures that encourage managers to maximize "long—run value" may

have the same effect.     Also, following the rule may be in managers'

self—interest:     a manager who does not allow conflicts between old and new

shareholders' interests to block positive—NPV projects could demand a higher

salary ex ante than one who does.

     However, management must take some responsibility for financing.      Consider

the extreme instruction, "Take all positive—NPV projects and issue securities

at      price."
     The "wrong" price for a security issue does not affect firm value.      It

just transfers value from some securityholders to others.       Nevertheless, the

instruction is not credible.    Public stockholders would not support it,

because it would leave them unprotected against sweet deals given to insiders

or their friends.23

     Of course this sort of sweet deal is illegal.      An outside investor hurt by

one of them could sue, and probably win if the inispricing were obvious and the

motive clear.     The law requires a manager to worry about the terms of

financing; we think it encourages the manager to look at financing from the

viewpoint of the passive investor.

     Consider the altered Instructions, "Take all positive—NPV projects, and

issue securities at a fair price conditional on market information only."         In

other words, managers should use their special information on the demand side,
                                             24
but ignore it when it comes to financing.         However, these instructions are
                                     —37--




still not fully credible, not only because of the mental dIscipline required,

but also because managers' personal interests are likely to be more closely

aligned with old stockholders' interests than with new stockholders'.

       Consider a manager who is also a stockholder.   If he always buys and holds

a pro rata share of any new issue, and maximizes the intrinsic value of his

holdings, then his interests will be aligned with all securityholders', and ne

will maximize the intrinsic value of the firm.

       However, most managers would not want to buy a pro rata share of every tew

issue, even if the issue is fairly priced from their point of view.        The

reasons why can be traced to the same portfolio considerations which prevent

old stockholders from buying all of every new issue——loss of diversification

and, In extreme cases, limits to personal wealth.      If the manager does not buy

all of every new issue then his interests as a shareholder are those of an

(informed) old shareholder.

       There is still another complication:   a manager—shareholder who has inside

information will be tempted to trade on it.     If the outside market is

(semi—strong form) efficient, the manager will want to sell half the time and

buy the other half.     In particular, he will want to abstain from half of new

issues, and buy more than a pro rata share of the others.      He will also want

to buy or sell if the firm does not issue.     The potential trading profit will

depend on the issue—invest decision, although apparently not in any tractable

way.    We doubt the managers' interests will be aligned with any outside

investor's if the managers are given free rein to trade on personal account.
                                      —38—




Empirical Evidence

    It is easy to see why managers should take all positive—NPV projects, but

hard to build a completely convincing theory explaining why they would always

do so.   We think it more likely that managers having superior information act

in old stockholders' interest.     We also think that existing empirical evidence

supports our view.

    If management acts in old shareholders' interests, our model predicts that

the decision to issue and invest causes stock price to fall.        If management

took all and only positive—NPV projects, even when issuing and investing

reduces the intrinsic value of the "old" shares, the same decision would

either increase stock price or leave it unchanged.        The decision to invest

would reveal the existence of an attractive project (i.e.,        b >   0).   This is

good news, unless Investors knew for sure that the firm would have that

investment opportunity.     It cannot be bad news in any case.

    Recent papers by Dann and Mikkelson (1982), Korwar (1982), and Asquith and

Mullins (1983) show significant negative average price impacts when a new

stock issue is announced.     "Information effects" are an obvious explanation.

However, as far as we know, ours is the only complete model explaining how

such an information effect could occur in a rational expectations equilibrium.

    Of course our model predicts that stock prices will always fall when

investors learn of a new stock issue.        But the model holds everything but the

issue—investment decision constant.     In particular, it ignores the flow to

investors of other information about the firm's prospects.        This flow creates

a random error in any measurement of how a stock price changes in response to

a specific event.
                                      —39—




    If our interpretation of these results is accepted, we can set aside,         at

least for the present discussion, models assuming managers simply "accept all

positive—NPV projects."

    If managers act in old shareholders' interests, do they assume those

shareholders are passive or active?        Do they just maximize the existing

shares' value, or do they work out how rational shareholders' portfolio

choices depend on their decisions?

    These questions can also be answered empirically.        If managers assume

active shareholders, then only the investment decision matters.        Good

investments are foregone even when the firm has plenty of cash to pay for

them.   However, if managers assume passive stockholders, then financing

matters and firms will adapt their financing policy to mitigate the loss in

value from foregone investment opportunities.       For example, managers will try

to build up financial slack on order to avoid situations in which a security

issue Is required to finance a valuable investment opportunity.       If

information asymmetries relate primarily to firm value, rather than risk,

managers will favor debt over equity financing If external capital is required.

    In our framework, the "passive investor" assumption gives a variety of

interesting hypotheses about corporate financing.       That is why we use the

assumption for most of this paper's formal analysis.

   We noted that Dann and Mikkelson (1982) found a significant negative

average price impact when stock Issues are announced.       They also looked at a

sample of debt issues, and found no significant price impact.       Our model may
                                      25
be able to explain this difference.

    The "passive investor" assumption implies that stock price falls when

stock is issued.   However, stock price should not fall If default risk—free
                                        —40—




debt is issued, because the ability to issue risk—free debt is equivalent to

having ample financial slack, and having ample slack insures that the firm

will take all positive—NPV projects.        Thus, in our model the only information

conveyed by the decision to issue risk—free debt and invest is that the firm

has a positive—NPV project.        This causes a positive price change unless the

project's existence was known beforehand.

    Under the "active investor" assumption, the decision to invest would be

bad news, and the choice of debt over equity financing would not make the news

any better.        Choosing this assumption would give us no way to explain Dann and

Mlkkelson' s results.

    Of course, the debt issues examined by Dann and Mlkkelson were not

literally default—risk free.        But if the probability of default on these

issues was small, their negative "information effect" should likewise be
         26
small.




                             4.   EXTENSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

    Having explained our model formally, and having discussed its assumptions

and some of its empirical implications, we can now turn to a few extensions,

qualifications, and further observations.27        We specifically address two

questions:

    1.        What happens when the information asymmetry is temporary?   What

happens when it is permanent but the firm has no immediate need for funds,

except to build up slack?

    2.        What does our model say about mergers?
                                          —41—




     Discussing these questions leads us to other issues, for example, the

 implications of managers' superior information for dividend poiicy.




An Easy Way Out

    There is of course an easy way out of the problems described in this

paper——an easy way to avoid any loss of market value:                just issue stock at
t = —1, when managers and the market are assumed to share the same

information.      That is one lesson of our model.            If managers know more than thE>

market does, firms should avoid situations in. which valuable investment

projects have to be financed by stock issues.             Having slack solves the

problem, and one way to get slack is to issue stock when there is no

asymmetric information.

    That is not an easy way out, however, if the information asymmetry is

permanent.      Suppose managers are always one period ahead of the

market.    At    t = —1, for example, managers would know           A     and       B, but

investors would not.       Investors at    t = —l      would see    A     and       B     as

random variables.     At    t =   0, they would find out the means              A       and    B

(and the underlying distributions of             and          but by that time

managers would know the realizations         a   and     b.

    Assume the firm has insufficient slack to undertake the project, and

also, to keep things simple that the amount of slack is fixed unless

equity is issued to increase it and the investment required to undertake

the project is known.       Consider the decision to issue          E =   I   —     S    dollars

of stock at     t = —1.    If the firm does not issue, its true value at

t=—l      is
                                                —42—




                         vOld(no Issue)           +         +       S    — L



where    L   is the ex ante loss in firm value attributable to insufficient

slack.    That is,       L     reflects the probability the firm will choose to

pass up a positive—NPV Investment at                  t =       0, and the loss In value if It

does.    Of course, investors do not know how big                              L   Is, because they do


not know the distributions of                  and '.               However, they do know that           L

goes to zero If the firm Issues stock at                        t         —1    in order to raise the

additional cash      E         I —   S   needed to assure Investment at                    t =   0.
     This brings us back to the same problem we started with in Section

1.   We have an "asset—in—place" worth                 A ÷          B   + S — L     and an "investment

opportunity" worth            L.   Managers know these values but investors have only

probability distributions.               Thus, the firm's decision to issue and the price

Investors are willing to pay are governed by Inequality (1) and Equation (2).

Managers may or may not issue stock at                  t = —1:                it depends on the price they

can Issue it for.            If investors are too pessimistic, relative to what managers

know, managers may accept the ex ante loss                          L     and take a chance that the firm

will be able to issue and Invest at               t = 0                 if the NPV of its Investment

opportunity turns out positive.

     We will not here pursue analysis of the optimal issue strategy in this

dynamic setting.     However, we have shown that the problems addressed In this

paper do not go away when the firm has no immediate real investment

opportunity.    Given asymmetric information, a firm with valuable future real

Investment opportunities is better off with slack than without It.                                    Moreover,
                                     —43—




it should build up slack through retention rather than stock issues.           This is

consistent with actual retention policies of most public firms, which limit

dividends so that they will rarely have to go to the market for fresh equity.

     Thus we add one item in favor of the list of possible arguments for

dividend payouts low enough to avoid reliance on external equity financing.

On the other hand, dividends would alleviate the problems posed in this

paper if they help signal the true value of       'X,   thus reducing   crA.

However, this is not necessarily an argument for high average payout;          it

merely supports payout policies with a high correlation of changes In

dividends and changes in the value of assets in place.         This could explain why

dividend payments respond to changes in earnings, not market value, if book

earnings primarily reflect the performance of assets—in-place.

    At this point, we revert to our original three—date model, In which

asymmetric information is important only at       t =   0.




Mergers

    Our model's main message is this:       given asymmetric information, a firm

with insufficient financial slack may not undertake all valuable investment

opportunities.    Thus, a firm that has too little slack increases its value by

acquiring more.

    One way to do this is by merger.    In our model, a merger always creates

value when one firm's surplus slack fully covers the other's deficiency.28

Of course this gain is only one of dozens of possible merger motives.          But we

have nothing to say here about other benefits or costs, so we will assume them

away' here.
                                                     —44—




      It turns out that the same conditions that create a potential gain from

 transferring surplus slack between merger partners will also complicate the

 merger negotiations, and in some cases rule out any possibility of their

 successful completion.                Consider a firm with an existing business, a good

 inVe8tment opportunity, but insufficient slack to pay for it.                               It seeks a

 merger with a cash—rich firm.                 The would—be buyer only knows the distributions

 of         and , not         the true values            a    and   b.

      Let        Q'     be the proposed merger price.               That is, if the merger offer is

accepted, the shareholders of the cash—poor firm receive                             Q'     In   cash or
            29
shares.               If the offer is turned down, that firm s shareholders forego the

Investment and are left with                  S +   a.       Thus, given   a   and    b, the offer will

be accepted if             Q' >   S   + a.   However, the cash—rich firm will only

offer      Q'     = S + A(N') +       B(N'), where (N') and (N)                  are the expectations

of          and          conditional on observing that the cash—poor firm is willing to

go through with the deal.

      Under these assumptions, the merger would never occur.                              The cash—poor firm

can always do better by issuing stock directly to investors, because                                  P'

always exceeds            Q'.30

      In   our model, the decision to sell shares always carries negative

information, regardless of whether the shares are sold to investors generally

or to a specific acquiring firm.                    The buyer or buyers discount the shares so

that cost equals expected payoff.                   If the firm issues         E =   I    — S, old

shareholders retain a stake, but If their firm Is sold they are completely

disengaged from it.               The decision to sell all of the firm via merger, rather

than issue the fraction                E/(P' +   E),     drives down market price below              P',
 because the firm has chosen to sell sore stock than absolutely necessary to

 cover the investment     I.    (We assume that        (1) the acquiring firm's slaci'

 exceeds the selling firm's deficiency          (I —    S),    (2) the acquiring firm has

other assets, and      (3) everyone knows what these assets are worth.)

    Negotiated mergers thus seem to be ruled out (In this simple case)

regardless of financing, because the cash—poor firm can always do oetter by

 issuing stock.     How can mergers be explained under the premises of this paper?

    There are two possible explanations.           First, there may be parttal or total

disclosure of internal information during negotiation.3'                 Second, the merger

may go through if the buyer rather than the seller takes the initiative.                          In

our model, firms with plenty of slack should seek out acquisition targets

which have good investment opportunities and limited slack, and about which

Investors have limited Information,           Such firms sell at a discount from their


average potential value        A + B + S.32    A tender offer made directly to

the slack—poor firm's shareholders, at a price above               A ÷   B   +   S   —   L, but
below A ÷    B   + S, makes both the bidder and the target's shareholders better

off ex ante, although neither buyer nor sellers know the true value

a + b + S.   A cash tender offer conveys no bad news about                   a + b + S, so long

as the target's management are not accomplices.               Perhaps this explains why

most mergers are initiated by buyers.          A firm that actively seeks to be bought

out may end up a wallflower.       The more actively management seeks to sell, the

less an outsider will assume their firm Is worth.

                                  5.    CONCLUSION

     We have presented a model of the issue—investment decision when the firm's

managers have superior information.      We can sum up by reviewing some of the

 model's most interesting properties.

     1.   It is generally better to issue safe securities than risky ones.

Firms should go to bond markets for external capital, but raise equity by

 retention if possible.   That is, external financing using debt is better than

financing by equity.

    2.    Firms whose investment opportunities outstrip operating cash flows,

and which have used up their ability to issue low—risk debt, may      forego   good

Investments rather than issue risky securities to finance them.       This is done

in the existing stockholders' interest.       However, stockholders are better off

ex ante—-I.e., on average—when the firm carries sufficient financial slack to

undertake good investment opportunities as they arise.

           The ex ante loss in value increases with the size of the required

equity issue,    Thus, increasing the required investment or reducing slack

available for this investment also increases the ex ante loss.       In addition,

numerical simulations indicate the loss decreases when the market's

uncertainty about the value of assets In place is reduced, or when the

investment opportunity's expected NPV is increased.

    3.    Firms can build up financial slack by restricting dividends when

investment requirements are modest.     The cash saved is held as marketable

securities or reserve borrowing power.

          The other way to build slack is by issuing stock in periods when

managers' Information advantage is small; firms with insufficient slack to

cover possible future investment opportunities would Issue in periods where
                                    —47—




managers have no information advantage.     However, we have not derived a

generally optimal dynamic issue strategy.

    4.   The firm should not pay a dividend if it has to recoup the cash by

selling stock or some other risky security.     Of course dividends could help

convey managers' superior information to the market.     Our model suggstq a

policy under which changes in dividends are highly correlated wIth rnanagei

estimate of the value of assets In place.33

    5.   When managers have superior information, and stock is issued tu

finance investment, stock price will fall, other things equal.    This actiou i;

nevertheless in the (existing) stockholders' interest.    If the firm issues

safe (default—risk free) debt to finance investment, stock price will not fall.

    6.   A merger of a slack—rich and slack—poor firm increases the firm's

combined value.   However, negotiating such mergers will be hopeless unless the

slack—poor firms' managers can convey their special information to the

prospective buyers.   If this information cannot be conveyed (and verified,

slack—poor firms will be bought out by tender offers made directly to their

shareholders.

    Of course, the six items stated just above depend on the specific

assumptions of our model and may not follow in other contexts.    We have only

explored one of many possible stories about corporate finance.    A full

description of corporate financing and investment behavior will no doubt

require telling several stories at once.

 1.    Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and

       paper draws on Majiuf (1978) and an earlier (1978) joint working paper,

       but it has undergone several major revisions and expansions.              We thank.

       Fischer Black, George Constantinedes, Roger Gordon, Rene Stulz and an

       anonymous referee for valuable comments.         The office of Naval Research

       sponsored the initial work on this paper.

2.    We could interpret our time subscript not as calendar time, but just the

       state of information available to the firm and market.

3.    That is, managers may have inside information about the firm, but not

      about the market or the economy.

4.    An analogy may help make this clear.        Think of a share of IBM stock

      on January 1   Ct   —1).   ' could      be the unknown distribution of the

      February 1 price,   a   the actual price on February 1        (t =   0).    However, a

      fur trapper snowed in on the upper MacGregor River might not learn the

      February 1 price until March 1     Ct     ÷1).
5.    These payoffs appear to be create incentive to leave the cash in the bank,

      and issue stock in state 2.    However, that action would immediately reveal

      the true state, forcing    P' down to 60.        If the firm does not have to

      issue stock to undertake the project, smart investors will assume the

      worst if it does issue, and the firm will find the issue unattractive.

6.    Rights issues resolve the conflict of interest only if old stockholders

      can be compelled to exercise their rights and hold the newly—issued shares.

 7.    What is it that competitors want to know?    There are two possIbi1itfes

           a.    They want to know the value of the firm's assets and

            opportunities——in our example, the true state,       s = 1   or 2   (In   the

           example, the firm cannot help revealing the true state if it has co

            Issue to invest.)

            b.   They want to know technology, product desIgn, managemit.

           strategy, etc.——that is, how the value is generated.          in this ca;c.

           knowing the true state would not help competitors at ail.

      We assume that the investment opportunity's NPV is independent ot whetLer

      stock has to be issued to finance it.     Thus we are Implicitly assuial'ig

      (b), not (a).   But if (a) is important, then slack may have still another

      payoff:    If the firm does not have to Issue to invest, It can more easily

      conceal the true value of its assets and growth opportunities.         Its ex

      ante investment opportunity set, described by the distrIbution of , may

      be more favorable with slack than without It.

           Issuing stock can fully reveal the true state     s    only In simple

      two—state examples.     But these comments also apply——if suitably watered

      down—--to the more general cases discussed in Section 3.

      Also pp. 142—143.

10. What if only part of the asset—in—place can be sold?         If it can he sold t.

      intrinsic value, the firm treats the proceeds as additional slack and

      looks again at its Issue—invest decision.
                                        —50—




11. What if the asset—in—place can only be sold at a discount?                     What if the

    potential buyer does not know its true value?                What if sale of the

    asset—in—place reduces       b?   These questions are worth exploring.

12. This is the case of market breakdown analyzed by Akerlof (1970).

13. Issue costs do not appear to change the structure of our model in any

    fundamental way,    However, we comment on them here because including them

    may qualify our proof that stock price falls when the firm issues shares.

           Suppose the firm incurs issue costs of           T     dollars.       This increases

    the amount it has to issue to finance the project from                   E    to   E + T.

   That is, it must issue a gross amount           E + T        in order to net        E.

           The higher issue costs are, the smaller the fraction of the

   post—issue shares held by old stockholders.              The firm issues and invests

   if:


     void                        (E + S + a + b)    >   S   + a     void
         issue    P' + E + T                        —                no issue

                       E+
    orif                          (S+a)<E+b
   The market value    P'      of the old stockholders' shares conditional on issue

   is as before given by Equation (2), but the region                M'   is now defined by

   the Inequality given just above.
                                            —51—




           Issue costs appear to lead to two main differences in the equilibrium

     properties of the model.         First, the firm may issue and invest when its

     investment opportunity's NPV is positive, but less than

     T (0 < b <   T).   This creates a different sort of real resource cost.

     In this region, the project actually has negative NPV once issue costs are

     allocated to it     (b — T   <   0).   Nevertheless, the investment may be

     rational if managers know the value of assets in place is sufficiently

    low.    If this outcome is possible, the ex ante market value of the firm

    will be marked down accordingly.

           Second, we can no longer say for sure that              P' <    P, and that the

    decision to issue shares drives down the price.                The proof given in the

    text follows from the observation that          ACM) > P' + S.             With issue

    costs, the corresponding statement is          ACM) >                                It is
                                                                   E       T

    conceivable that     A(M)     would fall between    P'(                    —   S   and   P' — S.
                                                               E       T
    The conditions under which this might happen are worth investigating

    further.   For present purposes, however, we have to assume that

    transaction costs are a second—order effect.


14. "Other things" includes the expectation of '              given that it is positive.
15. Majiuf (1978) shows that at least one equilibrium               P'     exists if there is

    a positive probability that the firm will issue stock.                     See his Appendix

    1, pp. 279—285.

17. That is, the chauge in the debt value at      t      1     is Independent of the

    firm—specific information revealed to investors at that time.            Other

    things, such as a general shift in interest rates, may change debt value,

    but that is Irrelevant here.

18. See, for example, Galal and Masulis (1976).         The option pricing framework

    of course rests on more restrictive assumptions than those used so far In

    this paper.      We return to these assumptions below.

19. This is Rendleman's conclusion (1980).      As noted above, he does not work

    out a full equilibrium solution.

20. Note that the general version of our model, as described in Inequality (1)

    and Equation (2), allows asynunetric information about

                                               (rX,).
    any feature of the joint distribution                But addressing the choice

    among financing instruments requires more specific assumptions.

21. We thank George Constantinedes for suggesting this possibility.

22. If old shareholders are willing to hold all of any new Investment——i.e.,

    if a       1   in Table 2's expressions—the firm always Invests if

    b >   0.   This is, of course, the ex ante optimal policy; the problem is

   enforcing it.      Old shareholders could enforce it by purchasing 100 percent

   of any new issue (Case I) or by not selling any of their shares (Case II).

           However, note that the incentive for old shareholders to buy all of a

   new issue Is strongest if they act in concert.            Management looks at the

   overall a.       An investor who holds, say, one percent of the firm's

   stock, and who acts alone, buying one percent of the new issue, will reap

   only one percent of his action's rewards.      If arranging a group action is

   costly, then individual investors' Incentives will not make           a    1

   overall.
                                       —53.-




          In Case II, a = 1 if old shareholders do not trade when the finn
     invests. Financial slack helps by making sure that old shareholders buy
    all    of the new project, at least temporarily. Trading costs then lthi
     the   extent of selling.   If their portfolios are "sticky," the conflict f

    interest   between old and new shareholders is reduced.        However, any

     investor who sells out will not face the full cost of his actions, Irc

    management's    decision depends on old stockholders' overall participation

    in the new project.

23. Existing securityholders could protect against this ripoff by taking a ro

    rata share of each new issue.      But this would be cumbersome at bests         It

    would also invite a different kind of ripoff, in which outside

    securityholders buy an overpriced issue while insiders and their friends

    sell or sell short.

24. This suggests the idea that managers could avoid conflicts between old ani

    new shareholders by concealing the firm's investment decision.          Take Case

    II   in Table 2, where the firm has ample slack.        Suppose its investment

    decision is not revealed until      t      +1.   Then the firm's actions prompt no

    trading at    t =   0, and good investment opportunities are not bypassed.        In

    Case I, on the other hand, the investment decision cannot be concealed

    because a stock Issue necessarily comes first.

25. Miller and Rock's model would predict the same negative stock price impact

    regardless of the type of security issued.

26. You would expect that the riskier the instrument Issued, the greater the

    issues' impact on the market value of the firm.         However, we have not bee:i

   able to prove that this positive relationship is always aionotonic.
                                                       —54—




27. "Our model" includes the assumption that nanagers act in old stockholders'

    interests, and that those stockholders are passive in the sense discussed

    above.

28. If the merged firms' total slack does not fully cover their investment

    requirements, the merger may or may not increase value.                                    See Majiuf

    (1978), pp. 239—256.

29. We assume for simplicity that the true value of any shares used to finance

    the merger is independent of                       a    and     b.    A more elaborate analysis is

    needed if they are not independent.                            A further complication is introduced

    if     (1) the merger is financed by shares and                              (2) the buying firm's

    management has superior information about what those shares are worth.

30. A proof follows.             Define       a*(N')         as the breakeven value of             a, the value

    at which the cash—poor firm is just indifferent to being acquired at the

    equilibrium price             Q'.   Note that             Q'       a*(N')    + S.      Refer again to (la),

    the requirement for the firm to Issue stock:

                                   E/P'(S+a)<E+b
    If    1"     were equal to          Q',    the firm would issue and invest at                    a*(N')   for

   any     b >    0.    That is, if           P'       Q'      S   + a*(N'),



                       (S + a)                   (S + a*(N')) = E< E + b
                                  = s   + a*(N')


   Thus        a*(M'), the breakeven value of                      a     at which the firm is just willing

   to issue stock, exceeds                a*(N')            for any      b >    0.

   Thus,       A(N') + (M') >           (N')       +   (N')        and    P' >       Q'.

31. The cash—poor firm would prefer to negotiate with a firm that is not a

    competitor.   A competitor might back out of the negotiations and take

    advantage of information acquired in them.   This hazard Is less in a

    "conglomerate" merger.

32. We assume the target firm has not yet declared its issue—invest decision.

33. However, there is no mechanism in our model to insure that such a policy

    would be faithfully followed.
