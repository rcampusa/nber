                                            ABSTRACT

Forensic accounting is used to reconstruct the data on emissions, redemptions, and bills outstanding
for colonial New Jersey paper money. These components are further separated into the amounts initially
legislated, and the amounts actually executed. These data are substantial improvements over what
currently exists in the literature. They also provide a more complete and nuanced accounting of colonial
New Jersey’s paper money regime than what has been done previously for any British North American
colony. Enough detail of the forensic accounting exercise is given for scholars to reproduce the data
series from the original sources.

        Forensic accounting is used to reconstruct the data on emissions, redemptions, and bills
        outstanding for colonial New Jersey paper money. These components are further
        separated into the amounts initially legislated, and the amounts actually executed. These
        data are substantial improvements over what currently exists in the literature. They also
        provide a more complete and nuanced accounting of colonial New Jersey’s paper money
        regime than what has been done previously for any British North American colony.
        Enough detail of the forensic accounting exercise is given for scholars to reproduce the
        data series from the original sources.

        The British North American colonies were the first western economies to emit sizeable

amounts of colony-specific paper money, called bills of credit. In 1709, New Jersey became the

third colony, along with Connecticut, New Hampshire, and New York, to experiment with paper

money. Massachusetts was the first in 1690, and South Carolina was the second in 1703. These

bills were emitted directly by their respective colonial legislatures and not by banks. No specie-

based commercial banks issuing paper banknotes existed in British North America in this era. 2

Colonial legislatures had paper money printed and placed in their respective colony’s treasury.

They directly spent that money on soldiers’ pay, government salaries, prison construction, etc. In

some cases, they loaned it on interest to their respective subjects with said subjects pledging their

lands as collateral for the loans. Once initiated, colonial legislatures, with irregular frequency,

continued to make periodic emissions of new paper money. After 1709, colonial New Jersey

never went longer than eight years without putting new paper money into circulation. This

  Banking structures successfully emitting paper banknotes backed by fractional specie reserves would not appear in
English-speaking North America until near the end of the American Revolution. The first joint-stock specie-based
bank was the Bank of North America chartered by Congress and by various states in 1781 (Hammond 1957, pp. 3-
64).

                                                                                                                 1
legislature-issued paper money formed an important part of the circulating medium of exchange

in many British North American colonies (Brock 1975, Newman 2008).

        Explaining how colonial paper money regimes performed has proven controversial.

Economists have found that within standard monetary models, even when employing heroic

assumptions, statistical relationships between the quantities of paper money in circulation, prices,

and exchange rates are weak to non-existent in the colonies south of New England. This

outcome, in turn, has sparked heated debate over how to characterize colonial monetary

behavior. 3 This controversy, however, may simply be the product of poor data. The current data

on colonial paper money was gathered long ago from outdated and poorly documented sources.

Noisy or random data can bias statistical relationships toward insignificance and thus lead to

poor modeling performance. Improving that data for one colony, namely New Jersey, is the goal

here. The forensic accounting methods used to accomplish this may provide a guide for future

reconstructions of the paper money data for other colonies.

        An example of how problematic the current data are can be gleaned from the most recent

compilation, and current go-to place, for colonial paper money in circulation, namely Carter

(2006, v. 5, pp. 692-6) Historical Statistics of the United States: Earliest Times to the Present,

Millennial Edition. The data therein were compiled by John J. McCusker. For New Jersey, these

data show no paper money in circulation between 1709 and 1724. McCusker relied on Brock

(1975) who gathered his data in 1941. Brock (1975, pp. 84-5, 92-3) reported that New Jersey

emitted paper money between 1709 and 1724, but then listed no New Jersey bills in circulation

before 1724. Brock stated, “It is impossible to follow the retirement of the early issues with

precise accuracy.” Because he could not determine the amount of bills retired, he could not

                                                                                                              2
calculate the amount of bills left in circulation, thereby leaving the erroneous impression that no

bills were in circulation before 1724. As such, scholars using this source have incomplete and

inaccurate data, operating under an erroneous impression that no New Jersey paper money was

in circulation before 1724. The forensic accounting exercise here corrects this oversight, along

with many others.

        Forensic accounting uses existent records to reconstruct the accounts of interest to a

standard sufficient to meet legal criteria. Given that the records used are legislative, that standard

is appropriate. This reconstruction relies on tracking internal consistencies and coherences across

the existent records, and pays close attention to the execution details embedded in all relevant

laws. A detailed description of how this technique was applied to colonial New Jersey, provided

at the end of the paper, illustrates the comprehensive nature and the extent of coordination and

cross-consultation among the surviving records that comprise forensic accounting practices.

Such reconstruction techniques are valuable when the original records are disorganized,

incomplete, and partially lost. The government records reporting the paper money issued and

used by the various American colonies suffer these defects. 4 Thus, forensic accounting

reconstructions of these records may enhance the completeness and accuracy of the data on

colonial paper money.

        Past scholars did not reconstruct colonial paper money accounts. They simply reported


4
  For example, the annual treasury reports for the colony of New Jersey do not provide a comprehensive tracking of
the satisfaction of listed payment arrears, nor a comprehensive or easy to follow accounting of the redemption and
removal of bills from circulation. Compare the annual treasury reports in Documents Relating to the Colonial
History of the State of New Jersey (14 (1890), pp. 51-2, 119-26, 303-7, 375-80, 413-5, 439-49, 491-7; 15 (1891), pp.
68-78, 122-3, 173-82, 258-63, 305-7, 362-7, 562, 621-6; 17 (1892), pp. 257-65, 398-403; 18 (1893), pp. 56-63, 77-
82, 206-9, 222-5, 319-21, 408-11, 493-99, 553-7) with the comprehensive retrospective accounting of net
accumulated payment arrears still outstanding and cumulative bills still outstanding as reported by the legislative
assembly in 1769 and 1771 in Bush (1982, pp. 547-64; 1986, pp. 64-8). Following forensic accounting standards,
the legislative acts of the assembly are taken as definitive, namely as the final legal word, and so are used here,
rather than the treasury reports, to reconstruct the flow of paper money and provide accurate statements of
cumulative unpaid arrears along with the payment remedies imposed.

                                                                                                                  3
the numbers they ran across in the surviving records using a catch-as-catch-can approach, often

without checking for internal consistency and coherence, making use of the execution details in

the relevant laws, or evaluating the accuracy and bias in casual statements on amounts of paper

money in circulation made by correspondents of the era. For example, when combining all the

data previously reported by scholars on colonial New Jersey paper money in circulation, 15

percent of the years when New Jersey was using paper money are missing observations on those

amounts. By contrast, the forensic accounting techniques used here yield no missing

observations. For years with prior data, over 70 percent of those years report different values

among the various prior estimates. Nothing in the literature explains these discrepancies or

indicates which values should be preferred or why they should be preferred. In addition, the prior

literature seldom explains how their estimates were constructed, other than citing their sources

(see the Appendix, comparisons derived from Table A3). As such, present scholars are left with a

variety of conflicting data choices and no way to determine which are the more accurate.

        Not only are data missing in the prior literature, but the data reported are inaccurate. For

years with prior data on colonial New Jersey paper money in circulation, 84 percent of these

years report different values than the values reconstructed here. In only 35 percent of the years

with prior data does at least one past estimate match that generated here. Finally, for the years

that report prior data, the average values reported are on average 50 percent different in

magnitude than that reconstructed here (see the Appendix, comparisons derived from Table A3).

        Brock (1975, 1992) is the predominant data source used in modern quantitative studies of

colonial paper money and serves as the core source for the amount of colonial paper money in

circulation reported in the Historical Statistics. 5 Brock gathered his data before 1941 as part of

his 1941 Ph.D. dissertation. That dissertation was published unaltered in 1975. An alternative

data set compiled from Brock’s on-going research was published, not by Brock, but by others in

1992 after Brock’s death in 1985. The data in the 1992 publication differ, sometimes

substantially, from that in the 1941 dissertation. Why these data differ is not explained by the

author or by his posthumous publication assistants, nor is enough information given to

definitively determine how either data set was created. 6

         Confining the comparison of the reconstructed data reported here to the Brock (1975,

1992) data sets for the amounts of New Jersey paper money in circulation, the Brock data sets

are missing observations for 22 percent of the years when New Jersey paper money was in

circulation. The forensic accounting reconstruction here has no missing observations. For the

entire 1709-1775 period, the average yearly difference in magnitude between Brock’s 1941 and

1992 data and that reconstructed here is 24 and 32 percent, respectively. Restricting the data to

years when Brock reports positive sums, 63 and 69 percent of those years report different values,

using Brock’s 1941 and 1992 data, respectively, compared with the data reconstructed here. For

the years with data observations but differing values, the average yearly magnitudes differ by 3.9

and 18.3 percent between the data reconstructed here and Brock’s 1941 and 1992 data,

respectively. During a few years, these magnitude differences reached as high as 22 and 54

percent for Brock’s 1941 and 1992 data, respectively (see the Appendix, comparisons derived

from Table A3). In comparing data sets, it is the yearly differences in magnitude that matter to

the time-series analysis of monetary performance and not whether cumulative sums over long


6
  The amounts of bills in circulation reported in Brock (1992) are systematically larger than the amounts reported in
Brock (1975), see Appendix Table 3A. Brock (1992) relied on the New Jersey treasury reports, whereas Brock
(1975) did not. As explained in footnote 4, the treasury reports do not comprehensively account for the payment of
arrears or the removal of bills from circulation. As such, they likely over-imply the amount of bills left in
circulation. This may explain both the discrepancy between Brock (1992) and Brock (1975), as well as the greater
divergence between Brock (1992) and the results reported in Table 1 compared with those reported in Brock (1975).

                                                                                                                    5
spans of time are similar.

       Many of the same scholars, Brock (1975, 1992) in particular, who gathered the data for

colonial New Jersey also gathered the paper money data for other colonies using the same

methods as they used for New Jersey. By analogy, therefore, it is likely that the prior paper

money data for these other colonies may be as problematic as that for New Jersey. This presents

a substantial challenge to the profession, as it casts credible doubt on the accuracy of the core

data used in past quantitative studies of colonial paper money regimes, including those published

by this author. As such, the results reported in these studies may have to be discarded. New

opportunities, however, are created, namely the chance to redo past studies to improve our

understanding of colonial paper money performance once better data are constructed. In

summary, the data on colonial paper money that were gathered in the distant past are suspect and

ripe for correction using forensic accounting techniques. While forensic accounting, like any

accounting, can be tedious and boring, it nevertheless provides the necessary bedrock upon

which the answers to more interesting and substantive questions are erected.

       Forensic accounting also allow for a more extensive and nuanced reconstruction of

colonial monetary data than has been previously done. For example, the difference between what

was planned and what was executed can be identified. The prior literature seldom reported this

distinction. Such data distinctions allow for questions to be investigated that could not be

investigated before, such as exploring how well paper money regimes were executed by their

governments, how well the populus complied with paper money laws, why paper money laws

were altered post hoc, and how colonial paper money regimes would have performed in the

absence of British government interference. The results presented here improve the quantitative

data needed to explore the statistical relationships between money, prices, and exchange rates,



                                                                                                    6
and opens up potential investigations into many other aspects of colonial public finance that have

not been quantitatively analyzed before.

                                                     . . . . .

         Colonial New Jersey was chosen for this initial application of forensic accounting, in

part, because its paper money regime has not been systematically analyzed in the modern era.

The last efforts to study it quantitatively were between 1939 and 1956 (Brock 1975; Kemmerer

1939, 1940, 1956; Lester 1939). After these efforts, a more complete compilation of colonial

New Jersey laws became available (Bush 1977, 1980, 1982, 1986). This makes colonial New

Jersey a promising candidate for updating and improving the data on its paper money regime.

The focus here is on data reconstruction. For the political history of paper money in New Jersey

see Kemmerer (1940).

         Colonial New Jersey was also chosen because it printed the face value equivalence of

New Jersey pounds to silver plate, i.e. its par value, on the face of each bill throughout its history

of paper emissions, see Figure 1. This action established the specie value of the nominal face

value of a New Jersey bill at redemption. 7 No other colony printed the specie value on the face


7
  Some scholars have erroneously asserted that New Jersey shifted after 1752 from the par shown in Figure 1
(1.3275£NJ = 1£S) for New Jersey bills of credit to a par equal to that of Pennsylvania bills of credit, i.e. 1.6667£NJ =
1£S (McCusker 1978, p. 171). This error comes from confusing the current market value of a bill with its par value
at redemption, an error often made in the colonial historical literature. This error manifests itself here in the
misinterpretation of the “Acts for the Support of Government” which indicated that after 1752 New Jersey
provincial government salaries were priced “in Money as it now passes in the Western Division of this Colony.”
This was pricing only for paying government salaries; it did not change the par value of New Jersey bills of credit.
Because bills of credit were zero-coupon bonds with defined future redemption (maturity) dates, at which point their
face value would be honored by the government, their current value was not their face value but their present value
once time-discounting was taken into account. In 1764, Benjamin Franklin explained that due to time-discounting
the current value of a new bill was always about 20 percent less than its face value (Labaree 1967, v. 11, pp. 13-5).
As such, the present value of a new New Jersey bill would be about 1.6667£NJ = 1£S instead of its face value of
1.3275£NJ = 1£S. See also the implied conversion rates used in the New Jersey treasurers’ reports (Documents
Relating to the Colonial History of the State of New Jersey 18 (1893), pp. 59, 81). This is exactly the value that
McCusker (1978, p. 171) erroneously assumed was the “new par,” though he did note that this rate was just a
customary current value as opposed to an official par value. Apparently, after 1751 New Jersey government officials
responded to being paid in bills that were worth less than their face value due to time-discounting by requiring in
law that their salaries be priced in the approximate current market (present) value of the bills. Their salaries

                                                                                                                       7
         Figure 1          Example of New Jersey Paper Money, Issued 31 December 1763

         Source: Newman (2008, p. 258).
         Notes: “Plate” refers to silver (specie). 20 penny-weight, of 24 grains each, equals one troy ounce of silver
         plate. In 1763, six shillings in New Jersey pounds (£NJ) equals 0.3£NJ which is set equal to 0.875 ounces of
         silver, or 0.3429£NJ equals one ounce of silver, at face value. One pound sterling (£S) equals 3.8715 ounces
         of silver, or one ounce of silver equals 0.2583£S. Therefore, by equating both to one ounce of silver,
         0.3429£NJ at face value equals 0.2583£S, or 1.3275£NJ at face value equals one £S. See McCusker (1978, pp.
         8-10).


of their bills for all paper money emissions throughout their history (Newman 2008). Knowing

with certainty the specie value of bills upon redemption is important for making value

adjustments to the paper money emissions as executed by the legislature when par values were

changed by that legislature. For example, New Jersey swapped some of its paper money issued at

one par value before 1724 for paper money issued at a different par value after 1723. As such,

the par value of each emission needs to be known to produce a value-consistent time-series of

paper money face values. For other colonies, assertions about the par value of their respective

bills of credit in specie at redemption in most years are debatable, often being hard to track and

verify in the original surviving records. That is not the case for colonial New Jersey paper



multiplied by 1.25 yield the approximate amounts of New Jersey bills of credit needed to pay those stated salaries in
their current market value, i.e. “in Money as it now passes in the Western Division of this Colony.” This required
action did not change the par value of a New Jersey pound, i.e. its face value at redemption (at maturity). See Bush
(1980, pp. 234, 269, 327, 393, 472, 581, 640; 1982, pp. 5, 107, 191, 273, 309, 385, 427, 453, 505); and compare that
with the par value printed on the face of the bills in Newman (2008, pp. 249-58) and as explained in Figure 1.

                                                                                                                    8
money. Its par value in specie was always printed on the face of each bill. It is known with

certainty.

        What follows is only about the reconstruction of the official paper money issued and

redeemed by the New Jersey colonial government. The circulation of counterfeit monies and

other non-New Jersey issued monies, such as foreign gold and silver coins, wampum, or the

paper money issued by other colonies, is not addressed here. Such information is not relevant to

this study’s data reconstruction exercise.

        Scholars have yet to measure, to any reasonable standard of accuracy, the quantities of

counterfeit monies, foreign specie coins, and the paper monies of other colonies that circulated in

a given colony. This lack of knowledge should not stop scholars from wanting to have the most

accurate measure of the amount of official paper money issued and redeemed by colonial

governments. If nothing else, once scholars can measure the amounts of these other monies in a

colony, determining whether said amounts were trivial or substantial will depend on an accurate

count of the amounts of official paper money put into circulation by that respective colonial

government. In most historical and modern studies of monetary performance, estimates of

counterfeit monies and foreign monies in circulation are either not used, being unknown, or are

so tenuously estimated as to not inspire confidence. This state of affairs has not stopped scholars

from using the official money issued by the governments of interest to study monetary

performance and publish the results of such studies.

        Based on an extensive reading, but not on a systematic quantification, of merchant

accounts, government accounts, laws, official correspondence, newspaper stories, and comments

made by New Jersey subjects, the amounts of counterfeit monies and other non-New Jersey

issued monies in circulation in colonial New Jersey in this period appears trivial. Certainly there



                                                                                                   9
was trade across colony boundaries. New Jersey subjects engaged both in foreign trade and

extensive trade with New York and Pennsylvania subjects. In the process of such trade, monies

had to be exchanged. Thus, along New Jersey’s borders, New York and Pennsylvania paper

monies, as well as foreign gold and silver coins, can be found in use, especially among subjects

involved in cross-border trade. That such non-New Jersey monies penetrated into the day-to-day

transactions between New Jersey subjects is doubtful. The absence of ubiquitous evidence

speaking to such penetration is telling. 8 It is like today, where lots of different foreign monies

can be found at the airport, but that does not mean that such monies are commonly used in

transactions between local residents outside the airport.

         A similar conclusion is made about the amount of counterfeit New Jersey bills in

circulation in the colony, namely that it was at best a trivial nuisance. Certainly reports of

suspected counterfeiting circulated in colonial New Jersey, not just of colonial New Jersey bills,

but also of foreign coins, the paper monies of other colonies, and land mortgages. With regard to

actual cases of counterfeit New Jersey bills, the number of individuals mentioned and the amount

of counterfeit bills reported are relatively trivial. Counterfeit bills were easily spotted and so

could not continue in circulation long. The actions taken by the New Jersey government appear

to have effectively mitigated, if not completely eliminated, any effect counterfeit New Jersey

25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33 (1894, 1895, 1897, 1898, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1917, 1918, 1924, 1928). The
occasional statements by contemporaries claiming either that New Jersey paper money left the province for
circulation elsewhere or that Pennsylvania and New York paper monies were circulating in New Jersey appear to be
primarily rhetorical—used by advocates and detractors of new paper money emissions to advance their cause, e.g.
see Documents Relating to the Colonial History of the State of New Jersey (5 (1882), pp. 289, 305); Ernst (1973, p.
292). It is difficult to put much stock in these politically charged statements. On balance, specie monies (along with
any other monies) appear to have been chronically scarce as attested by the preambles to almost every paper money
act passed by the New Jersey assembly, see the source note to Table 1; Ernst (1973, pp. 285-6); Lundin (1940, pp.
51-61). On the relative prevalence of specie-scarcity statements by colonists and the theoretical conditions that make
such scarcity possible, see Grubb (2012).

outstanding, thereby eliminating a perceived counterfeiting threat that manifested itself at that

time. This was the only time New Jersey undertook such an action. 9

         Table 1 reconstructs the quantitative history of colonial New Jersey’s paper money

regime with all numbers reported in face value. This is a forensic accounting exercise using the

complete, as of this date, compiled legislative history and government correspondence of the

colony of New Jersey. Three components comprise this quantitative history, namely new

emissions, redemptions for the purpose of retirement, and the amounts currently outstanding, i.e.

in circulation. These three components are further separated into the amounts initially legislated

and planned, and the amounts actually executed.

         Redemptions for the purpose of retirement entailed removing paper money from

circulation and subsequently destroying it. New emissions and redemptions are reconstructed

from original sources. The amounts outstanding are derived by subtracting redemptions from

new emissions. Occasionally the amounts outstanding were mentioned in the original sources,

which in turn serves as alignment checks on this procedure. The [Mt] column is the actual

official New Jersey paper money supply in circulation. The data in Table 1 are substantial

revisions and improvements over that reported previously in the literature. The appendix

provides a complete comparison of these estimates with that previously reported.

         Paper money acts, besides setting the amount of new emissions, also established the

means, timing, and yearly amounts of each new emission to be redeemed, i.e. retired from

Notes: Shillings and pence are converted to decimalized pounds. £NJ = New Jersey paper pounds; £S = pounds
sterling. For bills of credit emitted from 1709 to 1723, the face (par) value is 1£NJ = 2.5 ounces of silver = 0.6458£S
(or 1.5486£NJ = 1£S). For bills of credit emitted after 1723, the face (par) value is 1£NJ = 2.9163 ounces of silver =
0.7533£S (1.3275£NJ = 1£S). Before 1724, values quoted in post-1723 par were converted to pre-1724 par to achieve
consistency in aggregation in these years.

  The year of implementation for the 1737 emission is based on the delay between Royal approval of the emissions
act and when that approval was transmitted to New Jersey. Pre-1718, the year of implementation is based on the lack
of any information indicating a delay between legislative passage and operational execution. For all others, the year
of implementation is based on the authorization date printed on the bills. See Newman (2008, pp. 247-58).

face value rate. Interest of 8 percent was paid on this sum from 1 December 1718 to 25 March 1724, which amounts
to 33.83£NJ(1724-1775). So a total of 113.12£NJ(1724-1775) was exchanged for part of the new 1724 emission, making the
net new emission for 1724 = 39,886.88£NJ(1724-1775) rather than the 40,000£NJ printed.

  Money for the support of government, e.g. salaries, were paid from bills left unspent in the treasury from the last

circulation. Moreover, the complete redemption and removal of an emission was established in

each respective emission’s paper money act or in an ancillary contemporaneous revenue act.

Subsequent acts sometimes changed these planned emissions and redemptions, or indicated the

incomplete execution of an act with the corrective actions to be taken to fulfill the intentions of

the original act. Explanations of the forensic accounting adjustments to the data are provided to

illustrate the process, with enough information given for scholars to replicate the results. 10 The

following description of the data construction process also helps illuminate how past scholars

likely constructed their data. This is important because in most cases their data construction

explanations are incomplete and so their data are hard to replicate (see the Appendix). A casual

reading of the original sources makes the process look quiet mysterious. The mystery is removed

in what follows.



10
   Top economic journals, such as the American Economic Review and the Journal of Political Economy, and others,
require authors to provide their data and econometric estimating algorithms so that other scholars can replicate the
author’s results. These journals do not, however, require authors to provide the information needed to replicate their
data constructions. This is a significant oversight. Getting the data right should be as important as getting the
econometric tests and estimating equations right. Being able to reproduce how data were constructed is important,
and the information needed to do such replication should be required of authors.

Queen Anne’s War Emissions, 1709-1717

       The first three emissions, in the years 1709, 1711, and 1717, respectively, were used to

finance New Jersey’s participation in Queen Anne’s War. The 1717 emission was also intended

to ameliorate the post-war trade depression (Kemmerer 1940, pp. 78-113). All three emissions

set one New Jersey pound equal to 2.5 ounces of silver, or 1.5486£NJ = 1£S, as its face value at

redemption. All three emissions were to be redeemed, i.e. retired, through taxes paid in these

bills within a few years of their initial emission.

       The first emission was in 1709. It was supposed to be for 3,000£NJ. Redemptions via

taxation were supposed to be 1,500£NJ in 1710 and 1,500£NJ in 1711. The eastern counties of

Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Somerset, and Monmouth were to pay 822.5£NJ per year, and the

western counties of Burlington, Gloucester, Salem, and Cape May were to pay 677.5£NJ per year.

These taxes were to be paid only in these bills. A 2.5 and 5 percent discount were also legislated

on the taxes paid in these bills in 1710 and 1711, respectively. These discounts implied that total

redemptions via taxation in 1710 as legislated would be 1,462.50£NJ [1,500 - (0.025 * 1,500)],

and in 1711 would be 1,425£NJ [1,500 - (0.05 * 1,500)]. As initially legislated, there would be

112.50£NJ of the first emission left over and unredeemed (Bush 1977, pp. 63-70).

       In 1711, the legislature reported that the first emission as executed was not 3,000£NJ as

initially legislated in 1709, but only 2,966.42£NJ. In addition, redemption taxes from the western

counties were delayed one year. As such, redemption taxes for the 1709 emission were now

supposed to be 822.5£NJ in 1710, 1,500£NJ in 1711, and 677.5£NJ in 1712. The legislature also

allowed taxes to now be paid in bills or silver money (Bush 1977, pp. 97-9). Bills still

outstanding in 1712 could then be swapped at the treasury for the silver money paid in by those

who paid their taxes in silver at the paper money’s face value.



                                                                                                   16
       In 1714, the legislature reported that redemption taxes paid in the bills of the 1709

emission were in arrears. They set aside 2,000£NJ that had been redeemed via taxation from the

5,000£NJ emitted in 1711 of the second emission, and ordered it not to be destroyed but instead

swapped for the bills of the first emission that were still outstanding (Bush 1977, pp. 128-30).

The amount of the first emission actually redeemed in 1710 through 1712, and the remaining

amount swapped for bills of the second emission in 1714 is back-cast estimated once the

redemption of the second emission is established.

       The second emission was in 1711. The money emission and tax redemption procedures

were laid out in separate acts. All values were listed in ounces, penny-weight, and grains of

silver plate rather than New Jersey pounds. They are converted to New Jersey pounds here and in

Table 1 for comparative purposes. The amount emitted was supposed to be 5,000£NJ with

1,000£NJ redeemed via taxation every year from 1712 through 1716. Only bills from the first and

second emissions were to be accepted in payment of the taxes imposed by the 1711 act (Bush

1977, pp. 103-13).

       In 1714, the legislature found that 999.65£NJ of the 5,000£NJ emitted in 1711 were still

unspent in the treasury. They ordered it spent (Bush 1977, pp. 127-8). The legislature reported

this 999.65£NJ amount in post-1723 par values, which converts to 1,166.19£NJ in pre-1723 par

values. Thus, the second emission of 5,000£NJ consisted of 3,833.81£NJ put into circulation in

1711 and 1,166.19£NJ put into circulation in 1714. As noted above, in 1714 the legislature also

ordered that 2,000£NJ of the second emission redeemed by 1714 be not destroyed, but instead

used to swap for bills from the first emission that were still unredeemed and in circulation.

       In 1717, the legislature revealed that some townships in Burlington County had not paid

their taxes for 1714 that were part of the 1,000£NJ sum designated for bill redemption that year.



                                                                                                   17
This sum amounted to 134.63£NJ. They were to pay that amount by March 1717. In 1717, the

legislature also indicated that 1,794.75£NJ from the second emission were still unredeemed at the

beginning of 1717 (Bush 1977, pp. 209-13, 223-5; 1986, pp. 385-8).

       Starting with this 1,794.75£NJ sum at the close of 1716, and working backward through

the emissions and redemptions of the second (1711) emission as laid out above, yields the sums

of the first (1709) emission that were actually redeemed between 1710 and 1712 and the amount

actually swapped for bills of the second emission in 1714. This back-cast estimate indicates that

of the 2,000£NJ bills of the second emission redeemed by 1714 and set aside to swap for bills of

the first emission still outstanding, only 1,660.12£NJ were so swapped, leaving 1,306.30£NJ out of

the first emission that were redeemed between 1710 and 1712. Prorating this amount by the

percentage slated for the actual redemption of the first emission each year, as laid out above,

leaves actual redemptions of the first emission to be 358.14£NJ in 1710, 653.15£NJ in 1711, and

295.01£NJ in 1712, e.g. for 1710 [822.5£NJ / 3,000£NJ) * 1,306.30£NJ = 358.14£NJ]. This

completes the adjustments through 1716 and yields the results as reported in Table 1.

       The third emission was in 1717. The money emission and tax redemption procedures

were laid out in separate acts. All values were listed in ounces, penny-weight, and grains of

silver plate rather than New Jersey pounds. In addition, taxes, but not the paper money, were

priced at Queen Anne’s 1704 Proclamation Rate of 1£NJ = 2.9163 ounces of silver = 0.7533 £S, or

1.3275£NJ = 1£S (McCusker 1978, pp. 126, 168; Nettels 1934, pp. 242-9). All values are

converted here and in Table 1 for comparative purposes to the rate listed on the face of the New

Jersey paper pound pre-1724, which was 1 £NJ = 2.5 ounces of silver = 0.6458 £S, or 1.5486£NJ =

1£S. This means that tax values reported at Queen Anne’s Proclamation Rate are multiplied by

1.1667 to make them comparable with the pre-1724 New Jersey paper pound values.



                                                                                                  18
       The new amount emitted was supposed to be 4,670£NJ. The legislature, however,

indicated that 1,794.75£NJ from the second emission were still unredeemed at the start of 1717.

These bills were to be swapped for bills of the third emission. As such, the amount of net new

bills put into circulation from the third emission was 2,875.25£NJ [4,670£NJ - 1794.75£NJ] (Bass

1717, p. 19; Bush 1977, pp. 209-23; 1986, pp. 385-8).

       Property taxes to redeem these bills spanned three years, two 18-month stretches, but

effectively were paid in 1717 and 1718, with 2,046.44£NJ paid each year. In addition, an excise

tax on liquor of 350£NJ per year for five years, from 1718 through 1722, was to be used to

redeem these bills. All taxes were to be paid in these bills only and no other medium (Bush 1977,

pp. 193-5, 209-23; 1986, pp. 385-8).

       The total taxes slated to redeem the bills of the third emission exceeded the amount of

bills that were supposed to be put into circulation. Given this, in 1719 the legislature designated

the liquor excise taxes for 1719 and 1720 that were slated to redeem the bills of the third

emission to now be paid instead in specie and diverted to the direct support of the government,

e.g. paying administrator salaries. Similarly, in 1722 the legislature designated that the remaining

liquor excise taxes for 1721 and 1722 that were initially slated to redeem the bills of the third

emission be paid instead in specie or wheat and diverted to the direct support of the government

(Bush 1977, pp. 231-43, 277-84).

       Finally, in 1719, the legislature stated that the taxes assessed in 1717 and 1718 to redeem

bills of the third emission amounting to 1,040.05£NJ were in arrears. They were now to be paid in

1719 (Bush 1977, pp. 231-43). Prorating this amount over the years 1717 and 1718, subtracting

that amount from the planned redemption taxes, and adding in the tax arrears paid in 1717 by

Burlington County as mentioned above, yields the actual redemptions and amounts outstanding



                                                                                                    19
in Table 1. From 1720 through 1723, 92.50£NJ remained unredeemed and in circulation. That

sum would finally be swapped in 1724 for bills of the fourth emission.

The Three Land-Bank (Loan-Office) Emissions (1724, 1733, and 1737); and the War of Jenkins’

Ear (1740) and King George’s War (1746-7) Emissions

        Land-bank emissions entailed printing bills and then allowing subjects to borrow the bills

on interest with subjects pledging their lands as collateral for the loans. The acts authorizing

these land-bank emissions established the interest rate to be paid (typically several percentage

points below the going market rate), the principal repayment period, how interest and principal

payments would be used by the government, how loaned bills would be retired from circulation,

a loan size limit on individual borrowings, collateral requirements for loans (typically double the

value in land assessment per loaned amount), procedures for assessing land values, the

procedures for foreclosing on and selling the lands of delinquent borrowers, how to deal with

counterfeiters, the legal tender status of the bills, penalties for not accepting the bills as a legal

tender, a system of county loan offices and loan-office commissioners, and their salaries (Bush

1977, pp. 301-19, 427-38, 474-87; Kemmerer 1940; Lester 1939b, pp. 123-31). All bills emitted

after 1722 had their par value at redemption set according to the rate established by the 1704

Proclamation of Queen Anne, i.e. 1£NJ = 2.9163 ounces of silver, which was also the rate printed

on every bill after 1722. This rate works out to 1.3275£NJ = 1£S, see Figure 1.

        The New Jersey legislature passed the fourth emission, which was the first loan-office or

land-bank emission, in 1723. It commenced in 1724 and consisted of 40,000£NJ. Of this amount,

4,000£NJ was to be exchanged in 1724 for any unredeemed bills still outstanding from the first

three emissions, with any leftover balances used for the general support of government, e.g. to

pay government salaries and per diem expenses. Interest of 8 percent on these unredeemed bills



                                                                                                         20
accruing from 1 December 1718 to 25 March 1724 was also to be paid in bills of the fourth

emission (Bush 1977, pp. 301-19).

         The above analysis indicates that 92.50£NJ, at the old rate of 1£NJ = 2.5 ounces of silver,

remained outstanding from 1719 into 1724. This amount converts to 79.29£NJ at the new post-

1723 rate of 1£NJ = 2.9163 ounces of silver. The 8 percent interest payment on this 79.29£NJ

amount would be 33.83£NJ, for a total bill swap of 113.12£NJ (79.29£NJ + 33.83£NJ) at the new

rate for the old bills that were still outstanding in 1724. Therefore, the actual net new amount for

the fourth emission was 39,886.88£NJ. This exchange left 3,886.80£NJ out of the 4,000£NJ for the

general support of government. Taxes of 1,000£NJ per year for the first four years, from 1725

through 1728, were to redeem and retire from circulation this 4,000£NJ portion of the 40,000£NJ

fourth emission (Bush 1977, pp. 301-19).

         The rest of the fourth emission, 36,000£NJ, was to be loaned out for 12 years at 5 percent

interest with the loans secured by land mortgages on the respective borrowers’ properties. Total

principal repayments on this 36,000£NJ loaned sum were to be 3,060£NJ per year for the first 10

years, from 1725 through 1734, and 2,700£NJ for the last two years, from 1735 through 1736.

Out of the annual interest payments made on these loans, 479£NJ per year was set aside to pay the

annual salaries of the loan-office commissioners, with the rest used to retire the emission’s

bills. 11 In addition, taxes of 1,000£NJ per year from 1729 through 1734 were to be paid in these

bills and used to retire them from circulation.

         As far as can be determined, i.e. given no legislative or government correspondence to

the contrary, the entire 36,000£NJ was loaned out with the principal and interest paid back as

11
   Total loan-officer salaries paid per year are determined by indentifying the number of loan officers per county,
which was not the same across counties, multiplying those numbers by the salaries set for the officers from each
county, which was also not the same across counties, and then summing up the values. This information was
embedded in each land bank emission act, or in subsequent ancillary acts. The interest money used to pay these
salaries went back into circulation. It could not serve to redeem or retire bills of credit.

                                                                                                                      21
scheduled. In 1724, New Jersey Governor Burnet stated that “the common Interest of money is 8

per Cent” (Documents Relating to the Colonial History of the State of New Jersey, 5, p. 91).

Given that the market interest rate was 8 percent and the rate on borrowing New Jersey paper

pounds was set at 5 percent, the likeliness of this outcome should not be surprising (Rabushka

2008, p. 496). The intent of the law was to subsidize borrowings to insure all the bills were put

into circulation. Finally, subjects were allowed to pay their taxes, loan principals, and interest in

either bills of the fourth emission at face value or in wheat at its market price in New York and

Philadelphia minus a transport cost (Bush 1977, pp. 301-19).

       The redemption structure as initially legislated was overly aggressive in that it retired

bills from circulation faster than the 12-year loan repayment schedule. If followed rigidly, by

1732 no bills would be left in circulation for borrowers to use to repay their loan principals and

interest as scheduled for the years 1733 through 1736 (Bush 1977, pp. 341-2). In addition, by

1734 the annual loan-office commissioners’ salaries that were to be paid out of the annual

interest received on the loaned sums would exceed the annual interest payments received.

       To address these issues, the legislature made a series of adjustments to the initial

emission plan. In 1725 and again in 1728 and 1730, they took the annual interest payments

received, net of loan-office commissioner annual salary payments that were to be used to retire

bills, and diverted it to be used instead for the general support of the government. In 1725, they

also diverted the 1,000£NJ in annual taxes paid in fourth-emission bills for the years 1729 and

1730, that were initially slated for bill retirement, to be used instead for the general support of

government (Bush 1977, pp. 340-50, 379-81, 400-2).

       In 1728, the legislature reduced the annual loan-office commissioners’ salaries that were

paid out of annual loan interest payments from 479£NJ to 239.50£NJ for the remaining years of



                                                                                                      22
1729 through 1735 (Bush 1977, pp. 385-6). This change not only meant that more annual interest

money would now be available for the general support of the government, but also that the

annual interest payments received would now fully cover the annual loan-office commissioners’

salaries through March 1736, when the loan-office for this emission would end. Finally, in 1730,

the legislature diverted the 1,000£NJ in annual taxes paid in fourth-emission bills for the years

1731 through 1734, that were initially slated for bill retirement, to be used instead for the general

support of government (Bush 1977, pp. 403-7). When bills were used for the general support of

government instead of being retired, they were spent and so kept in circulation.

       These adjustments realigned redemptions for the purpose of retiring bills from circulation

to match what was needed to sustain payments on loans and interest over the 12-year loan

repayment window from 1724 through 1736 in these bills. By April 1736, no bills from the

fourth emission would still be in circulation. Before 1736, enough bills of the fourth emission

would be in circulation to fulfill scheduled loan payments in those bills. These adjustments yield

the yearly numbers in Table 1 for actual redemptions and amounts actually outstanding as

executed for the fourth emission.

       One check on these numbers comes from May 1728 when the legislature reported that

24,760£NJ were currently outstanding (Bush 1977, pp. 355-63). This amount was before the

1,000£NJ tax was collected for that year. Subtracting the 1,000£NJ tax collected in September of

that year, yields 23,760£NJ bills outstanding for 1728 which is exactly what the forensic

accounting procedure in Table 1 finds.

       The fifth emission, second loan-office or land-bank emission, was passed in 1732 and

went into effect in 1733. It was for 20,000£NJ, all of which were to be loaned out to subjects who

pledged their lands as collateral. The loan repayment period was 16 years, from 1733 to 1749.



                                                                                                    23
Annual interest payments on the loaned sums were set at 5 percent. Annual principal payments

were to be 1/16th of the loaned amount each year, but with the principal received for the first

eight years, from 1734 through 1741, re-loaned. Only the principal received in the last eight

years, from 1742 through 1749, amounting to 2,500£NJ per year, was to be used to retire these

bills from circulation. The annual interest payments were used to pay loan-office commissioner

salaries with the leftover amounts used for the general support of the government (Bush 1977,

pp. 427-38, 446-8, 453-7).

       The sixth emission, third loan-office or land-bank emission, was passed in 1735, but did

not receive Royal approval and go into effect until 1737. It was for 40,000£NJ, all of which were

to be loaned out to subjects who pledged their lands as collateral. It was structured the same as

the second loan-office emission. The loan repayment period was 16 years, from 1737 to 1753.

Annual interest payments on the loaned sums were set at 5 percent. Annual principal payments

were to be 1/16th of the loaned amount each year, but with the principal received for the first

eight years, from 1738 through 1745, re-loaned. Only the principal received in the last eight

years, from 1746 through 1753, amounting to 5,000£NJ per year, was to be used to retire these

bills from circulation. The annual interest payments were used to pay loan-office commissioner

salaries with the leftover amounts used for the general support of the government (Bush 1977,

pp. 474-87, 498-502).

       The seventh emission occurred in 1740. The legislature took 2,000£NJ from the extra bills

printed for the fifth emission that were held in reserve to exchange for worn and ragged bills and

spent them to pay for the colony’s participation in the War of Jenkins’ Ear. Emission acts

frequently had provisions that required extra bills of that emission to be printed above that

authorized to be emitted. These extra bills were held in reserve and only used to swap for worn



                                                                                                    24
and ragged bills that could no longer continue in circulation. Being a one-for-one swap of bills,

these extra bills did not change the amounts emitted, redeemed, or in circulation. The 2,000£NJ

emitted in 1740 were to be retired in increments of 500£NJ each year from 1743 through 1746 out

of the interest payments received on the loans of the fifth and sixth emissions. The said interest

money was now to be retired and destroyed rather than spent for the general support of

government (Bush 1977, pp. 531-3).

       In 1771, the legislature audited the payments by the counties to the colony’s treasury to

determine tax arrears and arrears of principal and interest on land-bank borrowings between

1722 and 1771. Failure to pay principal on loans, which would have been bills taken out of

circulation, amounted to 506.03£NJ between 1742 and 1752. This sum was apportioned and

prorated in Table 1 such that 63.50£NJ and 63.51£NJ were subtracted from redemptions as

executed in 1742 and 1743, respectively, and 42.11£NJ was subtracted from redemptions as

executed in 1744 through 1752. These sums were to be paid in 1773 (Bush 1986, pp. 64-8).

       Total tax arrears, along with the arrears of land-bank borrowing repayments of both

principal and interest, between 1722 and 1771 amounted only to 726.09£NJ (Bush 1986, pp. 64-

8). The tax and interest arrears were monies used for the support of government and not monies

slated for bill retirement. Thus, these arrears were not subtracted from executed redemptions in

Table 1. The overall small amount of arrears between 1722 and 1771 indicates substantial

compliance with taxes imposed and loan repayment requirements as legislated over this period.

       The eighth emission occurred in 1746 and 1747. It was used to support New Jersey’s

participation in King George’s War. In total, the eighth emission consisted of 16,850£NJ emitted

in 1746 and 1,000£NJ emitted in 1747. This total was comprised of 10,000£NJ of newly printed

bills in 1746. The additional sum of 4,000£NJ in extra bills printed of the sixth emission, that was



                                                                                                   25
originally slated to be held in reserve and used only to replace worn and ragged bills, was now

emitted as new in 1746. The additional sum of 2,000£NJ bills collected from the interest

payments on the land-bank emissions from 1743 through 1746, originally slated to retire the

seventh emission, was now rolled over and spent anew in 1746. The additional sum of 850£NJ in

extra bills printed of the eighth emission’s newly printed bills, that were originally slated to be

held in reserve and used only to replace worn and ragged bills, were now released and spent as

new in 1746. Finally, 1,000£NJ in extra bills printed of the eighth emission’s newly printed bills,

that were originally slated to be held in reserve and only used to replace worn and ragged bills,

were now released and spent as new in 1747 (Bush 1980, pp. 15-28, 31-3, 37-9).

       The 1,000£NJ emitted in 1747 and the 850£NJ emitted in 1746 were to be redeemed in

1753 out of accumulated interest money received from the fifth and sixth emissions, namely

from the second and third land-bank emissions. The 4,000£NJ and 2,000£NJ sums emitted in 1746

were to be redeemed out of interest money received from the fifth and sixth emissions at the rate

of 1,000£NJ each year for six years, with the six years being 1747, 1748, and 1750 through 1753.

The 10,000£NJ of newly printed bills in 1746 was expected to be redeemed by specie

reimbursements from the Crown after the war, an expectation that went unrealized (Bush 1980,

pp. 15-28, 31-3, 37-9). Finally, in 1748, the legislature discovered that 1,253.78£NJ of the

10,000£NJ new bills struck in 1746 were still unspent in the Treasury. They ordered them to be

spent on the support of government (Bush 1980, pp. 81-2). These numbers complete the

emissions and redemptions as planned through 1753 and, with the accumulated adjustments

above, the emissions and redemptions as executed through 1749 as reported in Table 1.

       After 1749, the scheduled interest payments received net of salary payments to the loan-

office commissioners from the sixth emission’s loans (the third land-bank emission’s loans) were



                                                                                                      26
insufficient to meet the planned redemptions as legislated that were to be taken from said interest

payments. These interest payment shortfalls, along with the tax arrears apportioned for the years

1750 through 1752 mentioned above, were subtracted from the scheduled redemptions to yield

the executed redemptions from 1750 through 1753 as reported in Table 1.

       The legislature foresaw that interest payments after 1749 would be insufficient to meet

redemptions as legislated. In 1748, they passed a fourth land-bank emission that was identical in

structure and size to the third land-bank emission of 1737. If the fourth land-bank emission

would have been put into operation, the interest payments would have been enough to cover the

redemptions as legislated. The Crown, however, disallowed this act in 1749 (Bush 1980, p. 104;

1986, pp. 441-56).

       In 1753, the legislature stated that 15,302.02£NJ bills from prior emissions were still

unredeemed and in circulation. They were not yet aware of the 506.03£NJ principal repayment

arrears discovered in 1771. Adding that amount to the amount the legislature calculated

[15,302.02£NJ + 506.03£NJ] equals 15,808.05£NJ which is only 0.02£NJ more than that found in

Table 1 for the actual amount outstanding in 1753; this difference is due to rounding only. The

coincidence of these two numbers corroborates and justifies the forensic procedures and amounts

reported in Table 1 up through 1753.

       The amount the legislature thought was outstanding in 1753 was to be redeemed and

retired through tax payments of 1,530.20£NJ each year from 1754 through 1763 (Bush 1980, pp.

219-33). These redemption taxes are not included in the “as proposed and planned” columns in

Table 1 as they were not needed if the initial legislation was followed. As such, they are included

only in the “as actually executed” columns in Table 1.

The French and Indian War Emissions (1755-1764)



                                                                                                  27
       The next 14 emissions supported New Jersey’s participation in the Seven Years’ War

from 1755 through 1762, as well as the lingering Indian wars on the frontier in 1763 and 1764.

These emissions were to be redeemed through future tax payments. Table 2 reports these

legislated emissions and tax-redemption amounts as reported in 1765 by Joseph Sherwood, agent

for New Jersey in Britain. Table 2 corrects some addition and placement errors in Sherwood’s

original table, with the exception of not moving emission #11 listed as being emitted December

1755 to 1756 when it was actually emitted. These numbers, with the mentioned corrections, are

consistent with the original legislative acts and yield the values in Table 1 under the “as proposed

and planned” columns.

       Two adjustments are needed to get the numbers under the “as actually executed”

columns. First, the tax arrears of 506.03£NJ for the purpose of bill retirement in 1742 through

1752, that were discovered in 1771 (mentioned above), were added back into actual redemptions

in 1773. This was when the 1771 act required these tax arrears to be paid (Bush 1986, pp. 64-8).

       Second, taxes for the support of governments, i.e. administration salaries, for the years

1760 through 1771 were paid out of newly printed bills that were left unspent in the treasury. In

other years, annual support-of-government salaries were paid out of direct taxes imposed for that

year (Bush 1980, 639-57; 1982, pp. 5-13, 107-11, 191-5, 273-6, 309-12, 385-8, 427-31, 453-6,

505-8, 577-80; 1986, pp. 25-8, 28-9, 53-8, 115-9). For the years 1760 through 1764, this means

diverting bills emitted for the purpose of funding military expenses to the support of government.

Apparently the assembly’s estimate of military expenses was higher than the realized costs,

leaving unspent bills in the treasury from the bills authorized and printed to cover war expenses.

       For the years 1765 through 1771, the amount spent on the support of government out of

the bills left unspent in the treasury was approximately 27,687.34£NJ. These were bills created



                                                                                                   28

before 1765 that were not put into circulation until after 1764. They were only emitted into

circulation via spending on the support for government from 1765 through 1771. The amounts

used for the support of government from 1765 through 1771 are assumed to come from the sums

left over from the last two authorized emissions, 10,000£NJ in 1763 and 25,000£NJ in 1764, for a

total of 35,000£NJ in new bills authorized and printed over those two years. The total amount of

bills used out of these last two emissions to pay for the support of government each year from

1763 through 1771 was subtracted from the total 35,000£NJ authorized in 1763 and 1764. The

left over residual, which was military spending, was placed in 1763 as being emitted into

circulation that year. As such, these last two authorizations were slowly emitted into circulation

from 1763 through 1771. This action did not alter the redemption process or redemption taxes

that were in place.

       At the end of 1771, the total sum emitted from 1763 through 1771 equaled the 35,000£NJ

authorized in 1763 and 1764. After 1771, the support-for-government acts stopped spending bills

still unused in the treasury and reverted to direct taxation to pay government salaries and other

expenses. The direct taxes established in the prior paper money acts to retire bills from

circulation were left unaltered and unaffected by this action. This action also indicated that by

1772, the initial unspent bills from the 1763 and 1764 authorizations had finally all been spent

and put into circulation.

       Calculating the sums spent out of the yearly support-for-government acts from 1763

through 1771 entailed summing the individual per annum salaries and other yearly expenses

listed in each act. Additional per diem spending in each support-for-government act could not be

directly calculated due to the lack of information on the incident of their occurrence. These items

included amounts paid to each assemblyman for every day they attended the legislature,



                                                                                                    30
payments to judges for each time their court met, and so on. Total per diem payments were

estimated to be on average 727.46£NJ per year. This sum was added to the sum of individual per

annum salaries and other yearly expenses listed in each act to get total bills spent, and so a

measure of the bills newly emitted into circulation, each year.

       The 727.46£NJ per year per diem estimate comes from taking the average difference

between the taxes imposed to pay for the support of government and the non-per diem spending

in each support-for-government act passed from 1753 through 1759 (Bush 1980, pp. 234-51,

269-87, 327-44, 393-409, 472-88, 581-97, 639-57). These were years when the support of

government was paid through direct taxation. The listings of per diem spending in these years

was the same as in the support-for-government acts from 1763 through 1771. The assembly is

assumed to have the best knowledge of what the average expected per diem expenses would be.

That knowledge is reflected in the difference between the taxes imposed by the assembly to pay

for the support of government and the non-per diem spending in each support-for-government

act passed. That knowledge is taken here as the estimate of average annual per diem spending in

support-for-government acts.

       In addition, after 1752 the individual per annum salaries listed in the support-for-

government acts were reported in the “Money, as it now passes in the Western Division of this

Colony.” This was pricing only for paying annual government salaries; it did not change the par

value of New Jersey bills of credit. Because bills of credit were zero-coupon bonds with defined

future redemption (maturity) dates, at which point their face value would be honored by the

government, their current value was not their face value. Their current value was their present

value, namely a value reduced by time-discounting. In 1764, Benjamin Franklin explained that

due to time-discounting the current (present) value of a new bill was always about 20 percent



                                                                                                  31
less than its face value (Labaree 1967, v. 11, pp. 13-5). As such, the approximate present value

of a newly emitted New Jersey bill was about 1.6667£NJ = 1£S as opposed to its face value of

1.3275£NJ = 1£S.

       Apparently, after 1751 New Jersey government officials responded to being paid in new

bills that were worth less than their face value due to time-discounting by requiring, in law, that

their salaries be priced in the approximate present value of the new bills. Using the 20 percent

estimate of the present value reduction from face value for newly emitted bills implies that their

salaries multiplied by 1.25 yields the approximate amount of New Jersey bills of credit at face

value needed to pay those stated salaries as priced in present value terms. This rate was used to

convert the support-for-government annual spending sums into face value units of New Jersey

paper pounds in Table 1. The one exception was the 500£NJ spent on troops in 1770, which was

priced in New Jersey paper pounds at their face value (Bush 1982, pp. 5-9, 107-11, 153, 191-5,

273-6, 309-12, 385-8, 427-31, 453-6, 505-8; 1986, pp. 25-8).

       Finally, the method for calculating the average 727.46£NJ per year per diem spending to

be added to the annual support-for-government spending eliminates the need for this present

value-to-face value conversion for these per diem amounts, and so they were added to the annual

spending amounts at their face value amount. This method entailed taking the annual salaries

scaled up to face value by multiplying them by 1.25, and then subtracting that sum from the face

value of the taxes imposed to pay for the support of government. The resulting amount is the sum

needed to pay estimated per diem expenses expressed in New Jersey bills at face value, which is

the 727.46£NJ number used.

       A consistency check corroborates these forensic accounting results. In 1769, the New

Jersey legislature, in an act to re-proportion taxes among the counties for the purpose of retiring



                                                                                                    32
these New Jersey bills of credit, stated that 190,000£NJ were currently outstanding (Bush 1982,

pp. 547-64). In 1769, the actual sum estimated in Table 1 as currently outstanding was

182,827.66£NJ. Adding the unspent bills still in the treasury that would be spend in 1770 and

1771, and subtracting the tax arrears that would be paid in 1773, yields exactly the 190,000£NJ

number stated by the legislature, i.e. (182,827.66£NJ + 3,945.19£NJ + 3,733.18£NJ - 506.03£NJ) =

190,000£NJ. 12

         Scholars have found it difficult to account for the empirical relationships between paper

money in circulation, prices, and exchange rates in British North American colonies using

standard monetary models—giving rise to the colonial monetary puzzle. The data reconstruction

exercise here indicates that these prior studies may not have been able to distinguish between

poor data (for their respective colonies of study) and poor model performance. In addition, the

paucity of data distinguishing between what was legislatively planned and what was actually


12
   On 21 July 1768, a sum of 6,750.47 expressed in New Jersey pound units of account was reported stolen from the
Eastern Treasury of the province of New Jersey (Documents Relating to the Colonial History of the State of New
Jersey 18 (1893), pp. 57-62, 78-82, 208, 320, 381, 387, 494; Ernest 1973, p. 292). How this stolen sum might have
affected the number of New Jersey bills of credit emitted, redeemed, or left in circulation is unclear. No adjustment
is made here to the values in Table 1 to account for this stolen sum for the following reasons: What actual monies
comprised the stolen sum is unknown. The monies flowing into the Eastern Treasury were reported to be 3,401£NJ in
New Jersey paper bills of credit and 37,221£NJ in pounds sterling as expressed in New Jersey pound units of
account. In other words, when the thieves broke open the treasurer’s strong box, over 91 percent of the value of the
money they faced was in pounds sterling and less than 9 percent was in New Jersey paper bills of credit. There were
not enough New Jersey bills of credit in the treasurer’s possession to account for the 6,750.47£NJ sum stolen. It
would seem incredulous to assume that the thieves would ignore the pounds sterling or fail to confine their thievery
to the pounds sterling only, given the relatively small sum stolen. The large sum of pounds sterling in the Eastern
Treasury at this point in time was part of the recently received Parliamentary donations to the colonies. These
donations were to compensate the colonies for the monies they spent supporting the last war. The presence of this
large sum of pounds sterling may explain the robbery in the first place. As such, the theft likely had no effect on the
volume or disposition of New Jersey paper bills of credit emitted, redeemed, or left in circulation.
         A similar conclusion can be made regarding the return of a sum of 500£NJ to the treasury that was found by
the wife of a former treasurer at their home, a sum that apparently no one knew existed (Ernst 1973, p. 292). This
sum was part of the extra bills printed that were held in reserve and only used to exchange for worn and ragged bills
that could no longer continue in circulation. As such, its disposition, i.e. whether it sat unused at the former
treasurer’s home or in the treasury would have no net effect on the emissions or redemptions of New Jersey bills,
and therefore no net effect on the amounts left in circulation.

                                                                                                                    33
executed has limited the scope of questions that can be quantitatively investigated regarding

colonial monetary behavior. As such, creating better quantitative data on monetary aggregates is

the necessary first step to resolving the colonial monetary puzzle and adding evidential power to

future reassessments of colonial public finances.

       Time series of the components of colonial New Jersey’s paper money regime were

reconstructed using forensic accounting techniques. This exercise produced substantial

improvements in data quality and quantity. The result is a more complete and nuanced

accounting of colonial New Jersey’s paper money regime than what has been done previously for

any British North American colony. The magnitude of these improvements suggests that such

techniques could be fruitfully applied to other British North American colonies. Many of the

scholars who gathered the prior data for New Jersey also gathered the paper money data for other

colonies using the same methods as they used for New Jersey. By analogy, therefore, it is likely

that the prior paper money data for these other colonies may be as problematic as that for New

Jersey. In conclusion, the data on colonial paper money that were gathered in the past are suspect

and ripe for reconstruction using forensic accounting techniques. The exercise presented here for

colonial New Jersey provides a guide for those future reconstruction efforts.

                                                   Appendix

        This appendix consists of three tables that compare the quantities of colonial New Jersey

paper money from 1709 to 1775 reported in the prior literature with that reported here in Table 1.

Table A1 compares estimates of new emissions, Table A2 compares estimates of the amounts

redeemed and retired from circulation, and Table A3 compares estimates of the amounts

currently outstanding, i.e. in circulation. The past sources listed in the tables often rely on the

prior sources listed in the tables and so are not fully independent. Most of the prior primary

research was done between 1939 and 1956 by Brock, Kemmerer, and Lester.

        The forensic accounting exercise reported in Table 1 corrects numerous oversights and

errors in this prior literature. See the text above for a quantitative summary of the magnitude of

these corrections. Some of these errors come from not distinguishing between what was

legislatively planned and what was actually executed. Some are timing placement errors,

confusing an earlier discussion of an event with the date when it was performed. Some errors are

just omissions of data by some authors either on new emissions, redemptions, or bills

outstanding, and some are simply transcription errors. The biggest error involves the period

1709-1724 and the amounts redeemed and in circulation (Table A2 and A3). Most authors report

nothing for these years, and the few that do report something are substantially off in magnitude.

Unlike here, the prior literature often does not explain how their data were constructed in enough

detail to reconstruct it from the original sources they cite.

Notes: See the notes to Table 1 and Figure 1. The numbers reported in Kemmerer (1939, 1940, 1956) are not
consistent, and his later works are not necessarily superior to, or more comprehensive than, his earlier works.
Rabushka (2008, pp. 401, 495-8) follows Brock (1975). Rabushka (2008, p. 653) follows Brock (1975) with the
exception that Rabushka reports 15,302£NJ for 1753, 40,000£NJ for 1757, and no numbers after 1762. The sources of
these differences are unknown. No justification is given.
a
  Kemmerer (1940, pp. 177, 238) is ambiguous as to whether this is a new emission or just a redirection of spending
of existing bills.
b
  Kemmerer (1940, p. 238) provides an inconsistent alternative estimate of 12,850£NJ for 1746.
c
  Kemmerer (1956) provides an inconsistent alternative estimate of 17,850£NJ for 1746.
d
  Sherwood’s redemption total for this emission adds up to 17,500£NJ.

Notes: See the notes to Table 1 and Figure 1. ? under Brock (1941) signifies that he did not clearly state how many
years this redemption total ran. ? under Kemmerer (1940) indicates that these retirements may not have been fully
executed.
a
  As reported in Wicker (1985, p. 874). The original amount was reported in sterling, i.e.181,176.44£S, which at face
value equals 240,511.72£NJ, and was to be redeemed in equal amounts over the next 17 years starting in 1764, which
yields the 10,657£NJ reported in the table.
b
  Kemmerer (1940, 1956) miscopied his source (Sherwood 1851, p. 147). He misplaced the 10,000£NJ redeemed in
1760, placing it instead in the year 1766.

Notes: See the notes to Table 1 and Figure 1. Most modern sources reporting data on colonial New Jersey paper
money in circulation are derivative of Brock (1975), originally from 1941. For example, Carter (2006, vol. 5, pp.
692-6) was compiled by John J. McCusker from Brock (1975), Newman (2008), and Kemmerer (1956). McCallum
(1992) is taken from Brock (1975). Smith (1985a, p. 548) is taken from Brock (1975) with transcription errors in the
years 1742 and 1743 (1742 should be 57,500£NJ and 1743 should be 55,000£NJ). Rabushka (2008, pp. 653, 820) is
taken from Brock (1992) with the following exceptions: 21,711£NJ is reported for 1753, 73,868£NJ for 1757,
236,488£NJ for 1762, 230,094£NJ for 1767, 220,069£NJ for 1768, and 227,539£NJ for 1769. No explanation is given
for these exceptions. They mostly appear to be transcription errors, with the number for 1767 possibly being derived
by ignoring Brock (1992, p. 113). Rabushka (2008, pp. 495-8) follows Brock (1975). Sumner (1993) and Weiss
(1970) report no data for New Jersey.

  This is the amount that 92.50£NJ in pre-1724 face value converts into at the new 1724-1775 face value. See the text
and the notes to Table 1 for discussion.

  Alternative and inconsistent estimates made by Brock (1975, pp. 89, 91, 393) include 24,760£NJ for 1728,
37,800£NJ for 1749, and 20,000£NJ for 1753.

  An alternative and inconsistent estimate made by Lester (1939a, p. 196; 1939b, p. 133) for 1764 was 347,000£NJ.

  The numbers reported in Brock (1992, pp. 111-3) for 1767 are internally inconsistent. Supposedly, 54 percent of
New Jersey’s paper money for that year was added to Pennsylvania’s total and 46 percent was added to New York’s

respectively, are summed, they yield a total that does not correspond to the 54 and 46 percent division. The sources
of Brock’s errors are unknown.
