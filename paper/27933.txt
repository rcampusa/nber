Teenage Driving, Mortality, and Risky Behaviors

JEL No. H75,I1,R4

                                         ABSTRACT

We investigate the effect of teenage driving on mortality and risky behaviors in the United States
using a regression discontinuity design. We estimate that motor vehicle fatalities rise by 40% at
the minimum legal driving age cutoff, implying a mortality risk per additional mile driven 6-9
times higher than the risk faced by adult drivers. We also find a stark 80% increase in female
deaths from drug overdoses and carbon monoxide poisoning at the cutoff, caused by changes in
both suicides and accidental deaths. Our analysis suggests driving regulations could be an
effective tool to improve teenage health.

1       Introduction
Suicides and motor vehicle accidents are the two leading causes of death for U.S. teenagers
(CDC, 2018). Both often involve substance abuse, which itself is also a leading cause of
teenage death. Over 25% of all teenage hospitalizations are related to mental health or
substance abuse disorders (Heslin and Elixhauser, 2016). Yet, the determinants of risky
behaviors among youth remain poorly understood, and what little we know about the drivers
of risky behaviors among adults may not apply to teenagers. For example, drug overdose
deaths among teenagers declined between 2007 and 2014, in stark contrast to the significant
nationwide increase in adult "deaths of despair" that has received much attention from
researchers (Case and Deaton, 2015, 2017).
    We investigate the effects of teenage driving on mortality and risky behaviors. While
driving undoubtedly increases motor vehicle mortality risk, the magnitude of this risk is
hard to quantify. Moreover, driving enables teenagers to participate in unsupervised risky
behaviors away from home, which may in turn lead to changes in mental health or drug use
that have additional effects on mortality risk. Identifying the effects of driving on teenage
outcomes is challenging, however. Individual-level data on driving behaviors are scarce,
and comparing the behaviors of drivers to non-drivers is unlikely to yield causal estimates
because the decision to obtain a license is voluntary. Likewise, exploiting variation due to
changes in state regulations is complicated due to challenges such as omitted variable bias
and reverse causality. In addition, detecting changes in important but rare outcomes such
as drug-related mortality requires large sample sizes.
    We overcome these challenges by using a regression discontinuity (RD) approach to iden-
tify the causal effect of teenage driving on a number of outcomes.1 Our research design
exploits variation in driving eligibility caused by the minimum legal driving age (henceforth
"minimum driving age" or "MDA"), which creates large differences in the teenage driver
population on either side of the MDA cutoff. We employ a confidential dataset that includes
information about month and year of birth for over 500,000 teenage deaths during 1983­2014,
which enables us to compare mortality rates for teenagers just above the MDA to mortality
rates for teenagers just below the MDA. We estimate that driving eligibility increases teenage
mortality by 5.84 deaths per 100,000 (15%) at the MDA cutoff. This intent-to-treat effect
is driven primarily by an increase in motor vehicle fatalities of 4.92 per 100,000 (44%).
    We also estimate that teenage poisoning deaths rise by 0.314 deaths per 100,000 (29%)
at the cutoff. This poisoning effect is driven by a stark rise in female drug overdose deaths
    1
    Our analysis controls for the family-wise error rate in order to address the multiple inference concern
that arises when testing many hypotheses. See Section 4 for details.



                                                    2
of 0.646 per 100,000 (78%) and an accompanying rise in female carbon monoxide poisoning
deaths of 0.127 per 100,000 (82%).2 These deaths reflect changes in both suicides and
accidental deaths, although our analysis suggests that the increase in poisoning suicides
reflects substitution away from other methods of suicide.
    We identify the local average treatment effect of driving on motor vehicle fatalities by
incorporating Add Health survey data on license status and vehicle miles driven into our
analysis. We estimate that a new teenage driver faces a risk of dying in a motor vehicle
accident equal to 10.1­14.5 per 100 million additional vehicle miles driven, 6­9 times higher
than the national average of 1.7. This additional risk declines modestly to 6.0­8.3 deaths per
100 million vehicle miles driven (4­5 times higher than the average) during the first year of
driving, indicating that teenagers learn how to drive more safely after obtaining their license.
    Finally, we calculate that raising the MDA by one year during the time period we study
would have saved 282 lives per year, which is worth $2.5 billion annually using conventional
estimates of the value of statistical life. This mortality reduction is similar to estimates of
the effect of raising the minimum legal drinking age by one year (Carpenter and Dobkin,
2009). This counterfactual exercise requires applying our estimated treatment effect--which
is local to the cutoff threshold--to ages up to one year above the threshold. We argue that
this extrapolation is reasonable because the derivative of our estimated treatment effect with
respect to the running variable at the cutoff is nonnegative (Dong and Lewbel, 2015).
    The most common MDA during our sample period is 16, which raises the concern that
our results might be driven by a "birthday effect" or some other regulation that takes effect
at age 16, such as the federal minimum legal working age or a state's minimum school leaving
age. However, the discontinuities that we observe are long-lasting, which is inconsistent with
a temporary birthday effect, and we do not detect changes in the probability of working or
leaving school at the cutoff. Moreover, our main results hold when we limit our analysis to
the subsample of states with MDAs other than 16. We therefore conclude that the MDA is
the causal mechanism underlying our results.
    Much of the research on the causal determinants of drug abuse comes from studies of
adults. For example, several studies find that drug overdose deaths increase after the first
of the month and following the receipt of money, suggesting a causal relationship between a
"full wallet" and substance abuse (Phillips, Christenfeld and Ryan, 1999; Riddell and Riddell,
2006; Dobkin and Puller, 2007; Evans and Moore, 2012). Less is known about the causal
determinants of drug abuse among adolescents.3 Indeed, Gruber (2001) calls for economists
   2
     During our sample period, about 80% of teenage poisoning deaths are caused by drug overdoses and
about 20% are caused by carbon monoxide poisonings.
   3
     Most of the prior literature on youth drug use focuses on tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana (e.g., Glied,
2002; Cawley, Markowitz and Tauras, 2004; Carpenter et al., 2019). Drug overdose deaths among teenagers,


                                                     3
to pay more attention to the risk-taking behavior of youth, noting that while economic
incentives appear to matter, most of the variation remains unexplained. Anderson (2010),
who finds no effect of a Montana anti-drug advertising campaign on methamphetamine use
among highschoolers, emphasizes the need for further research on the determinants of illegal
drug use among the young. Our study advances this literature by using a novel source
of exogenous variation to uncover a strong, causal relationship between driving and drug
overdose deaths among teenage females. Importantly, our findings imply that policymakers
interested in reducing teenage drug abuse should consider increasing the MDA.
    We are unaware of any quasi-experimental studies on the effects of the MDA.4 The prior
economics literature on driving policy has focused on laws addressing drunk driving (Evans,
Neville and Graham, 1991; Ruhm, 1996; Levitt and Porter, 2001; Carpenter, 2004; Hansen,
2015), child safety seats (Jones and Ziebarth, 2017), seat belts (Peltzman, 1975; Evans, 1986;
Cohen and Einav, 2003), traffic safety messages (Hall and Madsen, 2020), and speed limits
(Dee and Sela, 2003). Studies have also investigated the effects of Graduated Driver Licensing
(GDL) laws on motor vehicle fatalities (Dee, Grabowski and Morrisey, 2005; Morrisey et al.,
2006; Karaca-Mandic and Ridgeway, 2010; Gilpin, 2019) and crime (Deza and Litwok, 2016).
We advance this literature by quantifying the mortality consequences of changing the MDA,
a regulation that affects all teenage drivers in the United States.
    Our paper is also related to studies in the transportation literature that quantify crash
risk per driver as a function of time since licensure for a small number of states and years
(Foss et al., 2011; Chapman, Masten and Browning, 2014; Curry et al., 2015). Our quasi-
experimental study advances this literature by employing 32 years of administrative death
records for all 50 states, combining it with nationally representative survey data to estimate
risk per mile driven, and imposing a weaker identifying assumption.5 To our knowledge, we
are the first to investigate the causal effect of teenage driving on drug-related outcomes.
    The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background
information. Section 3 describes our data. Section 4 outlines our empirical strategy. Section
5 describes our results, Section 6 describes policy implications, and Section 7 concludes.
however, are mostly caused by opioids (both illegal and prescription) and sedatives.
    4
      By contrast, a large quasi-experimental literature investigates the effects of the minimum legal drinking
age on health, drug use, and crime (Kaestner, 2000; Carpenter and Dobkin, 2009; Crost and Rees, 2013;
Carpenter and Dobkin, 2015, 2017; Fletcher, 2018).
    5
      Our research design does not require assuming that the timing of the voluntary decision to obtain a
license is unrelated to crash risk. The transportation literature finds--like we do--that crash risk declines
significantly during the first year of driving, although its estimates are not directly comparable to ours
because it measures risk per driver, rather than per capita, and generally focuses on all crashes rather than
on fatal crashes.

2       Background
Every U.S. state requires drivers to be licensed. Teenagers begin the licensing process by
obtaining a learner's permit, which allows them to drive under adult supervision. Depending
on the state, the adult must be at least 18­25 years of age and have up to 5 years of driving
experience. The minimum legal age for obtaining a learner's permit ranges from 14 to 16
over our 1983­2014 sample period.
    With rare exception, teenagers must then complete a driver's education course and
behind-the-wheel training to become eligible to take their state's driving test, which typi-
cally consists of two components: a written test and a behind-the-wheel test. The teenager
receives her driver's license after passing both components. The minimum age for taking the
driving test ranges from 14 to 18 during our sample period. Beginning in 1996, states began
adopting GDL programs, which prohibit unsupervised driving by licensed teenagers under
the age of 18 during certain nighttime hours and limit the number and age of passengers in
their vehicles.
    Our study focuses on the age at which teenagers become eligible to take their state's
driving test. Before 1996, passing this test earned a full driver's license. In more recent
years, it may earn only a restricted driver's license, depending on whether the state has
implemented a GDL program.6 The fraction of teenagers with a license has declined over
our 1983­2014 sample period (Figure B.1).
    Suicides and motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are the leading and second-leading causes of
death for teenagers, respectively (CDC, 2018). About 25% of teenage motor vehicle fatalities
are alcohol-related, and over 50% occur during nighttime (Dee and Evans, 2001). Accidental
poisonings are the leading cause of death for people under age 30 (13,157 deaths in 2018)
(CDC, 2018). Two-thirds of drug overdose deaths for ages 15­24 are related to heroin and
illegal opioids, and one-third are related to sedatives and prescription opioids (National
Institute on Drug Abuse, 2019). Prior studies find that young females exceed males in their
nonmedical use of sedatives and prescription opioids, and are also more likely to overdose
than males (Cotto et al., 2010; Lyons et al., 2019).
    6
    Our age-based RD design can also be used to investigate the effect of gaining a learner's permit or a full
(unrestricted) driver's license. We find no mortality increase at the age cutoff for a learner's permit, and a
small positive increase at the age cutoff for an unrestricted driver's license (Table A.3). The latter result
suggests that implementing GDL licenses may reduce motor vehicle fatalities.

3       Data
3.1     Minimum driving age laws
We obtain data on MDA laws from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for the years
1995­2014. Data for the years 1983­1994 were hand-collected from databases of state session
laws. These data are reported in Table B.1.


3.2     Mortality
We measure mortality using the National Vital Statistics. This dataset is based on death
certificate records and includes information on decedents' month and year of death, cause of
death, and sex. We obtained a restricted-use version for the years 1983­2014 that includes
information on decedents' state of residence and month and year of birth. We use these data
to calculate age in months at death for all decedents. We then aggregate to the age-in-months
level and calculate age-specific deaths per 100,000 person-years by combining these count
data with population estimates provided by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) Program.7 Our final dataset includes information on 501,193 teenage deaths.
    Our main results combine suicides and accidents into one category to minimize mea-
surement error concerns (Cutler, Glaeser and Norberg, 2001; Alexander and Schnell, 2019).
When someone dies from a drug overdose, for example, it may not be clear whether the
death should be classified as a suicide or an accident. We also report estimates separately
for suicides and accidents in a later analysis.
    Figure B.2 reports annual teenage death rates for the years 1983­2014, separately for
males and females. Male death rates are about twice as large as female death rates. Motor
vehicle fatality rates decline significantly during this time period for both groups.8 Poisoning
deaths decline in the early 1990s and climb significantly during the early 2000s for both
groups. The trends then diverge, with the male poisoning death rate falling while the
female poisoning death rate remains steady. Neither group experiences sustained increases
in poisoning deaths after 2007. By contrast, Case and Deaton (2015) document a steeply
increasing trend in poisoning deaths among midlife whites for 2007­2013.
    7
     These population data are available for integer ages only. When calculating age-specific death rates,
we divide the count of deaths for a specific age in months by one-twelfth of the corresponding integer age
population.
   8
     Dee and Evans (2001) attribute the decline in motor vehicle fatalities during the 1990s to a reduction in
drunk driving and to an increase in seat belt use. Air bags were also introduced during this time period, but
Dee and Evans (2001) argue that they played only a small role in reducing teenage motor vehicle fatalities.




                                                      6
3.3    Driving behaviors
We measure driving behaviors using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health ("Add Health"). This nationally representative study began in 1994 with a classroom
survey of about 20,000 students in grades 7­12. The study then followed up with a series
of in-home interviews in 1995 and 1996. We obtained a restricted-use version of the in-
home survey data that includes month and year of birth. After excluding observations with
missing data, our sample includes 32,307 person-year observations (Appendix B.3). This
sample includes respondents ranging in age from 11 to 21; 97.9% of respondents are between
the ages of 13 and 19. We aggregate these data to the age-in-months level using Add Health's
cross-sectional weights.
    The in-home survey asks respondents whether they have a driver's license and whether
they drive 0, 1­50, 51­100, or "over 100" miles per week, which we use to measure vehicle
miles driven. We assign values of 25 and 75 to respondents who selected the ranges 1­50
and 51­100, respectively. For "over 100", our baseline specification assigns a value of 150.
By way of comparison, the typical adult driver drove 265 miles per week in 1996 (Federal
Highway Administration, 1997, 2003). To account for uncertainty, we also report results
from a more conservative specification that instead assigns a value of 265 to the "over 100"
response.
    Add Health also asks questions about drug consumption and mental health. We do not
consider those outcomes in the main text because the survey's small sample size combined
with the low prevalence of the outcomes we are most interested in­suicide attempts and
illegal drug consumption­cause the analysis to be underpowered. Instead, we present the
results of that analysis in Appendix C.


4     Empirical strategy
We employ a fuzzy RD design to identify the effect of driving eligibility on teenage behaviors
and mortality. Eligibility depends on age and state of residence. For analytical convenience,
we recenter the age variable for decedents in our data by measuring it in months from the
MDA law in force during the month of death. Our main identifying assumption is that
assignment to either side of the MDA threshold is as good as random. This assumption is
very reasonable: age cannot be manipulated, and we do not suffer from sample selection bias
because we observe the universe of deaths.




                                              7
      We estimate the following model:

                   Ya = 1 AGEa + P OSTa + 1 (P OSTa × AGEa ) + 1 Da + a                                 (1)

The dependent variable, Ya , is an outcome for the one-month age cell a. The running variable,
AGEa , is measured in months from the MDA, and P OSTa is an indicator equal to one if
AGEa  0. This indicator suffers from measurement error at the age cutoff because we do
not know whether a teenager who died in the month she reaches the MDA was over or under
the MDA on the day of her death. We remove the bias associated with this measurement
error by including the indicator variable Da , which is equal to one when AGEa = 0 and is
zero otherwise (Dong, 2015).
    We interpret the parameter  in equation (1) as the intent-to-treat effect of licensed
driving on the outcome Ya . We estimate the first-stage effect using the following model:

               DRIV Ea = 2 AGEa + P OSTa + 2 (P OSTa × AGEa ) + 2 Da + a                                (2)

The dependent variable, DRIV Ea , is either the fraction of teenagers with a driver's license
or average vehicle miles driven for the one-month age cell a. The other variables are defined
as in equation (1). The parameter of interest, , is the effect of driving eligibility on driving
behavior.
    We interpret the ratio  = / as the local average treatment effect (LATE) of teenage
driving on the outcome, Ya (Hahn, Todd and Van der Klaauw, 2001). This ratio corresponds
to the average causal effect for the subset of teenagers who are compliers, i.e., for teenagers
who are induced to drive upon reaching the MDA (Angrist, Imbens and Rubin, 1996). The
LATE is identified under the assumption that teenagers above the MDA cutoff are not less
likely to drive. This monotonicity assumption is satisfied in our setting because--with rare
exception--teenagers cannot obtain driver's licenses prior to age eligibility. This assumption
also has a testable implication when instruments are multivalued (Angrist and Imbens, 1995).
Figure A.1 presents evidence that this implication is satisfied for our vehicle miles driven
instrument.
    All of our regressions employ a triangular kernel. Our preferred specification employs
a mean-squared error (MSE) optimal bandwidth that varies for each outcome and reports
robust bias-corrected confidence intervals that account for the possibility that our estimating
equation is misspecified (Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2014).
    We address multiple inference concerns by controlling for the family-wise error rate using
the Sidak-Holm step-down correction.9 We define a family that includes all 13 mortality
  9
      This correction is conservative because it does not account for the significant collinearity among our

                                                      8
outcomes reported in our main table. When estimating models separately for males and
females, we include outcomes from both subgroups in the family, i.e., we report p-values
that adjust for testing 26 different hypotheses.


5     Results
5.1     Driving (first stage)
We begin by estimating the effect of driving eligibility on license status and vehicle miles
driven. Figure 1a shows that about 25% of teenagers obtain a license within their first two
months of eligibility. This increase rises to over 50% after 12 months. The increase at the
age cutoff (value 0 on the x-axis) is attenuated because of the measurement error discussed
in Section 4.
    The first three rows of Panel A in Table 1 report RD estimates of  from equation (2) for
our first-stage outcomes. Column (2) reports that driving eligibility increases a teenager's
probability of obtaining a driver's license by 18.6 percentage points. It also increases her
annual driving by 375 miles using the baseline definition of average vehicle miles driven, or
by 575 miles using the alternate definition (Figure A.2). The increase in licensing rates at
the cutoff is similar for males and females, but the increase in vehicle miles driven is larger
for males.


5.2     Mortality
Panel B in Table 1 reports estimates of  from equation (1) for different causes of death.10
Column (2) reports that total mortality increases by 5.84 deaths per 100,000 at the age
cutoff, an increase of 15% relative to a mean of 38.9 deaths per 100,000. The estimated
effect on deaths from internal causes is small and statistically insignificant. By contrast,
the estimated effect on deaths from external causes is 5.20 deaths per 100,000 (19%) and
remains marginally significant after conservatively accounting for multiple inference (family-
wise p = 0.0523). While the absolute increase in all-cause mortality at the age cutoff is
about the same for both males and females, the relative increase for females (22%) is double
the relative increase for males (11%) (Figure A.3).
outcomes (see Appendix C of Jones, Molitor and Reif (2019)). We are unaware of any resampling-based
multiple testing corrections for RD designs with discrete running variables.
  10
     Because bandwidths vary by outcome, estimates for specific causes of death do not add up to the estimate
for total deaths. Table A.13 reports estimates from a specification that uses a constant bandwidth of 24
months. In that table, subcategory estimates add up to the total estimate.




                                                     9
    Table 1 decomposes deaths due to external causes into its four main subcategories: MVAs,
suicides and accidents, homicides, and other. Column (2) reports a significant increase in
motor vehicle fatalities of 4.92 deaths per 100,000 (44%) at the age cutoff. Columns (4) and
(6) report that this increase is significant for both males and females (family-wise p < 0.01)
and can explain the majority of the increase in total mortality for both subgroups. Figure
1b confirms these results by showing that motor vehicle fatalities increase sharply within
the first two months of gaining driving eligibility for both males and females. There is little
change in the overall trend: motor vehicle fatalities increase with age at about the same
rate in the periods before and after the age cutoff. As with all-cause mortality, the absolute
increase in motor vehicle fatalities at the cutoff is similar for males and females, but the
relative increase is larger for females.
    Column (2) of Table 1 also reports a significant increase in poisoning deaths of 0.314 per
100,000 (29%). This poisoning effect can be further decomposed into a 0.315 per 100,000
(36%) increase in drug overdose deaths and a 0.103 per 100,000 (48%) increase in carbon
monoxide poisoning deaths.11 Comparing the estimates in Column (6) to those in Column
(4) reveals that this effect is driven by female poisoning deaths, which increase by 0.747 per
100,000 (76%) at the cutoff (family-wise p < 0.0001). Figure 2a illustrates this stark increase
in female poisoning deaths. Figure 2b shows that the increase can be attributed primarily to
a 0.646 per 100,000 (78%) increase in drug overdose deaths (family-wise p < 0.0001). Figure
2c shows a visible increase of 0.127 per 100,000 (82%) in carbon monoxide poisoning deaths,
although this effect is not statistically significant after accounting for multiple hypothesis
testing (family-wise p = 0.163).
    By contrast, trends in male poisoning deaths appear continuous at the age cutoff (Figure
A.4), and this result is confirmed by the small and statistically insignificant male poisoning
estimates reported in Table 1. We do estimate a statistically significant decrease in drownings
of 0.690 per 100,000 (26%) for males (Figure A.5a). Unlike the change in female poisoning
deaths shown in Figure 2a, this change in male drownings is short-lived. Likewise, while
Table 1 reports a statistically significant estimate for female deaths due to "other external"
causes, the RD plot does not provide compelling evidence of an effect (Figure A.6b).
    Table 2 decomposes the female poisoning death estimates into those classified as suicides
versus accidents. A few results stand out in this exploratory analysis. First, the increase
in drug overdose deaths is caused by both accidents and suicides. Second, although most
carbon monoxide poisoning deaths among female teenagers are accidental, the increase in
  11
    Carbon monoxide poisonings are a subcategory of gas poisonings. However, nearly 90% of gas poisoning
deaths are caused by carbon monoxide, so we refer to the category as carbon monoxide poisoning rather
than gas poisoning.



                                                  10
these deaths following driving eligibility is driven by suicides. Finally, the net effect on total
suicides is small and statistically insignificant because of an offsetting reduction in firearm
suicides, suggesting that female teenagers who commit suicide substitute away from using
firearms and toward using drugs and carbon monoxide poisoning upon gaining access to a
car.
    We caution that the reliability of these classifications is unclear. For example, some of the
increase in accidental drug overdose deaths may in fact be suicides. We also lack statistical
power to discern with confidence whether the increase in poisoning suicides reflects a net
increase in suicide or substitution away from other methods of suicide, making it difficult
to test different theories of youth suicide (Cutler, Glaeser and Norberg, 2001). Overall,
we conclude that the rise in female poisoning deaths represents changes in both accidental
deaths and suicides, and that the suicide estimate might reflect a compositional shift in the
method of suicide.
    Finally, we assess how our estimates change over time by estimating our model for differ-
ent four-year bins. Figures 3a and 3c reveal a steady decline in our estimated effect for motor
vehicle fatalities beginning in the mid-1990s, which likely reflects the significant reduction
in teenage licensure rates in recent years (Figure B.1). Figures 3b and 3d show estimates
over time for poisoning deaths. The male estimates are centered around zero throughout
our sample period. By contrast, the female estimates follow a U-shape pattern, which mir-
rors the aggregate fall and rise in poisoning deaths observed nationwide for teenage females
(Figure B.2b). The recent increase in female poisoning deaths is statistically significant and
suggests that contemporaneous (post-2014) effects may be larger than what we report in this
study.12


5.3     Local average treatment effects
The local average treatment effect (LATE) of driving on teenage mortality is the ratio of
the intent-to-treat and first-stage effects. To identify LATE, we shall assume that driving
eligibility affects outcomes only through the receipt of a driver's license. We therefore focus
on motor vehicle fatalities, the outcome most likely to satisfy this exclusion restriction. As
described in Appendix A.1, we impose a uniform bandwidth when estimating LATE, which
means the estimate is not exactly equal to the ratio of the intent-to-treat and first-stage
estimates reported in Table 1 (Imbens and Lemieux, 2008).
    We have three different first-stage measures of driving behavior, so we estimate three cor-
responding LATEs (Table A.14). Gaining a driver's license increases motor vehicle fatalities
  12
    We strongly reject the equality of the five coefficients corresponding to the 1995­2014 time period in
Figure 3d (p-value < 0.001).

                                                   11
by 29.9 per 100,000, an increase of 267% relative to the mean of 11.2. Our two measures of
vehicle miles driven yield LATE estimates of 10.1­14.5 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles
driven. By way of comparison, the national average for 1995­1996 is 1.7 deaths per 100 mil-
lion vehicle miles driven (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 2018). In other words, a
new teenage driver faces a mortality risk 6­9 times higher per additional vehicle mile driven
than the typical driver.
    Quantifying how quickly teenagers learn to drive more safely requires strengthening the
usual "local" randomization assumption to include inframarginal compliers (Angrist and
Rokkanen, 2015). Figure A.11 plots nonparametric approximations of the average treatment
effect for both marginal and inframarginal compliers. Figures A.11b and A.11c illustrate
a declining trend for the effect of vehicle miles driven on motor vehicle fatalities: twelve
months after driving eligibility, the risk has fallen to 6.0­8.3 per 100 million vehicle miles
driven, or 4­5 times higher than the typical driver. This decline suggests that teenagers
learn to drive more safely within the first year of obtaining their license.


5.4     Robustness
The most common MDA in our sample is 16 years, which also happens to be the federal
minimum legal working age as well as the minimum legal school leaving age in many states.
We do not believe these other laws confound our estimates, however. Analysis of the Add
Health data shows small and statistically insignificant changes in working for pay or leaving
school at the MDA cutoff (Figure A.7). Moreover, our results are similar when we limit our
analysis to states with an MDA that is not 16 years (Tables A.1 and A.2).13 Because the
MDA differs from the minimum working and school leaving ages in this subsample (Appendix
B.4), we conclude that the MDA is the causal mechanism underlying our results.
    Our analysis examines a large number of outcomes across two different subgroups. Al-
though we adjust for multiple inference, our outcomes and subgroups were not specified prior
to analysis. However, we emphasize that our most surprising result--the increase in female
poisoning deaths illustrated in Figure 2--is far too large to be spurious. A multiple testing
correction would need to adjust for many thousands of hypotheses to increase the unadjusted
p-value (p < 0.00001) above the conventional significance level of 0.05.
    Tables A.5­A.8 report our results separately by race and sex. Whites are more likely
than nonwhites to obtain a driver's license upon becoming eligible, consistent with prior
studies (Shults and Williams, 2013). This differential first-stage effect is reflected in the
  13
   For example, female poisoning deaths rise by 0.509 deaths per 100,000 at the cutoff in states where the
MDA is not 16. This estimate is statistically significant and its 95% confidence interval includes the full
sample estimate of 0.747 deaths per 100,000 (Table 1).


                                                    12
second-stage mortality estimates: motor vehicle fatalities increase the most at the cutoff for
white males and white females, and poisoning deaths increase the most for white females.
Figure A.8 also suggests some modest seasonality in our estimate for motor vehicle fatalities,
with effect sizes peaking during the summer months in both absolute and relative terms.
    Tables A.11­A.13 show that our intent-to-treat estimates are not sensitive to using differ-
ent bandwidth selection procedures or polynomial approximations, or to imposing a uniform
bandwidth of 24 months. Columns (2), (4), and (6) of Table A.14 show that 2SLS estimates
of LATE are similar to our MSE-optimal estimates. Figure A.10 shows that estimates us-
ing placebo cutoffs are centered around 0, and that our motor vehicle fatality and female
poisoning death estimates lie well outside the distribution of placebo estimates.


6    Policy implications
The mortality consequences of raising the MDA depend on how one extrapolates the RD
treatment effect estimate to ages above the cutoff. It is not clear a priori whether the
treatment effect should increase, decrease, or remain the same for those older ages. It could
be smaller if older teenagers are more careful drivers, or larger if older teenagers are more
likely to drink and drive.
    We investigate the external validity of our local RD estimate by estimating the treatment
effect derivative, i.e., the change in the slope of the trendline at the age cutoff (Dong and
Lewbel, 2015). Panel A of Table A.4 presents estimates for all-cause mortality, our primary
outcome of interest for this policy exercise, and Panel B presents estimates for motor ve-
hicle fatalities, which drive the majority of the increase in all-cause mortality. Column (1)
estimates a positive but statistically insignificant treatment effect derivative of 0.217 deaths
per 100,000. Columns (2) and (3) show that this estimate remains positive and statistically
insignificant when estimated separately for males and females. A positive estimate implies
that the slope of the trendline increases after crossing the age cutoff, as can be confirmed
from close visual inspection of the fitted lines in Figure 1b. Because our estimate of the
treatment effect derivative is small and statistically insignificant, we proceed below under
the assumption that it is equal to zero, i.e., we assume our local RD estimate also applies
to older ages. This assumption is likely conservative: if we instead assumed a positive treat-
ment effect derivative, as suggested by the point estimates in Table A.4, we would apply a
larger treatment effect to older ages, which would increase our estimate of the number of
lives saved from raising the MDA.
    We estimated previously that driving eligibility increases mortality by 5.84 deaths per
100,000 (Table 1) over the 1983­2014 time period. The social cost of these deaths depends

                                              13
on the teenage value of a statistical life (VSL), which we set equal to $9 million (Murphy
and Topel, 2006). Applying this value to our empirical estimate yields an estimated annual
cost of $526 per capita (= $9 million×5.84/100000) for the affected population. There was
an average of 3.9 million 16-year-olds alive in the United States during 1983­2014, so this
estimate implies that a one-year increase in the MDA would have saved 228 lives annually
during our sample period, producing an annual value of $2.0 billion. This value, while
large, does not necessarily imply that driving eligibility should be curtailed since driving
also confers significant benefits. Indeed, if teenage drivers are rational, then the net private
value of driving must remain positive for teenagers who choose to drive.
    However, teenage drivers also risk the lives of other passengers on the road. According to
our analysis of data published by the Fatal Accident Reporting System for the years 1983­
2014, for every car accident that involved the death of at least one teenage driver in her first
year of driving eligibility, an additional 0.24 people died on average. Assuming again a $9
million VSL, these additional deaths imply a negative externality of $490 million annually.
When added to our previous result, we calculate that increasing the MDA by one year would
have saved 282 lives per year, or $2.5 billion, which is comparable to the effect of increasing
the minimum legal drinking age by one year.14
    These estimates apply to the 1983­2014 sample period. Figures 3a and 3c show declining
trends in our motor vehicle fatalities estimates over time, suggesting that contemporaneous
increases in the MDA may have small effects on mortality. By contrast, Figure 3d shows
an increasing trend in our female poisoning deaths estimates beginning in 1995, suggesting
that an increase in the MDA may reduce poisoning deaths by more than what we estimate
in this study.


7      Conclusion
This study investigates the effect of teenage driving on mortality and risky behaviors. We
estimate that new teenage drivers are 6­9 times more likely to die per additional mile driven
than a typical adult driver and that raising the MDA by one year would have saved nearly
300 lives annually during our sample period. Our estimate is similar to the estimated benefits
of raising the minimum legal drinking age.
    We find that female poisoning deaths increase by about 80% in the months following
driving eligibility. These deaths reflect changes in both accidents and suicides, but the
  14
     Carpenter and Dobkin (2009) estimate that reducing the minimum legal drinking age from 21 to 20
would result in 337 additional deaths per year, including other people killed by drunk drivers. This estimate
is statistically indistinguishable from ours.



                                                     14
specific behavioral mechanisms underlying our results remain unclear. Driving may enable
teenagers to purchase or consume drugs more easily, and may affect mental health by altering
social environments. Further research is required to investigate these different possibilities.
Nevertheless, our results imply that increasing the MDA may be an effective way to curb
poisoning deaths among teenagers.

Notes: The figure shows the proportion of teenagers with a driver's license and motor vehicle fatality rates by age,
relative to the minimum driving age (MDA). Estimates in panel (a) are based on weighted responses to the 1995­1996
Add Health surveys. Estimates in panel (b) are based on data from the 1983­2014 National Vital Statistics. The
fitted lines in panels (a) and (b) are estimated using equations (2) and (1), respectively, with a bandwidth of 24
months. Table 1 provides RD estimates.                  21

A      Supplementary results
Figure A.1 displays cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of vehicle miles driven for teenagers
one month below and one month above the MDA. This result provides evidence in favor of the
monotonicity assumption (Angrist and Imbens, 1995).
    Tables A.1 and A.2 report estimates for motor vehicle fatalities and poisoning deaths, separately
for sample observations where the MDA is 16 years and 0 months versus observations where it is not
16 years and 0 months. The estimates for female poisoning deaths are statistically indistinguishable
from each other. Table A.3 reports estimates of the effect of becoming eligible for a learner's permit
and full driver's license on motor vehicle fatalities. Table A.4 reports estimates of the treatment
effect derivative for deaths from all causes and for deaths from MVAs (Dong and Lewbel, 2015).

A.1      Local average treatment effect estimates
As described in Section 4, the parameter  in equation (1) is the intent-to-treat effect of licensed
driving on the outcome Ya and the parameter  in equation (2) is the effect of driving eligibility on
driving behavior. We interpret their ratio,  = /, as the local average treatment effect (LATE)
of teenage driving on the outcome, Ya (Hahn, Todd and Van der Klaauw, 2001). We follow Imbens
and Lemieux (2008) and estimate LATE using an MSE-optimal bandwidth that is constant across
the first and second stages.
    We report our preferred LATE estimates for motor vehicle fatalities in Columns (3), (5), and
(7) of Table A.14. These estimates are approximately, but not exactly, equal to the ratio of the
intent-to-treat and first-stage estimates reported in Table 1 because of differences in the bandwidths.
    LATE can alternatively be estimated using two-stage least squares (2SLS), where the second
stage is given by:

                    Ya = 3 AGEa + DRIV Ea + 3 (P OSTa × AGEa ) + 3 Da + a                                   (3)

We instrument for DRIV Ea using the post-MDA indicator, P OSTa .1 These 2SLS estimates, re-
ported in Columns (2), (4), and (6) of Table A.14, are very similar to the MSE-optimal estimates.
Unlike the MSE-optimal estimates, the 2SLS estimates are exactly equal to the ratios of their corre-
sponding intent-to-treat and first-stage estimates. This equality can be confirmed by forming ratios
of the appropriate OLS estimates from Table A.13 to replicate the 2SLS estimates.

    One could alternatively include the interaction (DRIV Ea × AGEa ) instead of (P OSTa × AGEa ) in (3), which
requires additionally instrumenting for the interaction using (P OSTa × AGEa ) (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). That
alternative specification produces similar estimates.

Notes: The figure reports the average vehicle miles driven per year for teenagers one month below and one month
above the minimum driving age (MDA). Annual vehicle miles driven are calculated by assigning midpoints to the
number range reported by Add Health survey respondents. Respondents were asked whether they drive 0 miles per
week, drive 1­50 miles per week, drive 51­100 miles per week, or drive over 100 miles per week. For the last bin
("over 100"), we assigned a value of 150.

Notes: These figures show average annual vehicle miles driven by age, relative to the minimum driving age (MDA).
Estimates are weighted using Add Health's cross-sectional weights. The fitted lines are estimated using equation (2)
with a bandwidth of 24 months. The baseline specification assigns a value of 150 to respondents who report driving
"over 100" miles per week. The alternative specification assigns a value of 265.

babysitting or yard work. Panel (b) reports the proportion who report not being enrolled in school. The MSE-
optimal RD estimate from equation (1) is an increase in working for pay of 2.9 percentage points (p = 0.411), with
a 95% robust bias-corrected confidence interval of [­0.0385, 0.0942]. The MSE-optimal estimate for not enrolled
in school is ­0.021 percentage points (p = 0.829), with a 95% robust bias-corrected confidence interval of [­0.0104,

a nonparametric approximation of , the local average treatment effect in equation (3). The numerator variable Ya
is mortality (deaths per 100,000) for age cell a. The denominator variable DRIV Ea is either proportion of teenagers
with a license or average annual vehicle miles driven (measured in hundreds of millions). The point estimate at the
age cutoff is inflated due to the attenuation bias caused by measurement error in estimates of licensing status and
vehicle miles driven at the cutoff (e.g., see Figure 1a). For illustrative purposes, point estimates below the cutoff are
set equal to zero.

effect of becoming age-eligible for a learner's permit. The third row reports estimates of the effect of becoming age-eligible for a full,
unrestricted driver's license in states with GDL laws. The sample used in the first row includes 1,632 state-year observations between
1983­2014. Our data on laws for learner's permits start in 1991, which yield 1,224 state-year observations for the sample used in the
second row. Estimates for the effects of full licensure in the third row are based on the subsample of 716 state-year observations that
have GDL laws in place. Robust, bias-corrected 95-percent confidence intervals are reported in brackets. A */** indicates significance

Notes: This table presents estimates of equation (1) for two mortality outcomes: deaths from all causes and deaths from motor vehicle
accidents. The dependent variable is deaths per 100,000 person-years. The model is estimated using OLS with a bandwidth of 24
months. The estimated coefficient on POST is the OLS RD estimate (see also Column (2) of Table A.13). The estimated coefficient on
AGE corresponds to the slope of the trendline for ages below the MDA (see, e.g., the left halves of the fitted lines shown in Figures A.3
and 1b). The estimated coefficient on POST X AGE is the treatment effect derivative (TED). It is equal to the change in the slope of
the trendline before and after the age cutoff. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. A */** indicates significance at the
5%/1% level using conventional inference.

Notes: The dependent variable is deaths per 100,000 person-years. Column (1) reports means of the dependent variable one year before
reaching the minimum driving age (MDA). Columns (2)­(5) report estimates of  from equation (1) using different bandwidths. The
MSE-optimal method selects a bandwidth that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the point estimator. The coverage error
rate (CER) optimal method selects a bandwidth that minimizes the asymptotic CER of the robust bias-corrected confidence interval.
Column (2) reports estimates from our preferred specification, MSE optimal (1), which selects one common bandwidth on each side of
the cutoff. Columns (3)­(5) report estimates using different bandwidth selection procedures: MSE optimal with different bandwidths on
each side of the cutoff, CER optimal with one common bandwidth, and CER optimal with different bandwidths on each side of the
cutoff. Robust, bias-corrected 95-percent confidence intervals are reported in brackets. The selected bandwidths (rounded to the nearest
month) are reported below the confidence interval. A */** indicates significance at the 5%/1% level using conventional inference.

B      Data and additional background information
B.1      Minimum driving age laws
Table B.1 provides the data we collected on MDAs. Indiana, Kansas, and South Dakota have lower
MDAs for teenagers who complete a driver's education program.2 For these three states, we use
the MDAs that apply to teenagers who have completed a driver's education program.
    The data for the time period 1995­2014 were obtained from the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety and the data for the 1983­1994 period were obtained from HeinOnline.3 We made two
corrections to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety data. The original data reported that
Hawaii increased the MDA from 15 years and 3 months to 16 on 1/9/2006, and Nevada had an
MDA of 15 years and 9 months before 1995. However, the corresponding dates indicated in the
session laws are 1/1/2001 for Hawaii and 7/1/2001 for Nevada, so we use these corrected dates in
our analysis.
    Most states have hardship exemptions that allow teenagers below the MDA to obtain a limited
license for certain occupational, medical, and educational purposes.4 However, hardship exemptions
are very rare. For example, less than 1% of teenagers within one year of the MDA obtained a
hardship license in Ohio in 2017 (authors' calculations using Ohio administrative licensing data).
In addition, some states issue farmer's permits that have a lower MDA than the MDA we employ
(e.g., Kansas, Minnesota, and New Jersey), but these permits are uncommon and are intended only
for farming purposes.


B.2      Mortality
Table B.2 provides the list of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes used to classify the cause of death in the vital
statistics dataset. (The ICD-9 classification was replaced by ICD-10 in 1999.) We follow Carpenter
and Dobkin (2009) and classify alcohol- or drug-related internal causes of death as "other external"
(e.g., ICD-9 codes 291 and 292). A small number of deaths are classified as "undetermined intent,"
i.e., neither accidents nor suicides. These deaths are more likely to be suicides than accidents: prior
work has argued that medical examiners and coroners may classify a death as "undetermined"
when there is pressure to avoid a classification of suicide (Gray et al., 2014; Stone et al., 2017). We
therefore classify deaths of undetermined intent as suicides.
     Table B.3 reports annual death rates for different five-year age groups during our sample period.
Figure B.2 reports annual teenage death rates for the years 1983­2014, separately for males and
females. Male death rates are about twice as large as female death rates. Motor vehicle fatality
rates decline significantly during this time period for both groups.
   2
     In Indiana, starting in July 2010, the MDA is 16 years and 9 months for teenagers who did not complete a
driver's education program, but it is 16 years and 6 months for those who did complete the program. In Kansas, the
MDA is 16 years without completion and 15 years with completion. In South Dakota, starting in January 1999, the
MDA is 14 years and 6 months without completion and 14 years and 3 months with completion.

B.3     Add Health
We obtained a restricted-use version of the 1995 and 1996 Add Health survey data that includes
pseudo-state identifiers and age in months. Minimum driving ages for each combination of pseudo-
state and survey year (1995 or 1996) were inferred by plotting the proportion of respondents with
a license as a function of age in months and visually locating the discontinuity. We validated this
procedure by checking that the aggregate number of pseudo-states with a particular MDA was
consistent with the data presented in Table B.1.
    We dropped person-year observations that were missing values for the pseudo-state identifier,
sample weight, birth month, or birth year. We also dropped observations from eight pseudo-states
for which we were unable to reliably infer an MDA. In total, we excluded 3,177 observations. Our
final sample included 32,307 person-year observations.
    We confirmed that respondents' answers to questions about driving behavior are consistent with
national data on license counts published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). In 1995,
the MDA was 16 in most states (Table B.1). According to Figure B.1, data published by the FHWA
indicate that just over 40% of all 16-year-olds and just over 60% of all 17-year-olds were licensed
drivers in 1995. Similarly, Figure 1a shows that our Add Health data estimate that just under 40%
of teenagers in Add Health had a driver's license 6 months after eligibility (i.e., at 16y6m for a
state where the MDA was 16). Extending the x-axis of Figure 1a further out (not reported) reveals
that about 65% of teenagers in Add Health had a driver's license 18 months after eligibility (i.e.,
at 17y6m for a state where the MDA was 16).


B.4     Minimum legal school leaving age
We collected state-level information on the minimum legal school leaving age from the National
Center for Education Statistics (https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/). Data are available
for the following 13 years: 1994, 1996, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006­2010, 2013, and 2014.
    For those 13 years, 52 percent of our state-year observations have a minimum school leaving age
equal to 16 years. The MDA in 31 percent of states is the same as the minimum school leaving age
during those 13 years. However, the minimum school leaving age is not equal to the MDA in any
state where the MDA is not 16 years.


B.5     Background information on teenage driver's licenses
Figure B.1 shows the proportion of teenagers with a restricted or full driver's license during our
1983­2014 sample period. Below, we provide details about the teenage driver's licensing process.

B.5.1   Learner's permit

Teenagers begin the licensing process by first obtaining a learner's permit, allowing them to drive
under the supervision of an adult. The minimum age for a learner's permit ranges from 14 to 16.


                                               B-2
Since 1991, 7 states have decreased this minimum age, 3 states have increased it, and 2 states did
both. In 38 states, a driver's education program is required either before applying for a learner's
permit or a restricted driver's license. There is no driver's education program requirement in the
remaining 12 states plus DC. Instead, those states have alternative requirements. For instance,
learner's permit holders in Arizona who did not complete driver's education must have a minimum
of 30 hours of supervised driving (10 of which must be during nighttime) before they can apply for
a restricted license.5
    In all states, a teenager with a learner's permit must be supervised by a licensed driver when
driving a motor vehicle. A majority of the states (36 states plus DC) require the supervisor to be at
least 21 years of age. The lowest/highest age requirement for the supervisor is 18/25. In addition,
states usually impose driving experience, ranging from 1 to 5 years, on a supervisor.

B.5.2      Restricted driver's license

Beginning in 1996, states began adopting GDL programs. These programs introduced new restric-
tions that prohibit unsupervised driving by licensed teenagers under the age of 18 during certain
nighttime hours and limit the number and age of passengers in their cars. The minimum age for a
restricted driver's license ranges from 14 to 17. Upon reaching the MDA for a restricted license, the
teenager becomes eligible to take a driving test and to apply for a restricted driver's license after
satisfying the following requirements:

  1. Learner's permit holding period. This holding period ranges from 10 days to 12 months and
     was required in all states by the end of our sample period. Some states also require that the
     teenager have no traffic violations or accidents within a certain number of months, such as 3
     or 6 months, before applying for a restricted driver's license.

  2. Behind-the-wheel training. This required training was introduced in all but four states during
     our sample period. The hours required for the training vary between 12 and 70, and some
     states waive or reduce this requirement with completion of an optional driver's education
     course.

Two types of driving restrictions were adopted or modified during our sample period: nighttime
restrictions (42 states plus DC) and passenger restrictions (44 states plus DC). By the end of
our sample period, 42 states plus DC had both nighttime and passenger restrictions. The night
driving restrictions prohibit unsupervised driving during certain times, for example, between 8pm
and 6am. The passenger driving restrictions limit the number and age of passengers, and sometimes
the relationship of passengers to the driver. For instance, restricted driver's licenses typically do
not allow more than one to three non-adult passengers in the teenager's vehicle, and under stricter
GDL laws, no passengers are allowed other than family members or driving instructors.

B.5.3   Full driver's license

After both nighttime and passenger restrictions (if in force) are lifted at ages 16 to 18, restricted
driver's license holders become eligible to apply for a full driver's license. Teenagers with traffic
violations or accidents within a certain number of months before the application may have their
eligibility for a full driver's license delayed in some states.

Notes: The figure reports the proportion of U.S. teenagers with a restricted or full driver's license. Counts
of licensed drivers are obtained from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). A small number of the
state-year counts in the FHWA data are incorrect (Curry, Kim and Pfeiffer, 2014; Gilpin, 2019). We re-
placed obvious anomalies with interpolated values during our data construction process. Population estimates
come from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. FHWA data are available from:

C     Drug consumption and mental health analysis
The Add Health surveys ask several questions about drug consumption and mental health. This
section estimates the effect of driving eligibility on those outcomes. We do not consider those
outcomes in the main text because the survey's small sample size combined with the low prevalence
of the outcomes we are most interested in­suicide attempts and illegal drug consumption­cause this
analysis to be underpowered. Table C.1 provides the exact definitions for the Add Health variables
used in this supplemental analysis.
    Panels B and C of Table C.2 report estimates of the effect of driving eligibility on self-reported
drug consumption and mental health, as measured using the 1995­1996 Add Health surveys. One
estimate remains significant after accounting for multiple hypothesis testing: males are 6.38 per-
centage points (55%) less likely to report that their life had been a failure (family-wise p < 0.01).
    Our null estimates are meaningfully precise for prevalent outcomes. Our 95% confidence intervals
rule out a 2.97 percentage point (6.5%) increase in self-reported female depression and a 7.59
percentage point (13.4%) increase in self-reported female sadness. Our null estimates are less
precise for self-reported suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and illegal drug consumption, three
outcomes of particular interest given our previous findings of an increase in suicidal and accidental
drug overdoses. Our 95% confidence intervals rule out a 4.50 percentage point (24.7%) increase in
suicidal thoughts and a 3.80 percentage point (92.5%) increase in illegal drug consumption among
females.
    Table C.3 provides results for the remaining 15 mental health outcomes from Add Health. Most
estimates are statistically insignificant. Females are 2.26 percentage points less likely to report
enjoying life at the cutoff (family-wise p = 0.0359). They are also 8.81 percentage points more
likely to report being unusually bothered in the past week (family-wise p = 0.125). Figure C.1
illustrates that result.
    Overall, while these estimates do not contradict the poisoning death results from Section 5.2,
they do not point to a clear mechanism underlying those results either. In particular, the estimates
from Table C.2 are consistent with the possibility of large (relative) changes in illegal drug con-
sumption and serious mental health disorders, but unfortunately they are too noisy to confirm that
hypothesis.

Notes: Panels (a) and (b) illustrate the proportion of teenagers who report being bothered by things that usually
don't bother them in the past week by age, relative to the minimum driving age (MDA). Estimates are weighted
using Add Health's cross-sectional weights. The fitted lines are estimated using equation (1) with a bandwidth of 24
months.

Notes: Columns (1), (3), and (5) report means of the dependent variable one year before reaching the minimum driving age (MDA).
Columns (2), (4), and (6) report MSE-optimal estimates of  from equation (1). Robust, bias-corrected 95-percent confidence intervals
are reported in brackets. A */** indicates significance at the 5%/1% level using conventional inference. Family-wise p-values, reported
in braces, adjust for the number of outcome variables in each family and for the number of subgroups.
