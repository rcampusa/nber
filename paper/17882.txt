We develop and estimate a unified model of house prices, loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), and trade and
foreclosure behavior. House prices are only observed for traded properties, and trades are endogenous,
creating sample-selection problems for traditional estimators. We develop a Bayesian filtering procedure
to recover the price path for each individual property and produce selection-corrected estimates of
historical LTVs and foreclosure behavior, both showing large unprecedented changes since 2007.
Our model reduces the index revision problem by nearly half, and has applications in economics and
finance (e.g., pricing mortgage-backed securities).

   Real estate price indices, loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), and trade and foreclosure be-
havior are important measures of economic activity. Yet, these measures are difficult to
estimate, and the literature contains surprisingly little formal analysis of the resulting infer-
ence problems. To our knowledge, this paper contains the first formal econometric analysis
of the problem of estimating LTV distributions. Additionally, it addresses open issues in
the closely related inference problems for price indices and trade and foreclosure behavior.
   The difficulty of estimating LTV distributions arises because a property’s price (the
denominator in the LTV ratio) is only observed when the property trades, and trades are
endogenous. Two existing approaches to this problem are surveys and imputed prices,
both with serious limitations. LTV estimates from surveys (e.g., the Survey of Consumer
Finances (SCF) and the American Housing Survey (AHS)) are limited by the scope and
timing of the surveys. More importantly, home owners may neither be fully informed nor
entirely objective when valuing their home hypothetically for a survey, creating method-
ological concerns and substantial disparities between overlapping surveys (e.g., Melzer,
2011). LTV estimates from imputed prices (e.g., from CoreLogic and Zillow) start from
the price or LTV that is observed when a property is traded or refinanced and then impute an
updated price using a local price index or hedonic pricing model (see Bhutta et al. (2010),
Landier et al. (2011), Laufer (2011), and Okah and Orr (2010) among others). Imputing
prices implicitly assumes that properties appreciate exactly as predicted by the model, i.e.,
that there is no idiosyncratic volatility. With idiosyncratic volatility, this approach under-
estimates the dispersion in prices and LTVs, resulting in downward biased estimates of the
fraction of underwater properties. To illustrate, if a local price index shows an average
appreciation of 5%, it matters whether this represents exactly 5% appreciation for each
individual property, or whether it represents, say, a 15% increase for one half, and a 5%
decline for the other half. By assuming the former, the imputation approach mechanically
underestimates the dispersion. Additionally, idiosyncratic volatility introduces a dynamic
sample-selection bias, as described below.
   We present a new econometric model of house prices, LTV ratios, and trade and fore-
closure behavior, and we estimate this model using data from Alameda County, California,
spanning 1988 to 2008. Our results suggest that selection biases are substantial. We es-


                                               2
timate an idiosyncratic annual volatility in individual home prices of 28%. Towards the
end of our sample period, a naïve imputation of property prices using a repeat-sales index
leads to an estimate of the fraction of underwater properties of 20%. Accounting purely
for the idiosyncratic volatility and the resulting increase in the dispersion of prices (but
not dynamic selection) increases this estimate to 30%. Different specifications of the dy-
namic selection effect result in final estimates of the fraction of underwater properties in
the 28%–37% range.
    For an external validation of our estimates, we investigate the index revision problem.
This is a well-known sample-selection problem in which the current estimates of the most
recent index value are systematically revised (typically downwards) when subsequent data
become available. In our baseline specification, this revision problem is reduced by about
45% (average long-term downward revisions are reduced from 13% to 7%), confirming that
our model captures a substantial amount of the dynamic selection of traded and foreclosed
properties.
    The difficulties of estimating LTVs lead to other inference problems. Trade and fore-
closure decisions are endogenous and depend on current prices and LTVs (e.g., Case, Pol-
lakowski, and Wachter, 1997). This creates a selection problem when estimating prices
and price indices.1 Correcting such price estimates requires a selection model, such as a
probit or hazard model of trade and foreclosure behavior. This selection model, however,
requires current LTVs or prices as explanatory variables. We resolve this circularity by
jointly estimating the price index and the trade and foreclosure model.
    Our approach extends the standard repeat-sales model by Bailey, Muth, and Nourse
(1963) and Case and Shiller (1987) by modeling the entire price path for each individual
   1 This problem is aptly described by Calnea (Calnea Analytics (2010), p. 14), who calculates the United
Kingdom’s land-registry house-price index using a repeat-sales regression (RSR): “The RSR index is nat-
urally more reflective of properties that transact more frequently. In so far as a differential in price ap-
preciation exists between properties based on the relative frequency of transactions, the RSR measure will
be naturally weighted towards the more frequently transacting subset of properties. There are a variety of
reasons why the holding duration of properties might be unevenly distributed. The increase in transaction
costs for more expensive properties due to stamp duty may result in a decreased turnover of more expensive
homes. “Life-cycle” theories on property holding period posit that less expensive properties are traded more
frequently—when people move up the property “ladder” they tend to move home less often. In addition the
Buy-to-Let market is more active in the lower price brackets. Policy-makers need to be aware of the price
appreciation differentials between sub markets, especially when there is systematic variation in the frequency
of transactions between these sub markets.”

property, even when it is not traded, and by explicitly modeling trade and foreclosure de-
cisions for each property at each point in time. Simultaneously estimating prices, LTVs,
and trade and foreclosure behavior has several advantages. First, econometrically, the trade
process is a dynamic extension of the selection equation in the standard sample-selection
model (Heckman, 1979, 1990), and simultaneously estimating the price and trade processes
corrects for selection bias. (For this reason we sometimes refer to the trade process as the
selection or trade-selection process.) Second, the parameters in the trade process reflect
trading behavior. Separating regular sales from foreclosure sales and allowing coefficients
to vary over time, we find large and unprecedented changes in recent behavior. Third,
the approach estimates the full cross-sectional and time-series distributions of the LTVs.
Finally, our procedure consistently incorporates price information revealed by untraded
properties. To illustrate, when appreciating properties are more likely to trade, a period
with few trades suggests declining prices. (Conversely, when depreciating properties are
more likely to trade, possibly in foreclosure sales, periods with few trades suggest appre-
ciating prices; our model captures both cases.) Hence, trading volume is informative about
prices and should be included in the estimator. This is fundamentally different from the
standard Heckman (1979) cross-sectional sample-selection model. In this standard model,
observations with unobserved outcomes are only informative about the first stage, not the
second one.2 In our dynamic extension, prices are serially correlated, and the fact that
a property is not traded is informative about its current price, which is informative about
its previous and subsequent prices due to the serial correlation. Hence, observations with
unobserved outcomes must be included in the second stage as well.3
    Our Bayesian estimator has several advantages as well.4 First, modeling price dynam-
ics for individual properties is numerically intensive, rendering standard maximum likeli-
   2 In the standard selection model, unobserved outcomes are independent and can be integrated out of the
likelihood function for the second stage, conditional on the estimates of the first stage. With serial correlation,
unobserved outcomes are no longer independent and cannot be integrated out.
    3 Some studies construct corrected real-estate indices using a standard Heckman selection model (e.g., Jud

and Seaks, 1994; Munneke and Slade, 2000; and Hwang and Quigley, 2004). The standard Heckman model,
however, does not allow serial correlations in unobserved outcomes, and the price information revealed by
untraded properties is not incorporated, raising concerns about whether these model are correctly specified
and whether the resulting estimators are consistent.
    4 Our procedure is substantially different from the Bayesian estimators of the repeat-sales model described

and compared by Goetzmann (1992), which do not exploit these advantages to the same extent.



                                                        4
hood (ML) estimation infeasible. Bayesian estimation, however, remains computationally
feasible with robust convergence properties, as explained below. Second, the estimation
procedure is a numerical Monte Carlo procedure that simulates unobserved prices as part
of the estimation. This makes it straightforward to construct posterior distributions of the
estimated parameters and non-linear transformations of these, such as price indices, LTVs,
and foreclosure and trade intensities. In contrast, standard statistical inference (e.g., cal-
culating standard errors) is difficult for such transformations, especially involving variance
parameters, which are not asymptotically normal. Finally, the Bayesian estimator produces
accurate small-sample inference. Although our sample contains around 70,000 properties,
the number of estimated parameters and prices is also large, and it is difficult to assess
whether asymptotic approximations would be appropriate.
    As a final comment, our model extends the empirical finance literature about illiquid
assets with unobserved prices, such as private equity and venture capital investments in pri-
vately held companies (Cochrane, 2005; and Korteweg and Sorensen, 2010). The empirical
issues are closely related,5 and our approach may be useful for understanding prices and
trading behavior of other illiquid or asynchronously-traded assets (e.g., corporate bonds,
small-cap stocks, and index arbitrage). More generally, the empirical approach exploits re-
cent advances in Bayesian computational procedures—specifically, Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), Gibbs Sampling, and forward filtering backwards sampling (FFBS)—
that permit estimation of models with infrequently observed behavior of individual agents,
which may be useful for other applications.
    In Section I, we present the empirical model and discuss the estimation procedure and
identification. Section II presents the data. In Section III, we compare price indices esti-
mated with and without correcting for sample selection. Section IV presents estimates of
the LTV distribution. In Section V, we analyze trade and foreclosure behavior. Section VI
contains concluding remarks. Details about the estimation procedure are in the Appendix.
    5 Bloomberg (August 17, 2011) reported that there is “a record number of private-equity firms raising real

estate funds,” suggesting deeper economic relationships between real estate and private equity.

I     Model of Prices and Trades
To fix ideas and notation for our empirical model, it is useful to derive the discrete-time
price dynamics from continuous-time fundamentals. Let µ(t) be a common exogenous
determinant of price appreciation (a price index), and let the price of property i follow the
Brownian motion:
                                  dPi (t)
                                           = µ(t)dt + si dBi (t).                                              (1)
                                   Pi (t)
                                                          ´t                           1 2
Define the log-price pi (t) = ln (Pi (t)) and let di (t) = t 1 µ(t)dt                  2 si .   Using Ito’s lemma,
the change in the log-price from time t to t 0 is:
                                                      "              #
                                                          t0
                               pi (t 0 ) = pi (t) +       Â    di (t) + ei (t,t 0 ),                           (2)
                                                      t=t+1


with ei (t,t 0 ) ⇠ N 0, (t 0   t)s2i .
    The standard repeat-sales regression (RSR) is estimated from this equation using prop-
erties that trade (at least) twice by regressing the change in the observed log prices on
indicator variables for the intermediate periods between the trades, represented by the di (t)
terms in the equation. This regression is typically implemented using generalized least
squares (GLS) to correct for heteroscedasticity by weighing each observation by the in-
verse of the square root of the time between trades. With a sufficient number of partially
overlapping trades, all d(t) coefficients are identified (assuming no heterogeneity in si ).
The estimated d(t) coefficients are consistent when e is independent of the indicator vari-
ables (i.e., when the expected value of e is independent of whether or not the property
trades). This independence fails, however, when the decision to trade is not independent
of the price appreciation, ei (t). In this case, the error term is correlated with the indica-
tor variables, creating the sample-selection problem and potentially biasing the estimated
coefficients.
    Setting t = t 0    1, the one-period transition equation is:


                                    pi (t) = pi (t        1) + d(t) + ei (t),                                  (3)




                                                          6
with ei (t) ⇠ N(0, s2i ). Since most prices are unobserved, this equation cannot be estimated
directly. Treating the price as an unobserved state variable, however, our estimation pro-
cedure uses this equation to filter out the unobserved prices between trades. Following the
finance terminology, we also refer to d(t) as systematic variation and ei (t) as idiosyncratic
volatility.6
    The estimated d(t) coefficients can be transformed into price indices. Normalizing by
the price level at time t0 , it is natural to define an index as the population average of current
prices relative to time-t0 prices (in levels, not logs) as:

                      "    "              #            !#
                                 t                              t
           Pi (t)
  I(t) = E
           Pi (t0 )
                    = E exp     Â     d(t)   + e (t
                                                i 0 ,t)    =  ’ exp d(t) + 12 s2 . (4)
                              t=t0 +1                        t=t0 +1


The one-period change in this index is I(t)/I(t             1) = exp d(t) + 12 s2 . Note that typical
repeat-sales indices, such as those from S&P/Case-Shiller, CoreLogic, and FHFA (formerly
OFHEO), are defined without the 12 s2 adjustment term. Below, we compare indices with
and without this adjustment. Goetzmann (1992) discusses this adjustment in more detail,
and denotes indices with and without it as arithmetic and geometric indices, respectively.


A     Trade and Foreclosure Processes

To model sales, it is convenient to define the latent discrete time process wi (t), such that
property i trades between time t          1 and t, and hence pi (t) is observed, when


                                                 wi (t)   0.                                              (5)


This trade process is parametrized as:


                                  wi (t) = Wi0 (t)a0 + pi (t)a p + hi (t),                                (6)
    6 One can imagine estimating more flexible price processes, such as auto-regressive processes or processes

that depend on property characteristics or whether properties trade in foreclosure sales. This raises issues
about the identification of the model, left for future research. A main advantage of the simple specification
used here is that it is equivalent to the standard repeat-sales model, making the results directly comparable.




                                                      7
where hi (t) is i.i.d. N(0, 1). This specification is equivalent to a binary probit model,
and the parameters are only identified up to scale. Without loss of generality, the scale
is normalized by fixing the error term’s variance to one. The term pi (t) is the log price.
Property characteristics and prevailing mortgage rates (and a constant term) are in Wi (t),
along with the log loan amount with a coefficient fixed to -a p , implying that a p is the
negative of the coefficient on log LTV.
    The resulting model is a dynamic extension of the standard cross-sectional sample-
selection model from Heckman (1979, 1990) with the trade process as the selection process.
Under standard conditions, jointly estimating these processes corrects for the selection bias
that may arise when the price dynamics of properties with observed prices are not represen-
tative of the price dynamics in the population overall. Note that the trade process depends
on the contemporaneous LTV ratio. This is a natural specification, yet it has been difficult
to implement in existing studies, because contemporaneous LTVs are unobserved. Our
model circumvents this problem by jointly estimating the latent price and trade processes.
    In our data, normal sales are distinguished from foreclosure sales, and one might sus-
pect, as we find empirically, that these sales follow different processes. Appreciating prop-
erties are more likely to trade in normal sales, whereas depreciating properties are more
likely to end in foreclosures. Hence, we also estimate specifications with separate trade
and foreclosure processes. In these specifications, we include an additional foreclosure
process such that a foreclosure sale (but not necessarily a normal sale) occurs between time
t   1 and t when
                                             zi (t)   0.                                     (7)

This process is parametrized as:


                               zi (t) = Zi0 (t)g0 + pi (t)g p + xi (t).                      (8)


As above, x is i.i.d. N(0, 1), and Zi (t) contains observed variables that affect the probability
of foreclosure sales, including log LTV, property characteristics, and mortgage rates. In our
empirical specifications, we always have Z = W .




                                                  8
B     Empirical Implementation

To summarize, the baseline model specifies the price and trade processes:


                                     pi (t) = pi (t    1) + d(t) + ei (t),                                   (9)


                                  wi (t) = Wi0 (t)a0 + pi (t)a p + hi (t),                                 (10)

                                     wi (t)    0 , pi (t) is observed.                                     (11)

The price process, pi (t), is mostly unobserved, except when wi (t)                        0. The trade (or
selection) process, wi (t), is entirely unobserved. The vector Wi (t) is observed data. The
error terms are i.i.d. with ei (t) ⇠ N(0, s2 ) and hi (t) ⇠ N(0, 1). The estimated parameters
of interest are a, s2 , and d(t).7
    This model defines a likelihood function. ML estimation is complicated, however, by
the large number of latent variables, since evaluating the likelihood requires integrating
over them jointly. We specify the model at the quarterly level over a 20-year period, re-
sulting in 160 (= 2 ⇥ 4 ⇥ 20) latent variables per property. With around 70,000 properties,
each evaluation of the likelihood requires numerically evaluating 70,000 160-dimensional
integrals, rendering ML estimation numerically intractable. As a feasible alternative, we
develop a Bayesian procedure, using an MCMC method known as Gibbs sampling, to
substantially reduce the computational burden. We provide an overview of this procedure
below, and more details are in the Appendix (see also Korteweg and Sorensen, 2010).
    The model is constructed such that its variables can be divided into three blocks. The
first block contains the parameters, a, s2 , and d(t); the second one contains the variables
in the trade processes, wi (t); and the third block contains the price processes, pi (t). The
Gibbs sampler simulates the (augmented) posterior distribution by iteratively drawing the
variables in each block conditional on the previous draw of the variables in the other blocks
(for a formal treatment see Geman and Geman (1984), Tanner and Wong (1987), Gelfand
    7 Although not pursued here, these assumptions can be relaxed somewhat. It is possible to estimate specifi-

cations with property-specific coefficients using hierarchical priors, and the normality assumptions generalize
to mixtures of normals without losing tractability of the Bayesian procedure. The log-price must enter the
trade process linearly, however, to maintain a linear Kalman filter, since generalizing the log-linear specifica-
tion introduces substantial numerical complexity. See Korteweg and Sorensen (2010) for details.

and Smith (1990), Johannes and Polson (2006), and Korteweg (2012)).
    In the first block, conditional on the previous draw of the price and trade processes, the
parameters a, s2 , and d(t) are given by the linear equations (9) and (10), and they are drawn
from a standard Bayesian linear regression.8 Drawing the trade process in the second block
is similarly straightforward. Conditional on the parameters and prices, the distribution of
wi (t) follows a truncated normal distribution that is constrained to be negative when there
is no trade and positive when a trade is observed, as specified by equation (11). These first
two blocks are analogous to Bayesian estimation of probit models (see Albert and Chib,
1993). The key to the model is the third block, where the entire path of unobserved prices is
drawn using the FFBS procedure (Carter and Kohn, 1994; and Fruhwirth-Schnatter, 1994).
Conditional on the parameters and trade process, the price process can be viewed as being
defined by a linear state space or Kalman filter. Under this view, pi (t) is the unobserved
state variable; the transition rule is the one-period price equation (9); the index d(t) is an
“observed” control acting on the state; and, conditional on wi (t), the trade process is an
observation equation, providing noisy “observations” of the state. Given this setup, the
FFBS procedure draws from the conditional posterior distribution of the entire price path,
as required in the third block of the Gibbs sampler.9
    This Gibbs sampling procedure iteratively draws from the joint posterior distribution of
the parameters and the individual price paths for the properties. Using these draws, the pos-
terior distributions of the price index and LTV distributions are straightforward to construct.
For the price index, fixing t, in each iteration, we calculate I(t) = ’tt0 +1 exp d(t) + 12 s2
using the current draws of d(t) and s2 . Across iterations, the resulting distribution is the
posterior distribution of I(t).10 Repeating this calculation for all t generates the posterior
distribution of the entire index.
    The construction is slightly more complicated conceptually for the LTV distribution,
   8 Technically,    this is implemented as draws from several blocks, as explained in detail in the Appendix.
   9 While    it is convenient to describe the blocks in this order, the actual sampling procedure has better
numerical properties when starting with the prices in the third block. By setting the initial value of a p = 0,
the first iteration can draw the prices without specifying initial values of the trade process, which speeds up
convergence.
   10 Note that it would be difficult to perform standard classical asymptotic inference on this index, such as

calculating its standard error, since I(t) is a nonlinear function of the estimated parameters and the asymptotic
distribution of s2 is not normal.



                                                      10
since its posterior is a distribution of distributions (or, more precisely, a time series of
the distribution of distributions). In each iteration, the LTVi (t) = Principali (t)/Pi (t) is
calculated using the outstanding principal (described below) and the current draws of the
price processes. Collecting these values across properties produces one draw from the
posterior distribution of the cross-sectional distribution of LTVs. Collecting these cross-
sectional distributions across iterations and time produces the time series of their posterior
distributions. From these distributions it is straightforward to calculate, for example, the
time series of the estimated fraction of underwater properties, i.e., properties with LTVs
exceeding one.


C    Identification

Heckman (1990) shows that semi-parametric identification of the standard selection model
requires exogenous or predetermined variation in the selection equation. We include the
time since the previous trade (Time) as such variation. Following the logic of the standard
model, there are two requirements for Time to be a valid. First, the exclusion restriction
requires that Time is independent of the error term in the price process. When the price
process follows a martingale, which is a common assumption for price processes, this ex-
clusion restriction holds mechanically. Second, Time must be directly related to the proba-
bility of a sale. Due to transaction costs, it is reasonable to think that a new owner does not
intend to resell a property immediately after buying it. Hence, immediately after a trade,
the trade intensity declines and then gradually increases independently of the idiosyncratic
term in the price process. This behavior is consistent with the well-known phenomenon
of “seasoning” of mortgage-backed securities, where new loans prepay slower than older
loans, and our empirical results confirm this pattern. With these two requirements, Time
provides valid exogenous variation for the identification of the model. Note, however, that
the empirical results are very similar for specifications with and without Time, suggesting
that the model is reasonably well identified from distributional assumptions alone.
    For a formal identification argument, consider properties trading at time t0 , some of
which trade again one period later, at time t0 + 1. This simple case is equivalent to the
standard Heckman model, and identification follows from Heckman’s (1990) identification

                                              11
argument, which requires a variable, s(t0 + 1), that is independent of e(t0 + 1), and that
the probability of a trade at time t0 + 1 is a non-degenerate function of s(t0 + 1). Our case
is more complex, though, since the predetermined source of variation is the time since
the previous trade, and we cannot only consider trades one period apart. For our case,
compare properties trading at time t0 and again at time t0 + t to properties trading repeat-
edly at times t0 , t0 + 1, t0 + 2, ..., t0 + t. The average appreciation for the first properties

comparing the appreciation of properties trading rarely to properties trading frequently
over the same period of time provides observations of the same sum of d(t) under various
degrees of selection. Varying the predetermined variable, s, leads to different amounts of
selection, and the standard identification argument applies.
    As a more intuitive illustration, compare property A, trading at times 0 and 2, to prop-
erty B, trading at times 0, 1, and 2 (each time period may span several years). The total
appreciation from time 0 to 2 is observed for both properties and denoted dA and dB .11
Assume that trading one period apart (property B) is unusual and has a lower probability
than trading two periods apart (property A). These probabilities are observed (in the stan-
dard Heckman model, they are estimated in the “first stage”). Given that property B traded
in an unusual way, it may have experienced a price shock that compensated for the low
probability. If dB > dA , property B traded more frequently because it experienced a posi-
tive shock, and we infer that the coefficient a p in the trade-selection equation is positive.
Conversely, if dB < dA , we infer a p < 0. The magnitude of a p can be derived from the
difference dB      dA relative to the difference in the probabilities. Finally, we might observe
dB = dA and infer that trades are independent of price and a p = 0. Given the identification
of a p , the identification of the remaining parameters is straightforward.
  11 For a more formal identification argument, each of these properties represents a sufficiently large number

of individually trading properties that the law of large numbers applies and individual error terms can be
replaced by their conditional expectations. Specifically, dA and dB are the expected appreciations conditional
on the different trading patterns.

II     Data
We use data from transactions of single-family residences in Alameda County, California.
Alameda County is located in the San Francisco East Bay Area and includes, amongst
others, the cities of Oakland and Berkeley. The data are from CoreLogic (formerly First
American), obtained through the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia Business
School, and they include all transactions in the 20-year period from 1988:Q1 to 2008:Q3.
Unfortunately, the center’s agreement with CoreLogic expired in 2008, and we have been
unable to extend the sample beyond this period. The data contains sales dates and prices,
mortgage amounts, and refinancing information obtained from the deeds records. In ad-
dition, tax records contain information about each property’s characteristics, such as size,
number of bedrooms, single- or multi-family residence, etc.
     We restrict the sample to properties that satisfy the following criteria: the property is a
single-family residence; it trades at least twice during our sample period, and both sales are
full sales (not partial sales); the tax records have no missing property characteristics; the
property’s characteristics have not changed between the two sales; it has no more than 10
bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, and 3 stories; and it is located on less than 5 acres with less than
10,000 square feet of living space. The resulting sample contains 164,824 transactions of
68,700 properties. Table I presents summary statistics, and Figure 1 shows the time series
of normal trades and foreclosure sales within the sample.
     While the data contain initial mortgage amounts and subsequent refinancings, they con-
tain no information about amortization schedules. We estimate an amortization schedule
assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at the prevailing rate at the time of the transaction.
Whenever possible we update the outstanding mortgage amounts using refinancing infor-
mation.12 Using these calculated outstanding loan principals, we calculate the LTV, with
the value in the denominator given by the price process specified in the model.
     This calculation fails for transactions of properties without mortgages. These properties
have LTVs equal to zero, leaving log LTV undefined. We set their log LTV to                        3, corre-
sponding to an LTV ratio of 5%. These cases are infrequent, and the particular number has
  12 Refinancings  typically involve an appraisal of the property’s value. These appraisal values are not used
for estimating the price process.



                                                     13
a negligible effect on our estimates, as does excluding them altogether. We do not truncate
the upper tail of the LTV distribution, but in unreported estimates, we find that doing so has
a negligible impact on the estimates. The top plot in Figure 3 shows the distribution of the
buyers’ LTV ratios at the time of the transactions. The bottom plot shows the sellers’ dis-
tribution. Both LTVs are observed at the time of a transaction, and these plots only include
those observed ratios, not those estimated by the model.
   Foreclosure sales are identified in the data, typically separating the initial seizure of
the property from the subsequent sale of the repossessed property by the bank. We define
the latter of those two transactions as the foreclosure sale. The former transaction, when
a property is seized by the lender, is not an arms-length transaction and does not have a
well-defined price or mortgage, and it is not included in the estimation.
   Mortgage rates are collected from FRED, a database maintained by the Federal Reserve
in St. Louis. We use the change in the prevailing mortgage rate since the transaction in the
specifications. When the mortgage rate declines, it becomes more attractive for owners to
sell or refinance their loans.



III     Price Dynamics
We first compare the price dynamics without the trade process and selection correction.
Figure 3 plots indices estimated using the standard GLS procedure and our MCMC pro-
cedure (without selection correction, i.e., fixing a p = 0), along with the S&P/Case-Shiller
Home Price Index for the San Francisco metro area.13 Arithmetic indices include the 12 s2
adjustment (the annualized GLS estimate of s is 0.2811). Geometric indices are calculated
without this adjustment. All indices are normalized to 100 in 2000:Q1.
   Apart from the large differences between arithmetic and geometric indices, the indices
are very similar. The S&P/Case-Shiller Index is similar to the geometric indices calculated
here, although Case-Shiller is about ten points lower at the peak. This ten-point difference
probably arises because the S&P/Case-Shiller Index includes transactions from the entire
San Francisco metropolitan statistical area (MSA), comprising the counties of Alameda,

                                                   14
Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo; our data cover only Alameda County,
which is around one-third of the MSA by population. Additionally, unlike our indices, the
S&P/Case-Shiller Index is smoothed and value-weighted.
   In Figure 3, the indices from the GLS and MCMC estimators appear virtually identical.
Econometrically, the GLS estimator is defined in terms of moment conditions and the as-
sumption that the variance of the error term increases linearly with the time between trades.
The Bayesian MCMC estimator also imposes distributional assumptions on the error terms
and priors. The similarity between the resulting indices suggests that, at least absent the
trade process and selection correction, the MCMC estimator’s distributional assumptions
are reasonable.
   Figure 4 plots indices corrected for selection using the trade process. Models A to F
refer to the different specifications of this process, given in Table II. The baseline model
is the MCMC estimator without selection correction from Figure 3. Unlike the corrected
indices, the uncorrected index from the baseline model shows a small increase by the end
of the sample period. Figure 5 shows similar indices estimated from specifications with
separate processes for normal trades and foreclosure sales. This leads to slightly larger
effects of the selection correction. Most pessimistic is Model A, producing a final index
around 140. Model F is most optimistic, ending with the index at 170. In contrast, the
baseline index ends at a level around 155.
   Indices with and without selection corrections are broadly similar, suggesting that long-
term biases from sample selection in price indices are, perhaps, a smaller concern than
previously thought (e.g., by Calnea Analytics, see footnote 2). Comparing the two in-
dices, the quarter-by-quarter changes can be quite different, but over the sample period, the
levels never diverge substantially. Intuitively, while more rapidly appreciating properties
trade during the price run-up, eventually the more slowly appreciating properties also trade.
When they trade, they bring the index back to the underlying population average, and while
the standard index may show temporary biases due to selection, as long as all properties
eventually trade, the levels of the standard and selection-corrected indices are unlikely to
diverge substantially.




                                             15
A     Index Revisions

In the short term, selection bias leads to the well-known index revision problem (e.g.,
Clapham et al. (2006)). The index revision problem is the sample-selection problem that
arises when initial transaction data are selected and updated with new trades, resulting in
revisions of the index. In other words, the sample selection problem is important in the
short run, but disappears in the long run. Systematic revisions of the index value for a
given period as more data arrives have, for example, made it difficult to construct financial
derivatives based on the index value.
    To test the external validity of our model, we investigate whether our selection-corrected
index is less susceptible to the index revision problem than the standard repeat-sales index.
Since the index revision problem is a sample-selection problem, this provides a natural test
of the model.14 Figure 6 shows index estimates where the sample is extended incremen-
tally by one quarter at a time, and the entire index is re-estimated from the extended sample
(for expositional clarity, the plot only shows every fourth index, corresponding to one-year
extensions of the sample). The top panel contains standard repeat-sales indices, and the bot-
tom panel contains indices estimated with a simple trade-selection process containing just
log LTV (Model A). In both panels, the consistently downward revisions are immediately
apparent. For the selection-corrected indices, however, revisions are substantially smaller.
For each quarter we calculate the standard deviation across the index values calculated for
this quarter using the incrementally extended sample periods. For the standard repeat-sales
index, the average within-quarter standard deviation is 0.060. For our selection-corrected
index, it is 0.036.
    Revisions are not only smaller, they also converge faster. To illustrate, Figure 7 plots
the relative change in the index as the sample period is extended. The top plot contains
revisions of the standard repeat-sales indices, and the bottom plot contains revisions of the
selection-corrected ones. In both cases, the median revision when including a single ad-
  14 We considered two other external validity tests: (1) whether our model predicts prices of future out-of-

sample transactions and (2) whether it predicts the timing of future out-of-sample trades and foreclosures.
These tests are less useful, however. First, sample selection models do not attempt to predict observed
outcomes (OLS is the best linear unbiased estimator), rather they estimate whether observed outcomes are
representative of outcomes in the overall (unobserved) population. Second, our data contain no time-varying
property-specific characteristics, making it difficult to predict the timing of individual trades and foreclosures.



                                                       16
ditional quarter of data is around -5%, although the magnitude of the revision is slightly
smaller and the probability of a smaller revision is higher for the selection-corrected in-
dices. In the limit, however, after 12 quarters of additional data are included, the median re-
vision is around -13% for the standard repeat-sales index and around -8% for the selection-
corrected index. In fact, this -8% median revision for the selection-corrected index is close
to the “best case” revision (5th percentile) of -7% for the standard index. For the selection-
corrected index, the best case revision is just -3%. Conversely, the “worst case” revision
(95th percentile) for the standard index is as large as -21%. For the selection-corrected
index, it is “only” -13%. Finally, Figure 7 illustrates the faster convergence of selection-
corrected indices. These indices stabilize after 4 quarters of additional data, whereas the
downward revisions of the standard repeat-sales index are present for the entire 12 quarters
of additional data.
   The reduced magnitude of the index-revision problem provides external validation of
the model’s ability to accurately capture the dynamic selection of traded properties. While
the simple specification of the trade-selection process (Model A) does not fully eliminate
the revisions, richer specifications of the selection processes may further reduce this prob-
lem. Due to the high computational cost of repeatedly estimating more complex specifica-
tions of the selection processes, we do not pursue this extension here.



IV     LTV Distributions
The data contain the LTV ratio at the time of each trade. The top panel in Figure 2 plots the
LTV ratio of the new owner’s mortgage, and the bottom panel plots the seller’s mortgage,
constructed from amortizing the existing mortgages as described above. In Figure 8, the
top panel plots the median seller’s LTV over the sample period and the fraction of the
housing stock sold in each quarter. The plots show an increase in median LTVs towards
the end of the sample paired with a drop in trading volume. This increase in the median
seller’s LTV appears modest, essentially restoring the median LTV to its level before the
housing boom during the mid-2000s. In contrast, the second Panel in Figure 8 reveals a
substantial increase in the fraction of sales that are foreclosure sales. The bottom Panel


                                              17
in Figure 8 shows an even greater increase in the fraction of properties sold with an LTV
ratio above one, i.e., sales of underwater properties. This suggests that not only is the
median LTV deteriorating, but the cross-sectional distribution of LTVs is also becoming
more dispersed, with an increasing fraction of properties with very negative equity. These
plots are made from the observed LTVs at the time of the transactions.
   Turning to LTVs estimated by the model, Figures 9 to 11 plot historical LTV distri-
butions in the population. Figure 9 shows the percentiles of the LTV distribution resulting
from the various specifications, and Figures 10 and 11 show the fractions of properties with
LTVs greater than 1, 1.25, and 1.5. In all cases, the LTV distribution appears to deteriorate
substantially during the last years of our sample.
   We compare the LTV distributions estimated using the model to those that would be
obtained by imputing prices from a local house price index. In Figures 10 and 11 the
plots denoted RSR represent LTV estimates constructed by imputing property prices us-
ing the standard repeat-sales index. For each property, the loan and price are recorded at
the time when the property transacts, and updated prices are then calculated and imputed
using the GLS index in Figure 3. The fraction of underwater properties according to this
RSR calculation is substantially below both the fraction plotted for the baseline MCMC
estimates—calculated without selection correction, but including the dispersion in prices
arising from the idiosyncratic volatility of individual prices—and the two plots correcting
for selection (using Models A and F). Compared to the RSR estimates, the baseline MCMC
estimates show a substantial increase in the dispersion in LTVs, and consequently a greater
fraction of underwater properties.
   Figures 10 and 11 also show that moving from the baseline MCMC model to Models
A and F leads to substantial changes in the estimated LTV distribution, which may be
more surprising. This is due to a more subtle dynamic selection effect. When properties
trade or are refinanced, their LTV is typically set to 80%. Appreciating properties have
better (lower) LTVs but are also more likely to be refinanced and have their LTVs reset to
80%. Depreciating properties have worse (higher) LTVs but those are less likely to be reset.
Hence, even when prices are constant, the average LTV may deteriorate due to this dynamic




                                             18
selection effect.15 This effect explains the increase in the fraction of underwater properties
moving from the baseline model to Model A. Model F further allows the LTV coefficient
to vary by period, and the coefficient changes sign in the last period, reversing the direction
of the dynamic selection and resulting in a lower fraction of underwater properties than the
baseline model. This selection of trades and refinancings, as a function on LTVs, is thus
important for estimating the cross-sectional dispersion of prices and LTVs, particularly the
fraction of underwater properties. In all cases, however, the RSR estimates using imputed
prices underestimate this fraction.



V      Trade and Foreclosure Behavior
Decisions to trade, prepay, and default are particularly important when pricing mortgage-
backed securities. The literature models these decisions in two ways. First, decisions to
trade and prepay can be viewed as exercising real options, and behavior can be derived
from models of optimal exercise of options (e.g., Stanton (1995) and Longstaff (2005)).
This structural approach, however, has been less successful empirically, either because
homeowners’ decisions are not optimal or because the models are too stylized to capture
the nuances of these decisions. Alternatively, trade and prepayment intensities can be es-
timated from the observed hazard rates in pools of mortgages (e.g., Schwartz and Torous
(1989, 1992)). One limitation of this reduced-form approach is that the trade and prepay-
ment decisions are modeled as functions of only a limited set of explanatory variables.
Importantly, these models do not permit these decisions to depend on contemporaneous
price or LTV. As a consequence, hazard rates obtained this way tend to shift across vin-
tages, suggesting that the parameters are not constant, structural parameters of the model,
raising concerns about using these hazard rates to forecast future behavior and to price
mortgage-backed securities.
    Our model provides a new approach to estimating trade and foreclosure intensities. This
is a reduced form approach where decisions to sell are captured by the trade-selection pro-
cess, but this process is estimated at the individual property level (not from pools), allowing
   15 Jensen’s inequality may produce an additional effect when calculating average LTVs by imputing average

prices, because the LTV ratio is a convex function of the price, and E [L/P|d] L/E [P|d].


                                                    19
an arbitrary number of property-specific explanatory variables, including contemporaneous
price or LTV.


A     Trade Behavior

Table II presents the different specifications of the trade process. All models include log
LTV as an explanatory variable, and Models B to E add additional variables. Model F
allows the log-LTV coefficient to vary over the sample period to investigate changes in
trade behavior.
    In Model A in Table II, the estimated log-LTV coefficient is negative and statistically
significant.16 Since a lower LTV corresponds to a higher price, the negative coefficient
suggests that properties with higher prices trade at higher intensities, consistent with Case,
Pollakowski, and Wachter (1997), who also find that appreciating properties trade faster.
Moreover, Figure 4 shows that the selection correction attenuates the size of the price bub-
ble relative to the baseline model. With a negative log-LTV coefficient, this attenuation is
intuitive: When prices generally appreciate, properties with more rapid price appreciation
are traded more frequently, and their prices are observed more frequently, causing standard
indices to exaggerate the price appreciation.
    Model B in Table II, includes the time in years since the previous sale (Time). The
coefficients for Time are positive and those for Time-Squared are negative, showing that
the trade intensity follows an inverse U shape as a function of Time. When a property has
just traded, the probability of another trade immediately drops and then gradually increases,
peaking after about nine years, holding LTV constant.17 As discussed, including Time also
improves the statistical identification of the model, although Table II and Figure 4 suggest
that this has a negligible effect on the estimated parameters and indices.
    In Model C in Table II there is a negative and significant coefficient on the change in
mortgage rate since loan inception, indicating that properties for which the mortgage rate
has increased are less likely to trade, which is not surprising. Including this variable has
little effect on the LTV coefficient, however, and Figure 4 shows almost no change in the
  16 Although   a slight abuse of standard terminology for Bayesian statistics, we call a coefficient statistically
significant at a given level when the corresponding credible interval does not contain zero.
   17 In Model B, the maximum intensity occurs after 9.1 years (9.1 = 0.0381/ (2 ⇥ 0.0021)).



                                                       20
index.
   Model D in Table II includes the size and age of the property, and shows that larger
and older houses trade less frequently. In Model E, these house characteristics are also
interacted with the log-LTV ratio. The positive significant coefficient on the interaction of
size and log LTV shows that for larger properties the trades are less sensitive to LTVs than
they are for smaller houses. The interaction of age and log LTV shows a very small effect.
   Finally, in Model F, the sample is divided into four sub-periods with separate inter-
cepts and log-LTV coefficients. This specification is motivated by the sharp increase in
foreclosures toward the end of the sample, which raises concerns about a structural break
in trade and foreclosure behavior. Interestingly, the coefficient on LTV increases mono-
tonically over the sample period (its absolute magnitude declines). The other coefficients
are largely unchanged. The gradual increase in the LTV coefficients reflects a gradual
shift in the market, where sales are becoming less sensitive to LTVs. In fact, over the
last period the log-LTV coefficient changes sign, suggesting that recently, properties with
higher LTVs have traded more frequently. One explanation for this change is the increase
in foreclosure sales of underwater properties. Indeed, Figure 4 shows that the price index
estimated with the specification of the trade process given by Model F declines by about
10–15 index points less during 2007 and 2008 than the other indices. Moreover, since the
index from Model F peaks at a higher level, the proportional decline is even smaller. We
investigate this shift in more detail below, when we estimate separate processes for normal
trades and foreclosure sales. Another explanation for the change in trading behavior would
be a change in economic conditions, resulting in a change in the demand for inexpensive,
high-LTV housing. We re-estimate (but do not report) our model with data for Maricopa
County, Arizona (Phoenix and Scottsdale metro areas) and Clark County, Nevada (Greater
Las Vegas area), and find qualitatively similar results. Specifically the dramatic deterio-
ration of the LTV distributions and the gradual increase in the LTV coefficients over the
sample period appear to be robust across these geographical locations. If the changes in
the trading behavior are due to economic conditions, these economic conditions appear to
be widely shared.
   So far, the estimates only include properties that trade (at least) twice to make the


                                             21
analysis comparable to the standard repeat-sales analysis. One may be concerned this
sub-sample is selected, although this is probably a smaller concern given the long sam-
ple period. Unlike the traditional repeat-sales regression, our model can be estimated using
all properties in the data, including those that trade only once, assuming they follow the
same trade process as those properties that trade more than once. Including these proper-
ties roughly doubles the sample size to over 140,000 properties, which may improve the
estimates of the price and trade processes (mechanically, the level of the estimated trade
intensity is reduced). Table III compares the coefficient on LTV in the trade equation across
the samples. In the extended sample, the coefficient is closer to zero, but still significant.
Another concern is that foreclosure sales may not be arms-length sales and that the resulting
prices may not reflect the true market values. We re-estimate our model after eliminating
foreclosure sales from the sample to investigate this concern, but Table III shows that the
LTV coefficient remains largely unchanged.


B    Foreclosure Behavior

Table IV presents coefficients for specifications with separate processes for foreclosure
sales and normal trades. Panel A contains the trade process, and Panel B contains the
foreclosure process. The coefficients in Panel A are largely similar to those from Table II,
which combines normal trades and foreclosure sales in the estimation. This follows from
the relatively low number of foreclosures over most of the sample. Hence, normal trades
dominate the sample and estimates using just normal trades appear very similar to estimates
that combine the normal trades with the (relatively few) foreclosures sales.
    Comparing Panels A and B in Table IV, the greatest difference between the trade and
foreclosure processes is the LTV coefficient for the last sub-period in Model F. In Model F
in Panel A, the coefficient on LTV in the last sub-period is smaller compared to Table II.
Much of this increase appears to be caused by foreclosures of high-LTV properties. This
is confirmed in Panel B in Table IV, where Model F has a large positive coefficient on
LTVs in the last period, showing that these foreclosure sales were predominantly driven by
properties with high LTVs. The negative coefficients during the previous periods are less
intuitive, but these are periods with fewer foreclosure sales, so the estimate may be a result

                                             22
of more atypical transactions.
    Comparing Panels A and B in Table IV more broadly, the trade and foreclosure pro-
cesses appear largely similar. In addition to the differences for log LTV, the two processes
appear to respond slightly differently to property age, with older properties more likely to
foreclose and less likely to trade in normal trades. Nevertheless, Figures 4 and 5 show that
the indices are largely unchanged after including these processes separately, despite their
differences.


C     Equivalent Constant Intensity

To interpret the economic magnitudes of the coefficients in the trade equation, we define
the equivalent constant intensities as follows. Assuming that trades follow a Poisson arrival
process with constant intensity li , the number of trades of property i up to time t, denoted
di (t), is distributed as:

                                                          lni exp[ li ]
                        P[di (t)   di (t     1) = n] =                  for n      0.      (12)
                                                                n!

The probability of no trade between time t            1 and t is:


                               P[di (t)      di (t   1) = 0] = exp[ li ].                  (13)


Using the estimated coefficients in the trade process, the probability of no trade is:


                             P[wi (t) < 0] = F[ Wi0 (t)a0           pi (t)a p ],           (14)


where F is the c.d.f. of the standard normal distribution. Equating these probabilities,


                               exp[ li ] = F[ Wi0 (t)a0           pi (t)a p ],             (15)


implying:
                                             ⇥                             ⇤
                               li =        ln F[ Wi0 (t)a0      pi (t)a p ] ,              (16)




                                                     23
with partial derivative:
                             dli      f[ Wi0 (t)a0      pi (t)a p ]
                                 = a0                               .                     (17)
                             dWi      F[ Wi0 (t)a0      pi (t)a p ]
We call li the equivalent constant intensity. This intensity is the constant Poisson intensity
that gives rise to the same probability of a trade as the estimated coefficients in the trade
process, and its partial derivatives are more readily interpretable as economic magnitudes
than the estimated coefficients. This is closely analogous to marginal effects for probit
models; in fact, the mathematical expressions are quite similar. The posterior distributions
of li and the partial derivatives are simple to calculate from the posterior distribution of a.
Note that li is only used to interpret the economic magnitude of the coefficients in the trade
process. It is not a structural part of the model. Explicitly modeling the trade intensity as a
continuous-time process depending on the LTV (or price) turns it into a doubly stochastic
Poisson process or Cox process (see Cox, 1955), which is beyond the present scope.
   Figure 12 plots the time series of li for Models A and F, evaluated at the median LTV
and the 25th and 75th percentiles across properties. The top panels are from the specifi-
cations with only a trade process, and the bottom panels are from the specifications with
separate trade and foreclosure processes. The top plots show slightly higher intensities,
because they plot the combined intensities of either normal trades or foreclosure sales. The
bottom panels are just the intensities of normal trades. Moving from Model A in the left
panels to Model F on the right, the intensity process becomes much more volatile. Model
F allows the LTV coefficient to vary over the sample period, and it includes a greater
number of explanatory variables, including mortgage rates and quarterly indicators to cap-
ture seasonality in the trade process, overall capturing more time variation in the process.
Specifically, the seasonal adjustments produces the “spiky” movements in the intensity.
   To interpret the economic magnitude of the estimated LTV coefficients, the thin gray
lines in Figure 12 plot the intensities evaluated at the bottom and top quartiles of the LTV
distribution. In Model A, the LTV coefficient combined with the widening of the LTV
distribution shows that early in the sample period, the trade intensities for relatively high-
and low-LTV properties were quite similar, around 2.4%. Later in the sample period, the
intensities diverge, with a quarterly trade intensity of low-LTV properties around 2.25% and
high-LTV around 2.75%, representing about a 20% difference. In Model F, the additional

                                              24
explanatory variables lead to a less clear picture. Not surprisingly, we find that the trade
intensity for normal trades increases in the early 2000s, and decline rapidly towards the end
of the sample period.
   Turning to foreclosure intensities, Figure 13 reveals the substantial increase in these
intensities in recent years, along with a quiet period during the price run-up in the early
2000s preceded by substantial activity during the previous housing crisis in the mid 1990s.
   Table V reports the partial derivatives of the equivalent constant intensity. Panel A
shows the effect on the trade intensity. From Figure 12 we know that the average quarterly
intensity is around 2.5%, and the mean estimate of -0.49% shows that a one-standard devi-
ation increase in LTV reduces the trade intensity from around 2.5% to around 2% (around
a 20% decline), which confirms that the economic magnitude of the effect of LTV on trade
intensity is substantial. The corresponding figures for foreclosures are in Panel B. The first
figure of 0.04% shows that a one-standard deviation increase in LTV is associated with an
increase in foreclosure intensity from around 0.1% (from Figure 13) to 0.14%, a substantial
increase. Finally, note that these figures mechanically overestimate the baseline intensities,
because only properties that trade twice (or more) are included in the sample.



VI     Conclusion
While price indices, LTV distributions, and trade and foreclosure behavior are common
indicators of economic activity, they are surprisingly difficult to estimate, because property
prices are only observed when the properties trade, and trades are endogenous. We present
a new econometric model to address this problem. Our approach filters out the entire
price path of each property in our data, even when the property is non-traded and its price
is unobserved. This filtering is numerically intensive, but exploiting recent advances in
computational Bayesian estimation —specifically, MCMC, Gibbs sampling, and FFBS—
produces a tractable estimation procedure with robust convergence properties.
   The model estimates property prices jointly with the trade and foreclosure processes,
which allows those decisions to depend directly on price or LTV. It uses the trade and fore-
closure processes as dynamic extensions of the standard cross-sectional Heckman sample-


                                             25
selection equation to correct the estimates for selection arising when the price dynamics for
the traded properties (for which prices are observed) are not representative of the overall
population.
   For price indices, there have been concerns that the recent increase in the fraction of
foreclosure sales biases standard repeat sales indices. We find that the magnitude of this
bias is more modest than expected, at least in the long term. Even when rapidly appre-
ciating properties were more likely to trade during the bubble years, and this created an
upward bias in the traditional repeat-sales index, this bias appears to be somewhat modest
in magnitude and temporary as well. When the more slowly appreciating properties even-
tually trade, they bring the index back in line with the average price level in the underlying
population.
   In the short term, however, selection leads to the index revision problem where cur-
rent index estimates are subsequently revised (typically downwards) as trade data become
available for the estimation. These revisions are substantial, but our baseline specifica-
tion reduces the magnitudes of the revisions by about 45% (the absolute magnitude of the
median revision declines from 13% to 7%).
   We find large effects for home price dispersions, compared to an estimator of LTV
distributions that imputes prices from a repeat-sales index on the untraded properties for
which the price is unobserved. This standard approach substantially underestimates the
dispersion of prices, and hence the dispersion of LTVs, leading to estimates of the fraction
of underwater properties substantially below those produced by our approach.
   Finally, we calculate the equivalent continuous-time Poisson intensities. These are po-
tentially useful for models pricing mortgage-backed securities and derivatives on home
price indices. Moreover, these intensity estimates suggest large recent changes in trade and
foreclosure behavior. While we cannot isolate the specific cause of this change, it appears
to be wide spread, and some caution is required when using historical data to predict future
prepayment and defaults
   To our knowledge, this study contains the first formal econometric analysis of the prob-
lem of estimating LTV distributions, given the illiquidity of the real estate market. More
research is needed, however. Our sample ends in 2008, and while we have been unable


                                             26
to extend the sample beyond this period, the deterioration of the real estate markets has
continued. In April, 2010, Fiserv (the publisher of the S&P/Case-Shiller Indices) stated
that “the housing market has experienced significant turmoil and the last two-to-three years
have seen large increases in foreclosures as well as other market dislocations” and followed
this statement by a recommendation against using the standard seasonality adjustments, as
they appear to no longer work correctly. More recently, the June 2011 home sales figures
from Las Vegas show that volume is up 8% year-over-year but that almost 70% of sales
were distressed sales (47.2% were bank-owned properties and 21.6% were short sales),
underscoring the importance of understanding distressed markets for illiquid assets.

Appendix: Estimation Procedure
For each property i, the natural logarithm of price, pi (t), follows the process:


                                        pi (t) = pi (t       1) + d(t) + ei (t),                                    (18)


with ei (t) ⇠ N(0, s2 ) and i.i.d. across firms, i = 1 . . . N, and across time, t = 1 . . . T . Note
that d(t) is the index return between time t                 1 and t, so d(t) ranges from d(2) to d(T ). The
price is observed whenever wi (t)              0, where wi (t) is given by the selection equation:


                                    wi (t) = Wi0 (t)a0 + pi (t)a p + hi (t).                                        (19)


The vector of covariates Wi (t) is observed. In some models, we separate foreclosure sales
from normal trades by including an additional selection equation in which a foreclosure
occurs when zi (t)        0, where z(t) is:


                                       zi (t) = Zi0 (t)g0 + pi (t)g p + xi (t).                                     (20)


The error terms h and x are distributed i.i.d. normal with variance equal to one, and are
uncorrelated with each other at all leads and lags (including contemporaneously).
    It is convenient to stack the selection equations into a 2x1 vector:


                                       si (t) = Si0 (t)f0 + pi (t)f p + zi (t),                                     (21)
                      2            3             2                           3      2         3       2         3
                          wi (t)                     Wi0 (t)        0                    a0                ap
    where si (t) = 4               5, Si0 (t) = 4                            5, f0 = 4        5, f p = 4        5, and
                          zi (t)                         0        Z 0i (t)               g0                gp
        2             3
             hi (t)
zi (t) = 4            5. The covariance matrix of zi (t) is the identity matrix. For the models
          xi (t)
in which we only use one selection equation, si (t) = wi (t) and equation (21) is identical to
(19).
    The set of parameters to be estimated is q = d(2) . . . d(T ), s2 , a0 , a p , g0 , g p . We aug-
ment the parameter set with the latent variables and use a Bayesian estimation algorithm


                                                             28
that simulates the posterior distribution, f (q, {pi (t), si (t)} |data), using a Gibbs sampler
(Gelfand and Smith, 1990). By the Hammersley-Clifford theorem, we can break up the
posterior into three complete conditionals:

   1. Latent prices: f ({pi (t)} | {si (t)} , q, data)

   2. Selection variables: f ({si (t)} | {pi (t)} , q, data)

   3. Parameters: f (q| {pi (t), si (t)} , data)

We sample from each distribution 1-3 in turn, after which we return back to step 1 and
repeat. The resulting sequence of parameter draws forms a Markov chain, the stationary
distribution of which is exactly the posterior distribution. Given a sample of draws of
the posterior distribution, it is then straightforward to numerically integrate out the latent
variables and obtain the marginal posterior of parameters, f (q|data), or the unobserved
prices, f ({pi (t)} |data), for example. We now discuss how to draw from each conditional
distribution.


A1 Latent prices

We draw latent prices in the period between property sales using the FFBS algorithm
(Carter and Kohn, 1994; and Fruhwirth-Schnatter, 1994), which provides an efficient way
to sample a path of state variables defined by a linear state space model. Since the error
terms are assumed i.i.d. across properties, we can sample pi (t) separately for each propety.
For expositional simplicity, we describe the algorithm for a particular property, suppressing
the dependence on i.
    Interpreting the econometric model as a linear state space model, p(t) is the state vari-
able, and equation (18) is the transition rule. Conditional on the parameters, d(t) is an
“observed” control acting on the state, and conditional on s(t), the collection of selection
equations given by equation (21) are noisy observations equation for the state. This setup
allows us to calculate the filtered distribution of p(1) . . . p(T ), using the Kalman filter.
    The Kalman filter produces the distribution of p(t) conditional on s(1) . . . s(t), for any
time t. However, p(t) needs to be sampled conditional on the entire time series s(1) . . . s(T ).


                                                   29
This is achieved by a backward smoother, which effectively runs a Kalman filter backwards,
starting at time T . The conditional distribution of the state vector of latent valuations is
given by the following identity, which follows from Lemma 2.1 in Carter and Kohn (1994):

                                                                T 1
                   f p(1) . . . p(T )|sT = f p(T )|sT           ’f            p(t)|st , p(t + 1) ,   (22)
                                                                t=1


where st = {s(1) . . . s(t)} contains the selection variables up to time t. Next we describe
the forward filtering and backward sampling steps in detail.
                       ⇥       ⇤                 ⇥        ⇤
    Define m(t| j) = E p(t)|s j and v(t| j) = Var p(t)|s j as the mean and variance of p(t)
conditional on the selection variables up to time j. Note that all conditional distributions
are normal and hence fully characterized by their means and variances (Kalman, 1960; and
Anderson and Moore, 1979).
      For the forward filtering step, for t = 1 . . . T , we calculate m(t|t) and v(t|t) by iterating
on the forward filter, through a forecasting and an updating part. The forecasting part
involves the two equations:


                                m(t|t     1) = m(t        1|t       1) + d(t),                       (23)


and
                                  v(t|t    1) = v(t       1|t       1) + s2 .                        (24)

For the updating part, as long as p(t) remains unobserved, we update:

                                                  ⇥                                             ⇤
                    m(t|t) = m(t|t      1) + K 0 · s(t)        S0 (t)f0        m(t|t       1)f p ,   (25)


where the Kalman gain K is given by:

                               ⇥                           ⇤    1
                            K = I + f p v(t|t      1)f0p            · v(t|t      1)f p ,             (26)


and I is the 2x2 identity matrix (in the case of one selection equation, this is simply a
scalar unity). When K is large, more weight is placed on the information from the selection
equation. This happens when either f p or v(t|t                 1) is large, i.e., when either the selec-


                                                   30
tion equations are more informative about the valuations or when the valuations are more
uncertain. Further,
                                 v(t|t) = v(t|t     1) · 1    K0 · fp .                      (27)

We force f p = 0 when estimating the model without correcting for selection. Then, m(t|t) =
m(t|t    1) and v(t|t) = v(t|t    1), and no information is used in periods where p(t) is un-
observed. In periods where p(t) is observed, m(t|t) = ptOBS and v(t|t) = 0.
   For the backward sampling part, p(T ) is first simulated from the normal distribution
with mean m(T |T ) and variance v(T |T ), as given by the Kalman filter. For t = T        1 . . . 1,
we draw p(t) from the conditional distribution p(t)|st , p(t + 1). This distribution can be
derived from a filtering problem where the draw of p(t + 1) provides an additional obser-
vation of p(t). The distribution is:


                                    p(t)|st , p(t + 1) ⇠ N (r, q) ,                          (28)


where:


                          r = m(t|t) + G · [p(t + 1)              m(t + 1|t)] ,              (29)

                         q = v(t|t) · (1           G),                                       (30)


with:
                                                     v(t|t)
                                         G=                   .                              (31)
                                                  v(t|t) + s2
From equation (31), G can be interpreted as a Kalman gain similar to K in equation (26). As
such, the backwards sampler weighs the information from the filtered distribution p(t)|st
and the information in p(t + 1)|sT to obtain a draw of p(t)|sT , with the weight depending
on the relative variance of the filtered estimate, v(t|t), and the variance of a one-period price
change. If the filtered estimate m(t|t) is very precise relative to the variance of the valuation
change from one period to the next, then G is close to zero, and most of the weight is put
on the distribution of p(t) from the Kalman filter. The more imprecise the Kalman filter
distribution relative to how much the valuation can possibly change (as captured by sigma),
the more weight is put on the “observed” p(t + 1).


                                                    31
A2 Selection variables

The selection variables are sampled conditional on the valuations, parameters, and whether
or not the valuation is observed. Simulating this block is similar to simulating the (aug-
mented) posterior distribution of a probit model (Albert and Chib, 1993). Under the as-
sumption that h and x are independent, we may draw the selection variables, w and z, sep-
arately. In addition, by the i.i.d. assumption we may draw each property-quarter variable
separately.
    When property i is sold, the price is observed and the posterior distribution of the first
selection variable, wi (t), is:


                     wi (t)| {pi (t)} , q, data ⇠ NL Wi0 (t)a0 + pi (t)a p , 1 .                    (32)


When home price is unobserved, the distribution is:


                     wi (t)| {pi (t)} , q, data ⇠ NU Wi0 (t)a0 + pi (t)a p , 1 .                    (33)


Here, NL µ, s2 denotes a normal distribution with mean µ and variance s2 that is trun-
cated below at zero. Similarly, NU µ, s2 is the upper-truncated distribution, truncated
above at zero.
    Drawing zi (t) is analogous but using foreclosures instead of regular home sales for
observations.


A3 Parameters

Conditional on {pi (t)}, {Wi (t)}, and {Zi (t)}, the distributions of a, g, {d(t)}, and s2 are
given by the three Bayesian linear regressions (18), (19), and (20). Since e, h, and x are
independent by assumption, we may estimate the three equations separately.
    In the valuation equation, d = [d(2) . . . d(T )]0 and s2 are defined by the regression of Yp
on X p , where the vector Yp stacks the one-period returns, pi (t)       pi (t     1), across all prop-
erties and time periods. Let N(t) be the number of companies for which p(t)                   p(t    1)
                    T                                          T
exists, so Yp is a Ât=2 N(t) by 1 vector. The matrix X p is a Ât=2 N(t) by T              1 matrix of


                                                 32
zeros and ones. Each row of X p contains T         2 zeros and a one in column t   1, correspond-
ing to the timing of the return in Yp (such that a one in the first column of X p indicates a
return from time 1 to time 2).
    The standard conjugate normal inverse gamma prior with prior parameters a0 ,b0 , µ0 ,
and S0 is:


                                     s2 ⇠ IG (a0 , b0 ) ,                                    (34)
                                            ⇣             ⌘
                                   d|s2 ⇠ N µ0 , s2 S0 1 .                                   (35)


The posterior distributions for the parameters in the valuation equation are then (e.g., Rossi,
Allenby, and McCulloch, 2005):


                                     s2 |Yp , X p ⇠ IG (a, b) ,                              (36)

                                   d|s2 ,Yp , X p ⇠ N µ, s2 ,                                (37)


with parameters:

                                            T
                             a = a0 + Â N(t),                                                (38)
                                            t=2
                                             0
                             b = b0 + e e + (µ         µ0 )0 S0 (µ   µ0 ) ,                  (39)

                             S = S0 + X p0 X p ,                                             (40)
                                        1
                             µ = S          S0 µ0 + X p0 Yp .                                (41)


The vector e = Yp       X p µ contains the stacked error terms.
    The above regression pools the entire panel data set and quickly leads to memory issues
and slow computation speeds. For example, in a data set with 100,000 properties observed
for 80 quarters, the X p matrix is 8 million by 79. The solution to these problems is to
exploit the unique structure of X p . In particular, X p0 X p is a diagonal T   1 by T   1 matrix
that contains the number of trades on the diagonal. With a diagonal prior S0 , the inverse
S   1   is also a diagonal matrix with the inverse of each element of S on the diagonal. The
T       1 by 1 vector X p0 Yp contains the sum of returns for each period. These quantities can


                                                  33
be efficiently computed and used in equations (38)-(41).                            2        3
                                                                                        a0
   The selection equations are considerably simpler. To obtain a draw of a = 4               5,
                                                                                    ap
we regress Yw on Xw , where Yw is a vector that stacks wi (t) over all properties and time
                             h              i
periods. Similarly, Xw stacks Wi0 (t) pi (t) over all properties and periods. Recall that
we normalize the variance of the error term to one in order to identify the scale of the
parameters, and we can consequently treat the inference problem as a standard Bayesian
regression with known variance. The prior distribution is:

                                          ⇣          ⌘
                                     a ⇠ N q0 , W 0 1 ,                                  (42)


and the posterior becomes:
                                                          1
                                  a|Yw , Xw ⇠ N q, W          ,                          (43)

with:
                                      W = W0 + Xw0 Xw ,                                  (44)

and:
                                         1
                                 q=W         W0 q0 + Xw0 Yw .                            (45)

Drawing g works analogously to drawing a.


A4 Priors and Starting Values

Our Gibbs sampler uses 1,000 iterations for the initial burn-in, followed by 500 iterations to
simulate the posterior distribution. During the burn-in, the simulations converge quickly.
We use diffuse priors for the parameters. The prior distribution of sv2 is inverse gamma
with parameters a0 = 2.1 and b0 = 1/100, implying that E[sv] = 8.5% per quarter, and sv is
between 3.6% and 28.6% (quarterly) with 99% probability.
   We set prior means for a and d to zero (q0 = 0 and µ = 0). We set W0 1 = I/100, where
I is the identity matrix, so that the a are between -20 and +20 with 95% probability. We
assume that S0 1 = I/100. Together with the prior on s2 , this implies that our prior on the
one-quarter log change in price index is between -170% and +170% with 95% probability.


                                              34
   We start the algorithm with a and d equal to zero, and s = 25%. We do not need
starting values for the missing house prices or the selection variables, since the missing
house prices are the first variable we simulate, and do not depend on w because we start
with a = 0.
   When we use two selection equations (separating regular transactions from and fore-
closure sales), we assume the same prior distribution and starting values for the coefficients
of the two selection equations.
   We implement this algorithm in C++, using the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). On a
desktop 2.66 GHz Pentium 4 quad-core processor, it takes anywhere from less than one
hour for the simpler models to about five hours for the most complex model to simulate
1,500 draws of the Markov Chain (using only a single core).

Figure 4: Price Indices with Trade-Selection Process. The figure shows estimated price indices for Alameda
County, CA. The indices are normalized to 100 in the first quarter of 2000. All indices are estimated using the
Bayesian procedure described in the paper. The baseline index is calculated without adjusting for sample selection.
The remaining indices are calculated using four different specifications of the trade process. The bottom plot
presents arithmetic indices, calculated with the 1/2 σ2 adjustment discussed in the text. The top graph presents
indices without this adjustment.

period. All sample periods begin in 1988 and the ending period varies in one-year increments. The top panel
presents standard repeat-sales indices. The bottom panel presents MCMC indices estimated with a trade-selection
process specified as Model (A). Indices are normalized to one in the first quarter of 1988.

Figure 7: Cumulative Index Revisions in Relative Time. The figures present revisions to the initial index estimate
as the sample period is extended beyond the initial period. The horizontal axis gives the number of additional
quarters of data used to estimate the index value. The vertical axis is the change in the log index when additional
quarters are included relative to the initial index estimate. The solid line gives the median revision, and the dotted
lines indicate the 5th and 95th percentiles in the distribution of revisions.

Table I: Summary Statistics. The sample contains single-family residences in Alameda County, California, over
the period 1988:Q1 – 2008:Q3. The LTV ratio for the buyer is computed at the time of sale using the buyer’s
mortgage and the sale price of the home. The seller’s LTV uses the outstanding principal of the seller’s mortgage,
computed as described in the text. Foreclosure rate is the number of foreclosures as a percentage of all properties in
the sample.

Table III: LTV Coefficient Across Samples. The repeat-sales sample is the sample that is described in
Table I and that is used in all other tables and figures. The single-sales sample includes all properties that
had at least one trade during the sample period. The no foreclosures sample is the repeat-sales sample
without properties that experienced a foreclosure during the sample period. LTV is the natural logarithm of
the LTV. Time indicates the time since the previous sale (in years). Sigma is the annualized standard
deviation of the error term in the observation (price index) equation. Posterior standard deviations are in
parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table V: Marginal Intensities: Panel A shows the change in the equivalent constant sale intensity from a
one-standard deviation increase in LTV, time since the last sale and its squared value, 30-year mortgage
rates, house square footage, and age. Panel B contains corresponding figures for the foreclosure intensity.
Results are based on the models in Table IV. Posterior standard deviations are in parentheses. ***, **, and
* indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
