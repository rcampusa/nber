This paper simulates the impact of the AIDS epidemic on future living standards in South Africa.
I emphasize two competing effects. On the one hand, the epidemic is likely to have a detrimental
impact on the human capital accumulation of orphaned children. On the other hand, widespread
community infection lowers fertility, both directly, through a reduction in the willingness to engage
in unprotected sexual activity, and indirectly, by increasing the scarcity of labour and the value of
a woman's time. I find that even with the most pessimistic assumptions concerning reductions in
educational attainment, the fertility effect dominates. The AIDS epidemic, on net, enhances the
future per capita consumption possibilities of the South African economy.

I. Introduction

      In coming years, the AIDS epidemic will visit upon the peoples of southern Africa a

plague of immeasurable horror. The growth of HIV infection amongst African adults during the

1990s far exceeded most forecasts, with infection rates amongst pregnant women in, for exam-

ple, South Africa reaching 25 percent by the year 2000 (Figure 1.1). While adults with HIV typi-

cally remain asymptomatic for 8 or 9 years, they develop AIDS soon thereafter and quickly

succumb to the torturous infections and cancers which overwhelm their degraded immune

systems. Thus, existing infection rates, in and of themselves, presage the imminent death of at

least five million young South African adults aged 15-49 in the coming decade, without consid-

eration of the millions among future cohorts who will be infected at birth or as young adults.

      In considering the economic consequences of the AIDS epidemic, one is drawn to

historical examples of similar demographic catastrophes, perhaps the most well researched of

which is the Black Death in Britain in the late 14th century. Reaching Britain in 1348, and recur-

ring in a series of waves, the Black Death is estimated to have reduced Britain’s population to

about half of its pre-plague level by 1377 (Hatcher 1977). As in the case of AIDS today,

contemporary accounts of the human suffering brought about by the plague are depressing in the

extreme. Economic data, however, paint a surprisingly different picture. With a declining

labour force, real wages rose rapidly during the plague years, and then remained high throughout

the 15th century, as Britain’s population stagnated (Steffen 1901, Phelps Brown & Hopkins

1956). While early scholars (e.g. Saltmarsh 1941, Hatcher 1977) argued that the 15th century

was a period of continued high mortality, more recent work (e.g. Poos 1991, Goldberg 1992) has

emphasized the positive role played by the high post-plague wages in increasing female labour

market participation and lowering fertility, generating a self-reinforcing cycle of high incomes

and labour scarcity that lasted for more than a century. Regardless of the precise mechanism, it

is clear that the Black Death, in a purely economic sense, was a boon to the generations which

survived and succeeded it, who, for a sustained period of time, experienced living standards

which were not seen again until the late 19th century.1

      In this paper I try to calculate the impact of the AIDS epidemic on future living standards

in South Africa. Drawing inspiration from the recent historical work on the Black Death, I do so

in the context of a Beckerian model which endogenizes participation, fertility, and education

decisions with behavioral equations estimated off of household survey data. In simulating the

future evolution of the South African economy, I emphasize two competing effects. On the one

hand, the epidemic is likely to have a detrimental impact on the accumulation of human capital

on the part of orphaned children. On the other hand, widespread community infection lowers

fertility, both directly, through a reduction in the willingness to engage in unprotected sexual

activity, and indirectly, by increasing the scarcity of labour and the value of women’s time. I

find that even with extremely pessimistic assumptions concerning reductions in educational

attainment, the fertility effect dominates. The AIDS epidemic enhances the future per capita

consumption possibilities of the South African economy, in effect endowing it with additional

resources. These resources can be used to care for the afflicted and provide higher living stan-

dards to future generations.2
      The paper proceeds as follows: Section II below details the model, a simple Beckerian

household model embeded in a Solovian constant-savings macroeconomic framework. Section

III explains the sources of data, while Section IV estimates the normal household behavioral

coefficients and the impact of community HIV infection on fertility. Section V calibrates the

macroeconomy and lays out my assumptions concerning the evolution of the epidemic and its

      2
        Most studies (e.g. Over 1992, Arndt and Lewis 2000, and Bell et al 2003) estimate that
AIDS will have a negative impact on future living standards, but do not consider the fertility
effects emphasized in this paper. Bloom and Mahal (1995) are an exception to the general pessi-
mism, finding, in a cross sectional regression, no relation between the incidence of AIDS and the
growth of GDP per capita and, incidentally, also noting the parallels between the AIDS epidemic
and the Black Death.

impact on household behavior. Section VI then simulates the economy under a variety of scenar-

ios, showing the importance of the fertility and education assumptions and the role Beckerian

behavior plays in amplifying and extending the model’s dynamics. Section VII presents

empirical evidence on recent trends in the South African economy which indicate a dramatic

reduction in fertility with minimal reductions in school enrollment, supporting the most optimis-

tic of my simulations. Section VIII concludes.




                                                 3
II. Model: Becker and Solow

      I model household behavior in the Beckerian tradition, assuming that couples, endowed

with human capital Em (male) and Ef (female) and financial resources Y, derive utility from the

quantity of children n, the "quality" of children q (as measured by their human capital), individ-

ual leisure lm and lf, and material consumption Cm. In a one-period framework, each couple max-

imizes

      (2.1) U(n , q, lm , lf , Cm )

subject to the non-linear budget constraint

      (2.2) lm Wm + lf Wf + ntf Wf + nqPq + Pc Cm ≤ Y + T*(Wm + Wf )

where the Wi are the returns to labour market participation (functions of Ei), Pc and Pq the finan-
cial costs of consumption and quality, T the individual endowment of time, and tf the time cost of

fertility, which I assume is borne principally by women. I will use household surveys to estimate

a simple utility-consistent system of demand and then use it to predict behavior.

      The strictures of data severely limit what can be estimated. It is difficult to measure varia-

tion across households in the cost of education, so I shall assume, perforce, that the cost of edu-

cation is proportional to the cost of material consumption (Pq = aqPc). In third world household

surveys, data on assets is generally unavailable and, in any case, is endogenously determined by

individual productivities. Consequently, I ignore income effects. The only remaining plausibly

exogenous variation across households then lies in each couple’s educational endowments, Em
and Ef. In principal, this allows the estimation of a maximum of two price effects in each

demand equation. In practice, however, spousal educational attainment is unavailable for many

individuals (who are either divorced, widowed or as yet unmarried) and, even when available,

moves quite closely with own education. For children, mothers are identified much more fre-




                                                 4
quently than fathers. These considerations lead me to specify each component of household

demand as a function of only one relative price:

      (2.3) Male Labour Supply = LM(Wm /Pc )

                Female Labour Supply = LF(Wf /Pc )

                Fertility = F(Wf /Pc )

                Children’s Education = Q(Wf /Pc )

As I will show further below, this simplistic system performs extraordinarily well in predicting

out of sample household behavior.

      The Hicksian composite commodity theorem states that the expenditure function and

underlying preferences can be reexpressed as functions of the aggregates of products with com-

mon costs (Deaton and Muellbauer 1980). Despite the non-linearity of the budget constraint, this

theorem can be applied to the problem above. Thus, the only requirement for consistency with

utility maximization is that the matrix of compensated substitution terms for the negative of male

labour supply (-hm = lm - T), the negative of female labour supply (-hf = ntf + lf - T), and overall
financial expenditures (C = nqPq + PcCm),

                ∂X ∂X
      (2.4)        +   X′, where X′ = (−hm , −h f , C) and P′ = (Wm , Wf , Pc ),
                ∂P′ ∂Y

be a symmetric negative semidefinite matrix.3 In the context of the demand system (2.3), this
reduces to requiring that LM′ and LF′ be nonnegative. Given this, one can integrate to derive the

money metric indirect utility function
                                         wm               wf
      (2.5) V(Y, wm , w f ) = Y + ⌠           LM(x) dx + ⌠ LF(x) dx,
                                  ⌡0                     ⌡0

                                   where wi = Wi /Pc ,




      3
          This is a straightforward application of theorem 8 in Epstein (1981).



                                                      5
and associated household utility function
                                       hm               hf
      (2.6) U(C, hm , h f ) = C − ⌠ wm (x) dx − ⌠ w f (x) dx,
                                  ⌡0            ⌡0

                                 where wm () = LM()−1 and w f () = LF()−1 .

Household utility is simply given by total consumption expenditures minus the disutility of

labour, i.e. the area under the individual labour supply curves.

      The preceeding one period model can be extended to a multiperiod lifetime setting by, in

the standard macro-theorist’s fashion, assuming time separable utility, so that (2.3) and (2.6) rep-

resent the period by period household demands and flow of utility. Aggregating (2.6) across all
individuals and dividing by the total population, one sees that average utility per capita is given

by consumption per capita minus the disutility of labour per capita. If labour supply is of the
                         ε
isoelastic form hi = γwi i , per capita utility is then given by:

                              εm             εf  
      (2.7) u = y  (1 − s) −          θLm −          θL 
                              1 + εm         1 + εf  f 

where y is output per capita, s the savings rate, and θi the share of each factor in total income.

For constant savings rates and factor shares, this justifies the popular fixation on output per cap-

ita as a measure of welfare.

      To close the model, one must specify the evolution of the macroeconomy and, in

particular, the capital stock. Here, any number of frameworks could be used to motivate the sav-

ings rate, e.g. overlapping generations with or without actuarially fair market interest rates, inter-

generational insurance, and/or accidental bequests. I heroically sweep these issues aside and,

following Solow, assume that the savings rate, by some combination of private and public sector

behavior, remains fixed. This allows me to focus on the mechanisms emphasized in this paper,




                                                    6
e.g. fertility and education, and their impact on overall future consumption possibilities. The ele-

ment left unexamined, the evolution of the savings rate, will determine the ultimate allocation of

these consumption possibilities across generations.4




      4
        Thus, one can see the presentation as part of a Ramsey problem in which the planner
maximizes the discounted flow of per capita utility by changing national savings and investment
through the usual tax and expenditure mechanisms, but with no direct control over household
decisions. For appropriate choices of the discount parameter and elasticity of intertemporal sub-
stitution, the planner will, in the absence of the epidemic, choose the same initial and steady state
savings rate, with some (hopefully minimal) dynamics in between. Taking this as the
benchmark, one then evaluate whether the epidemic, overall, increases or decreases future per
capita consumption possibilities. The planner’s choice of a savings rate during the epidemic then
determines the distribution of these consumption possibilities across generations. Since my
emphasis is on the impact of the epidemic, and not the appropriate distributional choice across
future generations, I do not pursue this further.

III. Data and Estimation Strategy

      I estimate the model using the microdata files of the South African 1995 October House-

hold Survey (OHS) and the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).5 The OHS provides a

variety of personal and behavioral information on each household member (e.g. age, sex,

education, labour force participation, income, fertility, etc), as well as recording recent deaths in

the household. Most of the data reported in this survey are consistent with other sources,6 but the

reported retrospective fertility histories are very low (i.e. appear to involve incomplete reporting)

and cannot match the historical population distribution. Thus, I use the DHS, whose primary

focus is fertility, to estimate that aspect of behavior.7
      Estimation proceeds in a simple two-step process: I first use the data of the October House-

hold Survey to estimate incomes as a function of age, sex and education, and then use the pre-

dicted relative incomes by educational attainment as the independent variable in the household

behavioral equations. Exogenous variation in individual education levels then allows me to

identify the price elasticity in each demand equation. I focus only on the behavior of individuals

25 and over, whose education is taken as completed. In the data, however, both fertility and

labour supply begin as early as age 12 (albeit, at extremely low levels). The retrospective fertil-

ity histories in the Demographic and Health Survey allow me to identify the behavior of fertility


      5
       The OHS and DHS data sets can be ordered through the websites www.statssa.gov.za and
www.measuredhs.com, respectively. The construction of variables from the raw data is
explained in the appendix at the end of this paper.
      6
        For example, predicted employee earnings (estimated off of interval income data) are just
12 percent below national accounts compensation of employees, while the reported mortality
rates provide a good match to long term (1970 to 1996) intercensal cohort survival rates.
      7
        Official South African data on births, based upon voluntary registration, are woefully
inaccurate. Births can be registered years after the fact. Thus, 238 thousand births were regis-
tered in 1991 as occurring in that year, but by the year 2000 the total number of births registered
for 1991 had risen to 680 thousand (RSA, SSA 2001b). Yet, the 1996 census found about 960
thousand five year olds (microdata files). The primary incentives for birth registration are medi-
cal insurance requirements and access to social welfare benefits, and these do not appear to be
sufficient to ensure timely or comprehensive coverage. Official mortality data face similar
problems.

at earlier ages, under the assumption that each woman, when young, knew what her final

educational attainment would be. For participation, I have only a single cross section, so I sim-

ply extend the quadratic age profile estimated off of adults 25 and over.

      I estimate both fertility and hours of work using a Poisson count model, where the

probability of observing a count value of yi is given by:
                               −λ   y
                          e i λi i
      (3.1) P(Yi = yi ) =               where ln λi = B′xi
                           yi !

As the expected count is given by λi , with a quadratic in age and the ln relative wage as regres-

sors, this produces isoelastic demand and supply functions. The Poisson, while extremely easy

to estimate, has the undesirable feature that the variance of the process is equal to its mean.

There are also additional potential error correlations posed by sample design (clustering) or the

use of panel data (in the fertility equation). However, as shown by Gourieroux et al (1984), pro-

vided that the mean of Y conditional on xi is equal to λi , maximum likelihood estimates based
upon the Poisson distribution are consistent, whatever the process generating the variance of Y

may be. Consequently, I use pseudo-maximum likelihood methods, estimating the coefficients

using the maximum likelihood Poisson model, but calculating robust standard errors allowing for

an arbitrary variance process between observations within survey primary sampling units and

across multiple observations for individuals, as well as adjusting for the two-step procedures
involved in using parameter estimates from the income equation.8 This allows me to simplify the

presentation of the results. As a sensitivity test, I have also estimated the various equations using

      8
        Let B1 and B2 be the vectors of parameters estimated in the first and second step, respec-
tively, across sample sizes n1 and n2. Further, let N, the union of the two samples, be divided
into M independent clusters G1, G2...GM and let lik denote the log likelihood of observation k in
equation i. Then, accounting for the two-step procedure and arbitrary correlation within clusters,

constant, linear and generalized variance-mean ratio negative binomial, as well as generalized

event count (Winkelmann & Zimmermann 1991), cross-section models and, where applicable,

random effects poisson and negative binomial panel data models (Hausman et al 1984).9 The

results, in almost every case, are very similar, and are reported in footnotes.

      I depart from the Poisson model in the determination of children’s educational attainment,

where I used an ordered probit. Less educated women tend to have more children, who are in

turn given relatively less human capital. In this sense, the variance of educational outcomes is

quite important, as a mean preserving spread in initial educational attainment will lower average

educational levels and welfare in the next generation. Furthermore, bad outcomes tend to be per-

petuated from one generation to another. This becomes relevant in assessing the impact of the

AIDS epidemic, where I will assume that the education of orphaned children is permanently

interrupted at the time of their parents’ death. I use an ordered probit model, dividing the pop-




The proof is a simple extension of the standard proof of the asymptotic distribution of the one or
two step MLE using a first order Taylor expansion (e.g. Davidson and MacKinnon 1993,
Murphy and Topel 1985) with the empirical Hessian estimator of the information matrix (which
in my sample usually produces substantially larger standard errors than the outer-product-of-the-
gradient estimator, which is known to understate standard errors in finite samples - Davidson and
MacKinnon 1993, p. 477).
      9
         With the conditional mean of Yi given by E[Yi|xi] = exp(B′xi), in the Poisson model the
variance-mean ratio is 1. In the constant and linear variance-mean ratio negative binomial mod-
els, it is given by 1 + a and 1 + a E[Yi|xi], respectively. In the generalized event count model it is
given by 1 + a E[Yi|xi]k, while in the generalized variance-mean negative binomial model it is
given by 1 + exp(B2′zi)E[Yi|xi] and I use the same set of regressors to determine the variance-
mean relationship (zi=xi). The Poisson and constant and linear variance-mean binomial models
are special cases of the generalized event count model, and the generalized negative binomial
model subsumes the Poisson and linear variance-mean negative binomial as a special case or
limiting distribution. The random effects panel data Poisson and negative binomial models have
linear and constant variance-mean ratios (respectively), and take into account each panel mem-
ber’s average realized value of the dependent variable. As is usually the case, the various non-
Poisson models do better in predicting the distribution of the dependent variable (e.g. the number
of zeros). However, as my emphasis will be on the mean, which is fairly insensitive to the
choice of distribution, I opt for the simple Poisson formulation, with robust standard errors.

IV. Estimates

      Table I below presents the estimation of the Beckerian elements of the model. I begin, in

columns (1) and (2), by predicting the ln of before and after-tax hourly wages as a function of

quadratics in age and education and a dummy variable for sex.11 The return to education in

South Africa is quite high, with a 234% increase in ln after-tax incomes associated with a move-

ment from 0 to 16 years of education and a 92% premium to tertiary education alone. There is

also a great deal of variation in educational attainment within the OHS household sample, with

22% of persons over age 25 having 2 years of education or less and 24% having 12 years or

more. The extraordinary dispersion in educational outcomes and average earnings by


      11
         These estimates do not adjust for selectivity bias (see Killingsworth and Heckman 1986).
I have run more complicated (joint maximum likelihood) systems, augmenting the wage equa-
tions with probit selection equations, where the probability of working is determined by the vari-
ables in the wage equation plus marital status, children per adult in the household, and the total
number of adults in the household (all interacted with sex, i.e. a separate participation equation
by sex). First, the point estimate of the correlation between the error terms in the participation
and wage equations is negative, which goes against the standard presumption in this literature
(this holds even when I allow sex-based covariance between the errors in the participation equa-
tions and the joint wage equation, or when I estimate the entire wage/participation model sepa-
rately by sex). Second, and more importantly, while the age and sex profiles are somewhat
flattened, the educational profile of incomes, which is used to identify the price effects in all the
subsequent equations, is virtually unchanged. Consequently, to keep things as simple as possi-
ble, I ignore selection issues and estimate relative labour incomes using data on workers alone,
as reported above. I should note that the data are interval coded (hence the pseudo-R2) and that I
restrict the sample to employees, i.e. exclude the self-employed.
       In estimating separate equations for before and after tax hourly incomes, my approach pro-
duces an unrealistic linear budget constraint by worker characteristic and, also, implies negative
effective tax rates for the least educated young and old age groups. I have run a more realistic
model, in which I take into account the non-linearities in the tax code, work opportunities and
supply decisions (due to fixed costs, fatigue effects, etc) by modeling participation as a probit
zero-one decision subject to a lump sum before and after tax income. I calculate after tax income
in two ways, using the tax code and then with a separate regression (mirroring the hourly esti-
mates of Table I). First, I find that the predicted labour supply response to a change in the after
tax wage is virtually the same whether I use the tax code or the after tax regression, i.e. the after
tax regressions are a close approximation to the actual tax code. Second, the coefficient esti-
mates of the probit model predict that, at current levels, a 1 percent rise in wages will increase
the supply of effective male and female labour in the South African sample by .18 and .44
percent, respectively. This is quite close to the Poisson estimates presented in Table I. Since the
Poisson constant elasticity functional form allows for easy interpretation of the coefficients and
calculation of the disutility of labour, and the linear before and after tax budget constraint avoids
the complexity of calculating the tax burden at each level of income during the simulations, I opt
for the simplified formulation presented above.

    Notes: Wage Index = BEEi + BE2Ei2, with B’s from column (2). Ei equals own education in columns (3)-(5)
and mother’s education in column (6). Age in column (6) equals mother’s age at time of child’s birth. HIV is
the historical antenatal clinic HIV seroprevalence rate for the woman’s quinqennial age group at that time of
her life. The sample in column (5) is made up of a panel of 7276 individuals. The construction of the
remaining variables and sample selection procedures are explained in the appendix at the end of this paper. All
standard errors are adjusted for clustering (on enumeration areas or, for (5), on panel individuals) and the

educational group present in South Africa identify the price effects in the demand equations of

the model.12 I use the coefficients on education in column (2) to construct an index of relative

lifetime wages, Wage Index, which is used as an independent variable in the remaining columns

of the table.13

      Columns (3) and (4) of Table I estimate the labour supply response of males and females

to a change in the value of their time. As is frequently the case in the labour literature, I find that

female labour supply is more elastic than men’s. With every 1% increase in wages, male labour

supply rises .17% and female labour supply rises .44%.14 A better sense of the implications of

the coefficient estimates is provided by Figures 4.1 and 4.2, where I graph the average hours of

work by age group in the prime working years in South Africa and the United States, and then

predict the behavior of the United States population using the coefficient estimates of the

model.15 Average male hours of work between the ages of 20 and 65 are 29.3 in South Africa

      12
         The reader might be concerned that differences in incomes and economic and social
opportunities between racial groups in South Africa bias the model’s estimates of behavioral
responses to income. In an unpublished appendix, available from the author, I show that while
race is a significant determinant of incomes and behavior in South Africa, the inclusion of racial
dummies has virtually no impact on the model’s estimate of the overall household response to
changes in wage income. To keep things as concise as possible, in this paper I focus on the sim-
ple model presented above.
      13
       The before tax equation is used later in the paper to calculate the effective labour supply,
which determines output and wages in general equilibrium.
      14
        Alternative distributional assumptions yield mostly similar results. The linear and gener-
alized variance-mean ratio negative binomial models produce male/female wage coefficients of
.17/.42 and .19/.45, respectively, while the generalized event count model provides estimates of
.22/.49. Only the estimates of the constant variance-mean ratio negative binomial model
(.44/.77) differ substantially. However, this model is a restricted version of the generalized event
count model and is strongly rejected in the data.
      15
        The SA data are the predicted OHS population values. The US data are the 2000 Con-
sumer Expenditure Survey (BLS 2002) population values. To project US behavior, I first use the
microdata of the CES to estimate after-tax wages in the US with the same functional form as
column (2) of Table I. I then predict the behavior of the CES sample using the coefficient esti-
mates of columns (3) and (4) of Table I, applying a purchasing power exchange rate of 1.74,
based upon Penn World Table 6.1 (Heston et al 2002), to convert the year 2000 US dollar wages
to 1995 South African Rand. Table I uses the education slope of the wage equation to estimate
the supply price response, ignoring the age profile of wages, which is subsumed in the quadratic
age term. To predict US behavior, allowing for the slightly different US age profile of incomes,

male population should work an average of 36.0 hours. The model produces a profile of labour

supply that is somewhat more hump-shaped than that present in the United States, reflecting pat-

terns seen in South Africa. Part time employment opportunities may be better rewarded in a

more service oriented economy, and this structural, demand consideration, might explain the

higher relative participation of younger and older age groups, who have lower intrinsic labour

supply, in the U.S. economy.16 The female labour supply equation produces a similar pattern,

predicting a substantial rise in participation, but not quite attaining the levels or shape seen in the

US economy. While not perfect, the model does not produce obviously embarrassing results

(e.g. predicting 100 hours of work at US income levels).

      Column (5) of Table I uses the retrospective fertility histories of the Demographic and

Health Survey to calculate the response of fertility to a change in the price of a woman’s time.17
I include a time trend to account for trends in wages and the price of education. The times series

aspect of the DHS data also allows me to measure the impact of community HIV infection on

fertility. As shown in the table, I find that the historical HIV infection rate for each woman’s

quinqennial age group, as recorded in the maternity clinic seroprevalence surveys cited in the



I reinterpret the age specific constant terms to exclude the age profile of wages, which is then
captured in the wage supply response term. My choice of CES income variables, samples and
weights is described in the appendix at the end of this paper.
      16
       Amongst workers aged 29 or less or 55 or more in the South African economy, 90%
worked 35 hours or more. The comparable statistic for the United States CES sample is 67%.
      17
         The reader might worry that there is a bit of a logical inconsistency in using a count
model to predict births since, as the time interval gets shorter, more than one birth event becomes
biologically impossible. However, for the time frame of Table I, i.e. one year, multiple birth
events may occur. The frequency of multiple pregnancies in one birth event (twins, etc.) in the
South African DHS by age group is almost identical to that reported in US data (except for
women over 40 where, perhaps due to fertility drugs, the US numbers are much higher than those
reported in South Africa). However, 2/3 of reported multiple birth events within a 12 month
period in the South African data do not involve multiple pregnancies, but rather represent chil-
dren born 9 to 12 months apart. In a high fertility environment, back to back pregnancies are not
that rare. I should note that the predicted Poisson probabilities of more than 2 births in a given
year are negligible.



                                                  15
introduction,18 has a strong negative effect on predicted fertility.19 Figure 4.3 graphs year 1995

and 2000 fertility rates in South Africa and the United States, respectively, and then projects US

fertility using the coefficients of the model.20 The model comes close to matching both the life-

cycle pattern and the overall level of US fertility.

      I estimate the parental demand for quality in the upbringing of their children, in column (6)

of Table I, by running an ordered probit of the educational attainment of adults aged 25 or more,

whose education is completed, on their year of birth (to capture trends in wages and prices) and

the wage index and the age at the time of birth of their mothers. Maternal income has a strong

effect on realized education. As mother’s educational attainment varies from 0 to 16 years, the

average educational attainment of a child born in 1970 (aged 25 in 1995) to a 30 year old mother




      18
          Thus, for a woman aged 26 at the time of the 1998 DHS, the HIV variable is the infec-
tion rate among 25-29 year olds in the year 1997, when the probit examines her fertility history
at age 25, the infection rate among 20-24 year olds in 1996, when the probit examines her
fertility at age 24, and so on.
      19
         The three negative binomial cross section models all give exactly the same coefficient
estimates as column (5) of the table, as each likelihood is maximized at the limiting Poisson dis-
tribution. The generalized event count cross section model yields coefficients of -.35, -.003, and
-1.59 on the Wage Index, year of birth and the HIV seroprevalence rate, which are virtually
identical to the Poisson estimates reported in the table. Similarly, the random effects poisson and
negative binomial panel models both yield coefficents of -.35, -.003, and -1.65. Absent the time
trend and seroprevalence rates, the coefficient on Wage Index is -.38.
       As the impact of HIV on fertility plays an important role in the subsequent analysis, it is
worth reporting some additional sensitivity checks. Since HIV infection rates may be proxying
for a non-linear time trend, I tried including higher order polynomials in time. With a quadratic,
the coefficient on HIV falls to -.71, but with cubic or quartic time trends it rises to -2.93 and
-2.75, respectively (in each case, remaining highly significant). Thus, a coefficient of -1.63 is
not, for various formulations of the time trend, an extreme possibility.
      20
        I fix the time trend at 1995, which is what I use in the later simulations of the South Afri-
can economy. The actual US data are from CDC (2002), while the SA and US projected values
are the predicted OHS and CES sample behaviors, as described in the footnote earlier above.

upon request, I show that my fertility and education estimates, drawn off of subsamples of the

datasets, when applied in a retrospective manner to the OHS female population aged 62 to 99 to

predict their surviving children aged 25 to 50, produce an adult population distribution which

closely matches the actual size and educational attainment of the 1995 OHS population aged 25

to 50.22 Projection to US income levels is somewhat less meaningful in this case, given interna-

tional variation in both public support of education and the human capital interpretation of a year

of education. For what it’s worth, individuals aged 25 had an average educational attainment of

9.5 years in South Africa in 1995 and 13.3 years in the United States in 2000. The model’s pre-

diction for the 2000 25 year old US cohort is 13.4 years.23
      To summarize, the enormous variation in educational attainment and mean incomes by



      21
        The same equation run on the wage index of fathers yields a coefficient of 1.06, with
average children’s attainment going from 8.1 to 14.3 years as their father’s attainment varies
from 0 to 16 years. I opt for mother’s attainment as it is available twice as often as father’s
attainment. I include a quadratic in mother’s age at the time of birth for consistency with the
other household demand equations, but its practical impact is not large. For a woman with 12
years of education, children’s education attainment ranges from a minimum of 12.1 to a maxi-
mum of 12.6 years as the mother’s age at the time of birth varies.
      22
        The same appendix shows that the non-AIDS mortality estimates (briefly described in
the appendix at the end of this paper) are consistent with intercensal mortality rates.
      23
         This prediction is based upon the 1/5 of the U.S. CES 25 year old sample for which I can
identify mother’s education. I set the cohort trend at 1970, matching the value for the 25 year
old 1995 South African cohort which I use in the simulations which follow, and adjust 2000 US
wages to the 1975 birth year using the 1975-2000 .9% per annum growth in real, composition
adjusted, wages implied by the BLS estimates of the growth of nominal labor compensation
minus the growth of effective labour input and the GDP personal consumption deflator (data
from http:/www.bls.gov/web/prod3.supp.toc.htm and Council of Economic Advisers 2003).
Without adjustment for the trend in U.S. wages, the predicted value is 13.9 years of education.
As noted further below, real wage growth in South Africa during the 1970-1995 period is close
to zero.



                                                17
educational category in South Africa allows me to meaningfully estimate the impact of predict-

able differences in lifetime income on household decisions. The model matches historical fertil-

ity and educational distributions in South Africa and, when projected substantially out of sample,

produces patterns of behavior that are not altogether inconsistent with those of the U.S.

economy.24 In the following section I calibrate the macro-economy to match historical South

African data and lay out my assumptions concerning the evolution and behavioral impact of the

AIDS epidemic.




      24
          In the interest of science, I should note that this should not be interpreted as evidence that
the simple demand system I posit, with no cross-price effects, is an accurate description of real-
ity. Since spousal education varies quite closely with own education, the responses reported in
Table I really represent the response to a proportional increase in all of the labour prices faced by
the household. I confirm this when I estimate cross-price effects, e.g. in the participation and
fertility equations, using spousal education, in the fraction of cases where it is available, and find
that the sum of the coefficients on both prices is virtually identical to the own price effects
reported in Table I. The problem is that the estimates are not naturally consistent, e.g. partner’s
education has no effect on male labour supply but has a strong effect on female labour supply.
To be consistent with utility maximization (i.e. allow calculation of indirect and direct utility
functions) the demand system including cross-price effects would have to be severely restricted,
reducing to something close to what I report in Table I.
        In the table above I have estimated the response to changes in the overall lifetime labour
prices faced by households. Since spousal education moves closely with own education, and
since I shall be exploring simulations in which the overall level of wages moves up and down for
decades at a time, the coefficients reported in Table I arguably provide a good approximation of
likely behavior and a proper metric for calculating indirect utility functions, even if their inter-
pretation as pure, contemporaneous, own price effects is something of a fiction.



                                                  18
V. Calibration

      I calibrate the macroeconomy using standard aggregate data. I initialize the capital stock

using the Federal Reserve Bank of South Africa’s estimate of the 1995 capital stock and set the

depreciation rate at .06, the reported ratio of capital consumption to capital for that year. I then

fix the Solovian savings rate at .175, the average real investment to GDP ratio in the period

1946-1995, and set the labour share at .62, the average ratio of compensation of employees25 to

value added during the same period. I assume a Cobb-Douglas production function in capital

and effective labour:

      (5.1) Y = AK αEL 1 − α, where EL = ∑ Wi Li .
                                                   i


Effective labour is given by the sum of labour supplies differentiated by sex, age and education,

with fixed relative weights given by my estimates, in column (1) of Table I, of before-tax wages

in 1995. I assume a closed economy, with the evolution of aggregate factor returns determined

by the unit elastic production function and the domestic supply of capital and labour.26 To focus
on the role played by changes in factor supplies, I assume zero future total factor productivity

growth.27

      Turning to the HIV epidemic, the South African maternity clinic seroprevalence data pres-

ented at the beginning of this paper suggest that overall infection rates had begun to plateau by



      25
           Adjusted, using census data, for the implicit labour income of the self-employed.
      26
         In the unpublished appendix, I consider the case of perfect capital mobility. This frame-
work excludes most Beckerian effects, as the wage per unit of effective labour is fixed at its ini-
tial value. Consequently, the results are similar to the "No Becker" scenario further below where
I exclude any endogenous response of household behavior to movements in the wage.
      27
         Historical estimates of total factor productivity growth are hampered by the poor quality
of South African census data (discussed below), whose coverage is inconsistent and where
changes in the questionnaire design have induced large changes in measured participation. For
what it’s worth, real remuneration per worker grows .3% per annum between 1970-1995
(http://www.reservebank.co.za), which, after adjustment for rising educational attainment, is sug-
gestive of close to zero growth in effective wages per worker and, by implication, total factor
productivity.

the year 2000. Across age groups, infection rates currently peak at ages 25-29 (figure 5.1), and

decline thereafter. I interpret the current infection rates of persons over 30 not as random risk,

but rather as reflecting the infection of women who, were they 25-29 in 2000, would form part of

the current cohort of infected women. It seems reasonable to assume that there is a segment of

the population whose interaction with other individuals inevitably, but perhaps unknowingly,

leads to infection and that, given the extraordinarily high infection rates already present in the

population, the size of this group is given by the maximal infection rate of the 25-29 age group.28

Consequently, I assume that new cohorts will experience lifecycle infection profiles similar to

the upward sloping part of the 2000 age cross section. I assume that, with medical breakthroughs

or behavioral change, post-2000 cohort infection rates decline, sinusoidally, to zero over 50

years.29 I also assume that male and female infection rates are evenly matched.30 Where avail-

      28
          In this, I follow the WHO-UNAIDS modelling recommendations (UNAIDS Reference
Group 2002). The UNAIDS Group suggests using aggregate infection rates to estimate the over-
all "at risk" group and communicability parameters, using an ad hoc procedure to initialize the
epidemic. As I need historical age-specific infection rates, I opt for simply using the existing
seroprevalence data, with the "at risk" proportion set by the maximal age specific infection rate
in 2000 and the lifecycle pattern of infection given by the upward sloping cross section.
      29
        Specifically, I begin by smoothing the historical age specific seroprevalence data, run-
ning the ln of the infection to non-infection rate (a logit means model) on polynomials in age and
year, weighting the observations to account for the heteroskedasticity induced by differing
sample sizes. I then use these estimates of cohort age specific infection rates and UNAIDS esti-
mates of HIV survival rates (discussed below) to calculate the cumulative cohort infection for
each of the age groups in the cross section in the year 2000. This produces a cross-sectional
function S(age) which happens to peak at age 25. I then assume that the lifecycle cumulative
infection pattern for future cohorts will be St(age) = S(age)*sin[(pi/2)*(2050-t)/50], where
t>2001 is the year in which the cohort begins sexual activity (assumed to start at age 12) and
St(age) = St(25) for all ages > 25. The last cohort to be infected is that born in 2037, which
becomes sexually active in 2049. For cohorts aged 12-24 in 2000, I assume that their lifecycle
pattern is given by S(age) up to S(25), while for cohorts over 25 in 2000 I assume that their
cumulative infection rate rises by 10% of the gap between their current cumulative infection rate
and S(25) each year up to age 39.
      30
        Knowledge of infection rates among men is fairly limited, as the best data on infection
rates come from antenatal clinic attendees. However, studies of African couples consistently
find that about 30% to 40% of male partners of HIV infected females and 30% to 40% of female
partners of HIV infected males are themselves HIV negative (Carpenter et al 1999, Gray et al
1998, Hira et al 1990, and Serwadda et al 1995). This suggests relatively equal infection rates
once the virus spreads to the general community. The Nelson Mandela/HSRC 2002 Household
Survey (HSRC 2002), the only large sample community survey of South Africa, found higher



                                                 20
able, prevalence data indicate fairly equal infection rates across educational groups,31 which I

shall assume as well.

      Regarding mortality, adult individuals infected with HIV typically experience a short

period of flu-like symptoms, after which they remain, superficially, asymptomatic, until their

immune system collapses and succumbs to opportunistic infections and cancers.32 I use the

WHO-UNAIDS (UNAIDS Reference Group 2002) recommendations on adult survival times

absent retroviral therapy (figure 5.2), which suggest a median survival after infection of 9

years.33 While mother-to-child transmission can be reduced through antiretroviral therapy, cesar-

ean delivery and avoidance of breastfeeding, these are all costly and currently about 1/3 of chil-

dren born of HIV positive mothers in African countries, and South Africa in particular, are

infected,34 a proportion that I assume will remain constant for the foreseeable future. Pediatric
AIDS progresses horribly rapidly, with 1/3 of HIV infected South African children dying from

the virus within one year of birth (Bobat et al 1999). I use the recommended children’s mortality

profile of the UNAIDS Group (figure 5.2), which predicts that all infected children die by age

12.

      Turning to Beckerian behavior, as HIV infected individuals remain superficially healthy



infection rates among women aged 15-24, but no statistically significant difference between
males and females aged 25 and above.

         The UNAIDS Group estimates that retroviral therapy would add about three years to
median survival times. In November 2003 the South African government announced it would be
distributing free retroviral drugs, but as of March 2004 only 1500 people had received such sup-
port, the government had only begun to ask for bids from pharmaceutical companies, and the
health minister was extolling the benefits of consuming olive oil, lemon juice and garlic
(Goering 2004).

for long periods of time, I assume that adult economic participation and children’s education pro-

ceeds normally until the final year of each adult’s life.35 To incorporate the impact of orphan-

hood, I assume that the education of the surviving children of adults who die of AIDS is

interrupted at the moment of their parents’ (assumed joint) death. Thus, children borne of

parents with HIV will get minimal education, as their parents generally die before they reach 9

years of age, while children whose parents contract HIV after their birth will terminate their edu-

cation if and when their parents die before they reach 25 years of age.36 This almost certainly

overstates the impact of the HIV epidemic. Empirical estimates of the impact of orphanhood on

children’s educational outcomes in Africa range from nil (Lloyd and Blanc 1996) to a 5 to 10%

decline in enrollment rates after the death of each parent (Case et al 2004, Evans and Miguel

2004).37 In contrast, my approach results in dual orphaned children born after the year 2005,

      35
        Morgan et al (2000) report a median survival time from the development of AIDS to
death in Uganda of 9.3 months. Thus, the epidemological pattern is one of a prolonged period of
apparent health, followed by extremely rapid deterioration and death (see also http://www.av-
ert.org/hivstages.htm, 11/3/2002).
      36
        To incorporate this effect, I use the OHS to estimate an additional ordered probit educa-
tional equation, representing attainment at ages 6-24 as a function of a quadratic term in age and
the mother’s wage index (interacted with the quadratic in age). Individuals who reach age 25
without their parents dying from AIDS are endowed with their full human capital, as determined
by column (6) in Table I earlier.
      37
         Lloyd and Blanc, using cross-section data for seven countries, conclude that family net-
works make up for the loss of a parent, as they find that orphanhood generally leads to a slight
decline in enrollment, but produces both positive and negative effects (depending on the country)
on completed attainment, with almost all results being statistically insignificant (their table 8).
Evans and Miguel, using panel data for Kenya, report a 2.6 to 3.7% decline in school participa-
tion post-parent death in samples with 85 to 92% participation rates, but the total effect rises to
about an 8% decline when leads and lags on parental death are included (their figure 1 and tables
1 & 4). Case et al, using cross sectional data for 10 African countries, report from 3.8 to 4.9%
declines with the death of a single parent and between a 12.1 to 15.2% decline with the death of
both parents in a sample with a mean enrollment rate of 66% (their table 3 and p. 21). Case et al
show an increased effect with the death of both parents, but Evans and Miguel do not find a neg-
ative interaction.
       For my part, runing a probit of current school attendance in the OHS data on a quadratic in
age, district dummies and the survival status of each parent for individuals 6 to 24, I find that the
death of both parents reduces the average annual attendance rate from .77 to .70 (no significant
negative interaction). South African data on attendance are not synonymous with achievement,
as there is frequent repetition of grades (see Strauss 1999). As an alternative measure, I run an
ordered probit of educational attainment on age, district dummies and the survival status of each



                                                 22
whose parents die early in their life, acquiring only 1/5 of the years of education of non-orphaned

children.38 Nevertheless, I take this extreme assumption as a baseline, a maximal bound on the

conceivable losses of human capital due to the epidemic.39 As an alternative, I also consider the

possibility that orphanhood has no impact, whatsoever, on the realized education of children.

Reality lies somewhere between these extremes, although the empirical literature on orphanhood

and recent trends in South African enrollment (see Section VII) suggest that the path of the epi-

demic may end up being closer to the no impact scenario.

      With regards to fertility, HIV is well-known to be a sexually transmitted disease and,

consequently, community wide infection should lower the demand for unprotected sexual activ-

ity and, by extension, children. This is confirmed in Table I’s estimates, earlier, of the impact of




parent for individuals 15-19 and 20-24 in the OHS, finding that the death of both parents reduces
educational attainment an average of .6 years (from 8.6 with dual survival) for the 15-19 age
group and .9 years (from 9.9 with dual survival) for the 20-24 age group. Both procedures sug-
gest that about 10% of cumulated years of education are lost with the death of both parents.
      38
         Children born prior to 2005 do somewhat better, with, for example, the 1995 orphaned
birth cohort getting half of the years of education of non-orphaned children. Early on, as the
epidemic is still spreading, the average parent becomes infected at an older age so their children
have the opportunity to acquire more human capital.
       As noted in an earlier footnote, there is considerable discordance in the HIV status of cou-
ples, so that educational losses are likely to be more spread out than my assumption of dual
orphaning allows. This is difficult to model, however, as spouses sero-convert over time
(Carpenter et al 1999, Hira et al 1990, and Servwadda et al 1995 find between 5% and 25% sero
conversion among healthy spouses within a year), so that the final degree of dual vs. single
orphaning is difficult to predict. I opt for assuming that all AIDS induced adult deaths produce
immediate dual orphans.
      39
        One might argue that, aside from the issue of orphanhood, the epidemic will reduce the
demand for human capital as the expected return from educational investments is reduced by the
shortened expected lifetimes of the current youth. This view, however, is rejected by Section
VII’s data on continued school enrollment. In that sense, the data are supportive of this paper’s
rather narrow view of education, at least at the levels seen in Africa, as being primarily a parental
consumption good, without substantial regard for economic return.



                                                 23
age specific community infection rates on fertility.40 I use these estimates to modify fertility,

with diminishing force as the epidemic wanes and community infection rates decline. The

decline of fertility associated with the HIV epidemic plays an important role in the simulations,

raising the capital-labour ratio faced by future cohorts and offsetting the reductions in human

capital brought about by premature parental death. Although recent South African demographic

data support my estimates of the impact of HIV on fertility (see Section VII), I will also consider

simulations in which HIV has no impact on fertility, highlighting the important role played by

this variable.

      Finally, I should note that in all scenarios I shall assume a constant savings rate. The

assumption of a constant savings rate allows me to focus on other factors I believe are critical,

such as the change in fertility and the possible loss of educational capital. Further, while the

South African investment to GDP ratio has fluctuated, it shows no trend, either in the historical

past or during the first decade and a half of the epidemic (see Section VII below). Finally, future

movements in the savings rate are best thought of as allocations across generations in the con-

sumption possibilities engendered by the epidemic. I take as my baseline simulation of the posi-

tive evolution of the economy with HIV the assumption, consistent with current empirical trends

and convenient for exposition, that, whatever the private determinants of savings, government

policies will adjust so as to distribute these consumption possibilities intergenerationally on the



      40
         These estimates, perforce, did not distinguish between behavioral or physiological
responses. A growing body of field research (e.g. Gray el al 1998, Carpenter et al 1997 and
Hunter et al 2003) indicates that HIV may reduce the fertility of women who are otherwise
mostly asymptomatic and unaware of their infectious status by about 50% (explanations focus on
amenorrhea and early term miscarriages). This physiological response, however, is not large
enough to explain the estimates of Table I, which suggest that, at a 100% population infection
rate, fertility would be about 20% of normal. One can interpret this difference as representing an
external effect, i.e. the impact of community infection on individual behavior. I have explored
various simulations in which I parse Table I’s estimates into physiological and behavioral
effects, and found that the aggregate results are quite similar to the simple specification of a
common behavioral response. To keep the analysis simple, I focus on that interpretation in this
paper. An unpublished appendix, available from the author, reviews the literature on the physio-
logical impact of HIV on fertility and presents the alternative simulations.



                                                 24
basis of a constant savings rate. However, putting aside that particular savings path, I will ulti-

mately show that the epidemic allows all future surviving generations to enjoy higher living stan-

dards, while still leaving ample resources to support the infirm. This is the central point of the

paper.




                                                 25
VI. Simulation

      In the pages that follow I simulate the evolution of the South African economy under a

variety of circumstances. I consider five scenarios: (1) "No HIV" - the path taken absent the

epidemic; (2) "HIV" - the economy with the HIV epidemic; (3) "No Becker" - the economy with

the epidemic, but with no endogenous response to changes in wages, i.e. all education, fertility,

and participation decisions by educational class kept at their values along the No HIV path;41 (4)

"No Fertility" - the No-Becker scenario, but with the added dimension that HIV does not have

the negative effect on fertility estimated earlier in section IV; and (5) "Full Education" - the HIV

path, but without the assumption that children’s education is interrupted at the time of their par-

ents’ death. The components and assumptions that enter into the simulations are summarized in

Table II. Before delving into economic calculations, it is worth recalling the human cost of the

epidemic which, as shown in Figure 6.1, could cumulatively claim 18 millions lives (in the base-

line HIV scenario). What follows is a statement about economic conditions and the welfare of

survivors, not about the desirability of the wholesale slaughter of innocents.

      I begin by describing the development of the closed economy. Figure 6.2 below depicts

the evolution of the wage per unit of effective labour. Absent the HIV epidemic, the wage ini-

tially declines, as better educated young cohorts put pressure on the ratio of capital to effective

workers, but eventually begins to climb, as higher levels of education lead to lower fertility and

population growth. This pattern is reversed by the epidemic, as high mortality in the first

decades of the 21st century drives up the wage, which then comes back down as the epidemic

wanes and the labour force is built back up. In the baseline HIV scenario, the wage rises to 11

percent above the No HIV path by 2040. Although most of the mortality associated with the

epidemic is resolved by 2040 (figure 6.1), it takes some 60 years for the wage to return to the No

HIV transition path, as the reduced fertility brought about by the changed population structure

      41
        This simulation still contains Beckerian effects in that changes in the distribution of edu-
cational attainment lead to changes in average behavior and the behavior by educational class
responds to the value of the real wage along the No HIV path.

  HIV scenarios).




and higher wages sustains a higher capital labour ratio. In the No Becker scenario, the failure of

fertility to respond to temporarily higher wages results in a more rapid decline in the wage,

which ultimately falls below the levels achieved along the No HIV path. When, in addition, the

HIV epidemic has no impact on fertility, the wage falls well below the No HIV transition path.

Finally, in the Full Education scenario, the high wages brought about by the epidemic are com-

pletely self sustaining. High wages lead to lower fertility and better educated children, which in

turn sustain higher wages.




                                                      27
      The impact of the epidemic on the accumulation of human capital is summarized in Figure

6.3, which depicts average educational attainment by cohort birth year. In the HIV, No Becker

and No Fertility scenarios, I assume that the orphaning of children leads to an immediate and

permanent interruption of their education. As shown in the figure, this lowers the educational

attainment of the 1995 cohort by about one and a half years and substantially reduces the human

capital of cohorts for the next 100 years.42 Uneducated individuals have higher fertility and less

educated children, so the losses from orphaning early in the epidemic persist for generations.

The positive effect of higher wages on the demand for quality in children and the lower fertility

of HIV infected cohorts work against this effect. Consequently, the reductions in educational

attainment are smaller in the HIV scenario than they are in the No Becker or No Fertility scenar-

ios. The loss of human capital explains why the wage along the No Becker and No Fertility

paths, shown earlier in Figure 6.2, falls below the original, No HIV, transition. Lower

educational attainment, for a given real wage per effective worker, leads to higher average com-

munity fertility, which drives the real wage down, perpetuating low levels of education and fur-

ther high fertility. In contrast to the above, in the Full Education scenario I assume that the death

of parents does not interrupt their children’s education. In this case, the rise in the wage (figure

6.2), leads to higher demand for children’s education, which in turn supports continued lower

fertility, sustaining both wages and the level of educational attainment.

        About 1/4 of all HIV free (i.e. surviving) children born in 1995 are orphaned before com-
pleting their education, with the ratio falling to 10% and 5% for the cohorts born in 2020 and
2045, respectively. The education acquired by orphaned children depends upon how long their
parents survive. Children born in 1995 who are eventually orphaned get about 1/2 of the years of
education of non-orphaned children, as the epidemic in 1995 was still spreading and much of the
adult population was as yet uninfected. Orphaned children born after the year 2005, when the
epidemic is established and on-going, get only about 1/5 of the education of non-orphaned chil-
dren.

the levels sustained along the No HIV transition to the steady state.43 In the baseline HIV simu-

lation, the initial rise in the wage per effective worker more than offsets the losses in cohort edu-

cational attainment, so that output per capita remains, for some 50 years, above the No HIV path.

Eventually, however, the reduced educational attainment becomes dominant and output per

capita falls slightly below the No HIV path. In the No Becker scenario, neither participation,

fertility nor children’s education respond to the high temporary wages, so output per capita rises

by less during the wage boom and then falls considerably below the No HIV path, as the econ-

omy is burdened by large uneducated cohorts. Conditions are worse in the No Fertility case,

where, despite the wage boom, rising dependency ratios, brought about by adult mortality

combined with continued fertility, drag the economy down from the very beginning. In this case,

high fertility in an uneducated population ultimately leads to an output per capita about 3/4 of

what would have been experienced absent the epidemic. At the other extreme, in the Full Educa-

tion scenario, with no adverse effects on children’s education, high wages and low fertility lead

to higher output per capita everywhere along the path. Although this scenario seems decidedly

Panglossian, it is not far removed from recent developments in the South African economy

where, as discussed in the next section, the epidemic, at least in its early stages, appears to have

been associated with falling fertility and sustained human and physical capital accumulation.

      Figure 6.4 provides some insight into the influence of the HIV epidemic on future living

standards under a fixed savings rate. Rather than consider different intergenerational allocations

driven by different savings scenarios, one might broadly summarize the impact of the epidemic


      43
        Absent the epidemic, GDP per capita rises .8% per annum for the first century, in the
gradual transition to a steady state 3.5 times greater than its value in 1995. As the real wage per
effective worker rises only 10% in the transition to the steady state, almost all of this growth is
driven by the accumulation of labour, and not capital. The transition is driven by increases in
educational attainment, as better educated cohorts raise better and better educated offspring.
Higher levels of education increase effective labour per capita directly, through productivity, and
indirectly, by raising age specific participation rates and lowering fertility, which in turn shifts
the population structure in favour of age groups with higher participation. The steady state
involves an average adult educational attainment of 13.0 years, well above the cross sectional
average of 8.5 in 1995.



                                                 29
on future consumption possibilities by answering the following question: Allowing the savings

rate to vary as necessary, what percentage increase, relative to the No HIV path, in future living

standards (taken as per capita consumption minus the disutility of labour supply)44 is possible

under the different scenarios?45 The answer to this question is given in the first column of Table

III. Starting with the Full Education scenario, one sees that a 6.6 percent increase in living stan-

dards in perpetuity is possible. The early booms of the baseline HIV and No Becker scenarios

are followed in later years by a relative decline in GDP per capita (figure 6.4), as the reduction in

human capital takes its toll. Nevertheless, with an appropriate increase in savings early on these

two scenarios allow for 5.6 and 4.3 percent increases in perpetuity, respectively, relative to the

No HIV world. Finally, in the case of the No Fert scenario, output per capita begins to decline

immediately and there is no boom that can be invested. In this case, an immediate and perma-

nent 3 percent reduction in living standards allows the economy to distribute the severe troth of

later years evenly across all generations.

      While the preceeding calculations focus on the welfare of the living, one might also con-

sider the support of the dying. In the second column of Table III I calculate the maximum

annual expenditure on retroviral therapy for AIDS patients possible consistent with providing all

living individuals, everywhere along the path, with the alternative future No HIV living stan-

dards. In this calculation, I follow UNAIDS (2002) and assume that retroviral drugs will extend

the life of terminal AIDS patients by three years, i.e. each patient receives three years of




      44
         As noted in section II, this is equal to the flow of per capita utility absent the HIV epi-
demic. One should hesitate to use this term for the epidemic, as it does not take into account
disutility from mortality risk and the modification of behavior (e.g. reduction in fertility) brought
about by the presence of this risk. While one could use assumptions and modelling structure to
calculate "compensations" for these factors, I think it more reasonable to simply talk about living
standards. For generations that live after the epidemic, this is equivalent to utility, given the
demand functions estimated in this paper.
      45
        This calculation is done subject to the transversality condition that in the new steady state
the capital labour ratio permanently sustains the new level of consumption.

treatment. I assume that these persons do not contribute in any way to economic activity, but

count in the total population numbers so that, in addition to retroviral drugs, they receive the

average per capita flow of consumption. The number of persons receiving retroviral therapy

peaks at around 3.4% of the population in 2008 and remains above 1% until 2040. As shown in

the table, per patient retroviral expenditures close to 10 thousand US dollars per year are sustain-

able, while giving both survivors and the invalided the living standards they would have enjoyed

absent the epidemic.46 To put these numbers in perspective, generic triple dose retroviral therapy

drugs are available for US$292 or less per year.47 Brazil’s large scale retroviral programme, with

auxiliary CD4, viral load and drug resistence testing, is currently delivered at a cost of less than

survival times in Brazil rose from 18 months for AIDS patients diagnosed in 1995 to 58 months
for AIDS patients diagnosed in 1996, when the free retroviral programme was instituted (Marins
et al 2003). The effectiveness of retroviral therapy improves with expenditure on auxiliary test-
ing, treatment and supervision. Consequently, the UNAIDS assumption of three year survival
might be unduly pessimistic for a sufficiently well funded programme, implying that the
maximal expenditures calculated above are overestimates of sustainable expenditures per surviv-
ing patient. This, however, only reinforces the point made in the table, i.e. that sufficient
resources exist to improve the circumstances of infected individuals without harming future
generations.
      49
         An unpublished appendix, available from the author, reviews the sensitivity of the results
to some of the underlying assumptions. Allowing for perfect capital mobility (removing the
closed economy assumption), fixes the wage and eliminates most of the Beckerian effects, pro-
ducing per capita income results similar to the No Becker scenario. Capital mobility, however,
eases intertemporal substitution, allowing the economy to sustain somewhat higher permanent
increases in living standards (or smaller declines in the No Fert scenario). Reconsidering Table
I’s estimates of the reduction in fertility brought about by HIV as being a combination of behav-
ioral and physiological (in infected women) influences produces fairly similar results to those
shown above. Although this view is completely rejected by the HSRC 2002 community survey,
I also consider the possibility that underlying community infection rates are almost double those
indicated by the maternity clinic seroprevalence data. In this case, the results are worse, produc-
ing more orphans and considerably greater numbers of prospective patients, but the economy can
still sustain retroviral expenditures of US$3100 per AIDS victim per year.

VII. Empirical Developments

      Recent empirical trends in the South African economy support the analytic assumptions of

the simulations laid out above and their positive view of the welfare of future, post-epidemic,

generations. Although gross national saving and fixed capital formation were definitely lower in

the 1990s than earlier decades (figure 7.1),50 this cannot be attributed to the epidemic, as the

decline occurred in the late 1980s, long before HIV took root in South Africa. During the 1990s

and into the early part of the new century, as the epidemic spread and entered the public con-

sciousness, aggregate savings and capital formation have remained remarkably steady.51 During

the same period, despite rising parental mortality,52 school enrollment rates for the youngest age

groups have not fallen, while those of older teenagers have declined by only 5% (Table IV),


      50
        The data in the figure are based upon national accounts aggregates, available from
http://www.reservebank.co.za, with public sector saving defined as general government saving
plus fixed capital consumption and "private sector" saving defined as household and corporate
saving (including public corporations), plus the fixed capital consumption of private business
enterprises and public corporations. Together, these equal gross national saving or, equivalently,
gross capital formation plus the current account. The savings data are in current prices and gross
fixed capital formation is in constant 1995 prices.
      51
         As the reader can see, public sector savings during this period rose (from negative to pos-
itive), while "private sector" savings (including public corporations) fell. From the point of view
of understanding savings behavior, it is interesting to argue whether private savings fell in
response to the epidemic or in response to the increase in public savings, or whether public sav-
ings rose in response to the decline in private savings. However, from the point of view of the
implications for future generations, it does not matter what combination of public or private
savings behavior produces a constant national savings rate. It is sufficient that it is simply con-
stant. Hence, the Solovian assumption made in this paper.
      52
        Official South African mortality data are seriously undermined by underreporting and
unusual administrative procedures. The reporting of deaths is voluntary, motivated by the need
for an official burial permit (necessary only in urban areas) or insurance and welfare benefit
claims, and is believed to be largely incomplete (RSA SSA 1997 and 2000). Deaths are recorded
years after the fact and, historically, published data only indicated the number of deaths reported
within a given year, and not the year of occurrence. Further, the Department of Home Affairs
allowed forms coming in after December to be added to the December process month for arbi-
trary periods of time (e.g., the microdata files for recorded deaths 1996 reveal that 97 thousand
of the 327 thousand recorded deaths for 1996 were processed in "December"), confounding any
analysis of the annual series. For the 1997-2000 period, recorded deaths have recently been
reported in a cumulative fashion, based upon year of occurrence (RSA SSA 2001a). As cumu-
lated up to 2001, these data indicate a 50% to 100% increase in the number of male and female
deaths in the 25-34 age group from 1997 to 2000 alone.

indicating that educational losses from orphaning are minimal.53 Up to this point, the epidemic

has had little detrimental effect on physical or human capital accumulation.

      The impact of HIV on fertility, a key element in the analysis above, is confirmed in census

data. Figure 7.2 graphs the youth population distribution recorded in the past three censuses. In

1991 South Africa had the downward sloping profile typical of an economy with rapid popula-

tion growth. During the 1990s this profile flattened until, by the time of the 2001 census, the

number of teenagers exceeded the number of preteens. These trends are confirmed by data on

aggregate school enrollment (figure 7.3) which show a movement from rapid growth to stagna-



      53
        Or, alternatively, the reduction in the expected remaining lifespan of, for example, a liv-
ing 16 year old male from 51.4 years prior to the epidemic to 39.4 years in 2000 has had little
effect on the demand for investment in human capital.

tion and decline.54 These data, particularly the ongoing decline in the number of young primary

school students, are consistent with a recent, and severe, reduction in fertility.55 In Figure 7.4 I

graph the 1991 and 2001 population distributions produced by the forward and backward projec-

tion of the 1995 OHS in the base HIV simulation earlier above. These simulations, based upon

my estimates of the impact of HIV on fertility drawn from a third, independent, source (the

DHS), provide a close match to the change in relative cohort sizes present in census data. The

inescapable conclusion is that the HIV epidemic has produced an abrupt reduction in fertility,

endowing future generations with greater material resources per capita.

      Having made a case in favour of the paper, I will now do my best to undermine it, focusing

in particular on the fertility trends implied by recent census data. Censuses, especially in third

world countries, are bedeviled by the problem of the "undercount." The approach of the Central

Statistical Service (now known as Statistics South Africa) in the 1991 census was to completely

ignore the census totals56 and, instead, project the population distribution from the 1970 census
(considered to be accurate) using mortality and fertility estimates, with adjustment and validation


      54
        Changes in the political boundaries of South Africa, along with the untimely death of the
only programmer with access to the education database, have left the South African Department
of Education without a time series on enrollment (personal communication with DOE officials).
The South African Department of Education graciously provided me with scanned copies of
numerous historical documents and reports which I used, along with the historical issues of
South African Statistics and Statistics in Brief, to produce the series reported in the table. While
there were some minor disagreements among sources, the differences are on the order of 1% or
less. The data refer to ordinary (excluding special education) private and public school students,
within the current political boundaries of the Republic of South Africa. The 1985 & 1986 data
do not include White students enrolled in private schools, while the 1997 data do not include pri-
vate school enrollment (equal to about 250,000 in recent years) for any racial group.
      55
         If the reader will compare Figures 7.2 and 7.3, she will see that the growth in the size of
census cohorts aged 5-9 and 15-19 between 1991 and 2001 is broadly consistent with the stagna-
tion in primary school enrollment and growth of secondary school enrollment between these two
dates, assuming roughly constant enrollment rates.
      56
         Apparently, 88 areas were "enumerated" using aerial photography supplemented by spot
surveys used to convert houses to individuals, "sweeps" were conducted of entire magisterial dis-
tricts without enumeration areas, and the census form, to be filled out during the census period
by the households themselves, was printed only in English and Afrikaans (RSA CSS 1992, RSA
SSA 2004d and 2004e).



                                                  35
against school enrollment data and private sector sample surveys (RSA CSS 1992). The 1996

census adopted a different approach, using a post-enumeration survey to adjust the population

totals under the assumption of independence between the original census and post-enumeration

samples. Unfortunately, enumeration areas were not properly delineated prior to the Census,57

which also only asked for individual first names or initials, with the result that 22% of the post-

enumeration sample could neither be classified as a "match" nor a "miss" (RSA SSA 1998). The

2001 census again used a post-enumeration sample, but this time enhanced using bar codes

affixed to houses during the original census, more detailed respondent information, and reconcil-

iation visits to ensure matching, all of which reduced unclassified cases to less than 2% (RSA

SSA 2004a). While the 1996 census estimated an undercount of 10.7%, the more carefully

executed 2001 census raised the undercount estimate to 17.6%.58 The assumption, used in both
censuses, of census and post-enumeration independence is probably flawed, as censuses and sur-

veys in third world countries appear to systematically undercount young persons,59 a systematic

error which will not be solved by repeated sampling.60 Clearly, differences in methodology, and

      57
        Bad weather prevented aerial mapping before the census, leading to a reliance on geo-
graphic descriptions and household lists given by local authorities.
      58
        The 2001 adjustment used an additional reenumeration sample to eliminate overcounts in
the original census (e.g. falsifications and duplications), which was not done for the 1996 census.
Calculated on the same basis as the 1996 census, the undercount was 20.0% in 2001 (RSA
2004a).
      59
        In my experience this is a consistent problem across a number of countries and samples
(to confirm this, one simply has to compare the age distribution of each survey/census with later
enumerations, noting the growth in the absolute size of younger cohorts).
      60
         As an extreme example, consider the case where enumerators never record persons under
age 5. In this case, two random samples of households will still reveal no one under age 5 and
the post-enumeration adjusted census population will show no individuals in this age group. The
problem here is the assumption of independence, not in the selection of households, but in the
coverage of individuals within households. This problem is recognized by Statistics South
Africa, which has concluded that both the 1996 and 2001 censuses, after adjustment for the
undercount, underestimate the number of 0-4 year olds (RSA SSA 2004b and 2004d). If the
reader looks carefully at the data in Figure 7.2, she will see that the absolute size of youth
cohorts grows from 1996 to 2001 (simply shift the 1996 curve one position to the right). This is
consistent with a systematic failure to enumerate youth, but, of course, could also be produced by
the different adjustments for the undercount.



                                                 36
serious concerns about accuracy, make intercensal comparisons of demographic trends highly

questionable.

      These problems do not negate all of the preceeding discussion. The systematic failure of

censuses to enumerate youth does not explain why the relative size of the youngest cohorts is

considerably smaller in the 2001 South African census than in the 1996 census, as the two cen-

suses used similar methodologies. Additional data (e.g. on school enrollment and savings) sup-

port the assumptions and arguments made in the simulations. Nevertheless, it is the case that

aggregate African data, even in one of the most data rich African countries, are highly

problematic. For this reason, I have focused on estimates and simulations based upon data from

three careful surveys, the OHS, the DHS and the seroprevalence studies of pregnant women.

Aggregate data, such as they are, are strongly supportive of the most optimistic of these simu-

lations, indicating a rapid decline in fertility and sustained investment in human and physical

capital.

VIII. Conclusion

      Figure 8.1 below graphs my projections of the South African population with and without

the HIV epidemic. In the absence of the epidemic, the population would have grown rapidly,

reaching 110 million persons by 2050. With the epidemic, the combination of adult mortality,

HIV infant mortality, the powerful effects of community HIV infection on fertility, and the

endogenous response of fertility to higher wages contrive to keep the population below 50 mil-

lion for almost 50 years. As shown in this paper, the positive effects of lower population growth

are strong enough to counteract the most pessimistic forecasts of the human capital losses of

AIDS orphaned children, implicitly endowing the economy with extra resources which can be

used to extend the lifespan of the afflicted and still leave reserves to raise the per capita welfare

of future generations.

      An emphasis on per capita outcomes is a particularly calloused notion of "welfare", one

that does not care about the number of individuals, dead or unborn. It is by no means the way I

would evaluate the agonized deaths of millions of young adults and children invaded by infec-

tions and cancers. There is, however, a long standing emphasis on GDP per capita in the econo-

mics profession as a measure of economic well-being. In the classroom, this has led to the

Solovian based lessons on the merits of lower population growth taught to generations of

graduate students, while, in the real world, it has supported the encouragement of fertility control

through subsidies and, in some cases, draconian coercive measures. One cannot endlessly

lament the scourge of high population growth in the developing world and then conclude that a

reversal of such processes is an equal economic disaster. The AIDS epidemic is a humanitarian

disaster of millenial proportions, one that cries for assistance. It is not, however, an economic

disaster.

X. Appendix: Construction of Variables from the Microdata Sets

      The variables used in Section IV and Table I are constructed as follows:

       Wages per Hour - Individuals in the OHS report whether they work for someone else or for
themselves. Those working for someone else report their income from their main job, precisely
or in terms of a range (e.g. R2000-R2499), and whether this income is daily, weekly, monthly or
annual. I multiply the daily, weekly and monthly incomes (or income brackets) by 240, 48 and
12, respectively, to arrive at annual incomes. Individuals also report their weekly income in kind
received in the form of transport, food and other. I multiply these by 48 and add them to wage
income, treating entries with no reports as values of zero. I take annual taxes as the reported
amount deducted per day, week, month or year (imputing a value of zero for blank entries), mul-
tiplied by the factors listed above.61 Dividing by the response to the question on hours of work in
the last 7 days the individual worked, yields my estimate of annual before and after tax wage
income per weekly hour of work. I exclude from the sample a few hundred individuals who
report that they work both for themselves and for others. The behavioral equations (3)-(6) of
Table I exclude individuals under the age of 25, as their education, determining their lifetime
behavior, is as yet incomplete. However, I include all individuals, including those under 25, in
the wage regressions of columns (1)-(2), under the assumption that their incomes appropriately
reflect the return to their current educational capital. Excluding individuals under 25 or, as noted
in the paper, multistep procedures to adjust for selectivity bias, both have little effect on the esti-
mated educational profile of wages.

      Hours of work - The dependent variable in columns (3) and (4) of Table I is the number of
hours of work during the last 7 days that the individual worked (values of zero are entered for
individuals who were not working). The sample covers all individuals over the age of 25 for
which I have data on educational attainment.

       Education - Individuals surveyed in the OHS and DHS report their highest standard passed
or education level obtained, with some grouping of levels and some differences in choices
between the surveys. I convert these into standardized years of education for the regressions of
columns (1) and (2) of Table I as follows: (i) No schooling or less than one year completed = 0
years; (ii) Sub A/sub B/grade 1/grade 2/Std 1 = 2 years; (iii) Standards 2 - 10 = standard year +
2; (iv) Diploma/certificate with Std 9 or lower or further studies incomplete = 13 years; (v)
Diploma/certificate with Std 10 or diploma/other postschool complete = 14 years; (vi) Degree or
further degree complete = 16 years. These 14 educational categories are then used to identify the
impact of wage income in columns (3)-(6) of Table I and constitute the educational state space of
column (6)’s ordered probit and the simulations in the paper.

      Fertility - I use women’s reports of their past pregnancies in the DHS to reconstruct the
number of births in each year of their lives. I count pregnancies that were lost before term or
resulted in stillbirths as births, under the assumption that the infant mortality estimates I derive
from the OHS include such deaths. As shown in the unpublished appendix, the resulting esti-
mates of fertility and mortality reproduce the OHS adult population distribution. If the definition
of a pregnancy is restricted to a live birth, and the OHS infant mortality rates are then applied,
predicted historical cohort sizes are too small. Although I exclude from the sample women
younger than 25 at the time of the survey, fertility at earlier ages is captured by the retrospective


      61
        As noted in Section IV above, I get fairly similar model results when I use the tax code
to calculate after tax incomes.



                                                  43
histories of older women. I restrict the sample to completed years of life, i.e. do not include the
fertility history since each woman’s last birthday which, for obvious calendar reasons, shows
systematically lower fertility rates.

       Mother’s Education - Individuals in the OHS report their relationship to the head of the
household and the respondent numbers of their parents, if these are members of the household. I
use this information to construct two sets of identified mothers: (1) Based upon relationship,
where mothers are either the head of the household where the respondent (the child) reports
being the son or daughter of the household head, or mothers are respondents who report that they
are the parent of the head of the household (the child). I eliminate cases where the age difference
between the presumed mother and child is less than 12 or more than 60 years or where multiple
women claim to be the mother of the household head. (2) Based upon the reported respondent
number of mothers, eliminating cases where the reported "mother" is male, where the age differ-
ence between mother and child is less than 12 or more than 60 years, or where the mother and
child’s individually reported relationships to the household head are incompatible (e.g. when the
mother claims to be the daughter of the household head, but the child does not claim to be the
grandchild of the household head). I then merge the two sets of information, giving precedence
to mothers identified on the basis of reported relationship in the 81 cases where the datasets dis-
agree.

       Non-AIDS Mortality - Although not shown in Table I, I use the OHS sample reports of
deaths in the household in 1994-1995 to estimate mortality in the absence of AIDS. I add indi-
viduals who reportedly died in the period November 1994-October 1995 to the sample of surviv-
ing individuals and run probits for the probability of death in a given year on sex and a quadratic
in age. I divide the sample into two groups, aged 0-11 and 12-99, so as to allow simple
quadratics in age to capture the rapid decline of youth mortality and rise of adult mortality with
age. As the sex dummy is not a significant determinant of youth mortality, I exclude sex from
the final estimating equation for that group. As shown in the unpublished appendix, my esti-
mates of pre-AIDS mortality match the historical evolution of the South African population. In
the simulations, I assume that mortality due to AIDS and non-AIDS causes are independently
distributed.

       CES data - To predict the behavior of the US population using the SA coefficient esti-
mates, I make use of the interview survey data files of the 2000 consumer expenditure survey,
which includes five quarterly interviews running from first quarter of 2000 through the first
quarter of 2001. I measure after tax incomes as the family member’s gross pay minus federal
and state taxes deducted (grospayx-amtfed-sltaxx), multiplying by 48, 24, 12, 4 and 24 to convert
weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly and bimonthly reports to annual values ("other", i.e.
unknown, payperiods are dropped from the sample). Hours of work are measured as the family
member’s usual weekly hours of work (inc_hrsq). I then use an interval regression (to account
for topcoding) to estimate a wage regression as in column (2) of Table I, restricting the sample to
employees (incomey<4). Education is naturally coded in years, except for post secondary, where
I count some college or associate degrees as 14 years, bachelor’s as 16 years and master’s and
above as 18 years. After estimating the wage equation, I use it to predict the behavior of the
2000 US population using the 5 quarters of the CES population sample with weights adjusted for
months in the scope of the 2000 year (finlwt21*mo_scope/12). I identify mothers in cases where
members identify themselves as the child of the household reference person by using the refer-
ence person (if female) or the spouse of the reference person (if the reference person is male). I
also identify mothers using female individuals who report themselves as the mother of the
reference person (the child). In all cases, I drop observations where the age difference between
mother and child is less than 12 or more than 49 years.
