          ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF RELATIVE PRICES ON TRADE SHARES



                                ABSTRACT




          Estimated   effects of relative prices on trade shares are presented

in this paper for 64 countries. The equations are estimated using pooled

time series, cross section data under the assumption that the error term

is serially correlated across time and heteroskedastic across countries.

The results strongly indicate that relative prices have an important effect

on trade shares.

          The sensitivity of the properties of the inulticountry model in

Fair (198la) to the endogenous treatment of trade shares is also examined.

The addition of the trade share equations to the model has noticeable effects

on the properties of the model regarding the effects of a depreciation. The

sensitivity of trade shares to relative prices is an important channel in

this version of the model through which a country's price of exports affects

the demand for its exports.

I.   Introduction

       This paper grew out of my work on a multicountry econometric model

(Fair (l981a, 1981b)). The trade matrix in this model is 64 X 64, and

the trade shares have heretofore been taken to be exogenous. Estimated

effects of relative prices on these trade shares are presented in this

paper, and the sensitivity of the properties of the model to the endogenous

treatment of trade shares is examined. The estimates are based on quarterly

data from 19711 through 19791V (36 quarters) for 64 countries.



II. The Data and the Trade—Share Equation

       The relevant variables are presented in Table 1. The raw data were

taken from two tapes of the International Monetary Fund: the International

Financial Statistics (IFS) tape and the Direction of Trade (DOT) tape.

The way in which each variable was constructed is explained in brackets

in Table 1. Some variables were taken directly from the tapes, and some

were constructed from other variables. When "IFS" precedes a number in

the table, this refers to the variable on the IFS tape with the particular

number. The date of the tapes was October 1980.

       The variable to be explained is                       the share of country i's

total merchandise imports from Type A countries imported from country j

 (in units of 75$). Type A countries are countries for which data on ex-

change rates and export prices exist. These data, as can be seen in Table

1, are needed to construct                 .   There are 47 Type A countries out of

the total of 64. The a.. obey the property that                                    1 ,     c.here

(1) is restrictive in that the coefficient .                 is   the same across all

values of j      (i.e., there is only one coefficient to estimate over all

1692 observations). If, say,             8it—1 =                then the percentage

change in the share of country 8 corresponding to a given percentage change

in country 8's export price is assumed to be the same as the percentage

change in the share of country 9 corresponding to the same percentage

change in country 9's export price.

       Equation (1) is similar to the share equation estimated by Samuelson

(1973).l The differences are as follows.               (1) Samuelson uses                  in

1Other possible equations and approaches are discussed in Taplin (1973).

The use of the lagged values here is in keeping with the usual interpre-

tation of percentage changes. (2) Samuelson adds two other variables to

the equation: the relative change in capacity output and the relative

change in demand pressure. These variables are designed to measure

"relative non—price competitiveness" (p. 10). The problem with the capacity

output variable is that while capacity output and exports tend to be

positively correlated, the relationship between the two variables is not

necessarily a structural one. Similarly, demand pressure and exports may

be negatively correlated, but this is not necessarily a structural rela-

tionship. The assumption here is that any effects of capacity output and

demand pressure on exports are reflected in the effects of these two vari-

ables on export prices. (3) Samuelson uses seasonal dummy variables,

something which has not been done here.

        Samuelson (p. 11) argues that equation (1) (without the capacity

output and demand pressure variables) is a first—order approximation to

the CES demand system of Armington (1969). This is not, however, correct.

In the present case of one good per country, Armington's CES system is

as follows. Considerthedemandofacountry for its own and other countries'

goods. It's utility function is assumed to be:

k's good. Armington shows that maximizing (2) with respect to

Equation (1)' is the same as the equation derived by Samuelson (p. 11)

except for the use of the lagged values rather than the current values of

c and PX$ .          Samuelson argues that this equation is a first order approxi--

mation to equation (4). This is not the case because Z ,                                 unlike N75$A.
is not merely the weighted sum of imports: it is also a function of P

(and thus of            ).       Likewise,           P is a function of p .        Although in a
loose sense equation (1)' is an approximation to (4), it seems better

merely to argue directly that equation (1) may not be too bad an approxi-

mation to the true structure, rather than to appeal to the CES demand

system.

III. The Econometric Techniques

          Equation (1) is an example in which there is a fairly large number

of observations both across individuals (countries) and across time. It

will be useful for purposes of this section to drop the i subscript and

rewrite (1) as


(5)                        =         +            ,        j = 1,   ..., N    ,    t    =   1,   ..., T



N is the number of Type A countries. The error term is assumed to be

autocorrelated across time and heteroskedastic across countries. In par-

ticular, it is assumed that

          The model (5)—(8) (with an arbitrary number of explanatory variables)

is analyzed by Kmenta (1971, pp. 508—512). The model can be written

The generalized least squares (GLS) estimator of                           is

with asymptotic covariance matrix (X'QX)                           .   Under the assumption

of normality,       is also the maximum likelihood estimator.

        The GLS estimator is not feasible because P is not known. It

is possible, however, to estimate both                      and P .        Kmenta (pp. 510—511)

proposes a three step procedure for doing this. An alternative procedure

was used for the results in this study, a procedure that iterates between

estimates of       and estimates of P until convergence. The procedure

is:

        denote the estimate of               from this regression.

[4] Repeat [2] and [3] using the new estimate of                                    .    Keep repeating

        until successive estimates of                  are within a prescribed tolerance

        level.


An estimate of the covariance matrix of                          is merely the covariance matrix

computed on the last step from the pooled observations.                                    Note that in

going from [1] to [3] one observation is lost for each cross—sectional

unit.

          This procedure is a special case of the procedure discussed in

Oberhofer and Kmenta (1974). They show under fairly general conditions
                                                                                                                   9




 (conditions that are satisfied in the present application) that if the

procedure converges it converges to a solution of the first order maxi-

mizing conditions of the maximum likelihood estimator. As will be seen,

the procedure converged quite rapidly for the results in this study.

           This procedure does not lead to consistent estimates if x and

E•        are correlated. As will be discussed in Section IV, x.                                        and c.

may be correlated in the present case. If one can find variables that

are correlated with x.                    but not with c.                   ,       then an instrumental vari-

Z variables if they are not correlated with         .   In   other words, they

should serve as their own instruments. If they are not included, they

IV.   The Estimates

        The results of estimating equation (1) for each of the 64 countries

are presented in Table 2. There are 47 Type A countries, and the basic

estimation period is 197l1—l979IV (36 quarters). If every country traded

with all 47 Type A countries every quarter, the number of observations

for each estimated equation would be 35 x47 = 1645.     In practice, not

every country trades with every other. It is also true that for some

quarters (typically the early and late quarters) data on             do not

exist for an otherwise Type A country. These two facts mean the number

of observations for a given equation is less than 1645. The exact number

for each equation is presented in Table 2.

        The first set of results in Table 2 is quite remarkable.2 For

only three countries——Yugoslavia, Mexico, and China——is the sign of the

coefficient estimate positive (and thus contrary to what is expected).

Of the remaining 61 countries, 48 have t—statistics greater than or equal

to 2.0 in absolute value and only 5 have t—statistics less than 1.0 in



2The average number of iterations for the procedure (across the 64 equa-
tions) was 4.5 for a tolerance level of 0.01 percent. The largest number
of iterations for a given equation was 14. The time taken to estimate
the 64 equations on the IBM 370—158 at Yale was about 5.5 minutes using
a program written by the author. In a few cases the initial estimate of
a serial correlation coefficient was greater than one in absolute value,
and in these cases the estimate was constrained to be zero. This was also
done for the IV results.

absolute value. These results thus seem to provide rather strong support

for the hypothesis that relative prices have an important effect on trade

shares.

            These results are so good that they lead one to be suspicious that

something else is going on. One possible problem is that                                  is used

both in the construction of the data for a.                            (see Table 1) and in the

biased downward. To test for this, equation (1) was estimated by the IV

procedure. Five variables were used as Z variables: a constant term,

            The use of PY$ required that a few more observations be dropped
due to lack of data. The second set of results in Table 2 is the same as

the first set except for the use of the shorter sample periods. The second

set of results is similar to the first, although there are now six countries

with a positive coefficient estimate instead of three. The third set

of results is for the IV procedure.3 These results do not indicate that



3The average number of iterations in this case was 5.7. The largest number
of iterations for a given equation was 16.   The time taken to estimate
the 64 equations in this case was about 12 minutes.

the non IV estimates are biased downward. Consider the first 15 countries,

which are the main countries in the model. For 7 of the 15 the IV esti-

mates are greater than the non IV estimates, but for the other 8 they are

smaller. The estimates for the other countries are also not systematically

different. (The IV estimates are not as precise, as expected, and they

tend to be more erratic for the smaller countries.) It thus does not

appear that the non IV estimates are biased downward, and so it seems that

relative prices do have an important effect on trade shares.

        For each estimated equation there are N estimates of p. and

N estimates of . ,       where   N is the number of Type A countries that

the given country trades with. A subset of these estimates is presented

in Table 3.   Estimates of p. and c        for the first 15 countries for

each of the first 15 equations are presented. Almost all of the estimates

of p. are negative, which is as expected given that the left hand side

variable is in change form. The estimates of c. range from a low of

4 percent to a high of 94 percent. (Remember that the standard errors

are for the percentage changes in the shares, not the absolute changes.)

Most of the estimates are less than 20 percent.



V.   The Trade Share Equations in a Multicountry Model

       The sensitivity of the properties of the model in Fair (1981a)

to the endogenous treatment of trade shares is examined in this section.

Two main questions are considered. The first is how the fit of the model

is affected by the inclusion of the trade share equations, and the second

is how the multiplier properties are affected.

       The model will only be briefly reviewed here. It is quarterly and

contains estimated equations for 44 countries. Most of the equations

have been estimated by two stage least squares. The basic estimation

period is 19581—19801. There are up to 11 estimated equations per country

(excluding the U.S., for which there is a much larger model), explaining

(1) imports, (2) consumption, (3) investment, (4) production, (5) GNP

deflator, (6) money supply, (7) short term interest rate, (8) long term

interest rate, (9) exchange rate, (10) forward rate, and (11) export price

index. The part of the model that links the countries toget.her receives

as input from each country its level of imports, exchange rate, and export

price index and returns as output the level of exports and the import.

price index. The trade shares are used in the determination of both of

these variables. The model is solved by iterating between the models of

the individual countries and the part of the overall model that links the

countries together.

       When the share equations are added to the model, the estimates of

p.   cannot be used in the predictions of the shares. If they were used,
it would not be the case that     Ace.. = 0   .   The error term u..    in

equation (.1) must be set to zero for all j and t in order for this

property to hold.

       The fit of the model is examined in Table 4. The model was solved

for three eight—quarter periods, both statically and dynamically, and

root mean squared errors (RNSEs) were computed for each endogenous variable

for each run. For the first set of results in Table 4 a weighted average

of the RMSEs across all countries except the U.S. was taken for each var-

iable. The RNSEs were weighted by the ratio of the country's real GNP

(in 75$) in the last (i.e., eighth) quarter of the prediction period to

the total real GNP of all the countries. The RNSEs for the U.S. are

presented in the second half of Table 4.

Notes: 1. All errors are in percentage points.
       2. Weights are GNP in 75$ in the last quarter of the period.
       3. First set of equations in Table 2 was used for the endogenous trade share case.
           The shares for the three countries with the wrong sign for i ——Yugoslavia,
             Mexico, and China——were taken to be exogenous.

       c =   fixed   exchange rate period for almost all countries.
                                                                           17




           The variable most affected by the addition of the trade share

equations is (as expected) the level of exports. For the l9761—19771V

period, for example, the RNSE increased for the dynamic simulation from

2.65 percent to 7.90 percent. The effects on the other variables were

much smaller, and in some cases error cancellation was such as to lead

to smaller RNSEs in the endogenous trade share case. Of the other var-

iables, GNP was generally affected the most. This is, of course, not

surprising given that exports are part of GNP.

       For the results in Fair (1981b), ten experiments were performed,

each experiment corresponding to a change in one or more exogenous var-

iables. Trade shares were taken to be exogenous for these results. For

present purposes these experiments were repeated with the trade share

equations added. The results of two of the experiments are reported in

Tables 5 and 6. For the first experiment the equation explaining the

German exchange rate was dropped and the German exchange rate was taken

to be exogenous. The results in Table 5 are for an increase in the exchange

rate of ten percent (a depreciation). The second experiment is the same

as the first except the country is the U.K. instead of Germany. The

results of this experiment are presented in Table 6.

       All of the countries in the model were used for the experiments.

The results for 15 countries and 13 variables per country are presented

in Tables 5 and 6 for the two—quarter—ahead and six—quarter—ahead predic-

tions. Except for the numbers for the balance of payments, each number

in the tables is the percentage change in the variable (in percentage

points).

       Without a detailed description of the model, it is not possible

to explain all of the results in the two tables. This description is

provided in Fair (l981a, 1981b). For present purposes the discussion

will be limited to two effects: the effect on the balance of payments

and the effect on GNP. The initial effect of a depreciation on the balance

of payments is likely to be negative in the model. Depreciation raises

the local currency price of imports more than it does the local currency

price of exports, which, other things being equal, has a negative effect

on the balance of payments. Depreciation also lowers imports and raises

exports, which has a positive effect on the balance of payments.   This

latter effect is likely to be smaller initially than the price effect,

and so the initial net effect is likely to be negative. (This is the

"J curve" effect.) This is true of the results in Tables 5 and 6, where

the changes in the balance of payments of Germany in Table 6 and of the

U.K. in Table 7 are negative. The balance of payments falls less when the

trade shares are endogenous because the changes in exports are greater.

In the endogenous trade share case, the share of the depreciating country's

exports in other countries' imports rises because of the fall in the rela-

tive price of the depreciating country's exports. This is the first main

difference between the two cases.

       Depreciation has three main effects on GNP in the model, two positive

and one negative. The first effect is through the price of imports.

Depreciation raises the price of imports, which has a negative effect on

the demand for imports, which has a positive effect on GNP. In other

words, an increase in the price of imports causes substitution from imports

to domestically produced goods, which raises GNP, The second effect is

through the price of exports. Depreciation lowers the foreign currency

price of exports. If trade shares are endogenous, this increases the demand

for the country's exports, which raises GNP. Although this effect is
                                                                        21




lacking when trade shares are exogenous, there is still at least a slight

increase in the country's exports, other things being equal. The decrease

in the price of exports lowers the impor.t price indices of countries that

import from the given country, which in turn increases their demand for

imports. Some of this increase in demand (even with trade shares exogenous)

is an increase in demand for the given country's exports.

       The third effect is through the balance of payments. If deprecia—

tion lowers the balance of payments, this decreases the country's net

foreign assets, which in the model decreases the demand for imports and

consumption and increases the short term interest rate. Although the de-

crease in imports raises GNP, the decrease in consumption and the increase

in the interest rate lower GNP, and the net effect is likely to be negative.

       Although the net effect of a depreciation on GNP can go either way,

it is more likely to be positive when trade shares are endogenous than when

they are exogenous. The positive export effect is larger in the endogenous

case and the negative balance of payments effect is smaller (because the

decrease in the balance of payments is smaller). This is in fact the

case in Tables 5 and 6.   In the German experiment with trade shares exog-

enous, GNP fell by 0.16 percentage points after two quarters and 0.63

percentage points after six quarters. With trade shares endogenous, GNP

rose by 0.72 percentage points after two quarters and 0.20 percentage

points after six quarters. In the U.K. case with trade shares exogenous,

GNP fell by 0.09 and 0.70 in the two quarters,respectively. With trade

shares endogenous, GNP rose by 0.62 after two quarters and fell by 0.15

after six quarters.

       The differences in the results between the endogenous and exogenous

trade share cases are larger in the depreciation experiments just reported
                                                                     22

than they are when the experiment is a change in government spending or

in monetary policy. Changes in fiscal and monetary policy do not change

the relative price of a country's exports nearly as much as does a depre-

ciation, and so the results are obviously less sensitive to the treatment

of trade shares.



VI. Conclusion

       The results in Table 2 indicate that relative prices have an impor-

tant effect on trade shares. The sensitivity of trade shares to relative

prices thus appears to be an important channel through which a country's

price of exports affects the demand for its exports. This channe.i is

evident in the multicountry model discussed in Section V, where the addi-

tion of the trade share equations has noticeable effects on the properties

of the model regarding the effects of a depreciation.
