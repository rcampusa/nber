                           On the Rationality of
                          Black Youth Unemployment


                                  ABSTRACT


        In this paper I provide some evidence on the question of whether the

behavior of unemployed young blacks, whose reservation wages are relatively

high and whose jobless spells are very lengthy, reflect rational maximizing

choices. To do this, I use a simple income—maximizing job search model to

imply employment probabilities and various elasticities which are compared

to those which are actually observed for young blacks.

        The results show that, for reasonable discount rates, the employment

probabilities implied by income—maximization are consistent with those

observed for young blacks. The elasticities of reservation wages with

respect to nonwage income that are implied by income—maximizing are also

consistent with those estimated econometrically for this group. This was

true despite the many assumptions embodied in this model whose validity for

a sample of low—income youth is highly questionable.

        The evidence thus suggests that young blacks are making economically

rational choices by choosing high reservation wages and lengthy spells

without jobs.

     The exceedingly high rates of unemployment which plague black youth today

have generated a great deal of interest and concern among economists and

policy—makers. While recent research has provided sane important insights

into the nature and causes of the problem, many puzzles remain unresolved.

For instance, the evidence seems to indicate that the problem of unemployment

for black youth is primarily one of lengthy duration (or low probability of

gaining employment), rather than one of high frequency (or high probability of

losing employment).1 Furthermore, the reported reservation wages of black

youth remain above the minimum wage despite these lengthy durations of

unemployment; yet they continue to express desires for work and seek jobs

which are comparable to those sought by white youth.2

     These findings beg the question of whether black youth are behaving in an

economically rational manner. Do lengthy durations of joblessness reflect

income or utility—maximizing behavior on the part of black youth who

accurately perceive their unattractive labor market opportunities and who

choose their responses accordingly? Or does their behavior reflect some besic

irrationality, caused either by incorrect expectations that fail to adapt

(despite lengthy periods of search) or by tastes, attitudes, etc. that yield

non—maximizing outcomes?

     This paper presents some evidence on these issues. In particular, I

analyze some survey data on job search by Inner—city black youth using a

technique developed recently by Lancaster and Chesher.3 They use a simple

income—maximizing model of job search to derive formulas for the elasticities

of reservation wages and employment probabilities with respect to nonwage

income and job offer arrival rates. These formulas enable us to compute these

elasticities from summary statistics instead of estimating these parameters

statistically. However, the technique is valid only if the stringent

assumptions of the simple job search model are correct (and if certain survey

data can be interpreted in a particular manner).

     The validity of these assumptions for a sample of unemployed black youth

are tested below. Using formulas derived by Lancaster and Chesher, I compute

the elasticities and employment probabilities for unemployed blacks that are

implied by the income—maximizing job search model. These are then compared to

observed employment probabilities and econometrically estimated elastics to

test whether the income—maximizing model correctly predicts their behavior.

The computed elasticities are also interesting In their own right as measures

of responsiveness to economic incentives. The model, the data, the results

and various caveats are all described below.



I.. The Model and Data

     In their paper, Lancaster and Chesher use an Income—maximizing job search

model to derive an unemployed individual's optimal reservation wage. After

some algebraic manipulations, they then show that the elasticities of this

reservation wage with respect to nonwage income and job offer arrivals

respectively are:

           Ew r—b
          p        we -wr

*here p is the Individual's discount rate.

      Lancaster and Chesher then compute these elasticities using summary data

on a sample of unemployed British workers. In addition to providing data on

unemployment insurance payments and reported reservation wages, the survey

which they use also includes questions on how much the individual expects to
                                          4




earn on a new job.4 By interpreting this last variable as the individual's

conditional expected wage, Lancaster and Chesher have all the variables

necessary for the calculation of the first two elasticities above;5 and, by

hypothesizing a functional form for the distribution of offered wages (they

use the Pareto discription), they calculate the last two elasticities as

well.6 All elasticities are calculated using sample means of the independent

variables, and all are shown to be comparable to elasticities calculated by

others using more coventional econometric techniques.

     The same model can be applied to unemployed black youth in this country

by using the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Suriey of Iowa—City

Black Youth. This survey was conducted in 1979 and 1980 for 2400 males, aged

16 through 24, who live in predominantly black and low—income city blocks of

Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.7

     The survey contains a few questions which are used to gauge respondents'

expected wages and several more which gauge reservation wages; in both cases,

the responses obtained are generally consistent with one another. The ones

used in the calculations below are responses to the questions, "How much per

hour do you think you would earn (on the best job you could get right now)?"

and "If you were offered that job tomorrow, would you take It If it paid

_____?"   with   responses to the latter provided at $.50 Intervals.8 Respondents

were also asked whether they thought their chances of obtaining these jobs

were "very high," "somewhat high," "somewhat low," or "very low." The vast

majority of responses fell in the middle two categories, which are consistent

with the Lancaster--Chesher interpretation of responses as conditional

expectations of offer wage distributions.
                                      S




     Nonwage income sources and amounts for these youth in the previous four

weeks were also gauged in the survey. Since most of the unemployed youth here

have had either very short employment durations or no recent work experience,

the fraction who report receiving Unemployment Insurance is very low.9

Instead, most report gifts or loans from friends and relatives, other transfer

payments, and illegal activities as their main sources of income. Though the

last category undoubtedly contains a good deal of reporting error, these

responses probably provide the most realistic accounts of nonwage income

sources for these youth that could have been obtained)°

     Finally, the NBER survey contains a retrospective time—line for the

previous year that records all periods of employment during that period.

Employment and unemployment durations as well as transition probabilities

between employment states have been calculated using these data.11 These

estimates of employment probabilities for the unemployed are used below for

comparison purposes with measures implied by the Lancaster—Chesher model.

     Before presenting the results below, a few caveats are in order. As they

themselves acknowledge, the model of Lancaster and Chesher is a simple one

which assumes income (as opposed to utility) maximization, constant

reservation wages, and rational expectations with regards to potential wage

offers in the market. These are strong assumptions for any sample, and are

even less likely to hold for a sample of low—wage youth whose experience In

and knowledge of the labor market are limited. Furthermore, as young people

who are mostly unmarried and living at home, their tastes for leisure or other

non—market uses of time may make the assumptions of strict income—maximization

untenable. Perhaps most Importantly, these youth generally do not have access

to a constant stream of nonwage income that can be considered exogenously

determined (such as Unemployment Insurance); their income sources (especially
                                      6




illegal ones) are much more likely to reflect endogenous choices which are

influenced by status, risk and other non—pecuniary considerations outside of

the model. Thus we would expect the Lancaster—Chesher model to be less well—

suited to these youth than to a sample which is more broadly representative of

the population.

     Despite these drawbacks, the job search model provides a useful benchmark

for judging the consistency of behavior by low—income youth with simple

maximizing principles. Once this benchmark is established, we can consider

the effects of various biases Induced by complicating factors and also by

potential measurement errors in the variables used. Thus, the results

reported below should provide some important insights despite the strong

assumptions of the model on which they are based.



II. Results and Their Implications

     Table 1 below presents means and standard deviations on the variables

which are used in the calculations for those in the NBER. survey.12 The sample

includes all those without work who are not students)-3

     The results show reservation wages which are above the minimum wage

(which was $2.90 in 1979 and 3.10 in 1980) despite the low monthly probability

of gaining employment. In fact, the latter figure implies that expected

durations of completed spells without employment are approximately a year

Iong.4
     The expected wage is well above the reservation wage at the mean;

frequencies show this to be true for most Individuals as well. The evidence

is thus consistent with the Lancaster—Chesher interpretation of this variable

as a mean of the wage offer distribution, conditional on offers being above

the reservation wage. In fact, the expected wagemeasure is also well above

the mean of previously received wages for this group; this suggests some

possibility that black youth are overly optimistic about their prospects in

the labor market, though the evidence is certainly not conclusive.15

       As for the nonwage income figure, the large standard deviation reflects a

great deal of variation in individuals' outside income sources. A major

source of this variation involves illegal activities, which are reported by

approximately 19% of the sample)6 Since evidence on self—reported crime

rates generally shows them to be underreported, there is some reason to

believe that this income figure is downward—biased.17 This, in turn, Implies

that substantial sources of income may be available to the young unemployed——

especially relative to income needs for the vast majority who continue to lIve

at   home.

       Table 2 then shows the employment probabilities and elasticities that are

implied by these data when using the formulas derived from the simple job

search model. Perhaps most important for a test of the model's validity for

this sample is the first line, which reports the employment probability

(divided by discount rate) implied by the model. In comparing this figure

with the observed monthly probability reported in the previous table, we find

that the probability Jnplied by income—maximizing behavior equals the observed

one if the annual discount rate of individuals in the sample is approximately

41%.

       Of course, we have no way   of   knowing what the true discount rate really

Is. While economists generally assume it to be a number much lower than this,

it is not inconceivable that the true discount rate among youth from low—

Income backgrounds is as high as (or even higher than) the 41% mark. It is

therefore quite possible that, given their nonwage income sources and wage

opportunities in the labor market, the high reservation wages and lengthy

durations of joblessness which we observe for black youth are income—

maximizing choices.

     It is also interesting to note the direction of the error in the implied

probability if the true discount rate is different from 41%. For a lower

discount rate implies that a lower employment probability than the one

observed is consistent with income—maximization, while a higher discount rate

implies the opposite. In other words, if their discount rates are less than

41%, unemployed black youth are being too cautious and are choosing

reservation wages that would maximize income only if their chances of becoming

employed were lower than they are now. On the other hand, black youth are too

optimistic and choose reservation wages too high if their discount rates are

above 41%.

     Of course, some caveats mentioned above must now be considered again

since they are likely to cause biases in estimates of employment probabilities

that are consistent with rational behavior. For instance, unemployed youth

living at home are likely to value their leisure time and other non—work

activities. Therefore, nonwage income is likely to understate the true

benefits of being unemployed, and the implied employment probability that is

consistent with utility—maximization will be even lower than that consistent

with income—maximization. If nonwage income from illegal sources is

substantially underreported here, the employment probability consistent with

maximization would be lower still. These factors thus imply that reservation

wages could be even higher than those observed without violating the

principles of rational maximization. However, these biases do not appear to

greatly change the results described here.18
                                      9




     Furtermore, several other factors appear to explain why rational

maximizing may really call for reseration wages that are as low or lower than

those observed. In particular, the uncertainties and risks associated with

sources of income such as illegal activities should cause them to be far less

attractive per dollar received than sources such as Unemployment Insurance,

which provide a safe and steady stream of benefits with little effort. This,

in turn, suggests that the nonwage income figures used in the calculat!ons may

actually overstate the benefits of being unemployed. The employment

probability implied by risk—adjusted maximization may then be higher than the

one which appears in Table 2, and the argument that reservation wages should

be even higher than they are is severely weakened. Furthermore, Equation (5)

suggests that any overestimation of potential wage offers will also lower the

employment probabilities that appear to be consistent with maximization. If,

in fact, subjective expectations by black youth of the wage offers which they

face are too high, a higher employment probability will be consistent with

true income maximization and lower reservation wages would be in order. In

this last case, however, the behavior of black youth would be "rational" for a

given set of expectations, even where the expectations themselves are not.

     To sum up, the evidence indicates that reservation wages chosen by

unemployed young blacks may not be inconsistent with rational behavior in a

simple, income—maximizing search model. While various factors may cause

biases in estimates of employment probabilities consistent with maximization,

some are upward and others downward. Their net effect is unclear, but they

are unlikely to substantially change the basic result of consistency with

maximizing behavior.
                                         10




     Moving on to the elasticities which are implied by income—maximization,

we find that reservation wages among unemployed black youth will be less

responsive to nonwage income and more responsive to offers under income—

maximizing search than will those of the group studied by Lancaster and

Chesher 19

     The low elasticity with respect to nonwage Income Is somewhat troubling

here, given the importance attached to this Income in the previous discussion

of high reservation wages. However, these calculations are surprisingly

consistent with some econometrically estimated elasticities for this group

that. ranged in value from .02 to .07.20 This consistency of the job search

model's predictions with econometric evidence provides more support for the

notion that income—maximizing principles may accurately portray the behavior

of unemployed young blacks.

     It is also noteworthy that the factors discussed above which may bias

calculations based on the simple search model (e.g., underreporting of nonwage

income, endogenelty ,   etc.)   will also bias econometric estimates of these

elasticities, and that the net effect of these biases is likely to be

downward.21 It is therefore quite possible that reservation wage elasticities

for black youth with respect to nonwage income are more substantial than those

calculated or estimated here. But the discrepancies in this case are caused

by measurement problems rather than the maximizing assumptions which underlie

the search model.

     As for the elasticities of employment probabilities, these are

substantially different from the reservation wage elasticities presented in

Table 2. The reasons for these discrepancies are readily apparent. In order

to calculate these employment elasticities, some distribution function had to

be assumed for wage offers in order to obtain an estimate for the hazard

function. Following Lancaster and Chesher, I use the Pareto distribution for
                                      11




the sake of convenience and simplicity. The use of the Pareto distribution

here enables us to replace the hazard function with            where a is the
                                                           r

standard deviation of wage offers; the value of this statistic can, in turn,

be inferred from the data on expected and reservation wages which are

available here.21 However, this replacing of the hazard function has the

effect of specifying the following:

         dlogP
        d log w
                r a

From the expected and reservation wage data for young blacks, a is calculated

to be approximately .25 and the elasticity of employment probability with

respect to reservation wages approximately 4. This implied employment

elasticity is clearly larger than other estimates of these elasticities for

young blacks.23 This, in turn, causes the employment elasticities with

respect to nonwage income and offer arrivals to appear larger and smaller,

respectively, than would otherwise be the case. These problems appear to be

even more true for Lancaster and Chesher, for whom     approximately equals

10. But the difficulties in this case seem to be more a result of the

assumption of Pareto distributions for wage offers than of the job search

model on which these calculations are based. Once again, support for the

proposition that young blacks are behaving rationally is not undercut by the

evidence presented.

III. Conclusion

     In this paper I provide some evidence on the question of whether the

behavior of unemploy, young blacks, whose reservation wages are relatively

high and whose jobless spells are very lengthy, reflect rational maximizing

choices. To do this, I use a simple income—maximizing job search model to

imply employment probabilities and various elasticities which are compared to

those which are actually observed for young blacks.

     The results show that, for reasonable discount rates, the employment

probabilities implied by income—maximization are consistent with those

observed for young blacks. The elasticities of reservation wages with respect

to nonwage Income that are implied by income—maximizing are also consistent

with those estimated econometrically for this group. This was true despite

the many assumptions embodied in this model whose validity for a sample of

low—income youth is highly questionable.

     The evidence thus suggests that young blacks are making economically

reational choices by choosing high reservation wages and lengthy spells

without jobs. Given the availability of nonwage income from illegal

activities and other sources, and given the low potential wage offers which

they face, it appears to be in the interests of many young blacks to demand

high wages before accepting work. This is consistent with other research

evidence that shows young blacks responding to incentives and behaving

rationally in their labor market pursuits.24

     It is, however important to interpret these results carefully. What is

rational or optimal from the private point of view is not necessarily so from

a social point of view; this is especially, true if the nonwage income on which

unemployed people rely represents a cost to society. Futhermore, the private

rationality of high reservation wages depends on wage offer distributions

remaining unattractive relative to nonwage income. However, government

policies exist (e.g., education and training programs, Affirmative Action,

etc) which might change the attractiveness of the labor market which

unemployed people face and therefore might affect their behavior.25

     Finally, it is Important to remember that offer probabilities as well as

wage offers affect employment probabilities. Even if the reservation wages of

young blacks declined to the minimum wage (or lower), low offer probabilities

may continue to reflect the severe demand side constraints which many

unemployed young blacks presumably face. A policy approach on black youth

unemployment must therefore consider many sources of low employment

probabilities if it is to be successful.

     3See Lancaster and Chesher (1983).

     4me exact wording of the question they use is, "How much take home pay

would you expect to be able to earn in a new job?"

    5Lancaster and Chesher evidence in favor of their interpretation of this

variable as a conditional rather than unconditional mean of the offer wage

distribution—i.e., that e = E(wlw > Wr) instead of e = E(w)      .   The evidence

consists of joint frequency distributions of e and r which show the former

to be greater than or equal to the latter for virtually every individual in

the sample.

     6The Pareto distribution is chosen for computational convenience and

because it specifies a declining frequency of wages, which should be accurate

for most of the portion of the wage distribution above the reservation wage.

The effects of using a normal distribution instead (which would allow for

rising or declining frequency) are discussed as well.

     7The city blocks chosen were those in which at least 70% of the

population was black and 30% of families had income below the poverty line in

the 1970 Census.

     8There were concerns that the specific wording of the expected wage

question (i.e., the references to "best job" and "right now") made it

inappropriate for the job search context. However, responses to this question

were very comparable to those for the other question that asked about the job

which the individual is seeking. The decision to use the former variable here
                                       15




was based on its availability for a larger sample and also on the availability

of information on the perceived chance of obtaining this job, which is

described in the text below.

      9Only 5% of those without jobs in the sample report receiving

Unemployment Insurance at the time of the survey. This is consistent with the

fact that over 40% of this group report no regular employment in the previous

year, while the rest report completed employment durations of approximately 13

weeks. For the latter figure see Ballen and Freeman op. cit., p. 11.

Presumably, a large fraction of the reported employment spells are part—time

or   summer jobs of former students.
         good discussion of the potential reporting errors in   these   data and
how they might affect estimated relationships with labor market outcomes can

be found in Viscus: (1984).

11Many of these figures are reported in Ballen and Freeman, op. cit.

          calculating these elasticities, nonwage income is converted to an

hourly equivalent by assuming 40 hours per week and 4 weeks per month work.

     1-30f those without work in the nonstudent sample, about 80% are in the

official labor force. The decision to includethe others as well is

consistent with the work of Clark and Summers op. cit., who find the

distinction between unemployed and out of the labor force to be arbitrary.

Calculations performed for those in the labor force suggest that the

qualitative results do not change when the sample is limited to this group.

      14This is true since the expected duration of a spell of

unemployment E(D) =   f- where    is defined for a finite time unit.

     15me mean wage previously received by this group was $3.98. Alternative

interpretations of the gap between currently expected and previously received

wages include adjustments for inflation, higher minimum wages, and human
                                     16




capital formation over time. This last factor could be important for recent

high school graduates whose previous earnings, are from summer or part—time

jobs.

    16For those reporting illegally received income, the mean monthly income

attributable to this source is about $235. Thus the monthly nonwage income of

the sample excluding that from Illegal sources is about $71.

    7See Viscusi, op. cit.

    18For instance, if the total amount of money obtained by illegal

activities was double the amount reported, the implied         would decline to

2.155 and the discount rate which would equate the probabilities would rise to

45.7%.

    19meir reservation wage elasticities with respect to nonwage income and

offer arrivals were .135 and .107, respectively.

    20See Hoizer (1983), Chapter 6. The elasticities are calculated from

equations of the form £fl(Wr)   a + n(b) + y X, where the X included various

measures of actual or expected wages.

    21y reporting errors in nonwage income, the independent variable, are

likely to result in downward biases in the estimated coefficients for that

variable. Futhermore, the presumed positive correlation of unobserved

personal quality with reservation wages and its negative correlation with

income from sources such as Illegal activities should cause another downward

bias for these estimates. The effects of income endogenity on estimated

elasticities are unclear.

    22The Pareto distribution implies that, since    is comparable to the

coefficient of variation for the wage offer distribution, e =    w/(l—)     .   See

Lancaster and Chesher, p. 1669.

    23Elasticities of duration of unemployment with respect to reservation

wages of young blacks, estimated using the National Longitudial Survey, range

from .6 to 1.4 in Hoizer (1984). These estimates are based on equations of

the form £n(D) = + Ln(w') + y X , where the X represent variables that are

likely to affect offer probabilities and wage offers which individuals face.

While fairly substantial, these elasticities remain well below what is implied

by assuming the Pareto distribution.

    24For instance, Viscusi op. cit. shows that the decision of young blacks

to participate in illegal activities is largely influenced by their

preceptions of risks and returns in legal and illegal pursuits. Ferguson and

Filer (1984) also find absenteeism on the job related to incentives created by

job characteristics (e.g., wage, status, and skill specificity) as predicted

by rational, maximizing behavior.

    25Posltive effects of Affirmative Action programs on employment of blacks

has been found by Leongrd (1984). The effects of education and training

programs on earnings for black males and other groups is reviawed in Barocci

(1982).
