Sticky Price for Declining Risk? The Case of Cancellation Premia in the Hotel Industry

                                          ABSTRACT

Using data from about seven millions room postings by hotels in France and the UK, we
document that, rather than smoothly decreasing to zero, cancellation premia remain positive at
roughly 10%to 15% of the full price until two days before the stay. A model where travelers have
different willingness to pay and some overestimate the probability to cancel their trip explains
this price-setting mode more consistently than alternative interpretations. We denote these
strategies as a form of naivet -based price discrimination. We use our model also to identify
conditions under which these strategies are exploitative of certain consumers, or are welfare-
enhancing instead.

1     Introduction
According to standard economic theory, prices of goods and services reflect all the avail-
able information relevant to a particular product. Changes in relevant information should
therefore lead to changes in prices.
    There is evidence, however, that prices do not adjust entirely, if at all, to news. This topic
has long been of interest in economics, because price dynamics determine the effectiveness
of certain economic policies and the trends in various socioeconomic outcomes, such as the
distribution of gains from international trade or the effect of mergers, acquisitions and other
forms of consolidation or fragmentation in an industry (Bils and Klenow, 2004).
    Classic explanations for the low responsiveness of prices appealed, for example, to the
presence of menu costs (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008), and to the use of efficiency wages
(Akerlof and Yellen, 1986). Studies that departed from the standard rational-agent framework
have considered psychological tendencies that might account for limited price adjustments,
such as concerns for fairness, loss aversion, and managerial inertia (Kahneman et al., 1986;
Choi and Mattila, 2003; Anderson and Simester, 2010; Heidhues and K            oszegi, 2008, 2010;
K oszegi and Rabin, 2006, 2007).
    We contribute to this field of inquiry with theory and evidence of how an additional psy-
chological mechanism may explain the limited flexibility of prices in certain markets where
purchases (reservations) occur before the actual fruition of a good or service. Examples in-
clude hospitality, travel, entertainment and sport events, and e-commerce. When consumers
book a good or service to enjoy at a future date, and the actual fruition is uncertain, com-
panies may offer insurance against missed consumption at a premium: a refundable tariff.
Although one may expect this premium to decline as the uncertainty resolves, companies may
instead adopt pricing schemes that limit or exclude premium changes in order to leverage the
systematic bias of some consumers in assessing the likelihood of cancelling their purchase.
    Our empirical focus is on the hotel industry. Customers can generally choose, for a
given room configuration and dates, between a refundable a non-refundable payment option.
The former deal includes reimbursement in case of cancellation before the date of arrival,
whereas the latter does not. The price of the refundable option is therefore higher than
the non-refundable price. However, as the arrival (check-in) date approaches, the insurance
component of the refundable option is less valuable.
    But do we observe the prices for the refundable and non-refundable options converge
to one another? To address this question, we collected information on the full set of hotel
establishments in nine French and thirty-two British cities, operating on the Booking.com
platform ­ a total of 2, 030 hotels and about seven millions room postings. The data include


                                                1
information on prices for all rooms at a specific query date, the check-in date, the cancellation
policy, and several characteristics of the hotel and the specific room.
    We document that refundable prices are indeed higher than the corresponding non-
refundable ones. However, cancellation premia remain stable at more than 10% of the full
price with little variation over time, and no convergence toward zero as the arrival day nears.
    Further analyses provide evidence that the persistently positive premium is likely an
intentional, profit-maximizing managerial choice. We find, in particular, that when the
refundable and non-refundable prices change during the period ahead of stay, their change is
often fine-tuned so as to not alter their difference. Our evidence, moreover, does not support
the hypothesis of systematic mispricing by managers, nor is it consistent with the adoption
of certain "decoy" pricing strategies in order, for example, to make only one type of tariff
appealing to customers.
    Rational customers, however, would not be willing to buy a more expensive cancellation
option, when the uncertainty is fundamentally resolved. The persistence of a positive can-
cellation premium thus indicates potential naivet´  e on the side of customers, which facilitates
pricing strategies of the type that we document.
    To interpret our evidence, we propose a model of these price-setting patterns as a form of
(consumer-side) naivet´  e-based price discrimination, where the naivet´ e consists in systemati-
cally overestimating the probability to cancel a trip. The tendency to overweight the prob-
ability of rare events is one of the implications of prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky,
1979), and several studies demonstrated its presence and implications in relevant contexts ­
see for example Sydnor (2010), Barseghyan et al. (2013) and Jindal (2015). We derive that
profit-maximizing firms optimally sort consumers that are heterogenous in their willingness
to pay and degree of sophistication by setting a price menu with both a refundable and a
non-refundable tariff.1 This result is reminiscent of previous work on the airline industry
by Escobari and Jindapon (2014); similar to hotel reservations, air travelers book their seat
in advance and can choose to insure against cancellation from a menu of fares. This model
only includes consumer heterogeneity in willingness to pay; we show that firms can find it
profitable to offer refundable tariffs tailored to consumers who have both high willingness
to pay and biased beliefs even when the (actual) cancellation probability is negligible. Cali-
brations based on our data do not support standard risk aversion by travelers as a plausible
explanation of the evidence, whereas assuming probability over-weighting fits the model for
more reasonable parameter values.
    Our work combines the insights from studies of price discrimination with naive consumers
  1
    Bruhin et al. (2010) provide experimental evidence on heterogeneity in probability distortion across
individuals.


                                                   2
and results from work on price rigidities due to non-standard preferences and beliefs. Re-
search in behavioral industrial organization analyzed price discrimination in presence of time
inconsistency and overconfidence of certain consumers (Eliaz and Spiegler, 2008; Sandroni
and Squintani, 2013; Heidhues and K     oszegi, 2010, 2017). The objective of these studies is
not to explain price rigidities, but rather to derive optimal pricing menus and their welfare
implications. In addition to providing an explanation for certain types of price rigidities,
we also establish the conditions under which price discrimination in the presence of naive
consumers is not exploitative (as is usually the case in the literature) but is, instead, welfare-
enhancing. This occurs when naivet´     e-based price discrimination allows a partial form of
preference-based (second-degree) price discrimination that would not be possible otherwise.
In this case, consumers with a higher willingness to pay are more affected by the distortion
in the perception of the cancellation risk. When price discrimination expands the market,
profits increase and each consumer type is (weakly) better off. Allowing for consumers to be
heterogenous both in their willingness to pay and degree of sophistication, we provide novel
insights for those markets where consumers plausibly differ along both these features.
    We describe the data in Section 2. Section 3 reports our key findings and potential
explanations for them. In Section 4 we present our model. Section 5 provides a discussion
and concluding remarks.


2     The data
The data collection involved four steps. First, we obtained the full list of establishments
operating on the Booking.com platform using the identifiers of nine French and thirty-two
British cities. For each establishment, we recorded the unique url identifier and its type
(hotel, B&B, apartment, villa, inn, etc.). We focus only on establishments listed as hotels,
because the other lodging types tend to be small family-run businesses, which adopt simple,
unsophisticated pricing approaches (Mantovani et al., 2021).
    Second, we scraped the hotels' pages to retrieve their star classification, size as measured
in number of rooms, and whether they were affiliated with a chain. Because there is exten-
sive agreement in the literature that chain membership confers a competitive advantage by
improving a hotel's revenue management capabilities (Kosova and Lafontaine, 2012; Kosova
et al., 2013; Hollenbeck, 2017; Mantovani et al., 2021), and that one-star hotels exhibit a
very low propensity toward active pricing (Melis and Piga, 2017), we restricted the sample
to only chain hotels with at least a two-stars classification.
    Third, to reduce scraping problems arising from possible changes in the HTML that


                                                3
Booking.com uses, we saved the pages on a local disk.
    Fourth, we parsed the internal HTML code to create the sample that we used for the
analysis. Thus, we could conveniently update the parsing program without losing information
stored in the HTML file.2
    The data cover stay dates between 30th October 2017 and 2nd January 2018, with inter-
vals of three days to ensure that all weekdays were represented and to reduce collection time.
We retrieved room prices in advance of the stay period. Starting on September 7th 2017 and
continuing on a daily basis (whenever possible), we issued individual queries that specified
each hotel's url identifier and the stay dates. Doing so allowed us to obtain the prices for all
the varieties of rooms that an hotel offered; this would not be possible, for example, if we
based the query on the city listing. The hotel page provides a precise relationship between
the price and the offer characteristics in terms of cancellation policy, breakfast inclusion and
the number of persons allowed. Figure A.1 in the Appendix shows a snapshot of some room
postings. Similar examples continue to be qualitatively valid at the time of writing this pa-
per (February 2021). This information is central to derive a precise value of the cancellation
premium while holding all other characteristics constant.
    Prices are in Euro and Sterling for French and British hotels, respectively. The page
also includes the overall customer rating, and its division into various components: Comfort,
Cleanliness, Staff quality, Facilities, which we use to proxy how well an hotel is managed.
    The sample for the analysis contains 881 hotels in the UK and 1,149 in France that posted
both the Refundable (R) and Non-Refundable (NR) prices. Hotels in the three and four-stars
categories account for the largest proportion in both samples (respectively, 27.6% and 56.3%
in France, 37.0% and 50.0% in the UK). The share of five-stars hotels is about the same in
both countries (8%). Hotels in the UK are larger, with almost 69% of establishment having
between fifty and two hundred rooms; the proportion is about 61% in the French sample,
which includes about 32% of small hotels with less than fifty rooms.
    The scraping activity retrieved also hotels that exclusively posted rooms using only either
the R or NR price. We dropped these hotels from the sample, because no cancellation
premium is available. The single-price hotels are a minority (about 10% of the full sample in
both countries), are smaller than the rest, and tend to be two or three-star hotels, i.e., are
vertically differentiated to serve a more price-sensitive customer segment.3
    The resulting dataset includes about seven million observations, the majority of which
   2
      We verified that web scraping did not engender dynamic pricing (Cavallo, 2017). First, we cleaned
the cookie folder every day; second, using computers that were not used for the data collection, we issued
some queries identical to those made by the scraping computers by hand. We could not find any noticeable
difference.
    3
      The full distribution of hotels by star and size is available in Appendix B, Table B.1.


                                                    4
(between 65-80%) report both the R and NR price. Hotel may only post one of the two prices
for some types of rooms, or, more relevant for our analysis, they may choose to offer only
one at some point before the stay date. For instance, once the cancellation option expires,
which normally happens between seven and one day before the stay, one would only observe
the NR price. This is indeed when we retrieve a larger proportion of observations with only
the NR price, in both countries.4


3         Empirical analysis
3.1         The persistence of refundable premia
We estimate the relationship between room prices and the time between the posting and
reservation date through the following econometric model:

                                  Yrhd|s=i;c=j =       d Dd +         d Xrh + rhd .                           (1)
                                                   d            r,h


The outcomes that we consider are the price per night, separately for refundable and non-
refundable options, as well as the cancellation premium, i.e., the difference between the price
of a refundable and a non-refundable option for a room r in a hotel h, with s stars and in
country c. The binary indicators Dd take the value of one if the posting is d days before the
date of the stay, and zero otherwise. The vector X includes indicators of the combination of
hotel, check-in date, room type (double, luxury double, triple, ...), the maximum number of
guests allowed in the room, and the inclusion of breakfast. As an example, one observation in
our regressions would represent a room in three-star H^ otel des Princes in France, allowing a
maximum of four guests, with check-in date 6 Nov. 2017, whose prices for both a refundable
and non-refundable options (breakfast excluded) are observed on date 14 Oct. 2017 (twenty-
three days before the check-in date). These controls are akin to detailed fixed effects that
allow to account for different features or "bundles" that might differentiate, in particular,
refundable and non-refundable options. We allow the error terms  to be correlated at the
hotel level; as such, we cluster the standard errors at this level of aggregation. We then
estimate the vectors of parameters d and d and derive the predicted values Y     ^rh|s=i,d=D .
    Figure 1 shows the estimated premia for a refundable option at different times before
check-in, separately by number of stars and country of the establishment. The estimates are
stable over a time lag between posting and check-in date from eighty days to one day. In a
few instances, we observe a "stepwise" reduction of the premium in the two weeks before the
    4
        The full distribution of observations over the period ahead of stay is available in Appendix B, Table B.2.



                                                          5
check-in date. In no cases, however, does the premium drop or decrease smoothly to zero
in close proximity of the date of stay. In Figure 2, we report the estimated prices for the
refundable and non-refundable options. The prices, too, have little variation over different
time lags. This implies that the premium changes little not only in absolute terms, but also
as a percentage of price; on average, the estimated premium is about 12% to 16% of the full
refundable price.5


3.2     Understanding the premium persistence
We consider a few potential explanations for why premia for refundable reservations remain
positive even in close temporal proximity of the check-in date.
    Hotels, for one, may set prices for reasons other than conveying all the available informa-
tion or the level of uncertainty. Prices for refundable reservations, for example, may be kept
artificially high to establish a reference point or a "decoy" for consumers, in order to induce
them to book a room at the more convenient non-refundable price. This would imply that
hotel managers would think it highly unlikely that any transaction would include paying the
higher refundable price. In this case, whenever refundable fares are not posted, we should ob-
serve the non-refundable fare to be lower than the refundable one that was offered in nearby
dates. In our sample, this may occur if a hotel occasionally stops posting the refundable
option, or after its termination date occurs, generally between seven and one day before the
stay.
    The histograms in Figure 3 show the distribution of the following statistic:

                         P = [PN R (d) - PR (d + 1) |PR (d) not observed ] .                              (2)

P is the difference of the non-refundable price PN R posted d days before the stay, and the
refundable price PR posted the day before, conditional on the latter not being available on d.
Both in France and in the UK, over half of the distribution mass of P is at zero, i.e., the
NR price converges towards the refundable level when the latter is not offered any longer.
Because we mostly observe this during the week before the stay (not shown, but available on
request), Figure 3 suggests that the refundable price does not operate as a "decoy", but it is
instead a price at which the hotel expects to transact. In fact, in some cases P > 0, i.e.,
occasionally, the non-refundable price is set even above the past refundable values.
   5
    Figure B.1 in the Appendix displays the estimates of parameters d from the following regression equation:
ln(price)rhd|s=i;c=j = d d Dd + I (R)  d d Dd + r,h d Xrh + rhd , where ln(price) is the natural logarithm
of the price of a room, I (R) is binary indicator taking value of 1 if an observation concerns the price for a
refundable reservation, and zero otherwise, and all other terms and subscripts are as in Equation (1). The
values of d in Figure B.1 thus represent the cancellation premium in percentage terms.


                                                      6
    Second, the findings may reflect systematic mispricing, thus providing consumers with
arbitrage opportunities. DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2019), for example, conclude that the
limited price changes within a grocery store chain for the same product in different socioe-
conomic areas is consistent with inertial behavior of managers.6 Institutional features of the
hotel industry, as well as evidence from our own data, allow us to rule out that the persis-
tence of premia is due to managerial inertia. The data come from hotels that are part of
established chains, and exclude one-star hotels. Previous research found that hotel chains
employ sophisticated revenue-management strategies; Hollenbeck (2017), for example, dis-
cuss how information on revenue management strategies shared by chain hotels may become
a source of competitive advantage; as such, it is unlikely that their pricing strategies are
systematically suboptimal.
    Hotels with fewer stars, moreover, are more likely to be smaller and more informally
managed, but this is generally not the case for establishment with three stars or more (Melis
and Piga, 2017; Mantovani et al., 2021). If there were systematic mispricing in our sample,
we may expect it to occur especially among less sophisticated or more badly managed hotels,
as several studies indicate that features such as market experience or the quality of education
may correct certain behavioral tendencies (List, 2003; Goldfarb and Xiao, 2011; Anagol et al.,
2018). Our evidence is inconsistent with this prediction. Premia, for example, stay positive
for hotels of different quality as measured by stars. Within each star category, moreover, we
rely on the customer ratings available in the data to evaluate management quality (Vives
et al., 2018). We define a hotel as having low management quality if it scores below the
median value of its star group in all the four rating measures, and high management quality
otherwise. After estimating the model in equation (1) separately for hotels with high and
low-rated management quality, we show the predicted premia in Figure 4. The predicted
values are slightly smaller for hotels with lower management quality scores, but the patterns
are similar, and the premia are stable, for all categories of hotels and in both countries.
    Finally, the stability of premia may be just a direct consequence of the stability of prices.
However, Figure 5 shows that this is not the case. We plot the sample proportion of observed
changes, within a certain number of days before the check-in date, in both prices (dotted
lines) and the premium (full lines), by stars. Changes in prices are much more frequent
than changes in premia; in other words, when hotels adjust both the refundable and non-
refundable prices, they most often keep the premium unchanged. This indicates that the
stability of premia may be the result of a deliberate decision by hotel managers.
    In the next section, we provide support to our preferred interpretation of the evidence. We
   6
    Arbitrage by customers is less plausible in the context that DellaVigna and Gentzkow (2019) study than
in the one we consider.

claim, in particular, that a form of naivet´
                                           e-based menu pricing (Heidhues and Koszegi, 2017),
with some consumers over-weighting small probabilities of cancellation, leads to the persis-
tence of cancellation premia and the documented lack of convergence between the refundable
and the non-refundable tariffs.

4     A model of naivet´
                       e-based pricing
4.1    Model description
A monopolistic firm provides, at zero marginal cost, a service that consumers value at either
vH or vL , with vL < vH . Consumers make their purchasing decisions at period  (i.e., the
booking date), but actually enjoy the service at period t (i.e. the arrival or check-in date) with
probability  ( )  (0, 1),  ( ) > 0. With the complementary probability 1 -  ( ), consumers
do not enjoy the service and receive zero value.
    For a given t, cohorts of consumers entering at  are otherwise identical. There are NH
consumers of type H , i.e., they have a valuation vH for the service (high-valuation types),
and NL consumers of type L (low-valuation types). The probability  ( ) does not depend
on consumer type; from now on, we simply express this likelihood as  .
    A fraction  of customers has a correct perception of  , with  independent of the
valuation type. We define these consumers sophisticated, and indicate their type with S .
The remaining fraction 1 -  holds a distorted perception of  ; we denote it as g ( ), with
g ( ) > 0. We call these consumers naive (index N ). We assume that  > g ( ); this is
justified by our focus on "high" values of  (i.e., "low" cancellation probability) and the
assumption of over-weighting of small probabilities. All consumers, irrespective of their
valuation and sophistication, share the same increasing and concave utility function u()
(consumers are risk-averse).
    In each period  , the profit-maximizing firm offers a menu with a fully refundable and a
fully non-refundable tariff (we exclude partial refunds).
    We classify consumers in four "composite" types given by the combination of valuation
and sophistication, and denote them with the indexes HS, HN, LS and LN. The expected
utility of a sophisticated consumer with valuation  (= H, L), buying a refundable tariff at
price pR , is:
                                        R
                                     US   = u(v - pR ).                                        (3)

For naive consumers, the corresponding expected utility is:
                                      R
                                     UN = g ( )u(v - pR ).                                    (4)



                                                8
The expected utility for a sophisticated type buying a non-refundable tariff pN R is:

                           NR
                          US  = u(v - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R ),                           (5)

and for naive consumers, the corresponding expected utility is:

                        NR
                       UN  = g ( )u(v - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R ).                     (6)

We set to zero the utility of a consumer who does not buy. Thus cS , the reservation price
for a non-refundable tariff of a sophisticated consumer with valuation , is the solution to:

                             u(v - cS ) + (1 -  )u(-cS ) = 0.                              (7)

For naive consumers the corresponding reservation price, cN , solves:

                         g ( )u(v - cN ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-cN ) = 0.                         (8)

    Because  > g ( ), it follows that cS > cN , i.e., sophisticated types have a higher
reservation price than naive consumers with the same valuation. Moreover, cHS > cLS and
cHN > cLN : for a given level of sophistication, high-valuation consumers have a higher
reservation price. We also assume that cHS > cHN > cLS > cLN , i.e., reservation prices are
more affected by valuation than by the level of sophistication.


4.2    The optimal tariff menu when cancellation probability is small
In this Section we ask whether there are conditions under which the cancellation premium can
remain positive and large even when the cancellation probability is "small". Thus we provide
the characterization of the equilibrium for   1. Consistently with our previous assumption,
we assume lim g ( ) = g < 1, which implies lim vH - cHN > 0 and lim vL - cLN > 0. A general
             1                                 1                     1
version of the model, as well as all proofs, are in Appendix C.
    We can restrict our attention to four undominated candidate equilibria configurations, and
classify them in two groups. In the first group, two equilibria, which we denote as I and II ,
exhibit naivet´e-based discrimination. In both I and II , naive high-valuation consumers (HN )
select the refundable tariff, whereas sophisticated high-valuation consumers (HS ) select the
non-refundable tariff. Naivet´ e, therefore, leads to overinsurance. The two equilibria differ
because in I all types (except type HN ) select the non-refundable tariff, whereas in II
type LN does not buy in equilibrium; in this latter case, therefore, the market is not fully
covered. The non-refundable tariff in I that induces LN types to buy (those with the lowest


                                              9
reservation price for the non-refundable price) is lower than the non-refundable tariff in II ;
consequently, the refundable tariff in I is lower than the refundable tariff in II, in order for
the incentive compatibility constraint of type HN to be satisfied.
    Candidate equilibria in the second group do not include naivet´    e-based discrimination.
Equilibrium III corresponds to the case where all types select the refundable tariff. In equi-
librium IV , the firm offers only the refundable tariff, which H consumers (both sophisticated
and naive) purchase.
    Proposition 1 expresses the conditions that make each of the two configurations exhibiting
naivet´
      e-based discrimination the optimal one.

Proposition 1 Define mI as the solution to g ( )u(vH - mI ) = g ( )u(vH - cLN ) + (1 -
g ( ))u(-cLN ) and mII as the solution to u(vH - mII ) = g ( )u(vH - vL ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-vL ).

                                        vL (NH + NL ) vH NH - vL (NH + NL )

holds when configuration I guarantees higher expected profits than configuration II . The
left-hand side of the inequality is always positive because vL > cLN and mII > mI (the
latter inequality derives from the binding incentive-compatibility constraints). The right-
hand side term is negative for sufficiently high values of  , and declines with NL . The intuition
for this result is that serving naive low-valuation types (which requires low refundable and
non-refundable tariffs) is convenient only if the number of these consumers, NL (1 -  ), is
sufficiently high.
     Suppose now that configuration I dominates II . To be the equilibrium, this menu must
yield higher profits than III and IV as well. This is the case if (9) holds. If instead II
entails higher expected profits than I , the configuration is preferable to III and IV if (10)
holds.7

4.3     Welfare implications
Does the presence of naive consumers, and their consideration in a firm's pricing strategy,
have welfare implications? In this section we show that naivet´     e-based price discrimination
can be welfare-enhancing. In our setting, serving all customers is socially efficient because all
valuations are higher than marginal cost. If naivet´   e-based discrimination increases market
coverage, then social welfare increases, consistently with standard results from models of
price discrimination (Schmalensee, 1981; Katz, 1983). We show, in addition, that both the
firm and each type of consumers are (weakly) better off in this case. Therefore, not only can
naivet´e-based discrimination be welfare-maximizing (see for example Heidhues and K        oszegi
(2017)); it can also be Pareto-improving.
    When naivet´  e-based discrimination does not affect total welfare, it has redistributionary
effects; the firm is better off, naive types are (weakly) worse off, and sophisticated types are
(weakly) better off. Introducing naive consumers in the market makes sophisticated types
(weakly) better off, but this does not imply that naive consumers are necessarily exploited,
as in the case of Eliaz and Spiegler (2008) or Heidhues and K    oszegi (2010). Consider these
two results:
   · Suppose that vH NH > vL (NH + NL ). If the menu choice is restricted to cases without
     naivet´e-based discrimination (configurations III and IV ), in equilibrium for   1
     only high-valuation types are served, and pay a price (approximately) equal to vH . In
     this case, the market is not fully covered, and the utility of low-valuation types is zero.
     With (profitable) naivet´e-based discrimination, the naive high-valuation types pay mII
     or mI , both lower than vH . The sophisticated types are better off because vL < vH (or
     cLN < vH ). Low-valuation types are indifferent under configuration II , whereas the
     sophisticated low-valuation types enjoy a rent under configuration I because cLN < vL .
     Intuitively, naivet´
                        e-based price discrimination leads to a partial form of screening that
     allows the firm to treat naive high types differently from low types, while serving also
     the latter in equilibrium (at least the sophisticated ones). This possibility hinges upon
     the fact that consumers with a higher willingness to pay are more affected by the
     distortion in the perception of the cancellation risk. Therefore our results depends
     crucially on preference heterogeneity.

   · Now consider vH NH < vL (NH + NL ). Absent naivet´     e-based discrimination, the market
     is fully covered in equilibrium, with all consumers (approximately) paying vL . If naivet´
                                                                                              e-
     based discrimination is considered (and profitable), a NH type ends up paying mII (or
Configuration II is the equilibrium if  = 0.95, NH = 200 and NL = 10; while it is configuration I to be the
equilibrium for  = 0.7, NH = 170 and NL = 50.

                                                    11
        mI ), which are both higher than vL : therefore, he is worse off. The HS type is indifferent
        under configuration II , while she is better off under configuration I . As in the previous
        case, low types are indifferent under configuration II , while the sophisticated low type
        obtains a rent under configuration I .


4.4       Risk aversion vs belief distortion
As long as the probability of cancellation remains strictly positive, standard risk aversion can
generate positive cancellation premia. In this section we show, however, that for reasonable
parameters values, the magnitude of these premia as the arrival date approaches is too small
as compared to what we observe in the data. Our results are therefore consistent with
well-established "calibration theorems" (Rabin, 2000).
                                                                                      -p
    Let us express the utility of consumers with the function u(v - p) = log(1 + vk      ), where
k is a positive constant. A log utility function implies a coefficient of relative risk aversion
equal to 1, in line with recent empirical estimates (Chetty, 2006; Hartley et al., 2014).
    We set valuations in a monetary range compatible with four-stars hotels in our sample,
i.e. vH = 250 and vL = 200. The value of k identifies the contribution that the surplus from
service consumption can have on individuals's wealth. We assume k = 10000; with initial
wealth normalized to 1, this sets an upper bound of 2.5% for this contribution. As for the
                                                                                  
choice of g ( ), we compare biased and unbiased beliefs. We define g ( ) =              1 , where
                                                                                        (  +(1- ) ) 
  1, for consumers with biased beliefs (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992).8 Following Wu and
Gonzalez (1996), we set  = 0.71. For the case with unbiased beliefs, g ( ) = 1. Finally, we
focus on equilibrium configuration II.
    Detailed evidence for cancellation probabilities in the hotel industry is limited, because
this information is only available from proprietary data. One of the few papers providing
estimates is Falk and Vieru (2018), which looks at cancellation risk using individual book-
ings data from the booking system of nine hotels in a Finnish chain. The study reports a
probability of cancellation that is 2.9 % for bookings made between 1 and 4 days before a
stay, 4.8% for bookings between 5 and 9 days and 11% for bookings between 10 and 24 days.
Cho et al. (2018) report probabilities of cancellation as a function of days prior to arrival.
These range from under 0.5% (40 days prior to arrival) to a peak of 1.4% a few days before
check-in. The values are comparable to Falk and Vieru (2018). We thus focus on values of
 from 0.9 to 0.97. In this interval, the absolute risk premium ranges from 53.53 to 25.28
when beliefs are biased, but,absent probability overweighting, from only 25.28 to 7.59. The
  8
      g ( ) is inconsistent with the assumption lim g ( ) = 1. However, this in inconsequential because in this
                                                 1
Section we consider   0.97.


                                                       12
estimated premium for French four-stars hotels in our sample is never lower than 25 Euros; it
falls slightly below 20 pounds immediately before the check-in date in the UK. In addition,
the ratio between the premium at  = 0.9 and  = 0.97 is 2.12 with biased beliefs and
3.33 without bias (risk aversion only), thus implying a lower convergence of refundable and
non-refundable prices in the latter case.9

5       Conclusions
We find systematic evidence of the persistence of an insurance-like premium for the option to
cancel a hotel reservation, of about 10% to 15% of the full price, even when the uncertainty
about the fruition of a room is likely to be minimal, i.e., in the proximity of the check-in
date. The patterns and the estimated size of the premia relate closely to a model where firms
adopt pricing strategies with menus that sort customers depending both on their valuation
of a good and on whether they estimate correctly or overestimate the likelihood of having
to cancel. Under certain conditions, equilibrium strategies sort consumers based on their
degree of sophistication and exploit naive consumers, i.e., deliver lower utility to them as
compared to a situation where naivet´     e-based discrimination is not implemented. However,
menu pricing can also benefit this type of customers, because it may expand the market
and serve types of clients that might be left out with different pricing schemes that do not
consider the behavioral aspects we highlight in our study.
    There are several other relevant markets where there is a time lag between the purchase of
a good or service and its fruition, and where contingencies can preclude fruition at the estab-
lished date. Examples include travel, entertainment and sport events, as well as any market
where consumers order a good rather than purchase it in person, and have the good delivered
at a later date. It is likely that in all these different markets, perhaps with different preva-
lence, consumers differ in their attitudes toward uncertainty and the possibility of losses, and
that companies take advantage of these tendencies and the heterogeneity in the population.
In addition to showing how these psychological tendencies and pricing strategies play out in
the hotel industry, we also provide a framework to assess under what circumstances menu
pricing is exploitative, redistributive, or welfare enhancing. We believe that investigating the
relevance of our approach in these other markets is a fruitful area of research.



    9
    In both cases, the rate of convergence is somewhat higher than the rate observed in the data. One way
to deal with this issue would be to extend the model, to include the additional constraint that the refundable
price at  cannot be higher than the refundable price at any subsequent period  (otherwise, customers
monitoring firm's offer would have the opportunity to cancel at  and book the same room, most often still
available, at lower price).

Notes: The graphs display the estimated values of the cancellation premium, from model (1). The regressions are separate by
stars and country. The shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals, with standard errors clustered at the hotel level. Fixed
effects combine hotel, check-in date, room type, number of allowed guests, and breakfast inclusion. The number of observations
from 2, 3, 4, and 5-stars hotels are, respectively, 63, 324; 319, 623; 1, 709, 202; 315, 288 in France, and 46, 888; 770, 904; 1, 663, 163;
259, 056 in the UK. R2 values range from 0.81 - 0.88 in France, and 0.85 - 0.88 in the UK. Values are in Euros (France) and
Sterling (UK).

Notes: The regressions are separate by stars and country. The shaded areas indicate 95% confidence intervals, with standard
errors clustered at the hotel level. Fixed effects combine hotel, check-in date, room type, number of allowed guests, and breakfast
inclusion. The number of observations from 2, 3, 4, and 5-stars hotels are, respectively, 126, 648; 639, 246; 3, 418, 404; 630, 576
in France, and 93, 776; 1, 541, 808; 3, 326, 326; 518, 112 in the UK. R2 values range from 0.96 - 0.98 in France, and 0.93 - 0.97

C      Solving the model
In this Appendix, we fully characterize the solution of the model, which leads to Proposition
1 in the paper.


C.1     The optimal tariff menu: the general case
In general, the firm can offer three typologies of menus: i) a menu in which both the re-
fundable and the non-refundable tariffs are chosen in equilibrium by at least a type         
{LS, LN, HS, HN }; ii) a menu such that only the refundable tariff is chosen; or iii) a menu
with only the non-refundable tariff being selected. For each consumer type to buy in equi-
librium, their participation (P C ) and incentive compatibility (IC ) constraints must hold.
    The following lemmas simplify the firm's profit maximization problem:

Lemma 1 Suppose that P C is satisfied for a type  selecting pN R . Then IC implies P C
for all types  displaying c > c .
             NR                                     NR
Proof If U       0, then c  pN R . It follows that U    0 because c > c  pN R . If type
                     R     NR
 selects pR , then U  U  0.

Lemma 2 Suppose that type S ( = L, H ) selects pR . Then type N selects pR as well.

                                                   R   NR      NR   R
Proof The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that US  US  and UN   UN . The two
conditions can be re-written as:

                    [u(v - pN R ) - u(v - pR ) - u(-pN R )]  -u(-pN R )



                 g ( ) [u(vL - pN R ) - u(v - pR ) - u(-pN R )]  -u(-pN R ).

    Because  > g ( ), the two inequalities are incompatible.

Lemma 3 Suppose that type LS (LN ) selects pR . Then type HS (HN ) selects pR as well.
Proof Let us consider the case of sophisticated types first. The proof is by contradiction.
              R     NR        NR      R
Suppose that ULS  ULS   and UHS    UHS  .The two conditions can be re-written as

                      [u(v - pN R ) - u(vL - pR )]  -(1 -  )u(-pN R )



                     [u(vH - pN R ) - u(vH - pR )]  -(1 -  )u(-pN R ).

                                             27
Due to concavity of u(), u(vH - pN R ) - u(vH - pR ) < u(vL - pN R ) - u(vL - pR ).Therefore,
the two inequalities are incompatible. The proof for naive types is obtained substituting g ( )
to .

    Lemma 1 shows that the reservation price for non-refundable tariff identifies an ordering
over type exclusion when such a tariff is part of the equilibrium menu: if type  is served
in equilibrium, then all types  for which c > c must also be served. Lemmas 2 and 3
derive from the fact the attractiveness of refundable tariffs is higher for those customers who
have more to gain to get insured, because they have a higher (subjective) probability of not
enjoying the service (Lemma 2) or they have a higher valuation for it (Lemma 3).
    In the first group of equilibrium configurations, where each tariff is chosen by at least one
type, Lemmas 1-3 implies that there are six configurations to consider. For each configura-
tion, we can determine the candidate equilibrium tariffs by setting p     N R equal to the lowest
reservation price for types selecting such a tariff, and pR such that the incentive compatibility
constraints of types selecting in equilibrium such a tariff hold, with at least one of them with
an equality sign.
    We summarize the candidate equilibrium tariffs in the following propositions:

Proposition 2 Suppose HS , HL and LN select the refundable tariff and LS selects the
non-refundable tariff (configuration 1). Then p                
                                                N R = cLS and pR = vL . The firm's expected
profit is vL  (NH + NL (1 -  )) + cLS NL .
Proof The eight constraints for expected profit maximization problem are:

        u(vH - pR )  u(vH - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )                         (ICHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )            (ICHN )
        g ( )u(vL - pR )  g ( )u(vL - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )            (ICLN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vL - pR )                          (ICLS )
        u(vH - pR )  0                                                         (P CHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  0                                                    (P CHN )
        g ( )u(vL - pR )  0                                                    (P CLN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  0                                    (P CLS )

P CLN implies P CHS , P CHN and P CLS as from Lemma 1, whereas ICHS implies ICHN
following 2. P CLN is binding when pR = vL . We ignore IC HS for now. pR = vL implies
that ICLS is satisfied if pN R  cLS . If this constraint is binding, then ICLN holds because




                                               28
cLS  cLN . Finally, if we substitute pR = vL and pN R = cLS into ICHS we obtain

                      u(vH - vL )  u(vH - cLS ) + (1 -  )u(-cLS ),

which always holds because cLS < vL .

Proposition 3 Suppose HS and HN select the refundable tariff and LS and LN select the
non-refundable tariff (configuration 2). Then p                  
                                                 N R = cLN and pR = m2 where m2 is the
solution of u(vH - m2 ) = u(vH - cLN ) + (1 -  )u(-cLN ). The firm's expected profit is
m2 NH + cLN NL .
Proof The eight constraints of the expected profit maximization program are:

        u(vH - pR )  u(vH - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )                    (ICHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )      (ICHN )
        g ( )u(vL - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )  g ( )u(vL - pR )      (ICLN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vL - pR )                    (ICLS )
        u(vH - pR )  0                                                   (P CHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  0                                              (P CHN )
        g ( )u(vL - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R  0                       (P CLN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  0                              (P CLS )

P CLN implies P CHS , P CHN and P CLS following Lemma 1; ICHS implies ICHN as per
Lemma 2. P CLN is binding for pN R = cLN . For pR = m2 , ICHS is binding. Because

                     u(vH - vL ) > u(vH - cLN ) + (1 -  )u(-cLN ),

it follows that m2 > vL , which implies that ICLS and ICLN hold.

Proposition 4 Suppose HS and HN select the refundable tariff, LS selects the non-refundable
tariff and LN does not buy (configuration 3). Then pN R = cLS and pR = m3 where m3 is
the solution of u(vH - m3 ) = u(vH - cLS ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-cLS ). The firm's expected profit
is m3 NH + cLS NL .




                                             29
Proof These are the six constraints for the expected profit maximization problem in this case:

        u(vH - pR )  u(vH - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )                       (ICHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )         (ICHN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vL - pR )                       (ICLS )
        u(vH - pR )  0                                                      (P CHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  0                                                 (P CHN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  0                                 (P CLS )

P CLS implies P CHS and P CHN (Lemma 1), and ICHS implies ICHN as per Lemma 2.
P CLS is binding for pN R = cLS . For pR = m3 , ICHS is binding. Moreover, because the
following inequality holds:

                      u(vH - vL ) > u(vH - cLN ) + (1 -  )u(-cLN ),

it follows that m3 > vL , and therefore ICLS is verified. Finally, we observe that LN types
would obtain a negative expected utility both from the refundable tariff (since m3 > vL ) and
the non-refundable tariff (since cLS > cLN ).

Proposition 5 Suppose HN selects the refundable tariff and HS , LS and LN select the
non-refundable tariff (configuration 4). Then, p                  
                                                 N R = cLN and pR = m4 where m4 is the
solution of g ( )u(vH - m4 ) = g ( )u(vH - cLN ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-cLN ). The expected profit is
m4  (1 -  )NH + cLN (NH + NL ).
Proof The eight constraints for expected profit maximization are the following;

        u(vH - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vH - pR )                       (ICHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )         (ICHN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vL - pR )                       (ICLS )
        g ( )u(vL - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )  g ( )u(vL - pR )         (ICLN )
        u(vH - pR )  0                                                      (P CHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )  0                        (P CHN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  0                                 (P CLS )
        g ( )u(vL - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )  0                        (P CLN )

P CLN implies that all the other participation constraints hold, as per Lemma 1. P CLN is


                                             30
binding for pN R = cLN . For pR = m4 , ICHL is binding. ICHL can be re-written as

                 g ( ) [u(vH - cLN ) - u(vH - mf ) - u(-cLN )] = -u(-cLN ),

which implies:

                   [u(vH - cLN ) - u(vH - mf ) - u(-cLN )] < -u(-cLN ),

from which ICHS follows. Because

                    g ( )u(vH - vL ) > u(vH - cLN ) + (1 -  )u(-cLN ),

then m4 > vL . It follows that ICLS and ICLN are verified, too.

Proposition 6 Suppose HN selects the refundable tariff, HS and LS select the non-refundable
tariff and LN does not buy (configuration 5). Then, p                  
                                                      N R = cLS and pR = m5 where m5 is
the solution of u(vH - mh ) = g ( )u(vH - cLS ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-cLS ).Firm expected profit is
m5  (NH (1 -  )) + cLS  (NH + NL ).
Proof The six constraints for expected profit maximization are:

        u(vH - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vH - pR )                     (ICHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )           (ICHN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vL - pR )                         (ICLS )
        u(vH - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  0                                   (P CHS )
        g ( )u(vH - pR )  0                                                   (P CHN )
        u(vL - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  0                                   (P CLS )

From Lemma 1, P CLS implies P CHS . P CLS is binding for pN R = cLS . For pR = m5 , ICHL
is binding. We can rewrite ICHL as

                 g ( ) [u(vH - cLS ) - u(vH - mh ) - u(-cLS )] = -u(-cLS ),

which implies:

                    [u(vH - cLN ) - u(vH - mh ) - u(-cLN )] > -u(-cL ),




                                             31
from which ICHS follows. Because the following inequality holds:

                     g ( )u(vH - vL ) > u(vH - cLN ) + (1 -  )u(-cLN ),

then m5 > vL , so ICLS is verified. Finally, note that LN would derive a negative expected
utility both from the refundable tariff (m5 > vL ) and from the non-refundable tariff because
cLS > cLN .

Proposition 7 Suppose HN selects a refundable tariff, HS selects a non-refundable tariff
and LS and LN do not buy (configuration 6). Then p                   
                                                    N R = cHS and pR = vH , and the firm's
expected profit is vH  (1 -  )NH + cHS NH .
Proof The four constraints for expected profit maximization are the following:

            u(vH - pN R ) + (1 -  )u(-pN R )  u(vH - pR )               (ICHS )
            g ( )u(vH - pR )  g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R ) (ICHS )
            u(vH - pR )  0                                              (P CHS )
            g ( )u(vH - pN R ) + (1 - g ( ))u(-pN R )  0                (P CHN )

Suppose that both participation constraints are binding. Then ICHS is also binding and
ICHN is satisfied. Finally, note that both LN and LS would derive a negative expected
utility both from the refundable tariff (because vH > vL ) and the non-refundable tariff because
cHS > cLS > cLN .

    In the second group of configurations, customers choose only the refundable tariff. In this
case, the participation constraints do not depend on the degree of sophistication (because
  S,R                 N,R
U       0 implies U        0 and vice versa). It follows that the candidate equilibrium
tariffs are determined by fixing to refundable tariff equal to the lowest valuation among the
customers served by the firm. This leads to the following Propositions.

Proposition 8 Suppose HS , HL, LS and LN select the refundable tariff (configuration
7). Then, p                   
           N R = p > cHS and pR = vL . The firm's expected profit is vL (NH + NL ).


Proposition 9 Suppose HS and HN select the refundable tariff and LS and LN do not buy
(configuration 8). Then, p                   
                          N R = p > cLS and pR = vH . The firm's expected profit is vH NH .


    Finally, in the third group of configurations, only the non-refundable tariff is chosen. In
this case, given Lemma 1 above, the candidate equilibrium tariffs are determined by fixing
to non-refundable tariff equal to the lowest reservation price among the customers served by
the firm. Therefore, we can derive the following Propositions:

                                              32
Proposition 10 Suppose HS , HL, LS and LN select the non-refundable tariff (configura-
tion 9). Then p                        H
               N R = cLN and pR = p > v .Firm expected profit is cLS (NH + NL ).


Proposition 11 Suppose HS, HL and LS select the non-refundable tariff (configuration 10).
Then p                        H
      N R = cLS and pR = p > v . Firm expected profit iscLS (NH + NL ).


Proposition 12 Suppose HS , HN and LS select the non-refundable tariff and LN does not
buy (configuration 11). Then p                        H
                              N R = cHN and pR = p > v . Firm expected profit is cHN NH .


Proposition 13 Suppose HS selects the non-refundable tariff and HL, LS and LN do not
buy. (configuration 12). Then p                        H
                               N R = cHS and pR = p > v . Firm expected profit is cHS NH .




   Based on expected profit comparison, the following Proposition shows that we can restrict
our attention to seven candidate equilibria.

Proposition 14 The candidate equilibrium 7 always guarantees higher expected profit than
candidate equilibria 9 and 10. The candidate equilibrium 8 always guarantees higher expected
profit than candidate equilibria 6, 11 and 12.
Proof 8 dominates 6 because vH > cHS . 7 dominates 9 and 10 and 8 dominates 11 and 12
                                                       -u(-cS )
because v > cS . (7) can be re-written as  = u(v -      cS )-u(-cS )
                                                                     . Multiplying both sides by
v             v          -u(-cS )/c
c
   we obtain c = u(v -cS )-u(-cS )/v . The right term is greater than 1 because u () < 0.
v > c follows.


C.2     The optimal tariff menu: the case of   1
In this Section we provide the characterization of the equilibrium for   1. The expected
profits are summarized in table below.
     Candidate equilibrium              Expected profit
                 1                         vL (NH + NL )
                 2                        cLN (NH + NL )
                 3                        vL (NH + NL )
                 4               m4 (1 -  )NH + cLN (NH + NL )
                 5               m5 (NH (1 -  )) + vL  (NH + NL )
                 7                         vL (NH + NL )
                 8                             vH NH
    The following Proposition shows that in this case we can further restrict our attention to
five candidate equilibria only.


                                              33
Proposition 15 The candidate equilibria 1 and 7 always guarantee higher expected profits
than candidate equilibria 2 and 3 .
Proof 1 and 7 dominate 2 because vL > cLN , and 3 because  < 1.

    The five undominated equilibria can be divided in two groups. Candidate equilibria
in the first group do not implement naivet´    e-based discrimination. Candidate equilibrium
7 corresponds instead to the case where all types select the refundable tariff. Candidate
equilibrium 8 corresponds to the case where the firm offers only the refundable tariff, to be
selected by type H consumers (both sophisticated and naive). Candidate equilibria 7 and 8
correspond to configurations III and IV in the paper, respectively.
    In the second group, candidate equilibria 1, 4 and 5 do exhibit naivet´  e-based discrimina-
tion. In 1, naive low types are pooled with high types (both sophisticated and naive), and
select the refundable tariff, whereas the sophisticated low type selects the non-refundable
tariff. However, the cancellation premium p         
                                               R - pN R converges to 0 for   1, because both
p          
 R and pN R converge to vL , as in Escobari and Jindapon (2014). In this case, candidate
equilibria 1 and 7 converge to the same menu in which all consumers end up paying vL with
probability 1. For that reason, without any substantial loss in our discussion, we exclude 1
as possible global solution in the remaining analysis.
    In both 4 and 5, naive type H consumers select the refundable tariff, whereas sophisti-
cated type H consumers select the non-refundable tariff. In other words, naivet´      e leads to
overinsurance, because HN is willing to get insured, and pay a cancellation (i.e. insurance)
premium, while the sophisticated type with the same valuation is not. The two candidate
equilibria differ because in 4, all types (except type HN ) select the non-refundable tariff (so
that the market is covered), whereas in 5 type LN does not buy in equilibrium (so that the
market is not covered). The non-refundable tariff in 4 is lower than the non-refundable tariff
in 5 to induce LN (who is the type with the lowest reservation price for the non-refundable
tariff) to buy; consequently, the refundable tariff in 4 is lower than the refundable tariff in 5,
in order for the incentive compatibility constraint of type HN to hold. Candidate equilibria
4 and 5 correspond to configurations I and II in the paper, respectively. The conditions that
make each of these two configurations the optimal one are described in the main text.
