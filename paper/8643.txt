                                              ABSTRACT

        Stocks with greater downside risk, which is measured by higher correlations conditional on
downside moves of the market, have higher returns. After controlling for the market beta, the size effect
and the book-to-market effect, the average rate of return on stocks with the greatest downside risk exceeds
the average rate of return on stocks with the least downside risk by 6.55% per annum. Downside risk is
important for explaining the cross-section of expected returns. In particular, we find that some of the
profitability of investing in momentum strategies can be explained as compensation for bearing high
exposure to downside risk.

1 Introduction
We define “downside risk” to be the risk that an asset’s return is highly correlated with the
market when the market is declining. In this article, we show that there are systematic variations
in the cross-section of stock returns that is linked to downside risk. Stocks with higher downside
risk have higher expected returns, than returns that can be explained by the market beta, the size
effect and the book-to-market effect. In particular, we find that high returns associated with the
momentum strategies (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993) are sensitive to the fluctuations in downside
risk.
    Markowitz (1959) raises the possibility that agents care about downside risk, rather than
about the market risk. He advises constructing portfolios based on semi-variances, rather
than on variances, since semi-variances weight upside risk (gains) and downside risk (losses)
differently. In Kahneman and Tversky (1979)’s loss aversion and Gul (1991)’s first-order risk
aversion utility, losses are weighted more heavily than gains in an investor’s utility function.
If investors dislike downside risk, then an asset with greater downside risk is not as desirable
as, and should have a higher expected return than, an asset with lower downside risk. We find
that stocks with highly correlated movements on the downside have higher expected returns.
The portfolio of greatest downside risk stocks outperforms the portfolio of lowest downside
risk stocks by 4.91% per annum. After controlling for the market beta, the size effect and the
book-to-market effect, the greatest downside risk portfolio outperforms the lowest downside
risk portfolio by 6.55% per annum.
    It is not surprising that higher-order moments play a role in explaining the cross-sectional
variation of returns. However, which higher-order moments are important for cross-sectional
pricing is still a subject of debate. Unlike traditional measures of centered higher-order
moments, our downside risk measure emphasizes the asymmetric effect of risk across upside
and downside movements (Ang and Chen, 2001). We find little discernable pattern in the
expected returns of stocks ranked by third-order moments (Rubinstein, 1973; Kraus and
Litzenberger, 1976; Harvey and Siddique, 2000), by fourth-order moments (Dittmar, 2001)
by downside betas, or by upside betas (Bawa and Lindenberg, 1977).
    We find that the profitability of the momentum strategies is related to downside risk. While
Fama and French (1996) and Grundy and Martin (2001) find that controlling for the market, the
size effect, and the book-to-market effect increases the profitability of momentum strategies,
rather than explaining it, the momentum portfolios load positively on a factor that reflects
downside risk. A linear two-factor model with the market and this downside risk factor explains
some of the cross-sectional return variations among momentum portfolios. The downside risk


                                                1
factor commands a significantly positive risk premium in both Fama-MacBeth (1973) and
Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimations and retains its statistical significance
when the Fama-French factors are added. Although our linear factor models with downside
risk are rejected using the Hansen-Jagannathan (1997) distance metric, our results suggest that
some portion of momentum profits can be attributed as compensation for exposures to downside
risk. Past winner stocks have high returns, in part, because during periods when the market
experiences downside moves, winner stocks move down more with the market than past loser
stocks.
       Existing explanations of the momentum effect are largely behavioral in nature and use
models with imperfect formation and updating of investors’ expectations in response to new
information (Barberis, Shleifer and Vishny, 1998; Daniel, Hirshleifer and Subrahmanyam,
1998; Hong and Stein, 1999). These explanations rely on the assumption that arbitrage
is limited, so that arbitrageurs cannot eliminate the apparent profitability of momentum
strategies. Mispricing may persist because arbitrageurs need to bear factor risk, and risk-averse
arbitrageurs demand compensation for accepting such risk (Hirshleifer, 2001). In particular,
Jegadeesh and Titman (2001) show that momentum has persisted since its discovery. We show
that momentum strategies have high exposures to a systematic downside risk factor.
       Our findings are closely related to Harvey and Siddique (2000), who argue that skewness is
priced, and show that momentum strategies are negatively skewed. In our data sample, we fail
to find any pattern relating past skewness to expected returns. DeBondt and Thaler (1987) find
that past winner stocks have greater downside betas than upside betas. Though the profitability
of momentum strategies is related to asymmetries in risk, we find little systematic effect in the
cross-section of expected returns relating to downside betas. Instead, we find that it is downside
correlation which is priced.
       While Chordia and Shivakumar (2000) try to account for momentum with a factor model
where the factor betas vary over time as a linear function of instrumental variables, they do not
estimate this model with cross-sectional methods. Ahn, Conrad and Dittmar (2001) find that
imposing these constraints reduces the profitability of momentum strategies. Ghysels (1998)
also argues against time-varying beta models, showing that linear factor models with constant
risk premia, like the models we estimate, perform better in small samples. Hodrick and Zhang
(2001) also find that models that allow betas to be a function of business cycle instruments
perform poorly, and they find substantial instabilities in such models.1
   1
       An alternative non-behavioral explanation for momentum is proposed by Conrad and Kaul (1998), who argue
that the momentum effect is due to cross-sectional variations in (constant) expected returns. Jegadeesh and Titman
(2001) reject this explanation.


                                                        2
   Our research design follows the custom of constructing and adding factors to explain
deviations from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). However, this approach does not
speak to the source of factor risk premia. Although we design our factor to measure an
economically meaningful concept of downside risk, our goal is not to present a theoretical
model that explains how downside risk arises in equilibrium. Our goal is to test whether
a part of the factor structure in stock returns is attributable to downside risk. Other authors
use factors which reflect the size and the book-to-market effects (Fama and French, 1993 and
1996), macroeconomic factors (Chen, Roll and Ross, 1986), production factors (Cochrane,
1996), labor income (Jagannathan and Wang, 1996), market microstructure factors like volume
(Gervais, Kaniel and Mingelgrin, 2001) or liquidity (Pástor and Stambaugh, 2001) and factors
motivated from corporate finance theory (Lamont, Polk and Saá-Requejo, 2001). Momentum
strategies do not load very positively on any of these factors, nor do any these approaches use a
factor which reflects downside risk.
   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 investigates the relationship between
past higher-order moments and expected returns. We show that portfolios sorted by increasing
downside correlations have increasing expected returns. On the other hand, portfolios sorted by
other higher moments do not display any discernable pattern in their expected returns. Section
3 details the construction of our downside risk factor, shows that it commands an economically
significant risk premium, and show that it is not subsumed by the Fama and French (1993)
factors. We apply the downside risk factor to price the momentum portfolios in Section 4 and
find that the downside risk factor is significantly priced by the momentum portfolios. Section 5
studies the relation between downside risk and liquidity risk, and explores if the downside risk
factor reflects information about future macroeconomic conditions. Section 6 concludes.


2 Higher-Order Moments and Expected Returns
Economic theory predicts that the expected return of an asset is linked to the higher-order
moments of the asset’s return through the preferences of a marginal investor. The standard
Euler equation in an arbitrage-free economy is:

   We show in Section 2.1 that there is a positive relation between downside risk and expected
returns. Stocks with high downside conditional correlations, which condition on moves of
the market below its mean, have higher returns than stocks with low downside conditional
correlations. However, there is no reward nor cost for bearing risk on the upside. In Section 2.2
we show that stocks sorted by other higher-order moments have no discernable patterns in their
expected returns. We also show that stocks sorted by conditional downside or upside betas have
little discernable patterns in Section 2.3. We provide an interpretation of our results in Section
2.4.


2.1    Downside and Upside Correlations
In Table (1), we show that stocks with high downside risk with the market have higher expected
returns than stocks with low downside risk. We measure downside risk and  upside risk by
downside conditional correlations,                   >@? , and upside conditional correlations, > , respectively.
We define these conditional correlations as:

excess market return.
      To ensure that we do not capture the endogenous influence of contemporaneously high
returns on higher-order moments, we form portfolios sorted by past return characteristics and
                                                      stocks based on downside and upside
examine portfolio returns over a future period. To sort
correlations at a point in time, we calculate >            ? and >   using daily continuously compounded
excess returns over the previous year. We first rank stocks into deciles, and then we calculate
the holding period return over the next month of the value-weighted portfolio of stocks in each
decile. We rebalance these portfolios each month. Appendix A provides further details on
portfolio construction.
        
      Panels A and B of Table (1) list monthly summary statistics of the portfolios sorted by >                ?
and   > , respectively. We first examine the > ? portfolios in Panel A. The first column lists
the mean monthly holding period returns of each decile portfolio. Stocks with the highest
past downside correlations have the highest returns. In contrast, stocks with the lowest past
downside correlations have the lowest returns. Going from portfolio 1, which is the portfolio
of lowest downside correlations, to portfolio 10 which is the portfolio of highest downside
correlations, the average return almost monotonically increases. The return differential between
the portfolios of the highest decile >      ? stocks and the lowest decile > ? stocks is 4.91% per annum
(0.40% per month). This difference is statistically significant at the 5% level (t-stat = 2.26),
using Newey-West (1987) standard errors with 3 lags.
      The remaining columns list other characteristics of the              > ? portfolios. The portfolio of
highest downside correlation stocks have the lowest autocorrelations, at almost zero, but they
also have the highest betas. Since the CAPM predicts that high beta stocks should have high
expected returns, we investigate in Section 3 if the high returns of high >          ? stocks are attributable
to the high betas (which are computed post-formation of the portfolios). However, high returns
of high > ? stocks do not appear to be due to the size effect or the book-to-market effect. The
columns labeled “Size” and “B/M” show that high > ? stocks tend to be large stocks and growth
stocks. Size and book-to-market effects would predict high > ? stocks to have low returns rather
than high returns.
      The second to last column calculates the post-formation conditional downside correlation
of each decile portfolio, over the whole sample. These post-formation >                 ? are monotonically
increasing, which indicates that the top decile portfolio, formed by taking stocks with the
highest conditional downside correlation over the past year, is the portfolio with the highest
downside correlation over the whole sample. This implies that using past >              ? is a good predictor
of future >      ? and that downside correlations are persistent.

returns.
    In summary, Table (1) shows that assets with higher downside correlations have higher
returns. This result is consistent with models in which the marginal investor is more risk-averse
on the downside than on the upside, and demand higher expected returns for bearing higher
downside risk.


2.2       Coskewness and Cokurtosis
Table (2) shows that stocks sorted by past coskewness and past cokurtosis do not produce any
discernable patterns in their expected returns. Following Harvey and Siddique (2000), we define
coskewness as:
                                                                         IKJ    J6   

contemporaneous excess market return, and        is the residual from the regression of the market

    Similar to the definition of coskewness in equation (5), we define cokurtosis as:
                                                                        IOJ H  J   

                                                                        6
We compute coskewness in equation (5) and cokurtosis in equation (6) using daily data over the
past year. Appendix B shows that calculating daily coskewness and cokurtosis is equivalent to
calculating monthly, or any other frequency, coskewness and cokurtosis.
   Panel A of Table (2) lists the characteristics of stocks sorted by past coskewness. Like
Harvey and Siddique (2000), we find that stocks with more negative coskewness have higher
returns. However, the difference between the first and the tenth decile is only 1.79% per annum,
which is not significant at the 5% level (t-stat = 1.17). Stocks with large negative coskewness
tend to have higher betas and there is little pattern in post-formation unconditional coskewness.
Panel B of Table (2) lists summary statistics for portfolios sorted by cokurtosis. In summary,
we do not find any statistically significant reward for bearing cokurtosis risk.
   We also perform (but do not report) sorts on skewness and kurtosis. We find that portfolios
sorted on past skewness do have statistically significant pattern in expected returns, but the
pattern is the opposite of that predicted by an investor with an Arrow-Pratt utility. Specifically,
stocks with the most negative skewness have the lowest average returns. Moreover, skewness
is not persistent in that stocks with high past skewness do not necessarily have high skewness
in the future. Finally, we find that stocks sorted by kurtosis have no patterns in their expected
returns.


2.3    Downside and Upside Betas
In Table (3), we sort stocks on the unconditional beta, the downside beta and the upside beta.
Confirming many previous studies, Panel A shows that the beta does not explain the cross-
section of stock returns. There is no pattern across the expected returns of the portfolio of stocks
formed by past F . The column labeled F shows that the portfolios constructed by ranking stocks
on past beta retain their beta-rankings in the post-formation period.
   Panel B of Table (3) reports the summary statistics of stocks sorted by the downside beta,
F ? . There is a weakly increasing, but mostly humped-shaped pattern in the expected returns of
 the F ? portfolios. However, the difference in the returns is not statistically significant. This is
in contrast to the strong monotonic pattern we find across the expected returns of stocks sorted
by downside correlation.
   Both the downside beta and the downside correlation measure how an asset’s return moves
relative to the market’s return, conditional on downside moves of the market. In order to analyze
why the two measures produce different results, we perform the following decomposition. The
downside beta is a function of the downside correlation and a ratio of the portfolio’s downside

      The columns labeled                   F ? and > ? list summary post-formation F ? and > ? statistics of the
decile portfolios over the whole sample. While Panel B of Table (3) shows that the post-
formation F_? is monotonic for the F_? portfolios, this can be decomposed into non-monotonic
effects for >? and \ ? . The downside correlation > ? increases and then decreases moving from
the portfolio 1 to 10, while \ ? decreases and then increases. The hump-shape in expected
returns largely mirrors the hump-shape pattern in downside correlation. The two different
effects of > ? and \ ? make expected return patterns in F ? harder to detect than expected return
patterns in > ? . In an unreported result, we find that portfolios of stocks sorted by \ ? produce
no discernable pattern in expected returns.
      In contrast, Table (1) shows that portfolios sorted by increasing                                                      > ? have no pattern in
downside betas. Hence, variation in the expected returns of F                                               ? portfolios is likely to be driven
by their exposure to >                 ? . This observation is consistent with Ang and Chen (2001) who show
that variations in downside beta are largely driven by variations in downside correlation. We
find that sorting on downside correlation produces greater variations in returns than sorting on
downside beta.                                                                                                                                             

2.4        Summary and Interpretation
Stocks sorted by increasing downside risk, measured by conditional downside correlations,
have increasing expected returns. Portfolios sorted by other centered higher-order moments
(coskewness and cokurtosis) have little discernable patterns in returns. If a marginal investor
dislikes downside risk, why would the premium for bearing downside risk only appear in
portfolio sorts by               > ? , and not in other moments capturing left-hand tail exposure such as
co-skewness? If the marginal investor’s utility is kinked, skewness and other odd-centered

                                                                                 8
moments may not effectively capture the asymmetric effect of risk across upside and downside
moves. On the other hand, downside correlation is a complicated function of many higher-
ordered moments, including skewness, and therefore, downside correlation might serve as a
better proxy for downside risk. Although we calculate our measure conditional at a point in
time and conditional on the mean market return at that time, the emphasis of the conditional
downside correlation is on the asymmetry across the upside market moves and the downside
market moves.
   Downside correlation measures risk asymmetry and produces strong patterns in expected
returns. However, portfolios formed by other measures of asymmetric risk, such as downside
beta, do not produce strong cross-sectional differences in expected returns. One statistical
reason is that downside beta involves downside correlation, plus a multiplicative effect from the
ratios of volatilities, which masks the effect of downside risk. Second, while the beta measures
comovements in both the direction and the magnitude of an asset return and the market return,
correlations are scaled to emphasize the comovements in only direction. Hence, our results
suggest that while agents care about downside risk (a magnitude and direction effect), economic
constraints which bind only on the downside (a direction effect only) are also important in
producing the observed downside risk. For example, Chen, Hong and Stein (2001) examine
binding short-sales constraints where the effect of a short sale constraint is a fixed cost rather
than a proportional cost. Similarly, Kyle and Xiong (2001)’s wealth constraints only bind on
the downside.


3 A Downside Correlation Factor
In this section, we construct a downside risk factor that captures the return premium between
stocks with high downside correlations and low downside correlations. First, in Section 3.1,
we show that the Fama-French (1993) model does not explain the cross-sectional variation
in the returns of portfolios formed by sorting on downside correlations. Second, Section 3.2
details the construction of the downside correlation factor, which we call the CMC factor. We
construct the CMC factor by going short stocks with low downside correlations, which have
low expected returns, and going long stocks with high downside correlations, which have high
expected returns. Finally, we show in Section 3.3 that the CMC factor does proxy for downside
correlation risk by explaining the cross-sectional variations of in the returns of the ten downside
correlation portfolios.

3.1    Fama and French (1993) and the Downside Correlation Portfolios
To see if the Fama and French (1993) model can price the ten downside correlation portfolios,
we run the following time-series regression:

where SMB and HML are the two Fama and French (1993) factors representing the size
                                                                                                         c. ef         ij
effect and the book-to-market effect, respectively. The coefficients, ,                                            and         , are the factor
loadings on the market, the size factor and the book-to-market factor, respectively. We test
                                         a
the hypothesis that the                        ’s are jointly equal to zero for all ten portfolios by using the F-test
developed by Gibbons, Ross and Shanken (1989) (henceforth GRS).
   Table (4) presents the results of the regression in equation (8). We find that portfolios of
stocks with higher downside correlations have higher loadings on the market portfolio. That
is, stocks with high downside correlations tend to be stocks with high market betas, which is
consistent with the pattern of increasing betas across deciles 1-10 in Table (1). The columns
          e              i
labeled       and             show that the loadings on SMB and HML both decrease monotonically with
increasing downside correlations. These results are also consistent with the characteristics listed
in Table (1), where the highest downside risk stocks tend to be large stocks and growth stocks.
Table (4) suggests that the Fama-French factors do not explain the returns on the downside risk
portfolios since the relations between >                    ? and the factors go in the opposite direction than what
the Fama-French model requires. In particular, stocks with high downside risk have the lowest
loadings on size and book-to-market factors.
                                                                  a
   In Table (4), the intercept coefficients,                            , represent the proportion of the decile returns left
unexplained by the regression of equation (8). The intercept coefficients increase with >                                                ? , so
that after controlling for the Fama-French factors, high downside correlation stocks still have
high expected returns. These coefficients are almost always individually significant and are
jointly significantly different from zero at the 95% confidence level using the GRS test. The
                   a
difference in                between the decile 10 portfolio and the decile 1 portfolio is 0.53% per month, or
6.55% per annum with a p-value 0.00. Hence, the variation in downside risk in the >                                               ? portfolios
is not explained by the Fama-French model. In fact, controlling for the market, the size factor
and the book-to-market factor increases the differences in the returns from 4.91% to 6.55% per
annum.
   In Panel B of Table (4), we test whether this mispricing survives when we split the sample
into two subsamples, one from Jan 64 to Dec 81 and the other from Jan 82 to Dec 99. We list the
                                   a
intercept coefficients,                  , for the two subsamples, with robust t-statistics. In both sub-samples,


                                                                         10

the difference between the         for the tenth and first decile are large and statistically significant at
the 1% level. The difference is 5.54% per annum (0.45% per month) for the earlier subsample
and 7.31% (0.59% per month) for the later subsample.


3.2    Constructing the Downside Risk Factor
Table (1) shows that portfolios with higher downside correlation have higher F ’s and Table
(4) shows that market loadings increase with downside risk. This raises the issue that the
phenomenon of increasing returns with increasing >         ? may be due to a reward for bearing higher
exposures on F , rather than for greater exposures to downside risk. To investigate this, we
perform a sort on >   ? , after controlling for F . Each month, we place half of the stocks based
on their F ’s into a low F group and the other half into a high F group. Then, within each F
group, we rank stocks based on their > ? into three groups: a low > ? group, a medium > ? group
and a high > ? group, with the cutoffs at 33.3% and 66.7%. This sorting procedure creates six
portfolios in total.
    We calculate monthly value-weighted portfolio returns for each of these 6 portfolios, and
report the summary statistics in the first panel of Table (5). Within the low F group, the average
returns increase from the low >  ? portfolio to the high > ? portfolio, with an annualized difference
of 2.40% (0.20% per month). Moving across the low F group, mean returns of the > ? portfolios
increase, while the beta remains flat at around F = 0.66. In the high F group, we observe that the
return also increases with > ? . The difference in returns of the high > ? and low > ? portfolios,
within the high F group, is 3.24% per annum (0.27% per month), with a t-statistic of 1.98.
However, the F decreases with increasing > ? . Therefore, the higher returns associated with
higher downside risk are not rewards for bearing higher market risk, but are rewards for bearing
higher downside risk.
    In Panel B of Table (5), for each >@? group, we take the simple average across the two                F
groups and create three portfolios, which we call the F -balanced >       ? portfolios. Moving from the
F -balanced low > ? portfolio to the F -balanced high > ? portfolio, mean returns monotonically
 increase with > ? . This increase is accompanied by a monotonic decrease in F from F = 0.94
 to F = 0.87. Hence F is not contributing to the downside risk effect, since within each F group
 increasing correlation is associated with decreasing F .
    We define our downside risk factor, CMC, as the returns from a zero-cost strategy of shorting
the F -balanced low >? portfolio and going long the F -balanced high > ? portfolio, rebalancing
monthly. The difference in mean returns of the F -balanced high > ? and the F -balanced low > ?



                                                     11
    is 2.80% per annum (0.23% per month) with a t-statistic of 2.35 and a p-value of 0.02.2
           Since we include all firms listed on the NYSE/AMEX and the NASDAQ, and use daily data
    to compute the higher-order moments, the impact of small illiquid firms might be a concern.
    We address this issue in two ways. First, all of our portfolios are value-weighted, which reduces
    the influence of smaller firms. Second, we perform the same sorting procedure as above, but
    exclude firms that are smaller than the tenth NYSE percentile. With this alternative procedure,
    we find that CMC is still statistically significant with an average monthly return of 0.23% and a
    t-statistic of 2.04. These checks show that our results are not biased by small firms.
           Table (6) lists the summary statistics for the CMC factor in comparison to the market,
    SMB and HML factors of Fama and French (1993), the SKS coskewness factor of Harvey and
    Siddique (2000) and the WML momentum factor of Carhart (1997). The SKS factor goes short
    stocks with negative coskewness and goes long stocks with positive coskewness. The WML
    factor is designed to capture the momentum premium, by shorting past loser stocks and going
    long past winner stocks. The construction of these other factors is detailed in Appendix A.
           Table (6) reports that the CMC factor has a monthly mean return of 0.23%, which is higher
    than the mean return of SMB (0.19% per month) and approximately two-thirds of the mean
    return of HML (0.32% per month). While the returns on CMC and HML are statistically
    significant at the 5% confidence level, the return on SMB is not statistically significant. CMC
    has a monthly volatility of 2.06%, which is lower than the volatilities of SMB (2.93%) and
    HML (2.65%). CMC also has close to zero skewness, and it is less autocorrelated (10%) than
    the Fama-French factors (17% for SMB and 20% for HML). The Harvey-Siddique SKS factor
    has a small average return per month (0.10%) and is not statistically significant. In contrast,
    the WML factor has the highest average return, over 0.90% per month. However, unlike the
    other factors, WML is constructed using equal-weighted portfolios, rather than value-weighted
    portfolios.
           We list the correlation matrix across the various factors in Panel B of Table (6). CMC has
    a slightly negative correlation with the market portfolio of –16%, a magnitude less than the
    correlation of SMB with the market (32%) and less in absolute value than the correlation of
    HML with the market (–40%). CMC is positively correlated with WML (35%). The correlation
       2
           An alternative sorting procedure is to perform independent sorts on o and prq , and take the intersections to
    be the 6 o /prq portfolios. This procedure produces a similar result, but gives an average monthly return of 0.22%
    (t-stat = 1.88), which is significant at the 10% level. This procedure produces poor dispersion on pjq because o
    and prq are highly correlated, so the independent sort places more firms in the low o /low prq and the high o /high
pjq    portfolios, than in the low o /high prq and the high o /low pjq portfolios. Our sorting procedure first controls for
o     and then sorts on prq , creating much more balanced portfolios with greater dispersion over pjq .

matrix shows that SKS and CMC have a correlation of –3%, suggesting that asymmetric
downside correlation risk has a different effect than skewness risk.
      Table (6) shows that CMC is highly negatively correlated with SMB (–64%). To allay fears
that CMC is not merely reflecting the inverse of the size effect, we examine the individual firm
composition of CMC and SMB. On average, 3660 firms are used to construct SMB each month,
of which SMB is long 2755 firms and short 905 firms.3 We find that the overlap of the firms,
that SMB is going long and CMC is going short, constitutes only 27% of the total composition
of SMB. Thus, the individual firm compositions of SMB and CMC are quite different. We
find that the high negative correlation between the two factors stems from the fact that SMB
performs poorly in the late 80’s and the 90’s, while CMC performs strongly over this period.


3.3      Pricing the Downside Correlation Portfolios
If the CMC factor successfully captures a premium for downside risk, then portfolios with
higher downside risk should have higher loadings on CMC. To confirm this, we run (but do not
report) the following time-series regression on the portfolios formed by >                     ? :
                                    `Eas,:c.           @,:t )u       u-v,dJ m 

where the coefficients            and        are loadings on the market factor and the downside risk factor
respectively. Running the regression in equation (9) shows that the loading on CMC ranges
from –1.09 for the lowest downside risk portfolio to 0.37 for the highest downside risk portfolio.
These loadings are highly statistically significant. The regression produces intercept coefficients
that are close to zero. In particular, the GRS test for the null hypothesis that these intercepts are
jointly equal to zero, fails to reject with a p-value of 0.49.
      Downside risk portfolios with low > ? have negative loadings on CMC. That is, the low > ?
portfolios are negatively correlated with the CMC factor. Since the CMC factor shorts low > ?
stocks, many of the stocks in the low > ? portfolios have short positions in the CMC factor.
Similarly, the high > ? portfolio has a postitive loading on CMC because, by construction, CMC
goes long high > ? stocks.
      When we augment the regression in equation (9) with the Fama-French factors, the intercept
               an                                                                                                6
coefficients         are smaller. However, the fit of the data is not much better, with the adjusted w                ’s
that are almost identical to the original model of around 90%. While the loadings of SMB and
HML are statistically significant, these loadings go the wrong way. Low >                      ? portfolios have high
  3
      SMB is long more firms than it is short since the breakpoints are determined using market capitalizations of
NYSE firms, even though the portfolio formation uses NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ firms.


                                                               13
loadings on SMB and HML, and the highest >             ? portfolio has almost zero loadings on SMB and
HML. However, the CMC factor loadings continue to be highly significant.
         That a CMC factor, constructed from the >    ? portfolios, explains the cross-sectional variation
across > ? portfolios is no surprise. Indeed, we would be concerned if the CMC factor could
not price the > ? portfolios. In the next section, we use the CMC factor to help price portfolios
formed on return characteristics that are not related to the construction method of CMC. This
is a much harder test to pass, since the characteristics of the base test assets are not necessarily
related to the explanatory factors.


4 Pricing the Momentum Effect
In this section, we demonstrate that our CMC factor has partial explanatory power to price the
momentum effect. We begin by presenting a series of simple time-series regressions involving
CMC and various other factors in Table (7). The dependent variable is the WML factor
developed by Carhart (1997), which captures the momentum premium. Model A of Table (7)
regresses WML onto a constant and the CMC factor. The regression of WML onto CMC has
          6
an   w        of 12%, and a significantly positive loading. In Model B, adding the market portfolio
changes little; the market loading is almost zero and insignificant. In Model C, we regress
                                                                                                   6
WML onto MKT and SKS. Neither MKT nor SKS is significant, and the adjusted                     w       of the
regression is zero. Therefore, WML returns are related to conditional downside correlations but
do not seem to be related to skewness.
         Models D and E use the Fama-French factors to price the momentum effect. Model D
regresses WML onto SMB and HML. Both SMB and HML have negative loadings, and the
                                            6
regression has a lower adjusted         w       than using the CMC factor alone in Model A. In this
regression, the SMB loading is significantly negative (t-statistic = -3.20), but when the CMC
factor is included in Model E, the loading on the Fama-French factors become insignificant,
while the CMC factor continues to have a significantly positive loading.
         In all of the regressions in Table (7), the intercept coefficients are significantly different
from zero. Compared to the unadjusted mean return of 0.90% per month, controlling for CMC
reduces the unexplained portion of returns to 0.75% per month. In contrast, controlling for SKS
doesn’t change the unexplained portion of returns and controlling for SMB and HML increases
the unexplained portion of returns to 1.05% per month. While the WML momentum factor loads
significantly onto the downside risk factor, the CMC factor alone is unlikely to completely price
the momentum effect. Nevertheless, Table (7) shows that CMC has some explanatory power


                                                       14
for WML which the other factors (MKT, SMB, HML and SKS) do not have.
         The remainder of this section conducts cross-sectional tests using the momentum portfolios
as base assets. Section 4.1 describes the Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) momentum portfolios.
Section 4.2 estimates linear factor models using the Fama-Macbeth (1973) two-stage method-
ology. In Section 4.3, we use a GMM approach similar to Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and
Cochrane (1996).


4.1         Description of the Momentum Portfolios
Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)’s momentum strategies involve sorting stocks based on their past
x                                x                                         x
     months returns, where           is equal to 3, 6, 9 or 12. For each , stocks are sorted into deciles
and held for the next        2 months holding periods, where 2 = 3, 6, 9 or 12. We form an equal-
weighted portfolio within each decile and calculate overlapping holding period returns for the
                                                                               x
next 2       months. Since studies of the momentum effect focus on =6 months portfolio formation
                                                                                                            x
period (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993; Chordia and Shivakumar, 2001), we also focus on the =6
months sorting period for our cross-sectional tests. However, our results are similar for other
                                                      x
horizons, and are particularly strong for the =3 months sorting period.
         Figure (1) plots the average returns of the 40 portfolios sorted on past 6 months returns. The
average returns are shown with *’s. There are 10 portfolios corresponding to each of the 2 =3,
6, 9 and 12 months holding periods. Figure (1) shows average returns to be increasing across
the deciles (from losers to winners) and are roughly the same for each holding period                  2 . The
differences in returns between the winner portfolio (decile 10) and the loser portfolio (decile
1) are 0.54, 0.77, 0.86 and 0.68 percent per month, with corresponding t-statistics of 1.88,
3.00, 3.87 and 3.22, for        2 =3, 6, 9 and 12 respectively. Hence, the return differences between
winners and losers are significant at the 1% level except the momentum strategy corresponding
to   2 =3. Figure (1) also shows the F ’s and >@? of the momentum portfolios. While the average
returns increase from decile 1 to decile 10, the patterns of beta are U-shaped. In contrast, the
> ? of the deciles increase going from the losers to the winners, except at the highest winner
decile. Therefore, the momentum strategies generally have a positive relation with downside
risk exposure.4 We now turn to formal estimations of the relation between downside risk and
expected returns of momentum returns.
     4
         Ang and Chen (2001) focus on correlation asymmetries across downside and upside moves, rather than the
level of downside and upside correlatio. They find that, relative to a normal distribution, loser portfolios have
greater correlation asymmetry, than winner portfolios, even though past winner stocks have a higher level of
downside correlation than loser stocks.

The fit is very poor with an adjusted w                      of only 7%. Moreover, the point estimate of the market
premium is negative.
       Model B is the Fama-French (1993) specification:

This model explains 91% of the cross-sectional variation of average returns but the estimates of
the risk premia for SMB and HML are negative. The negative premia reflect the fact that the
loadings on SMB and HML go the wrong way for the momentum portfolios.
       In comparision, Model C adds CMC as a factor together with the market:

and produces a w                of 93%, which is slightly higher than the Fama-French model. The estimated
premium on CMC is 8.76% per annum (0.73 per month) and statistically significant at the 5%
level. These results do not change when SMB and HML are added to equation (17) in Model D.
While the estimates of the factor premia of SMB and HML are still negative, the CMC factor
                                                                                                               6
premium remains significantly positive and the regression produces the same w                                      of 93%.5
       We examine the Carhart (1997) four-factor model in Model E:

We find that adding WML to the Fama-French model does not improve the fit relative to the
                                                                                                      6
original Fama-French specification. Both models produce the same                                  w       of 91%, but the WML
premium is not statistically significant. However, when we add CMC to the Carhart four-factor
model in Model F, the factor premia on WML and CMC are both become significant. Model F
                  6
also has an w         of 93%. The fact that CMC remains significant at the 5% level (adj t-stat=2.01)
in the presence of WML shows the explanatory power of downside risk. Moreover, the premium
associated with CMC is of the same order of magnitude as that of WML, despite the fact that
CMC is constructed using characteristics unrelated to past returns.
       The downside risk factor CMC is negatively correlated with the Fama-French factors and
positively correlated with WML. In estimations not reported, CMC remains significant after
orthogonalizing with respect to the other factors with little change in the magnitude or the
significance levels. In particular, CMC orthogonalized with respect to either MKT or the Fama-
French factors are both significant. CMC orthogonalized with respect to the Carhart four-factor
   5
       When the ten p   q       portfolios are used as base assets, the estimate of the CMC premium is 3.45% per annum,
using only the CMC factor in a linear factor model.


                                                                   17
model also remains significant. Therefore, we conclude that the significance of the downside
risk factor CMC is not due to any information that is already captured by other factors.
    Figure (2) graphs the loadings of each momentum portfolio on MKT, SMB, HML and CMC.
The loadings are estimated from the time-series regressions of the momentum portfolios on the
factors from the first step of the Fama-MacBeth (1973) procedure. We see that for each set of
portfolios, as we go from the past loser portfolio (decile 1) to the past winner portfolio (decile
10), the loadings on the market portfolio remain flat, so that the beta has little explanatory
power. The loadings on SMB decrease from the losers to the winners, except for the last two
deciles. Similarly, the loadings on the HML factor also go in the wrong direction, decreasing
monotonically from the losers to the winners.
    In contrast to the decreasing loadings on the SMB and HML factors, the loadings on the
CMC factor in Figure (2) almost monotonically increase from strongly negative for the past
loser portfolios to slightly positive for the past winner portfolios. The increasing loadings on
CMC across the decile portfolios for each holding period      2 are consistent with the increasing
> ? statistics across the deciles in Figure (1). Winner portfolios have higher > ? , higher loadings
on CMC, and higher expected returns. Since a linear factor model implies that the systematic
variance of a stock’s return is F
                                        F  from equation (11), the negative loadings for loser stocks
imply that losers have higher downside systematic risk than winners. The negative loadings also
suggest that past winner stocks do poorly when the market has large moves on the downside,
while past loser stocks perform better.


4.3     GMM Cross-Sectional Estimation
In this section, we conduct asset pricing tests in the GMM framework (Hansen, 1982). In
general, since GMM tests are one-step procedures, they are more efficient than two-step tests
such as the Fama-MacBeth procedure. Moreover, we are able to conduct additional hypotheses
tests within the GMM framework. We begin with a brief description of the procedure before
presenting our results.

and can be interpreted as the least-square distance between a given pricing kernel and the closest
point in the set of the pricing kernels that can price the base assets correctly. The HJ distance
is also the maximum mispricing possible per unit of standard deviation. For example, if the
HJ distance is 0.45 and the portfolio has an annualized standard deviation of 20%, then the
maximum annualized pricing error is 9 percent.
    The HJ distance can be estimated using the standard GMM procedure with one difference.
The weighting matrix used is the inverse of the covariance matrix of the second moments of
                   !  ¹I   
asset returns,              w w ? . The optimal weighting matrix cannot be used in this case
since the weights are specific to each model, which makes it unsuitable for model comparisons.
Hypothesis tests with the optimal weighting matrix may fail to reject a model because the model
is difficult to estimate, rather than because the model produces small pricing errors. In contrast,
the inverse of the covariance matrix of asset returns is invariant across models, so that the HJ
distance provides an uniform measure across different models. We compute both asymptotic
and small sample distributions for the HJ distance, which we detail in Appendix C.


4.3.2     Empirical Results
                                                                                  xº¼»
Table (9) presents the results of the GMM estimations. The 40 momentum                    portfolios,
together with the risk-free asset, are used as the base assets in these estimates. We first turn
to Model A, the CAPM. Unlike the Fama-MacBeth estimation in Table (8), the market has
a significantly positive risk premium, rather than a negative risk premium. The Fama-French
model (Model B) estimates of risk premia for SMB and HML are negative, but the market risk
premium is estimated to be positive. We consider the linear factor model with MKT and CMC in
Model C. Both MKT and CMC command positive factor premia that are statistically significant
at the 1% level. In particular, the CMC premium is estimated to be 1.00% per month, with a
t-statistic of 4.75.
    In Model D, which is the Fama-French model augmented with the CMC factor, factor
premia for SMB and HML are still negative, although the HML premium is insignificantly
different from zero. This model nests the MKT and CMC model of Model C and also nests the
Fama-French model (Model B). Taking this as an unconstrained model and using its weighting
                                                                  6
matrix to re-estimate Models B and C, we can conduct two µ            over-identification tests. The
null hypothesis of the first test is the Fama-French model, which tests for the significance of
CMC given the Fama-French factors. This tests rejects the null hypothesis with a p-value of
          6
0.02 (µ       =7.99). Hence, CMC does provide additional explanatory power for the cross-section
of momentum portfolios which the Fama-French model does not provide. In the second test,


                                                 20
the null hypothesis is the linear factor model with only the MKT and the CMC factors, and the
alternative hypothesis is Model D (MKT, SMB, HML and CMC). This test fails to reject, with
                         6
a p-value of 0.15 (µ     6 =2.12). Hence, given MKT and CMC, the size and the book-to-market
factors provide no additional explanatory power for pricing momentum portfolios.
   Model E is the Carhart four-factor model, which extends the Fama-French model by adding
WML. The WML premium is significantly positive, as we would expect, since the WML factor
is constructed using the momentum portfolios themselves. The Carhart model is nested by
Model F, which adds CMC. This model also nests Model D, which uses MKT, SMB, HML
                                       6
and CMC factors. We run a          µ           over-identification test with the null of Model D against the
                                                                                  6
alternative of Model F. This tests rejects with a p-value of 0.01 (µ              6 =6.54). Hence, we conclude
that WML still has further explanatory power, in the presence of CMC, to price the cross-section
of momentum portfolios. However, the premium of the CMC factor is still significant at the 1%
level in the presence of the WML factor.
   The last two columns of Table (9) list the results of Hansen’s over-identification test (J-test)
and the HJ test. Only the CAPM model is rejected using the J-test (p-value 0.03), while the
remaining models cannot be rejected. However, the last column shows that none of the models
can pass the HJ test. The HJ statistic is generally large, around 0.54 for every model. Both the
asymptotic and small-sample p-values of the HJ test are less than 0.00%. Hence, although the
downside risk factor is priced by the momentum portfolios, the pricing errors are still large and
we reject that the pricing error is zero. Exposure to downside risk accounts for a statistically
significant portion of momentum profits, but it cannot fully explain the momentum effect.
   Finally, we graph the average pricing errors for the models in Figure (3), following Hodrick
                                                                                           !     I   
and Zhang (2001). The pricing errors are computed using the weights,                                  w w ? ,
which is the same weighting matrix used to compute the HJ distance. Since the same weighting
matirx is used across all of the models, we can compare the differences in the pricing errors for
different models. Figure (3) displays each momentum portfolio on the ½ -axis, where the first

ten to the   2           holding period. The 41st asset is the risk-free asset. The figure plots two
standard error bounds in solid lines, and the pricing errors for each asset in *’s.
   Figure (3) shows that the CAPM has most of its pricing errors outside the two standard
error bands and shows that the loser portfolios are the most difficult for the CAPM to price.
The Fama-French model has most difficulty pricing past winners; the pricing errors of every
highest winner portfolio lies outside the two standard error bands. The model using MKT
and CMC factors is the only model that has all the pricing errors within two standard error

bands.6 Comparing the CAPM and the model with MKT and CMC factors, we see that adding
CMC to the CAPM greatly helps to explain loser and winner portfolios. Adding CMC to the
Fama French model or the Carhart model does not change the pricing errors of the assets very
much. This is consistent with the fact that the Fama-French and Carhart models augmented
with the CMC factor are still rejected, using the HJ distance. The Carhart model and the Carhart
model augmented with the CMC factor produce an interesting pattern for pricing errors relative
to other models. Models without WML typically under-estimate the expected returns of the
winner portfolios. In contrast, models with the WML factor over-estimate the expected returns
of winner stocks, and under-estimate the expected returns of loser stocks.


5 Downside Risk, Aggregate Liquidity and Macroeconomic
        Variables
In this section we explore the relation between downside risk, aggregate liquidity and the
business cycle by investigating how the downside risk factor covaries with liquidity and
macroeconomic variables. The investigation in this section should be regarded as an exploratory
exercise, rather than as a formal test of the underlying economic determinants of downside risk.


5.1       Downside Risk and Liquidity Risk
A number of studies find that liquidity of the market dries up during down markets. Pástor
and Stambaugh (2001) construct an aggregate liquidity measure which uses signed order flow,
and find that their liquidity measure spikes downwards during periods of extreme downward
moves, such as during the October 1987 crash, and during the OPEC oil crisis. Other authors,
such as Jones (2001) find that the bid-ask spreads increase with market downturns. Chordia,
Roll and Subrahmanyam (2000) also find a positive association at a daily frequency between
market-wide liquidity and market returns. These down markets, which coincide with systematic
low liquidity, are precisely the periods which downside risk-averse investors dislike. We now
try to differentiate between the effects of downside risk and aggregate liquidity risk.
       To study this relation, we follow Pástor and Stambaugh (2001) and reconstruct their
aggregate liquidity measure,         l . Our construction procedure is detailed in Appendix A. After
   6
       Although all pricing errors for the model of MKT and CMC fall within the two standard error bands, this model
does not pass the HJ distance test. The graph and the HJ distance give different results because the weighting matrix
used in computing the HJ distance does not assign an equal weight to all the portfolios in the test, and the graph
does not take into account any covariances between the pricing errors.

constructing the liquidity measure, we assign an historical liquidity beta, F                              , at each month, for
each stock listed on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. This is done using monthly data over the
previous 5 years from the following regression:

     Since each stock  in our sample now has a downside correlation (> ? ) and a liquidity beta
(F ) for each month, we can examine the unconditional relations  across the two measures.
                                                                
First, we compute the cross-sectional correlation between > ? and F
                                                                          at each time  , and then
average over time to obtain the average cross-sectional correlation between downside risk and
                                                        
liquidity. The average cross-sectional correlation is –0.0108, which is close to zero. We obtain
the average time-series correlation between >
                                                                  ?   and F    by computing the correlation between
these two variables for each firm across time, and then averaging across firms. The average
time-series correlation is -0.0029, which is also almost zero. Hence, our measure of downside
risk is almost orthogonal to Pástor and Stambaugh’s measure of aggregate liquidity risk.
   To further investigate the relation between downside risk and aggregate liquidity, we sort
                                                   
stocks into 25 portfolios. At each month, we independently sort all NYSE, AMEX and
                                                 by F
NASDAQ stocks into two quintile groups, one group                                and another by >          ? . The intersection
of these 2 quintiles forms 25 portfolios sorted by F                     and >
                                                            ? . To examine the effect of liquidity,
controlling for downside risk, we average the 25 portfolios across the > ? quintiles. We call these
portfolios the ‘Average Liquidity Beta Portfolios’. We report the intercept coefficients from a
Fama-French (1993) factor time-series regression of these portfolios  in Panel A of Table (10).
Consistent with Pástor and Stambaugh, portfolios with the lowest F                           have the most negative
mispricing. However, none of the estimates of the intercept terms are statistically significant.
                                                arÂ         aj
Furthermore, the difference between                   and         is positive (0.10% per month), but insignificant.
Hence, controlling for downside risk, there is little relation between the cross-section of stock
returns and their liquidity risk exposure.                                                         
   In Panel B of Table (10), we average the 25 portfolios across the                           F           quintiles. We call
these portfolios the ‘Average Downside Correlation Portfolios’. We observe a similar pattern
in the average returns moving from low     > ? to high > ? portfolios as in Table (4). There is
negative mispricing in the low > ? portfolios and positive mispricing in the high > ? portfolio.
                         ajÂ    aj
The difference between               and     is 0.26% per month, which is statistically significant at the
1% level. Hence, even after controlling for liquidity risk using the Pástor-Stambaugh liquidity
measure, there remains significant mispricing of downside risk relative to the Fama-French
three factor model.

                                                                 23
5.2    Downside Correlations and Macroeconomic Variables
To investigate the relation between downside risk and business cycle conditions, we consider six
macroeconomic variables which reflect underlying economic activity and business conditions.
Our first two variables are leading indicators of economic activity: the growth rate in the
index of leading economic indicators (LEI) and the growth rate in the index of Help Wanted
Advertising in Newspapers (HELP). We also use the growth rate of total industrial production
(IP). The next three variables measure price and term structure conditions: the CPI inflation
rate, the level of the Fed funds rate (FED) and the term spread between the 10-year T-bonds
and the 3-months T-bills (TERM). All growth rates (including inflation) are computed as the
                                                                          EQÃ* 8          
difference in logs of the index at times and                                         , where is monthly.
   To examine the connection between downside risk and macroeconomic variables, we run
two sets of regressions. The first set regresses CMC on lagged macro variables, while the
second set regresses macroeconomic variables on lagged CMC. The first set of regressions are
of the form:

                     u           u-EaM,       < c.

where we use various macroeconomic variables for 0Ä     wÅ .
   Panel A of Table (11) lists the regression results from equation (26). There is no significant
relation between lagged macroeconomic variables and the CMC factor except for the first lag
of LEI, which is significantly negatively related with CMC. A 1% increase in the growth rate of
LEI predicts a 30 basis point decrease in the premium of the downside risk factor. The p-value
for the joint test (in the last column of Table (11)) that all lagged LEI are equal to zero rejects the
null with p-value=0.02. Overall, with the exception of LEI, there is little evidence of predictive
power by macroeconomic variables to forecast CMC returns.
   To explore if the downside risk factor predicts future movements of macroeconomic

We also include lagged macroeconomic variables in the right hand side of the regression since
most of the macroeconomic variables are highly autocorrelated. Panel B of Table (11) lists the
regression results of equation (27). We report only the coefficients on lagged CMC. While the
macroeconomic variables provide little forecasting power for CMC, the CMC factor has some
weak forecasting ability for future macroeconomic variables. In particular, high CMC forecasts

                                                                            24
lower future economic activity (HELP p-value = 0.00, IP p-value = 0.04), lower future interest
rates (FED p-value = 0.01) and lower future term spreads (TERM p-value = 0.03), where the
p-values refer to a joint test that the three coefficients on lagged CMC in equation (27) are equal
to zero.
   In general, these results show that high CMC forecasts economic downturns.                 The
predictions of high CMC and future low economic activity is seen directly in the negative
coefficients for HELP and IP. Term spreads also tend to be lower in economic recessions.
Estimates of Taylor (1993)-type policy rules on the FED over long samples, where the FED
rate is a linear function of inflation and real activity, show short rates to be lower when output
is low (Ang and Piazzesi, 2001). Hence, the positive correlation of high CMC with future
low HELP, low IP, low TERM and low FED shows that high CMC weakly forecasts economic
downturns.


6 Conclusion
Stocks with higher downside risk, measured by greater correlations conditional on downside
moves of the market, have higher expected returns than stocks with low downside risk. The
portfolio of stocks with the greatest downside correlations outperforms the portfolio of stocks
with the lowest downside correlations by 4.91% per annum. This effect cannot be explained by
the Fama and French (1993) model, since after controlling for the market beta, the size effect
and the book-to-market effect, the difference in the returns between the highest and the lowest
downside correlation portfolios increases to 6.55% per annum. To capture this downside risk
effect, we construct a downside risk factor (CMC) that goes long stocks with high downside
correlations and goes short stocks with low downside correlations. The CMC factor commands
a statistically significant average return of 2.80% per annum.
   The factor structure in the cross-section of stock returns rewards investors for bearing
assets with greater downside risk. In particular, past winner momentum portfolios have greater
exposure to the downside risk factor than past loser momentum portfolios. Hence, some part
of the profitability of momentum strategies can be explained as compensation for bearing
greater downside risk. Arbitrageurs who engage in momentum strategies face the risk that the
strategy performs poorly when the market experiences extreme downward moves. Downside
risk provides some explanatory power for the cross-section of momentum returns, which the
Fama and French (1993) model does not provide. In GMM cross-sectional estimations, the
downside risk factor is significantly priced by the momentum portfolios, and it commands a


                                                25
significant risk premium. However, Hansen-Jagannathan (1997) tests reject the linear factor
models with the CMC factor, indicating that exposure to downside risk is only a partial, and not
a complete explanation for the momentum effect.
   Since downside risk is priced and stocks’ sensitivities to downside risk play a role in asset
pricing, our empirical work points to the need for models that can explain the underlying
economic mechanisms which generates downside correlation asymmetries. Representative
agent models suggest that downside risk may arise in equilibium economies with asymmetric
utility functions, such as first order risk aversion (Bekaert, Hodrick and Marshall, 1997) or
loss aversion (Barberis, Huang and Santos, 2001). Asymmetries in correlations can also be
produced by economies with frictions and hidden information (Hong and Stein, 2001) or with
agents facing binding wealth constraints (Kyle and Xiong, 2001). Which of these explanations
best explains the driving mechanism behind cross-sectional variations in downside risk remains
to be explored.

Appendix

A Data and Portfolio Construction
Data
We use data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) to construct portfolios of stocks sorted by
various higher moments of returns. We confine our attention to ordinary common stocks on NYSE, AMEX and
NASDAQ, omitting ADRs, REITs, closed-end funds, foreign firms and other securities which do not have a CRSP
share type code of 10 or 11. We use daily returns from CRSP for the period covering January 1st, 1964 to December
31st, 1999, including NASDAQ data which is only available post-1972. We use the one-month risk-free rate from
CRSP and take CRSP’s value-weighted returns of all stocks as the market portfolio.


Higher Moment Portfolios
We construct portfolios based on correlations between asset Æ ’s excess return ÇfÈ and the market’s excess return ÇÉ
conditional on downside moves of the market (p q ) and on upside moves of the market (pÊ ). We also constuct
portfolios based on coskewness, cokurtosis, o , o conditional on downside market movements (oËq ), o conditional
on upside market movements (o Ê ). At the beginning of each month, we calculate each stock’s moment measures
using the past year’s daily log returns from the CRSP daily file. For the moments which condition on downside or
upside movements, we define an observation at time Ì to be a downside (upside) market movement if the excess
market return at Ì is less than or equal to (greater than or equal to) the average excess market return during the
past one year period in consideration. We require a stock to have at least 220 observations to be included in the
calculation. These moment measures are then used to sort the stocks into deciles and a value-weighted return is
calculated for all stocks in each decile. The portfolios are rebalanced monthly.


SMB, HML, SKS and WML Factor Construction
The Fama and French (1993) factors, SMB and HML, are from the data library at Kenneth French’s website at
http://web.mit.edu/kfrench/www/data library.html.
     Harvey and Siddique (2000) use 60 months of data to compute the coskewness defined in equation (5) for
all stocks in NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ. Stocks are sorted in order of increasing negative coskewness. The
coskewness factor SKS is the value-weighted average returns of firms in the top 3 deciles (with the most negative
coskewness) minus the value-weighted average return of firms in the bottom 3 deciles (stocks with the most positive
coskewness) in the 61st month.
     Following Carhart (1997), we construct WML (called PR1YR in his paper) as the equally-weighted average
of firms with the highest 30 percent eleven-month returns lagged one month minus the equally-weighted average
of firms with the lowest 30 percent eleven-month returns lagged one month. In constructing WML, all stocks in
NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ are used and portfolios are rebalanced monthly.
     The construction of CMC is detailed in Section 3.2.


Momentum Portfolios
To construct the momentum portfolios of Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), we sort stocks into portfolios based on
their returns over the past 6 months. We consider holding period of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. This procedure yields
4 strategies and 40 portfolios in total. We illustrate the construction of the portfolios with the example of the ’6-6’
strategies. To construct the ’6-6’ deciles, we sort our stocks based upon the past six-months returns of all stocks
in NYSE and AMEX. Each month, an equal-weighted portfolio is formed based on six-months returns ending one
month prior. Similarly, equal-weighted portfolios are formed based on past returns that ended one months prior,
three months prior, and so on up to six months prior. We then take the simple average of six such portfolios. Hence,
our first momentum portfolio consists of Í;Î]Ï of the returns of the worst performers one month ago, plus ÍBÎÏ of the
returns of the worst performers two months ago, etc.


Liquidity Factor and Liquidity Betas
We follow Pástor and Stambaugh (2001) to construct an aggregate liquidity measure, Ð . Stock return and volume
data are obtained from CRSP. NASDAQ stocks are excluded in the construction of the aggregate liquidity measure.

                                                         27
The liquidity estimate, ÑnÈHÒ Ó , for an individual stock Æ in month Ì is the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of ÑÈHÒ Ó
in the following regression:

                   ÇÈHÔ Ò Õ ÊjÖ Ò Ó ×¸Ø È©Ò ÓrÙ4ÚÈHÒ ÓÇ Û ÈHÒ ÕÒ ÓÙ Ñ È©Ò Ó Ü Æ©ÝBÞ ÇÈ©Ô Ò ÕÒ Ó ß È©Ò ÕÒ ÓjÙ4àHÈHÒ Õ ÊjÖ Ò Ó áãâ × Í á¡ää¡ä áåä (A-1)

In equation (A-1), Ç Û È©Ò ÕÒ Ó is the raw return on stock Æ on day â of month Ì , Ç ÈHÔ Ò ÕÒ Ó × Ç ÈHÒ ÕÒ Óçæ Ç ÉyÒ ÕÒ Ó is the stock return
in excess of the market return, and ß ÈHÒ ÕÒ Ó is the dollar volume for stock Æ on day â of month Ì . The market return
on day on day â of month Ì , Ç ÉyÒ ÕÒ Ó , is taken as the return on the CRSP value-weighted market portfolio. A stock’s
liquidity estimate, Ñ ÈHÒ Ó , is computed in a given month only if there are at least 15 consecutive observations, and if
the stock has a month-end share prices of greater than $5 and less than $1000.
     The aggregate liquidity measure, Ð , is computed based on the liquidity estimates, ÑnÈ©Ò Ó , of individual firms listed
on NYSE and AMEX from August 1962 to December 1992. Only the individual liquidity estimates that meet the
above criteria is used. To construct the innovations in aggregate liquidity, we follow Pástor and Stambaugh and
first form the scaled monthly difference:
                                                                                                   ì

                                                                                ê Ö           Èí Ö

where is the number of available stocks at month Ì , Ó is the total dollar value of the included stocks at the end
of month Ì æ Í , and     is the total dollar value fo the ê stocks at the end of July 1962. The innovations in liquidity
                     ê Ö
are computed as the residuals of the following regression:
                                                è=Ñ é Ó
                                                    èòé        î           é

                                                                                            é
Finally, the aggregate liquidity measure, ÐçÓ , is taken to be the fitted residuals, ÐöÓ × ô Ó .
    To calculate the liquidity betas for individual stocks, at the end of each month between 1968 and 1999, we
identify stocks listed on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ with at least five years of monthly returns. For each stock,
we estimate a liquidity beta, oöÈ ÷ , by running the following regression using the most recent five years of monthly
data:

                           ÇÈHÒ Ó × orÈø Ù o È ÷ ÐöÓ Ù oöÈû
                                                           ù úýüþ Ó Ù oöÈÿ sú Ó Ù oÈ
                                                                                           ú ÐçÓ Ù£à È©Ò Ó á                                          (A-4)

where Ç ©È Ò Ó denotes asset Æ ’s excess return, Ð Ó is the innovation in aggregate liquidity.


Macroeconomic Variables
We use the following macroeconomic variables from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: the growth rate in the
index of leading economic indicators (LEI), the growth rate in the index of Help Wanted Advertising in Newspapers
(HELP), the growth rate of total industrial production (IP), the Consumer Price Index inflation rate (CPI), the level
of the Fed funds rate (FED), and the term spread between the 10-year T-bonds and the 3-months T-bills (TERM).
All growth rates (including inflation) are computed as the difference in logs of the index at times Ì and Ì æ Í  ,
where Ì is monthly.


B Time-Aggregation of Coskewness and Cokurtosis
Since we compute all of the monthly higher moments measures using daily data, the problem of time aggregation
may exist for some of the higher moments. Assuming that returns are drawn from infinitely divisible distributions,
                                                                         Õ and Õ , by the time aggregated relations
central moments at first and second order can scale. That is, an annual estimate of the mean and volatility can
          Õ           
be estimated from means
                             Õ
                           and volatilities estimated from daily data
   ×   and ×   . Hence, daily measure for second order moments, such as prq , p Ê , o , oËq and o Ê are
equivalent to their corresponding monthly measures. We now prove that daily coskewness and cokurtosis defined
in equations (5) and (6) are equivalent to monthly coskewness and cokurtosis.
     With the assumption of infinitely divisible distributions, cumulants scale but not central moments (“cumulants
cumulate”). The central moment,  , of  is defined as:
                                                                        

    To calculate a small sample p-value for the HJ distance, we assume that the linear factor model holds and
simulate a data generating process (DGP) with 432 observations, the same length as in our samples. The DGP
takes the form:

where Ç ÈHÒ Ó is the return on the Æ -th portfolio, Ç Óe is the risk-free rate, o È is an úfH Í vector of factor loadings, and 'Ó

and j k is the covariance matrix of the factors.
     For each model, we simulate 5000 time-series as described above and compute the HJ distance for each
simulation run. We then count the percentage of these HJ distances that are larger than the actual HJ distance from
real data and denote this ratio empirical p-value. For each simulation run, we also compute the theoretic p-value
which is calculated from the asymptotic distribution.

The table lists the summary statistics of the value-weighted prq and p Ê portfolios at a monthly frequency,
where prq and p Ê are defined in equation (3). For each month, we calculate prq (p Ê ) of all stocks based
on daily continuously compounded returns over the past year. We rank the stocks into deciles (1–10), and
calculate the value-weighted simple percentage return over the next month. We rebalance the portfolios at
a monthly frequency. Means and standard deviations are in percentage terms per month. Std denotes the
standard deviation (volatility), Auto denotes the first autocorrelation, and o is the post-formation beta of the
portfolio with respect to the market portfolio. At the beginning of each month Ì , we compute each portfolio’s
simple average log market capitalization in millions (size) and value-weighted book-to-market ratio (B/M).
The columns labeled p q (pjÊ ) and o q (ovÊ ) show the post-formation downside (upside) correlations and
downside (upside) betas of the portfolios. High–Low is the mean return difference between portfolio 10 and
portfolio 1 and t-stat gives the t-statistic for this difference. T-statistics are computed using Newey-West
(1987) heteroskedastic-robust standard errors with 3 lags. T-statistics that are significant at the 5% level are
denoted by *. The sample period is from January 1964 to December 1999.

 The table lists summary statistics for value-weighted o , oËq and o Ê portfolios at a monthly frequency, where
oËq  and o Ê are defined in equation (4). For each month, we calculate o (o q , o Ê ) of all stocks based on daily
 continuously compounded returns over the past year. We rank the stocks into deciles (1–10), and calculate the
 value-weighted simple percentage return over the next month. We rebalance the portfolios monthly. Means
 and standard deviations are in percentage terms per month. Std denotes the standard deviation (volatility),
 Auto denotes the first autocorrelation, and o is post-formation the beta of the portfolio. The columns labeled
oËq (o Ê ) and pjq (p Ê ) show the post-formation downside (upside) betas and downside (upside) correlations
 of the portfolios. The column labeled m Ê ( mq ) lists the ratio of the volatility of the portfolio to the volatility
 of the market, both conditioning on the downside (upside). High–Low is the mean return difference between
 portfolio 10 and portfolio 1 and t-stat gives the t-statistic for this difference. T-statistics are computed using
 Newey-West (1987) heteroskedastic-robust standard errors with 3 lags. The sample period is from January
 1964 to December 1999.

 Summary statistics for the portfolios used to construct downside risk factor r ú r at a monthly frequency.
 Each month, we rank stocks based on their o , calculated from the previous year using daily data, into a low
o group and a high o group, each group consisting of one half of all firms. Then, within each o group,
 we rank stocks based on their pjq , which is also calculated using daily data over the past year, into three
 groups: a low prq group, a medium pjq group and a high pjq group, with cutoff points at 33.3% and 66.7%.
 We compute the monthly value-weighted simple returns for each portfolio. The o -balanced groups are the
 equal-weighted average of the portfolios across the two o groups. T-statistics are computed using Newey-
 West (1987) heteroskedastic-robust standard errors with 3 lags. The sample period is from January 1964 to
 December 1999.

This table shows the summary statistics of the factors. MKT is the CRSP value-weighted returns of all
stocks. SMB and HML are the size and the book-to-market factors (constructed by Fama and French (1993)),
WML is the return on the zero-cost strategy of going long past winners and shorting past losers (constructed
following Carhart (1997)), and SKS is the return on going long stocks with the most negative past coskewness
and shorting stocks with the most positive past coskewness (constructed following Harvey and Siddique
(2000)). CMC is the return on a portfolio going long stocks with the highest past downside correlation and
shorting stocks with the lowest past downside correlation. The two columns show the means and the standard
deviations of the factors, expressed as monthly percetages. Skew and Kurt are the skewness and kurtosis of
the portfolio returns. Auto refers to first-order autocorrelation. Factors with statistically significant means at
the 5% (1%) level are denoted with * (**), using heteroskedastic-robust Newey-West (1987) standard errors
with 3 lags. The sample period is from January 1964 to December 1999.

Time-series regression of the momentum factor, WML, onto various other factors. MKT is the market, SMB
and HML are Fama-French (1993) factors, CMC is the downside risk factor, and SKS is the Harvey-Siddique
(2000) skewness factor. The t-stat is calculated using Newey-West (1987) heteroskedastic-robust standard
errors with 3 lags. T-statistics that are significant at the 5% (1%) level are denoted with * (**). The sample
period is from January 1964 to December 1999.

This table shows the results from the Fama-MacBeth (1973) regression tests on the 40 momentum portfolios
sorted by past 6 months returns. MKT, SMB and HML are Fama and French (1993)’s three factors and CMC
is the downside risk factor. WML is return on the zero-cost strategy going long past winners and shorting
past losers (constructed following Carhart (1997)). In the first stage we estimate the factor loadings over
the whole sample. The factor premia, s , are estimated in the second-stage cross-sectional regressions. We
compute two t-statistics for each estimate. The first one is calculated using the uncorrected Fama-MacBeth
                                                                                                             . is

the joint significance of the betas of each model. The first p-value is computed using the uncorrected variance-
covariance matrix, while the second one uses Shanken’s (1992) correction. T-statistics that are significant at
the 5% (1%) level are denoted with * (**). The sample period is from January 1964 to December 1999.

This table shows the time-series regression of excess return ÇÈ on factors úýüþ , sú and  ú Ð . In
each month, we sort all NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ stocks into 25 portfolios. We first sort stocks into
quintiles by oö÷ and sort stocks into quintiles by prq , where oö÷ is computed using equation (25) using the
previous 5 years of monthly data. The intersection of these quintiles forms 25 portfolios on oö÷ and prq . The
average liquidity beta portfolios in Panel A are the liquidity beta quintiles averaged over the prq quintiles.

This table shows the results of the regressions between CMC and the macroeconomic variables. Panel A
lists the results from the regressions of r ú r on lagged r ú r and lagged macroeconomic variables, but
reports only the coefficients on lagged macro variables. Panel B lists the results from the regressions of
macrovariables on lagged CMC and lagged macroeconomic variables, but reports only the coefficients on
lagged CMC. LEI is the growth rate of the index of leading economic indicators, HELP is the growth rate in
the index of Help Wanted Advertising in Newspapers, IP is the growth rate of industrial production, CPI is the
growth rate of Consumer Price Index, FED is the federal discount rate and TERM is the yield spread between
10 year bond and 3 month T-bill. All growth rate (including inflation) are computed as the differences in
logs of the index at time Ì and time Ì æ Í  , where Ì is in months. FED is the federal funds rate and TERM
is the yield spread between the 10 year government bond yield and the 3-month T-bill yield. All variables
are expressed as percentages. T-statistics are computed using Newey-West heteroskedastic-robust standard
errors with 3 lags, and are listed below each estimate. Joint Sig in Panel A denotes to the p-value of the joint
significance test on the coefficients on lagged macro variables. Joint Sig in Panel B denotes the p-value of the
joint significance test on the coefficients of lagged CMC. T-statistics that are significant at the 5% (1%) level
are denoted with * (**). P-values of less than 5% (1%) are denoted with * (**). The sample period is from
January 1964 to December 1999.

These plots show the average monthly percentage returns, o and prq of the Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)
momentum portfolios. J refers to formation period and ü refers to holding periods. For each month, we
sort all NYSE and AMEX stocks into decile portfolios based on their returns over the past J =6 months. We
consider holding periods over the next 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. This procedure yields 4 strategies and 40
portfolios in total. The sample period is from January 1964 to December 1999.

               These plots show the loadings of the Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) momentum portfolios on MKT, SMB,
               HML and CMC. Factor loadings are estimated in the first step of the Fama-MacBeth (1973) procedure
               (equation (11)). y refers to formation period and z refers to holding periods. For each month, we sort all
               NYSE and AMEX stocks into decile portfolios based on their returns over the past y =6 months. We consider
               holding periods over the next 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. This procedure yields 4 strategies and 40 portfolios in
               total. MKT, SMB and HML are Fama and French (1993)’s three factors and CMC is the downside correlation
               risk factor. The sample period is from January 1964 to December 1999.

          These plots show the pricing errors of various models considered in Section 4.2. Each star in the graph
          represents one of the 40 momentum portfolios with y]{}| or the risk-free asset. The first ten portfolios
          correspond to the z~{ month holding period, the second ten to the z~{| month holding period, the third
          ten to the z{ month holding period, and finally the fourth ten to the z{ holding period. The 41st
          asset is the risk-free asset. The graphs show the average pricing errors with asterixes, with two standard error
          bands in solid lines. The units on the  -axis are in percentage terms. Pricing errors are estimated following
          computation of the Hansen-Jagannathan (1997) distance.
