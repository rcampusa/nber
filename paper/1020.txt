                    The Impact of Public Health Policy:
                    The Case of Community Health Centers


                                   ABSTRACT


         The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the Community

Health Center (CHC) on health levels in the U.S. Using infant mortal-

ity as the underlying health indicator, a time series of large coun-

ties as the data set, and multivariate regression techniques, we

investigate the extent to which the presence of a program in a county

affects future mortality. We find that CHCs have negative and statis-

tically significant impacts on white and black infant mortality rates.

The centers have larger effects on black infant mortality than on

white infant mortality. The reduction in the black infant mortality

rate between 1970 and 1978 due to the CHC system amounts to one death

per thousand live births or approximately 12 percent of the observed

decline.    This result is particularly striking in light of the well-
known higher   infant mortality rate of blacks. A reduction in the

excess   mortality rate of black babies has been dentf1ed as a goal
of public health policy for a number of years. Our results suggest
that community health centers have the potential to make a substan-
tial contribution to the achievement of this goal.

          This is a study of the Impact of a Federally sponsored health Ini-

 tiative on health status. Since 1965 a network of Federally funded

 community health centers (CHCs) have developed in the United States to

 deliver comprehensive ambulatory care, both primary and preventive, to

 poverty populations in medically underserved areas. The program to

 create   and fund these centers, originally termed neighborhood health
 centers, was started by the Office of Economic Opportunity as part of
 the   War on   Poverty. By 1973   overall control of the centers had been

shifted to the Bureau of Community Health Services (BCHS),      Health
Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,

and    the centers began to be referred to as community health centers.
New and smaller variants of the basic CHC model were created in 1975

and 1978 by the introduction of the Rural Health Initiative and the

Urban Health Initiative, respectively. Concomitant with these

legislative developments, the number of CHCs increased from 51 in

1968 to 104 in 1974 and to approximately 800 in 1980.1_6

      CHCs were only one component of a broad Federal initiative which

was meant to address the "underiyin" causes of poverty as well as the

poverty population's health needs. The poor were mired in a "vicious

cycle of poverty," a popularized shorthand which meant that they lacked

employment or were underemployed and were politically disenfranchised.

The War on Poverty which was launched under the auspices of the Federal

government included, therefore, programs such as the Job Corps   and
                                    —2—

Community Action Programs as well as those specifically aimed at af-

fecting the health needs of the poor such as CHCs, maternal and infant

care programs, children and youth projects, and family planning clin-

ics.

       The programs were not, however, neatly compartmentalized in their

aims: for example, health programs directed at health goals. Conunu—

nity health centers were "... viewed as shotgun attempts to operate'

simultaneously on all action variables."' In fact, proponents of the

CRC program argued that the centers were best used to inject Federal

funds Into the community, act as a locus of legal and political support,

and provide educational training as well as direct employment for conmtu—

nity members. Given this, an evaluation of the medical care component

of the CHCs and more importantly its impact on the community's health

status is not easily accomplished.

       The political and economic climate has shifted during the nearly

two decades of the CRC program's existence. Whatever the reasons,

these are times of fiscal austerity, and the momentum of public initia-

tives has shifted emphasis from equity to efficiency. Health programs

now have improvements in health status as their overriding goal. Other

beneficial outcomes such as improved community employment are welcome

but unnecessary. Moreover, the very existence of a particular health

program is predicated on actual or potential evidence that it is

competitive with alternative programs. As Rush7 recently has written

of the WIC program: "If we are to rationally allocate resources, we

must know whether programs work."
                                      —3—

        The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of the C}IC program

on health levels. That is, we look for an answer to Rush's query:

"Does it work?" Using infant mortality as the underlying health in-

dicator, a time     series   of large counties as the data set, and multi—

variate regression techniques, we investigate the extent to which the

presence of a program in a county affects future mortality. Our esti—

mates control for other determinants of infant mortality such as income

and   health   manpower availability. Although CHCs are not limited in

terms of the types of services provided or the age classes of those

receiving services, we focus on infant mortality because it is gen-

erally accepted that where infant mortality rates are high health

levels in all segments of the population are likely to be low.8

Moreover, CUCs were designed in part to service target populations

with high infant mortality rates. tn addition, all centers must pro-

vide prenatal and post partum care and voluntary family planning ser-

vices, each of which can have substantial impacts on infant mortal—

           To the extent that health benefits of CBCs are conferred on

other members of the population, our findings will understate and

thus provide conservative estimates of the impact of the centers on

health status.

                               I.   Methods and Data


        To estimate the effects of CUCs on health status, alternative ver-

sions of infant mortality multiple regression equations or impact func-

tions are fitted. The two     basic   equations are given by


                      +
                          ic1_i + a2c_i +           +
                                                        a4mj_i
                                                                           (1)




                      +   E
                              8Pi1 +           + B6mj_i                    (2)




In equation (1)       is the infant mortality rate in the 1th county of

the United States in year t, c_1 is the per capita number of cotnmu—

nity health centers in the th county in year t—i, ci is the square

of the per capita number of centers,         is a vector of other determi-

nants of infant mortality such as family income and the per capita

number of physicians, and           is the infant mortality rate in year

t—l. In equation (2) the per capita number of C}lCs and its square are

replaced by a set of four dichotomous variables given by

i —   1, 2, 3, 4. Here pi1 equals one if the initial service date of
the ith CRC in the th county (the year in which the CHC began to de-

liver   medical care services) was as early as or earlier than year t—l.
Four dichotomous variables are employed because very few counties in
our   sample (described below) had more than four CHCs during the sample

period (1969—1978).

        Equation (1) constitutes a quadratic specification of the effects

of CRCs on infant mortality, while equation (2) constitutes a

dichotomous variable specification. Both specifications are employed
                                     —5—

because   the appropriate way to measure the size of public programs such

as CHCs and their impacts on health status remains an open issue.           This

is particularly true in our case because we have no data on the utiliza—

tion or expenditures of CHCs. Moreover, the medical care services that

they deliver are intended to affect the health of all segments of the

poverty population and not just pregnant women and infants.          The qua-

dratic specification allows for nonlinear effects from the placement of

additional centers in the same county, at least on a per capita basis.

That is, the health "returns" to the centers could diminish as more are

added if they simply compete for the same population. On the other hand,

health    "returns" could increase if the greater presence of centers prompts
still greater acceptance and use of their services.
         The dichotomous   variable specification allows for more flexible non—

linearities than the quadratic specification and, in the absence of county—

specific time series on the size of the poverty population, permits us to

explore alternatives to per capita measurement. Note that the regression

coefficients of p1, p2, p3, and pl+ give the marginal effects of the place-

ment of CHCs on infant mortality. The coefficient of p1 compares counties

with no CHCs to those with one CRC. The coefficient of p2 compares coun-

ties with two CNCs to those with one, and the coefficient of p3 compares

those with three to those with two. Finally, the coefficient of p4 com-

pares counties with four or more CHCs to those with three. The sum of

the four coefficients gives the difference in mortality rates between

counties with four or more CHCs and those with none.

         The specification of the impact functions recognize explicitly the

plausible proposition that CUCs will affect infant mortality with a lag

rather than instantaneously. The equation assumes a one—year lag be—

tween the year in which a dC       begins   to deliver services   and its
                                    —6—

initial impact on infant mortality. To allow for the possibility that

the length of the initial impact lag is more than one year, two— and

three—year lag models also were estimated in preliminary research. The

results of these models (not shown) did not improve upon those of the

basic equations, possibly because of the gross nature of the CIIC mea-

sures. The members of the Xj    vector   are not lagged because some vari-

ables can affect infant mortality within a relatively short period,

particularly those that do not represent new innovations in the medical

care delivery system for poverty populations.

         Theoretically, the lagged infant mortality rate is an important

variable to include in the regression equations because CHCs were de-

signed to service target populations with poor health indicators. Con-

sequently, estimates of their impacts are biased toward zero if the

initial level of the mortality rate is omitted from the regression.

That is, the presence of a center would be associated with high mortal-

ity. The use of the lagged rate as an independent variable also con-

trols for unmeasured determinants of infant mortality that are corre-

lated with the included variables. In addition, the effects of the

placement of a CHC in a county will fall over time if there are upward

trends   in the percentage of the eligible population serviced and the
amount of medical care delivered and diminishing returns to care.
Simultaneously,   mortality differentials between counties with CHCs and

those without them will widen over time. Both these effects are cap—
                                                                             *
tured   by including the lagged infant mortality rate in the regressions.



   *
    This   point can be demonstrated in a simple fashion by employing

equation (2) and by assuming that counties either have one CHC or

none. Suppose that county 1 receives a CHC in year t—l while county 2


                                                  (continued on next page)

          As the last comment and the footnote suggest, either equation (1)

or equation (2) is a distributed—lag model because the effects of CHCs

on infant mortality are spread over a number of periods. For instance,

Clearly, these equations imply that rates of change in infant mortality

in county one decline over time (in absolute value since                               is nega-

tive), while mortality differentials between county one and county

two grov over time.

 impact. The latter term shows the difference between the infant mor-

 tality rate in a year in the distant future and the rate in the year

prior to the increase in the CHC variable. Since the lagged infant

mortality rate is held constant in regressions (1) and (2), they con-

stitute a short—run model of the impact of CHCs.

        Note that the basic model may be viewed as the result of apply-

ing a Koyck13transformation to an infinite—lag distributed—lag model

with geometrically declining weights.* Because the assumptions that

underlie the Koyck lag structure are somewhat restrictive, an ad hoc

distributed—lag model also is estimated. The quadratic version of

this model is

The county—specific infant mortality rate (mw) in the initial year of

the time series (1969 in our sample) is included in these regressions

to control for the placement of CHCs in counties with poor health in—

dicators.* In principal such regressors as, for example,

etcetera should be included in equation (3) to make it an ad hoc

distributed—lag model. These variables are omitted because the appro-

priate lag structure is not known and because multicollinearity among

members of the distributed—lag vector of CRC variables is high. Given

this high degree of correlation, we Interpret the coefficients of the

          In   addition to relaxing the assumptions that underlie the Koyck

 lag structure, estimation of the cumulative model is desirable because

 it is possible that the short— and long—run effects of CHCs are under-

 stated in the Koyck model. This occurs if the contemporaneous

 correlation between a CHC measure and the infant mortality rate [for

example, the correlation between              and m1_1 in equation (1)] be-
                                      c11,1
 comes negative after some point in time. Initially, this correlation

will be positive, reflecting the placement of CHCs in counties with

above average infant mortality rates. Ultimately, however, it may

become negative if c2 has a substantial impact on                  and if

the correlation between
                             c2 and c1 is positive and fairly large.
Under these circumstances, part of the impact of         c1i n        may be

captured by              Therefore, we view long—run effects computed from

the Koyck model as lower—bound estimates.

youth   projects, and family planning centers, are omitted from the regres-

sions. CHCs may be substitutes or complements for these components of

the delivery system. They are substitutes if the availability of another

program lowers the utilization of CUCs and complements if the reverse

holds. For example, if a CRC and a family planning clinic are located

in the same county, utilization of family planning services at the CRC

may be smaller than if there were no family planning clinic. On the

other hand, the existence of a CRC and a maternal and infant care

project in the same proximity may encourage utilization of both via

referrals.

        Strictly speaking, if different types of projects tend to be lo-

cated in the same areas, the omission of the other projects under-

states the impacts of CHCs on infant mortality if these projects

are   substitutes for CHCs and overstates the impacts of CHCs if they
are complements. The reverse conditions hold if the presence of a CRC
in a county is negatively related to the presence of other projects.
But, as the preceding examples illustrate, the direction of the bias

is not certain because locational patterns are not clear and because

CHCs may be substitutes for some projects and complements for others.

Moreover, the inclusion of the lagged mortality rate controls in part

for   the effects of other projects. Finally, it might be   difficult to

disentangle   the effects of specific projects because of multicollin—
earity.

       During   our sample period, the U.S. infant mortality rate fell at

an annually compounded rate of approximately 5 percent per year. The

lagged infant mortality rate obviously is negatively related to time.

Therefore, in the short—run specification, the former variable controls

in part for the effects of time1 and a time trend is omitted from the

regression models. This is because the inclusion of a time trend

creates serious problems of utulticollinearity, especially since the

data span a short nine year period. Since m10 replaces m11 as a re-

gressor in the cumulative model, unmeasured trend effects are not held

constant in that model, This factor alone biases upward in absolute

value the CHC effects in the cumulative model. Note, however, from

the previous footnote that the omission of certain members of the dis-

tributed lag vector of CHC variables biases downward the cumulative

effect. Therefore, biases due to the omission of time are mitigated.

Regression results without time are presented in the next sectio:1 and

we indicate how these results are altered when time is included,



   *
    A potential remedy to problems associated with time trends and

serial correlation is to take first differences of all variables.

We did not employ this approach because it assumes that the regres-

sion residuals exhibit first—order serial correlation with a serial

correlation coefficient equal to one. Preliminary results led to a

rejection of this key assumption. The estimation of the precise

nature of a serial correlation process, particularly in models

with lagged dependent variables, is difficult, frequently has a high

standard error, and is sensitive to alternative specifications. Con—

sequently, we did not pursue this approach.

       The basic   data set employed in this paper is the Area Resource

File (ARF). The ARF is a county—based data service, prepared by

Applied Management Sciences, Inc., for the Bureau of Health Profes-

sions, Health Resources Administration, U.S. Department of Health and

Human Services. It incorporates information from a variety of sources

for 3,077 counties in the United States. These counties also can be

aggregated into larger geographic areas such as county groups, Standard

Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and states. Deaths by age, race, and

sex for the years 1969 through 1978 are obtained from the National

Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Tape.     Births by race

for those years are obtained from the NCHS Natality Tapes. County—

specific time series pertaining to health manpower and facilities come

from the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Associa-

tion, and other sources. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics

for 1970 are taken from the 1970 Census of Population and from other

sources for years before and after 1970. We have added Information on

the location and initial service dates of CUCs to the ARF. This infor—

niatlon Is derived from the Bureau of Community Health Services Common

Reporting Requirements data tape (the BCRR tape).



   *
    Since we use race— and age—specific infant mortality data (see

below), the death data are based on the August 1978 and December 1980

versions of the ARF. Deaths for 1978 were provided to us directly by

Applied Management Sciences.

            In   the regression estimates, a distinction is drawn   between   the
 two    components of infant mortality: neonatal mortality and postneo—

 natal mortality. Neonatal mortality refers to deaths of infants

 within the first 27 days of life. Postneonatal mortality refers to

 deaths of infants between the ages of 28 and 364 days. Neonatal

 deaths are usually caused by congenital. anormalies, prematurity, and

 complications of delivery; while postneonatal deaths are usually

 caused by infectious diseases and accidents. Since the causes of the

 two types of infant deaths are dissimilar, CHCs may have different ef-

 fects on each. This possibility is examined by using the neonatal,

postneonatal, and total infant mortality rates as alternative depen-

dent variables. In addition separate regressions are fitted for white

infant mortality and for black infant mortality as well as regressions
                                         *
for    infant mortality of all races.        This is because black infant mor-

tality rates are much higher than white rates.

            Counties rather than states or SMSAs are used as the units of ob-

servation. As indicated by their name, CHCs are intended to serve the

residents of particular communities, and counties are the smallest

geographic areas on the ARF. On the other hand, SMSAS and states are

very large and sometimes heterogenous. Income, medical resources, and

other relevant variables may vary greatly within an SMSA or a state.

Since counties are much more homogeneous, these problems are reduced in

       In   the non—race—specific regressions, the dependent variable pertains

to whites, blacks, and other races. All infant mortality rates are ex-

pressed as deaths per thousand live birth8.

our research. A weakness with the use of counties is that the small size
of some of these areas may mean that people may receive medical care out-

side the county. Moreover, the small number of births in certain counties

may increase the importance of random movements or "noise" in the deter-

mination of regression coefficients.

        We reduce these problems with county data by including in the re-

gressions only counties with a population of at least 50,000 persons in

1970. A county must also have at least 5,000 blacks for inclusion in the

black impact regressions. There are 678 counties in the white regressions
                                               *
and 358 counties in the black regressions.         In addition to selecting

large counties, we attenuate random elements by estimating weighted re-

gressions, where the set of weights is the square root of the total or

race—specific number of births.

        There are nine alternative dependent variables in the regression

equations: the total, white, and black infant mortality rates; the

total, white, and black neonatal mortality rates; and the total, white,

and   black   postneonatal mortality rates. The lagged rate on the right—

hand   side of each equation corresponds to the rate that is being used as
the dependent variable. The first observation on the dependent variable
pertains    to 1970 and   the last observation pertains to 1978.   This   is
because    the age— and race—specific infant death series begins in 1969




     *One county with a population greater than 50,000 in 1970 was elimi-

nated from the sample because it was     the only such county characterized
as   an isolated rural county with no incorporated place with a popula-

tion of a least 2,500 persons in 1970.

 and ends in 1978. Thus, the regression equations    are fitted to a time
 series   of the 678 largest counties (358 in the case of the black regres-

 sions) of the U.S. for the period 1970—1978.

         The roles of the CHC variables, the lagged infant mortality rate,

 and the initial (1969) infant mortality rate in the regressions have

 been discussed in detail. In the non—race—specific regressions, the per-

 centage of nonwhite births controls for the higher death rates of non-

white babies. Real median family income and office—based physicians in

private practice per thousand population have been stressed conceptually

and empirically as basic determinants of infant mortality in previous re-

search8'15'16 and are included in the regressions. Race—specific family

income is employed as a regressor in race—specific regressions. In all

cases money family income is divided by the Consumer Price Index to ob—
                        *
tam real family income.    Only the regression coefficients of the CHC

variables are presented in the next section. It is important to realize,



   *
       Race—specific median family income in 1969 by county is available

from the 1970 Census of Population. Complete time series are obtained

by assuming   that the year—to—year percentage change in   race—specific
median    family income equals the year—to—year percentage change in per
capita income for all races. The same procedure is employed to com-
pute   a time series of median family income for all races. In the   mor-
tality   regressions for all races, it makes little difference whether

income is given by median family income or per capita income since the

two variables are highly correlated. We select median family income

to be consistent with the race—specific regressions.

sense that the impacts of the variables just mentioned are held con-

stant. (The full regression estimates are contained in the Appendix6)

                                     II.   Results


         Table 1 contains regression coefficients of the community health

 center measures (CRC, the number of centers per thousand population,

 and CHCSQ, the square of the number of centers per thousand population)

 and related statistics in the two versions of the quadratic specifica-

 tion. The first version is the Koyck or short—run model and is ob-

 tained by including the relevant lagged infant mortality rate as a

 regressor. The long—run effects in that model obtained by dividing the

 CRC coefficients by one minus the coefficient of the lagged infant mor-

 tality rate, are shown in brackets. The second version of the quadratic

specification is the cumulative model and is obtained by replacing the

lagged infant mortality rate with the mortality rate in 1969. For

reasons discussed in Section I, the CRC coefficients in the cumulative

model are alternative estimates of long—run effects.

         The results in Table 1 indicate that community health centers in

general have negative and statistically significant impacts on the

alternative infant mortality rates studied. The coefficient of CRC is

negative and significant in sixteen of eighteen cases. The exceptions

pertain to the two white postneonatal mortality regressions. The co-

efficient of the square term always is positive, which implies that

there are diminishing returns to the placement of centers, at least on
a per capita basis. It should be noted that the significance of the
CRC coefficients   is not an artifact of the nonlinear specification.
When the square term is omitted, the sixteen negative CRC coefficients

                                 — 19



of CRC that "minimizes" the relevant infant mortality rate (that is, the

value of CRC beyond which the infant mortality rate begins to rise) falls

outside the range of all observations.

      The CRC regression coefficients associated with the dummy varia-

ble specification are presented in Table 2. Recall that the four

dichotomous variables denote whether the initial service date of the

first (P1), second (P2), third (P3), or fourth (P4) CRC in a given

county was as early as or earlier than year t—l. The results in Table 2

are less clearcut than those in Table 1. Fifty—seven of the seventy—

two regression coefficients (or 79 percent of the coefficients) are

negative, but only twenty—three of the negative effects are significant.

The hypothesis that no member of the set of four dichotomous variables

has a nonzero effect is accepted in six of eighteen cases at the 5 per-

cent level of significance and in eight of eighteen cases at the 1 per-

cent level of significance (see the F—ratios in Table 2). The

marginal effects of the placement of additional CIICa in the same county

do not demonstrate a consistent pattern. For example, in the short—run

infant mortality regression for all races, the mortality differential

between counties with one CRC and counties with two CUCs (.3 deaths per

thousand live births) exceeds the differential between counties with one

CRC and those with none (.1 deaths per thousand live births). In addi-

tion, the excess mortality of counties with three CHCs compared to those

with two (less than .1 deaths per thousand live births) is smaller than

the excess mortality of counties with three CBCs compared to those with

four (.2 deaths per thousand live births).

          In   spite of the above points, the findings in the two   tables    are

 consistent with each other. Both sets of results contain the implica-

 tion that the growth in CHCs during the l970s has contributed to the
 decline in infant mortality during that period. Both sets are shown
 because of the exploratory nature of this research and the crude

 measurement of the CHC variables. The negative effects that emerge

 from the quadratic and dichotomous variable specifications and from

 the short—run and cumulative versions of each specification strengthen

 our confidence in the basic findings. Since the coefficients of

 determination in the quadratic specification (not shown) are at

 least as large as (and frequently larger than) the corresponding co-

efficients in the dichotomous variable specification, the former is

preferred to the latter. This suggests that it is important to take

account of the size of the clientele of CHCs. Surely the number of

users is positively related to the size of the population.

         So far we have said nothing about the magnitudes of the negative

impacts of CHCs on infant mortality. To address this issue, we ex-

amine the net or partial contribution of the centers to overall re-

ductions in the nine infant mortality rates between 1970 and 1978 in

Table 3. Specifically, we apply the regression coefficients of the

preferred quadratic specification to trends in the CHC measures in

period under consideration.* To illuminate the nature of the

computations, note that the total infant mortality rate of all races
fell by 5.9 deaths per thousand live births, from 19.6 in 1970 to

13.7 in 1978 (see Table 3, row 1, columns l_3).** Based on the Koyck

model, the short—run contribution of the CHC system to this reduction

amounts to .1 deaths per thousand live births or 2 percent of the

decline.     The preceding computation ignores, for example, the reduction



     *(continued)
where c69 is the mean of the per capita number of CHCs in 1969, and C77

is   the mean of the per capita number of centers in 1977. These means

pertain to the sample of 678 counties    in the white and non—race specific
regressions    and to the sample of 358 counties in the black regressions.

They are weighted by the year—specific total or race—specific number of

births. Means for 1969 and 1977 are employed because the CUC variables

are lagged one year in the regressions. The long—run contribution in

Table 2 is the absolute value of [cz1(77 — c69)    + 277 — c69)1/ (1—ct4).
Based on the notation in equation (3), the cumulative contribution is the

absolute value of y1(c77 — c69) + y2(c77 —    c69).

 in infant mortality in year t due to an increase in the per capita num-
 ber of CHCs in year t—2. When these effects are incorporated, the
 long—run contribution is obtained. It amounts to a drop of .3 deaths

 per thousand live births or 5 percent of the observed decline. An

 alternative estimate of the long—run effect is provided by the cuinula—

 tive    model. The absolute and percentage variants of this estimate are
 contained   in the last two columns   of Table 3. In the case of the
 total   infant mortality rate of all races, the long—run and cumulative

 contributions are almost identical.

         The twenty—four computations of declines in various infant mortal-

ity rates due to the CHC system range from a low of less than .1 deaths

per thousand live births (the short—run contribution to the decline in

the non—race—specific postneonatal mortality rate) to a high of 1.2

deaths per thousand live births (the cumulative contribution to the

decline in the black total infant mortality rate). When these effects

are expressed as percentages of the observed reductions, they range

from a low of 2 percent in several instances to a high of 18 percent

in the instance of the long—run black postneonatal contribution. In

general the cumulative effects are slightly larger than the correspond-

ing long—run effects. The close agreement between these two alterna-

tive sets of estimates underscores the robustness of the computations.

According to the figures in Table 3, CHCs have larger absolute effects

on neonatal mortality than on postneonatal mortality. When, however,

the contributions are expressed as percentages of the observed declines,

the postneonatal impacts exceed the neonatal impacts. In part this

finding reflects the fact that the postneonatal mortality rate is much

smaller than the neonatal mortality rate.
                                    — 23 —




        The most notable finding in Table 3 is that CHCs have larger un—

pacts on black infant mortality (total or age—specific) than on white

infant mortality. This result emerges whether the effects are ex-

pressed as absolute contributions to observed reductions or as con-

tributions as percentages of the corresponding reductions. This

result   is particularly striking in light of the well—known higher
infant   mortality rate of blacks. A reduction in the excess mortal-

ity rate of black babies has been identified as a goal of public

health policy for a number of years. Our results suggest that

community health centers have the potential to make a substantial

contribution to the achievement of this goal. In particular, the

long—run reduction in the black total infant death rate between 1970

and 1978 due to the CRC system amounts to one death per thousand live

birth or approximately 12 percent of the observed decline. In appre-

ciating the significance of such a decline, it is important to keep

in mind that the centers were designed to affect the health of all

segments of the poverty population and not just infants and pregnant

women. Hence, there are many competing demands on their scarce re-

sources: the goal of improvements in the delivery of prenatal care,

perinatal care, and care for infants under the age of one competes in

the allocation of CRC resources with the goal of improvements in the

delivery of medical care services to children beyond the age of one

and   adults.
        Table 4 contains alternative summary measures to those in Table 3

of the effects of community health centers on infant mortality. Spe—

cifically, cumulative mortality differentials between counties with

four   or more centers and those with no centers are shown. Each race—

and age—specific differential in the table is the sum of the regression

coefficients of the four dichotomous variables in the relevant cumula-

tive model. This model is used in the computations because it embodies

more flexible assumptions about the nature of the lag structure than

the Koyck model. The figures in the table suggest a substantial pay-

off to counties that have pursued an aggressive policy of investment in

CHCs. For whites the total infant mortality rate in such counties

(those with four or more CHCs)   is   smaller than the rate in counties

with no centers by 1.5 deaths per thousand live births. The compara-

ble figure for blacks is a whopping 2.9 deaths per thousand live births.

Put differently, counties that have invested substantial resources in

CHCs appear to have reduced both their white and black infant mortality

rates by 10 percent when compared to counties that have made no invest-

ments in CHCs.

       Still, some caution must be exercised in interpreting these results.

We have stressed the difficulties with an empirical evaluation of as gen-

eral a concept as the CHC and the techniques involved In such an evalua-

tion. For example, the regression coefficients of the CHC variables are

reduced in magnitude and lose their statistical significance when a time

trend is included in the regressions. Given the short nine—year time

span of our sample, this finding is not surprising. We wish to emphasize,

however, that pure time effects in regression models are measures of

ignorance. In this context it Is important to note that our model does

at least   as good a job in explaining variations In   infant   mortality
rates as   a model in which eight time dummy variables alone are used as
                                   — 25 —




regressors.    Frequently, our model outperforms the pure time model based

on the relevant coefficients of determination. Clearly, more research

on the effects of CHCs on infant mortality is appropriate. Neverthe-

less, given the variety of evidence that we have presented and the

robustness of this evidence to alternative specifications, we feel

that   it is reasonable to conclude that there is significant evidence
that the centers have contributed to reductions in   infant   mortality.

                               III.    Discussion

       Since 1964 the U.S. infant mortality rate has declined at an annu-

 ally compounded rate of more than 4 percent per year. This is an ex-

 tremely rapid rate of decline compared to the decline of less than 1

 percent per year during the prior decade, 1955 to 1964. Our study is

 the latest of several to attribute important roles in the dramatic fall

 in the infant mortality rate during the past two decades to a number

 of public policies and programs. Using a very different methodology

 from the one employed in this study, Grossman and Jacobowitz9 report

 that the increase in the legal abortion rate was the single most im-

 portant factor in reductions in white and black neonatal mortality

 rates between 1964 and 1977. In turn, the growth in the legal abor-

 tion rate occurred because of the reform of restrictive state abortion

laws starting in 1967, the ruling by the Supreme Court in 1973 that

restrictive state laws were unconstitutional, and the Federal and state
                                                   *
funding of abortions for poor women under Medicaid, Grossman and
Jacobowitz also find that the growth in the use of organized family

planning services by low—income women due to the expansion in Federal

subsidies to clinics that deliver these services produced declines in

race—specific neonatal mortality rates. Moreover, they indicate that



   *Under the Hyde Amendment, which was in effect from June 1977 until

February 1980 and continually since July 1980, Federal funding of

abortions under Medicaid is banned except in cases when the woman's

life is in danger. Note that, although we exclude the legal abortion

rate from our regressions, we control for its effects by including

the lagged infant mortality rate.

the delivery of prenatal and perinatal health services to poor pregnant
women by maternal and infant care projects and the financing of these

services under Medicaid caused reductions in black neonatal mortality.
                               17                            *
Results    in studies by Hadley     and by Chachere and Verona support

Grossman and Jacobowitz's conclusions with respect to abortion and to

Medicaid financing of prenatal and perinatal care. Taken together,

these three studies and our study indicate that public financing and

delivery of medical care services (defined to include abortion ser-

vices and family planning services) can have substantial impacts on

the health of the poor.

         A full cost—benefit or cost—effectiveness analysis of the comsu—

nity health center program vis—a—vis other programs to reduce infant

mortality, such as the construction and subsidization of neonatal in-

tensive care units, is beyond the scope of this paper. Our results

suggest, however, that the CHC system may have a very favorable cost—

benefit ratio. The impact of the program on infant mortality, espe-

cially black infant mortality, appears to be substantial. Moreover,

the cost of the program probably is smaller than the cost of con-

structing and maintaining sophisticated neonatal intensive care units

if, for example, these were competing programs. In addition, the CHC

system's benefits are understated in our research because the centers

deliver services to all age—classes of low—income people and cart

affect health measures besides infant mortality.

        Clearly,   our research findings are relevant with regard to the

  current policy debate on the effectiveness, efficiency, and ultimate

  fate of public health policy in general and the CRC system in particu-

  lar. The growth of the CRC system has been curtailed sharply in real

 terms by the Reagan Administration's
                                         budget cutbacks. Although the
 centers were exempted from the Administration's
                                                    block grant program in
 the fiscal 1982 budget,
                           starting in 1983 individual states have the

 option to take over the CRC program or leave it in Federal hands. In

 the fiscal 1983 budget, the centers are combined with family planning

 clinics, migrant health centers, and black lung clinics into a single

 block grant. Moreover, a provision under which states that choose to

 take control of the program must match a portion of the Federal
                                                                 support
 is eliminated. If the CHCs are relatively inefficient producers of

 ambulatory medical care services and have little or no impact on health

levels, the policies of the Reagan Administration have some merit. On

the other hand, if the centers
                                  are relatively efficient, the merit of
these policies can be questioned.

      Our results seriously challenge the conventional wisdom that pub-

lic sector production is less efficient than private sector production.

We have shown in this study that the CHC system has played an impor-

tant role in recent reductions in infant
                                           mortality, especially black
infant mortality. In addition, in another study,18we have found no

evidence that allocative inefficiency (increases
                                                   in production costs
due to the use of inappropriate
                                  combinations of inputs) is more
                                — 29 —




widespread among CHCs than among private sector physicians. Although
there are statistically significant departures from cost—minimizing

behavior in the CRC system, their impacts on the cost of ambulatory

medical care are modest. To be specific, the cost saving associated

with the use of a more appropriate combination of physicians, physi-

cian aids, and medical support personnel amounts to 6 percent of the

CRC system—wide total cost of ambulatory medical care in 1980. Thus,

we conclude from our two studies that the CRC program is an effective

vehicle to achieve the goal of improvements in the health of the

poor. Substantial improvements appear to have been accomplished, and

the costs in terms of departures from the optimal utilization of in-

puts appear to be small. Our results suggest that infant mortality

rates, especially black rates, may fall more slowly than otherwise

and may even rise if the CRC program is subjected to substantial

budget cutbacks. In general this study and the related studies dis-

cussed in this section raise serious questions with regard to current

public health policy.

      Ordinary least squares regression estimates of the Koyck or short—

run model are contained in Tables Al, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, and

A9. Each table pertains to one of the nine alternative infant mortal-

ity rates. Both the dichotomous variable specification and the qua-

dratic specification are shown. Estimates of the cumulative model are

not shown.

      The notation in the tables is as follows. Variable names ending

in an asterisk denote race—specific measures.
