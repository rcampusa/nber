                                             ABSTRACT

This paper documents some previously neglected features of sectoral shares at business cycle frequencies
in OECD economies. In particular, we find that the nontraded sector share of output is as volatile
as aggregate GDP, and that for most countries, the nontraded sector is distinctly countercyclical. While
the standard international real business cycle model has difficulty in accounting for these properties
of the data, an extended model which allows for sectoral adjustment along both the intensive and extensive
margins does a much better job in replicating the volatilities and co-movements in the data. In addition,
the model provides a closer match between theory and data with respect to the correlation between
relative consumption growth and real exchange rate changes, a key measure of international risk-sharing.

          This paper documents some previously neglected features of sectoral shares
      at business cycle frequencies in OECD economies. In particular, we …nd that
      the nontraded sector share of output is as volatile as aggregate GDP, and that
      for most countries, the nontraded sector is distinctly countercyclical. While
      the standard international real business cycle model has di¢ culty in accounting
      for these properties of the data, an extended model which allows for sectoral
      adjustment along both the intensive and extensive margins does a much better
      job in replicating the volatilities and co-movements in the data. In addition,
      the model provides a closer match between theory and data with respect to
      the correlation between relative consumption growth and real exchange rate
      changes, a key measure of international risk-sharing.

1     Introduction
Output shares of traded and nontraded goods sectors have been changing secularly
over time. As is well known, the service sector has experienced secular expansion,

while traditional sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, have contracted. In
addition to this well-recognized long-run structural change however, output shares
of the traded and nontraded sectors has shown signi…cant business cycle movements.
This paper studies the business cycle properties of traded and nontraded goods sec-
tors. We …rst document that the standard deviation of nontraded output share is
around 2.3 percent in a sample of OECD countries during 1970-2007 period. Non-
traded output share is at least as volatile as aggregate output. In addition, we …nd
that nontraded output share is strongly countercyclical for almost all countries. We
then construct a theoretical model to account for these properties.
    Fluctuations in the nontraded output share can be due to changes at the intensive
margin as existing …rms in di¤erent sectors adjust their output in response to sectoral
demand and supply conditions; or due to the changes at the extensive margin that
occur due to the emergence of new …rms, or …rms reallocating across sectors. Existing
literature has focused on the intensive margin, and has had di¢ culty in matching the
volatility and cyclicality of sectoral output shares. In this paper we …rst document this
disagreement between theory and data, and then provide an extension of the standard
framework to account for empirical regularities. In particular, we extend a standard
two-sector international business cycle model to allow for …rm heterogeneity and an
extensive margin in sectoral reallocations. This framework allows us to quantify
the contribution of each margin to sectoral output volatility and co-movement. We
also investigate the role played by the extensive margin in sectoral reallocation for
international business cycles and cross country risk-sharing.
    We start by documenting the properties of the nontraded output share in a con-
ventional two-sector model of international business cycles. We show that this model
does a poor job in matching the regularities we documented above. We proceed by
extending this benchmark framework to allow for an extensive margin in sectoral
adjustments. In particular, we introduce endogenous tradability, where in response
to sector-speci…c shocks, …rms decide which sector to locate in. These decisions to
re-allocate across sectors are driven by pro…t maximization of heterogenous …rms, sub-
ject to international transportation costs and …xed costs of exporting. We show that
in the presence of endogenous tradability the performance of our model improves on
several dimensions. First, it produces a more volatile nontraded output share as …rms
shift across sectors in response to productivity shocks. Second, the model produces a
countercyclical nontraded output share, consistent with the data. Finally, the model


                                           2
is able to improve on a number of business cycles moments, and in particular, the
model does a better job at explaining the observed consumption real exchange rate
correlation than does the standard model. Thus, the extensive margin of adjustment
provides a better model for understanding the pattern of international consumption
risk sharing.


2        Empirical facts
We report the properties of the nontraded output share using the OECD STAN data-
base for the 1970-2007 period. Nontraded output is de…ned based on the traditional
industrial classi…cation, according to United Nations classi…cation system. The dis-
tribution of sectors into tradables and nontradables is summarized in Table 1. The
nontradable share is constructed as the ratio of nontraded output to aggregate output
for each country.

    Figure 1 illustrates some of our …ndings. The …gure illustrates the cyclical compo-
nents of aggregate output, nontraded and traded output, and the nontraded output
share for the U.S. during the1987-2007 period. Clearly, the nontraded output share is
volatile (equally as volatile as nontraded output itself), and strongly countercyclical.
    This result for the U.S. is con…rmed in a broader sample of OECD countries. Ta-
ble 2 summarizes our …ndings by reporting the standard deviation of the nontraded
output share (column (i)), its correlation with aggregate output (column (ii)), and
the standard deviation of aggregate output (column (iii)).1 All countries exhibit sig-

ni…cant volatility of the nontraded output share at the business cycle frequency. The
average standard deviation of nontraded output’s share across countries is 2.26 per-
cent. Note that this volatility is comparable to the volatility of aggregate output for
our sample of countries. Furthermore, the nontraded output share is countercyclical
for the vast majority of countries in the sample. The average correlation of the share
of nontraded goods with aggregate output is -0.28.
    Having established these basic properties of the data, we now turn to a theoretical
model which can be used in accounting for the empirical regularities.


3    Model
We consider a conventional two-country model with incomplete asset markets. This
type of model has been used extensively in the literature to study the properties of
international business cycles and cross country risk sharing. A world economy in our
model consists of two symmetric economies, home (h) and foreign (f). Each country
is populated by a continuum of …rms and households. We describe the problem faced

3.1    Households
Households residing in country h supply Lh units of labor inelastically to domestic
…rms in return for the wage rate wt : We assume that labor is perfectly mobile across
sectors within a country, but not across countries. Households derive utility from
consuming two goods: a composite tradable, C t and a domestic nontradable, C n . In
particular, preferences of h households are given by:

                                        X
                                        1
                                              s       t      n
                                   Et             U (Ct+s ; Ct+s );                             (3.1)
                                        s=0


where 0 < < 1 is the discount factor, and U (:) is a concave sub-utility function.
Let all goods available to h households in period t be normalized to a [0,1] interval.
We denote each individual good on this interval by index i: Further, let it denote the
endogenous time-t share of goods that are non-traded. Then, at time t household


                                                    5
consumes a nontraded goods basket de…ned over a continuum of goods Itn = [0; it ]
and a traded goods basket de…ned over a continuum of goods Itt = [it ; 1]: In what
follows we show that the measures of Itt and Itn are determined from the …rms’pro…t
maximizing decisions. The utility function of h household can be written as:

                                     1          h                                                             i1        1 !
          U (Ctt ; Ctn )   =                               1
                                                     t (it )    (Ctt )     +    n (it )
                                                                                          1
                                                                                               (Ctn )                         ;
                               1         !

where ! is the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity. Here t (it ) and n (it ) =
1    t (it ) are the weights of tradable and nontradable consumption in the aggregate

consumption basket; and are endogenous functions it . In the Appendix A.2 we show
that n (it ) = it and t (it ) = 1 it : The elasticity of substitution between tradable
and nontradable consumption is (1         ) 1 > 0:
   A composite tradable good, Ctt ; is given by a CES aggregator over tradables
produced in the h and f countries:
                                                                                                   1
                           Ctt =             h (it )
                                                    1
                                                          (Cth ) +       f (it )
                                                                                1
                                                                                      (Ctf )            ;

where (1      ) 1 > 0 is the elasticity of substitution between tradable goods. Here
 h (it ) and f (it ) = 1 h (it ) denote the weights that households in country h assign

to the consumption of h and f-produced tradable goods. Again, these weights are
endogenously linked to the shares of non-traded goods in the two countries as:

                                     1         it                                              1        ^{t
                   h (it )   =                                 and          f (it )   =                             ;
                                 2       it         ^{t                                   2        it         ^{t

where ^{t is the nontraded share in country f in period t. Hereafter we will use a hat,
"^", over a variable to denote f country variables.
    The key feature that distinguishes the preference structure outlined above from the
one used commonly in the open-economy macro models is the endogenous nature of
consumption expenditure weights. This is the outcome of the endogenous tradability
feature of our model.
    Each consumption basket is a CES aggregate of individual goods. For instance,
period-t consumption aggregates in country h are given by:




                                                                6

    See Appendix A.2 for the full derivations. Note also that by de…ning consumption
aggregates in this way we rule out "love for variety" e¤ects, which are characteristic
of Dixit-Stiglitz aggregators. In doing so we follow the tradition of the standard
international business cycle models, in which consumption aggregates are de…ned
over a constant measure of varieties.2
    Let pt (i) denote the price of good i. Then the consumption-based price indices
for di¤erent consumption baskets in country h are given by:

                           =(   1)       R it              1

                                                                                             di;                      i 2 In

    Households in each country …nance their consumption expenditures with wage
income and pro…ts, t ; received from domestic …rms. Households also have access to
international borrowing and lending at interest rate Rt . We assume that bonds are
denominated in units of internationally tradable goods produced by country h.3 As
a result, asset markets in our model are incomplete.
    The period t budget constraint of households living in country h can be written
as

                                     1 h
 Pth Cth + Ptf Ctf + Ptn Ctn +         P Bt                        Pth Bt          1    + (Ltt + Lnt + fx (1                it )) wt +   t;   (3.2)
                                     Rt t

where Bt denotes period t holdings of the international bond, Pt is the h country
price of internationally traded goods produced in country , with = fh,fg; and
Ltt ; Lnt denote aggregate labor employed in the production of internationally tradable
   2
       In the numerical results we check the robustness of our …ndings when the "love of variety" e¤ect
is incorporated in the calculation of consumption.

       The denomination of the bond does not in‡uence our results.




                                                                             7
and non-tradable goods, respectively. The term fx (1 it )wt denotes the wage pay-
ments received by domestic labor that was hired by the domestic …rms to cover the
…xed cost of exporting, fx : We discuss this issue in detail below.
   Using the household’s …rst-order conditions, we can now de…ne the household
demand for each individual good i belonging to the di¤erent consumption baskets as

                         ct (i) =    1
                                    it
                                         (pt (i)=Ptn )1=(      1)
                                                                    Ctn ;        i 2 In
                         ct (i) =    1

                                            (pt (i)=Pth )1=(        1)
                                                                         Cth ;   i 2 It                    (3.3)
                         ct (i) =    1
                                    1 ^{t
                                            (pt (i)=Ptf )1=(        1)
                                                                         Ctf ;   i 2 It

Note here, that the terms with it appear in the expressions above, as we account
for the fact that the set of varieties over which aggregates are de…ned can expand or
contract.
    Preferences of f households are similarly de…ned in terms of the tradable con-
sumption basket, C^tt ; and a nontradable consumption basket, C^tn : The tradable con-
sumption basket in f country is de…ned symmetrically in terms of h tradables, C^th ;
and f tradables, C^tf ; as
                                h                                          i1
                          C^tt = ^ h (^{t )1 (C^th ) + ^ f (^{t )1 (C^tf )    :

Here ^{t denotes the endogenous time-t share of goods that are non-traded in country
f. Households in the f country face the budget constraint:

                                    1    ^t
 P^th C^th + P^tf C^tf + P^tn C^tn + Pth B            ^t
                                                  Pth B     1
                                                                  ^t + L
                                                                + L t
                                                                       ^ n + fx (1
                                                                         t                ^{t ) w^t + ^ t ; (3.4)
                                    Rt

      ^t denotes the bond holdings of f households. As noted previously, goods
where B
produced in country h are set as numeraire.


3.2     Firms
Each country specializes in the production of a continuum of goods, indexed by i 2
[0; 1]: Each di¤erentiated good i is produced using constant returns to scale technology
in just one input, labor, lt (i):

                                             yt (i) = Xt A(i)lt (i):

                                                        8
Here Xt is the total factor productivity (TFP), and A(i) is the good/…rm-speci…c
productivity. Productivity di¤erences across …rms give rise to …rm heterogeneity.
Firms can sell their output in two markets: in the domestic (national) market and
abroad (international market).4
     We de…ne the ‘nontraded’(n) sector as a sector comprising of …rms that sell their
goods only on the domestic market, while all …rms that also sell on the international
market, we de…ne to comprise ‘traded’ (t) sector. These are the goods that form
the corresponding consumption baskets of the households. We assume that TFP is
sector-speci…c and a¤ects all …rms who choose to locate in that sector equally.
     Exporting to a foreign country is costly. In order to export, it is necessary for a …rm
to incur a …xed cost, denoted by fx ;. In addition, there are ‘iceberg’transportation
costs, I . As in Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and Bergin and Glick (2005), we assume
that …rms hire domestic labor to cover the …xed costs of exporting. Transportation
costs are common to all producers.
     Di¤erences in productivities also imply di¤erent unit costs of production across
…rms. In particular, if, as before, we let wt denote the wage rate in country h measured
in units of a numeraire good, then wt =Xt A(i) represents such unit costs in country h.
Further, in each destination market, a …rm faces a constant elasticity of substitution
(CES) demand function, which we derived in equations (3.3). For instance, when
selling in the domestic market in country h; …rm i faces demand function given by
ct (i), while c^t (i) denotes the country f’s demand for good i. When making a decision
of which market to service, the …rm decomposes its pro…ts into parts earned from
national sales and potential international sales. In particular, these components for
a …rm i operating in country h can be written as:
(i) pro…ts from national sales:

                                t (i)   = pt (i)ct (i)           wt
                                                                       c (i);
                                                                Xt A(i) t
                                                                                i 2 In               (3.5)



(ii) pro…ts from international sales:
                   (
                                          wt       1
                       p^t (i)^
                              ct (i)     Xt A(i) 1
                                                           c^t (i)   fx wt ;    if …rm exports
       ^ t (i) =                                       I
                                                                                                 :   (3.6)
                       0;                                                       otherwise
   4
     In our setup, it will be the case that a …rm that decides to export internationally, will also sell
its products in the domestic market.

                                                                9
    In this setup, the maximization problem of a …rm i operating in country h yields
a mark-up pricing rule. In particular, for goods sold on the domestic markets, prices
are
                                     1 wt
                            pt (i) =              i 2 I n.
                                      Xt A(i)
Prices for goods sold in the international market are

                                           1     wt      1
                              p^t =                                                     i 2 I t.
                                               Xt A(i) 1                    I


Here 1 is constant markup, linked to the elasticity of substitution across di¤erent
varieties of traded and nontraded goods. Due to the …xed costs of exporting, …rms
with lower productivity levels will choose to sell in the domestic market. When making
this decision, a …rm computes potential pro…ts from export sales after accounting for
the …xed costs of exporting. A …rm will export if and only if these pro…ts are non-
negative, that is

                  p^t (i)^
                         ct (i)           wt
                                         Xt A(i) 1
                                                   1
                                                       I
                                                           c^t (i)              fx wt      0       i 2 I t.

A …rm for which ^ t (i) = 0 will pin down the threshold index it of the marginal …rm
that will export. In particular, let A(i )     inffA : ^ t (i) > 0g be a productivity
cut-o¤ level. Then all …rms with productivities below with cuto¤, A(i) < A(i ), will
only sell in country h, while the …rms with A(i) > A(i ) will also be able to sell in
country f. Firms operating in country f face a similar problem.
    Following Melitz (2003) and Bergin and Glick (2005), we de…ne "average" produc-
tivity levels –average A –for …rms producing di¤erent categories of goods in country
h:
                                                           Z       i

Our focus is on aggregate dynamics, and as shown in Melitz (2003), the average pro-
ductivities are su¢ cient to characterize these dynamics. We can now de…ne average


                                                               10
goods prices in terms of these productivity averages. In particular, prices of goods
sold on the domestic market in country h are given by:

                                         1 wt                           1 wt
                                 Ptn =           ;              Pth =           :                             (3.7)

Here Ptn ; Pth denote prices of internationally-nontraded and internationally-traded
goods, respectively, in country h. Prices of goods that originated in country h and

                                          @Ut =@Cth   Pth

These equations de…ne the relative prices of f traded goods, and h nontraded goods
in terms of h international tradables as ratios of their respective marginal utilities to
the marginal utility of h tradables. In the bond economy, the …rst-order conditions
also include
                                                 h

which is the standard pricing equations for the bond. The …rst-order conditions for
f households are symmetric.

    In equilibrium, households and …rm decisions must also be consistent with the
market clearing conditions. The market clearing conditions in the nontraded goods
sector are
                  ct (i) = yt (i) and    c^t (i) = y^t (i); i 2 I n:

   In equilibrium, the world demand for each internationally-traded good must be
equal to its corresponding supply:

                           ct (i) + c^t (i)                        = yt (i);      i 2 It

                                                   1          I


Here c^ [c ]; i 2 t is consumption demand for internationally-traded goods produced
in h [f] country and sold in the f [h] country, as de…ned before.
    Labor market clearing in each region within country h requires

                           0                        ^{t


where L (L)    ^ is the exogenously given labor supply in country h [f].
      We also require an asset market clearing condition. We assume that bonds are in
zero net supply, so that bond market clearing condition is Bt + B      ^t = 0.
      An equilibrium in this economy consists of a sequence of goods prices {Pth , Ptf , P^th ,
P^tf , Ptn , P^tn } and an interest rate Rt ; such that households in both countries make
their consumption and bond allocation decisions optimally, taking prices as given;
…rms in both countries make their pro…t maximizing decisions; and all markets clear.


3.4     Variables of interest
In our economy there is a sequence of price indices that comprise regional and inter-
national real exchange rates. To simplify the notation, we omit explicit references to
i in the consumption weights, h ; f ; n ; t :
    Recall that Ptt denotes the price of the aggregate internationally traded consump-
tion basket in country h. It is composed of prices of internationally traded goods in


                                                                  12
country h:
                             h                                                 i       1

                     Ptt =                  h
                                 h (it ) (Pt )
                                                 1    +               f
                                                           f (it ) (Pt )
                                                                           1               :       (3.11)

The aggregate price index in country h, therefore, is given by
                             h                                                 i       1

                     Pt =        t (it ) (Pt )
                                                 1   +    n (it ) (Pt )
                                                                           1               :       (3.12)

The price indices in the foreign country are symmetrically de…ned. The price of
aggregate internationally traded consumption basket in country f is given by
                            "                                                      #       1

                    P^tt = ^ h (^{t ) P^th            + ^ f (^{t ) P^tf                        ;   (3.13)


while the aggregate price index in country f is
                                                                                           1
                                                 1                             1
                    P^t = ^ t (^{t )    P^tt         + ^ n (^{t )   P^tn                       :   (3.14)

   The international real exchange rate in our model, RERt ; is given by the ratio of
f to h aggregate price indices:
                                             P^t
                                   RERt = :                                   (3.15)
                                             Pt
The terms-of-trade in the model are de…ned as a relative price of foreign to domestic
internationally-traded goods and are given by T OTt = Ptf =Pth :
    The nontraded output share in the domestic economy is computed as Ptn Ytn =Pt Yt ;
where Ytn and Yt are, respectively, real output produced in the nontraded sector, and
on aggregate in the h economy.


4    Parameter values and computations
Parameter values for the calibration of our benchmark model are summarized in Table
3. We consider the world economy as consisting of two symmetric countries, roughly
matching the properties of the US economy in annual data. Most of the preference
parameter values are standard in the literature and, in particular, follow closely those
adopted by Stockman and Tesar (1995). In particular, is set to 0.96 to obtain
the steady-state real interest rate of 4% per annum. The coe¢ cient of relative risk

aversion, !; is set to 2. The values for substitution elasticities are chosen as follows.
First, the value for is set, following Mendoza (1995), to obtain the elasticity of
substitution between tradable and nontradable consumption equal to 0.74. Second,
the elasticity of substitution between h and f traded goods is set to equal 6 to obtain
a 20% mark-up of price over marginal costs, a value commonly used in the literature
(Obstfeld and Rogo¤, 2000).

    We parameterize the …xed cost of the exporting parameter, fx ; in both countries
to obtain the share of nontradables in aggregate consumption expenditure, n and ^ n ;
equal to 0.55 in the steady state. This number is calculated using OECD STructural
ANalysis (STAN) database.5 We set the shares of home goods in the internationally-
traded consumption basket in both countries, h and ^ f ; to 0.5 in the steady state,
so that there is no consumption home bias built in exogenously in the model. Instead
we calibrate the international iceberg transportation costs to match the share of
international imports to be equal to 10% of output in the steady state.
    The available estimates for sectoral productivity processes in the literature are
very dissimilar (see, for instance, Corsetti et al., 2008; Benigno and Thoenissen,
2008; Tesar, 1993; Stockman and Tesar, 1995), thus we assume independent pro-
   5
    These numbers are similar to the estimates in the literature. For instance, Corsetti et al. (2008)
and Dotsey and Duarte (2008) use n = 0:55, Stockman and Tesar (1995) report n close to 0.5;
Pesenti and van Wincoop (2002) also argue that 0.5 of consumers budget is allocated to nontradables;
Benigno and Thoenissen (2008) assume n = 0:45.

ductivity processes across sectors, across regions and across countries. Each of the
productivity processes follows an AR(1) process. The AR(1) coe¢ cients are all set
to 0.9. Innovations to internationally traded productivity have standard deviation of
0.01, while innovations to internationally nontraded productivity are half that size.
These numbers are consistent with the empirical …ndings that traded productivity
exhibits more volatility than nontraded productivity (see Dotsey and Duarte (2008)).
We parameterize good/…rm-speci…c productivity following Bergin and Glick (2005)
as Ai = (1 + i); with = 1:
    The model is solved by linearizing the system of equilibrium conditions and solv-
ing the resulting system of linear di¤erence equations. To make our bond economy
stationary, we introduce small quadratic costs on bond holdings. We study the prop-
erties of the model’s equilibrium by simulating it over 100 periods. The statistics
reported in the next section are derived from 200 simulations.


5       Results
Table 4 summarizes the results from model simulations. We start by characterizing
the properties of a production economy with no …rm heterogeneity due to …rm-speci…c
productivity (panels (i) in the Table). This simpli…cation eliminates the endogenous
non-tradability feature in our model and reduces the setting to a standard interna-
tional business cycle economy with a representative …rm in each country. Then we
allow for …rm heterogeneity and consider a production economy with endogenous
tradability (panels (ii) of the Table). The statistics for the U.S. during 1970-2007
period are presented in the row labelled "U.S. Data".6
    Without endogenous tradability, our model has been used extensively in the lit-
erature to study international business cycles, terms of trade and real exchange rate
movements (see Tesar, 1993; Corsetti et al., 2008; Benigno and Thoenissen, 2008).
The international business cycle properties of this version of our model, therefore, are
standard. Some of the usual shortcomings of international business cycles models are
present in our case as well. In particular, while the model matches well the majority
of volatilities of macro aggregates, it considerably underpredicts the volatilities of
    6
     To compute all cross-country or international correlations we used the data for the U.S. and
the rest of the world during 1973-2007 period. The latter was constructed as a weighted aggregate
of Canada, Japan and 19 European economies. See Appendix A for details on data sources and
calculations.


                                               15
international relative prices. Given our focus on the nontraded sector share we also
report the volatility of the nontraded share relative to the volatility of GDP. This
number is 0.4 –well below its value of 1.05 we estimated in the OECD data.
    In terms of correlations, the model does well at matching the co-movements of
consumption, traded sector employment, imports and net exports with output, but
predicts counterfactual co-movements for international relative prices and exports
with output. For the new variable of interest – the nontraded output share – the
model predicts it to be strongly countercyclical, in excess of what we measured in
the data. Finally, when it comes to cross-country correlations, the model predicts
positive cross-country correlation for consumption and output, consistent with the
data; but negative for labor inputs, in contrast to the data.
    Models similar to ours, with no endogenous tradability, have also been used exten-
sively to study the degree of international risk-sharing. E¢ cient risk sharing in this
model implies that expected relative consumption growth should co-move positively
with expected real exchange rate changes. Numerous studies have noted that this pos-
itive co-movement is absent in international data. This discrepancy has been labeled
the ‘Backus-Smith-Kollman’puzzle, (after Backus and Smith (1993) and Kollmann
(1995)). We compute a similar correlation in our model and …nd it to be positive,
as earlier studies have documented. This correlation is positive and high when we
consider both levels and growth rates of the two variables (0.3 in levels and in growth
rates). In contrast, in the OECD data this correlation is negative, both in levels and
in growth rates.
    Overall, focusing just on the properties of the nontraded output share, the model
predicts too little volatility in that share relative to the data, and too much negative
co-movement with output relative to the data.
    Next, we consider a version of the model with …rm heterogeneity and endogenous
tradability. The results are summarized in panels (ii) of Table 4. This extended
model performs similarly to the version with a representative …rm for a majority
of macroeconomic moments. However, it signi…cantly improves the …t to the data in
several key dimensions. First, it generates more volatile labor input in both the traded
and nontraded sectors, almost matching the numbers found in the data. Second, the
extended model predicts nontraded output share whose properties closely line up with
the data. In particular, it raises the volatility of nontraded share to 0.89 (relative to
1.05 in the data), and raises its co-movement with output to -0.28, thus replicating it

in the data exactly. Third, an important improvement in the model with endogenous
tradability is the fact that it predicts signi…cantly lower degree of international risk-
sharing relative to the model with a representative …rm. In particular, the correlation
between relative consumption and the real exchange rate in this version of the model
is 0.03, in both levels and growth rates – much closer to the values observed in the
data. This correlation, however, remains positive, implying that endogenous non-
tradability per se is not su¢ cient to completely resolve the Backus-Smith-Kollman
puzzle.8


6        Discussion
To understand the results above it is useful to consider how our model economy
responds to various shocks. Thus we present the impulse responses of various macro-
economic aggregates and prices following sectoral productivity shocks in the home
country. It also proves useful to decompose the real exchange rate into its compo-
nents. In particular, in Appendix A.3 we show that the log international real exchange

     The model with endogenous tradability implies that the measure of varieties available for con-
sumption is changing over time. To account for this, we adjust the measurement of consumption
to account for expanding varieties and re-compute the correlation between this adjusted measure of
consumption and the real exchange rate. We …nd that the results remain relatively unchanged. In
particular, the correlation is 0.04 in levels and 0.03 in growth rates.

0, then the improvements in the terms of trade will be associated with the real ex-
change rate appreciation. Furthermore, any variations in the relative price of non-
traded goods in the two countries will also contribute to real exchange rate movements
to the extent of the weight of nontraded consumption in the aggregate consumption
basket of the two countries, n 2 and ^ n 2 .


6.1      No endogenous tradability
We begin by discussing the adjustments to sectoral shocks in the simpli…ed version
of the model with no …rm heterogeneity and endogenous tradability. In the model
the productivity shocks can originate in two sectors: internationally traded (t) and
internationally nontraded (n).
    Figure 2 illustrates the adjustments of key macroeconomic variables to a positive
1% t productivity shock in the h country. The top panels show impulse responses
of t, n, and aggregate output, as well as the nontraded output share. The bottom
…gures illustrate the responses of relative consumption, the real exchange rate and
its components (from the decomposition in equation (6.16)) to the same shock. In
   9
     A similar decomposition is also derived in Benigno and Thoenissen (2008) in the context of a
two-country two-sector model with no iceberg trade costs.


                                                                            18
response to a positive t shock, h traded output goes up relative to country f’s traded
output. As a result, h terms of trade deteriorate, which tends to depreciate the real
exchange rate. This e¤ect, however, may be counterbalanced by the movements in
the relative prices of nontraded goods. The latter will arise from two sources. The
…rst is due to a standard Balassa-Samuelson e¤ect, where a positive productivity
shock in the t sector will trigger an increase in the real wage, thus driving up relative
prices of nontraded goods; the latter adjustment is necessary to prevent all labor from
reallocating into the traded sector and out of the nontraded sector. This is a supply
side e¤ect and we refer to it as the resource-shifting channel.
    The second e¤ect arises from the CES structure of preferences and the desire of
households to consume a balanced basket of traded and nontraded di¤erent good.
Thus, following a productivity improvement in the t sector, domestic households
experience a positive wealth e¤ect, which leads them to increase their demand for
nontraded goods, which in turn will drive up their prices. This is the demand-side
e¤ect and we refer to it as the demand-composition channel. In our model these two
e¤ects dominate the fall in the terms of trade and, as a result, positive productivity
shocks in the t sector are associated with real exchange rate appreciation and an in-
crease in relative consumption. This gives rise to the negative Backus-Smith-Kollman
correlation.
    What do these adjustments imply for the nontraded output share? An increase in
the output of traded goods, combined with the contraction of labor in the nontraded
sector lead to a drop in the nontraded output share. This fall is accompanied by a
rise in domestic GDP, thus implying that the nontraded share is countercyclical.
    Positive shocks that originate in the n sector have the opposite e¤ect on the real
exchange rate. Figure 3 illustrates the adjustments after a 1% positive shock to n
productivity in country h. Such n sector shocks lead to a fall in the relative price of
nontraded goods, thus depreciating the real exchange rate. Given the low elasticity
of nontraded demand, this price decline is large. The fall in the relative price of non-
traded goods lowers the value marginal product of labor in the nontraded sector, lead-
ing to an out‡ow of workers into the traded sector. Output of traded goods in country
h thus rises relative to the foreign economy. This resource-shifting channel leads to
a terms of trade deterioration in the economy experiencing a positive n productivity
shock. This e¤ect is, however, weak. Thus, positive shocks to the n productivity
lead to a real exchange rate depreciation and an increase in relative consumption,


                                           19

implying a positive correlation between consumption and real exchange rates, and
working against the resolution of the Backus-Smith-Kollman puzzle. Quantitatively,
we …nd that nontraded shocks dominate the adjustments of the real exchange rate,
thus leading to an overall positive correlation between relative consumption and the
real exchange rate in the model. The reason is that in the presence of an international
bond, households can smooth out the e¤ects of t shocks much better than the e¤ects
of n shocks. The e¤ects of the former, therefore, are moderated through bond trade.
    The reallocation of workers from the nontraded sector into the traded sector, com-
bined with a large fall in the relative price of nontraded sector output lead to a con-
traction in the nontraded output share. Thus, the model prediction of countercyclical
behavior of nontraded output share remains robust to the origin of productivity shocks

6.2    With endogenous tradability
Next, we consider the impulse responses arising in the model with endogenous trad-
ability. Top panel in Figure 4 summarizes the responses of t, n, and aggregate output,
as well as n output share to a 1% positive shock to t productivity in country h. The
bottom panel of Figure 4 does the same for relative consumption, the real exchange
rate and its components using the decomposition in equation (6.16). Notice that all
responses presented in Figure 4 are qualitatively similar to the responses obtained
in the version of the model with no endogenous tradability in Figure 2. The key


                                         21
di¤erence between them, however, lies in the magnitudes of the responses. As before,
t sector output and aggregate output rise following the shock, but these increases
are much larger with endogenous tradability. Also, n sector output falls as in the
model with no tradability, but does so by a larger amount. The reason behind these
ampli…ed adjustments in output is the extensive margin in sectoral reallocation. In
the model with no endogenous tradability studied earlier, following a positive shock,
labor was reallocating from the nontraded sector into the traded sector. That is, the
adjustment on the supply side was taking place at the intensive margin, through the
labor employment per …rm. With endogenous tradability, the intensive margin is still
present. However, it gets ampli…ed by the extensive margin as more …rms enter the
export market in country h.
    In our model …rm reallocations closely resemble sectoral movements of labor.
Thus, in response to t productivity improvement, unit production costs in the traded
sector decline, providing higher pro…ts to …rms operating in that sector and higher
potential pro…ts from international sales (higher demand elasticity for traded goods
in comparison to demand elasticity for nontraded goods is key for this result). As a
result, some less-productive …rms that previously serviced the national market only
will …nd it pro…table to export. The threshold index it that de…nes the sectoral split
will shift to the left to include these less productive producers. The size of the traded
sector thus expands, while the size of the nontraded sector contracts. With fewer
nontraded goods produced, the relative price of these goods goes up by more, making
the real exchange rate appreciate by a larger amount. The extensive margin thus
ampli…es the adjustments relative to the representative …rm economy, making the
e¤ects of t shocks on macro aggregates and relative prices more pronounced.
    A similar intuition applies to n sector productivity shocks. Figure 5 presents
impulse responses following a positive 1% shock to nontraded productivity in home
country. As before, this shock is accompanied by an increase in n output and a fall
in the relative prices of n goods. The fall in prices brings down the value marginal
product of labor leading to workers moving out of the n sector and into the t
sector. The fall in the value marginal product of labor also lowers unit costs of
production in the traded sector, leading to marginal …rms relocating from n sector
into t sector. Thus, the increase in n output after a positive productivity shock in
that sector is mitigated by both labor and …rms moving out of n sector into t sector.
Quantitatively, however, this e¤ect turns out to be small. The adjustments in the t


                                           22
Figure 4: Impulse responses after 1% positive shock to T sector productivity in
country H: With endogenous tradability




sector are more signi…cant –there the output rises twice the amount it did with no
endogenous tradability.
    With incomplete markets, this magni…es the positive wealth e¤ects to domestic
households, allowing them to raise their consumption further. Thus relative consump-
tion goes up by more in the economy with endogenous tradability. But again, this
e¤ect is quantitatively small.
    Overall, we …nd that introducing endogenous tradability increases the respon-
siveness of the nontraded output share, no matter the sector of productivity change.
When productivity in either sector improves it leads to a fall in the share of nontraded
goods in the aggregate output. This is due to both workers and …rms reallocating
away from the n sector and into the t sector. These reallocations tend to amplify the


                                          23
Figure 5: Impulse responses after 1% positive shock to N sector productivity in
country H: With endogenous tradability




adjustments following t shocks, but moderate the adjustments following n shocks.
This result becomes particularly important for Backus-Smith-Kollman correlation
which depends very sensitively on the relative strength of the two sectoral shocks.
Since t shocks produce a negative correlation between relative consumption and real
exchange rate, and because the e¤ects of these shocks are ampli…ed in the presence
of endogenous tradability the most, we …nd that Backus-Smith-Kollman correlation
falls and thus becomes more aligned with the data in this version of the model.

7    Conclusion
This paper has documented some previously neglected features of sectoral shares at
business cycle frequencies in OECD economies, and has shown that while the standard
international real business cycle model has di¢ culty in accounting for these properties
of the data, the extended model which allows for sectoral adjustment along both the
intensive and extensive margins does a much better job in replicating the volatilities
and co-movements in the data. In addition, the model provides a closer match between
theory and data with respect to the correlation between relative consumption growth
and real exchange rate changes, a key measure of international risk-sharing. The
model of the paper may be extended in a number of dimensions, such as allowing
for physical capital accumulation, habit persistence in consumption preferences, and
alternative sources of shocks. Doing so may improve the match between model and
data. In its current form, however, the model suggests that the endogenous extensive
margin of adjustment in open economies o¤ers a rich vein of analysis in explaining
properties of international business cycles.

Consider the …nal consumption aggregate. It consists of internationally nontraded
goods and a basket of internationally traded goods. The latter can be produced
by local …rms or imported from the foreign country. Recall that all local …rms are
located on [0; 1] interval. Firms that produce internationally nontraded goods occupy
[1; i ] interval, where i is the threshold export index in a given country. Domestic
internationally-traded goods are produced by …rms located on (i ; 1] interval. We
append this continuum of local …rms by a [1; 2 ^{ ] measure of foreign …rms that can
export their goods to the home country market. As a result, the consumption basket

A.3           International RER
In order to derive the decomposition for international RER, we log-linearize aggregate
consumption price indices as follows. The log-pice of aggregate price index in country
h can be written as

                                                           Pt                            Pn

                                                                                                    1   pnt

                                                           Ph                            Pf

                                                                                                    1   pft
                                                                     Pf

A similar set of conditions applies to the foreign country. We de…ne international
RER as a relative price of foreign to domestic consumption basket. Thus RER can
be written as
                                   rert = p^t pt :

Substituting in the de…nitions above, we get

                                                   1
         rert =     h        f       1
