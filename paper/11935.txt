                                           ABSTRACT

This article examines revealed rates of time preference for public goods, using environmental quality

as the case study. A nationally representative panel-based sample of 2,914 respondents considered

a series of 5 conjoint policy choices, yielding 14,570 decisions. Both the conditional fixed effect

logit estimates of the random utility model and mixed logit estimates implied that the rate of time

preference is very high for immediate improvements and drops off substantially thereafter, which

is inconsistent with exponential discounting but consistent with hyperbolic discounting. The implied

marginal rate of time preference declines and then rises. Estimates of the quasi-hyperbolic

discounting parameter range from 0.48 to 0.61. People who are older are especially likely to have

a high disutility from delays in improving water quality.

        The rate of discount plays a central role in evaluating many policy decisions. As

with other long-term choices, such as those for personal savings, policy choices today

may have profound long-term consequences. At the extreme, current policies may have

ramifications that will be manifested at the end of this century, as in the case of global

climate change. Although there is a substantial literature addressing the normative issue

of the appropriate rate of discount for policy evaluation, the behavioral properties of

individual rates of time preference are also consequential because these preferences will

provide the basis for the public’s political support.1

        Unfortunately, individual rates of time preference may not always exhibit

properties associated with the usual intertemporal economic models of rational choice.

The conventional exponential discounting model weights utility payoffs in year                    by a

discount factor ( ), where

                                                Φ(Τ) = δ Τ                                               (1)

and δ = 1 / (1+ r ) , where r is the rate of interest. A series of experimental studies that

typically have employed student subjects have documented a variety of inconsistencies of

the discount rates revealed by individual behavior with the exponential discounting

model.2

        The most widely used alternative to exponential discounting is hyperbolic

discounting. Hyperbolic discounting rates place an especially large weight on immediate

payoffs as compared to deferred payoffs, inducing patterns of time inconsistency.3 The

widely used quasi-hyperbolic discounting approach employed by Laibson (1997) is

useful because of its analytic simplicity and clear-cut contrast with the exponential

model. The quasi-hyperbolic formulation for discrete time periods yields discount factors

    ( ) given by {1, λδ, λδ 2 , λδ 3 ,...} , where 0 < < 1, and δ < 1.4 The discount factor terms

involving δ are all multiplied by a parameter except in the initial period. The

discussion here and below will be in discrete time rather than continuous time because

our survey data consists of valuations with respect to four discrete periods of delay.

           The approach here will depart from the literature in several ways. First, we

estimate rates of time preference based on a series of policy choices administered in a

survey context. Rather than using an experimental structure with a small convenience

sample, we use a survey methodology drawing on a large nationally representative

sample. From this sample we estimate average and marginal rates of time preference and

ascertain how these change based on individual characteristics.

           Second, we estimate rates of time preference using a random utility model,

employing both conditional fixed effect logit and mixed logit approaches. Our estimates

of the role of discounting consequently will be based on a theoretically appropriate model

of discounted utility rather than money.

           Third, our study will test whether the hyperbolic discounting phenomenon is due

to the shape of intertemporal preferences or whether uncertainty regarding future payoffs

is generating the preference for immediate rewards. Put differently, we will estimate the

the form Φ (Τ ) = (1 + ρΤ )
                            −ω / ρ
                                , where the parameters , ρ > 0 . Concerns with time inconsistency date
back to Strotz (1956).

quasi-hyperbolic discounting parameter and explore whether this term is due to the

nature of time preference or a perceived probability that deferred payoffs are less likely to

be received than immediate payoffs.

        Fourth, the experimental structure will pertain to a publicly provided good,

environmental quality, rather than a financial outcome. The potential importance of

hyperbolic discounting for environmental decisions has been recognized by Cropper and

Laibson (1999), and there have been numerous studies of discounting for regulatory

outcomes such as lives saved at different times in the future.5 However, no study to date

has presented experimental or empirical evidence pertaining to hyperbolic discounting for

publicly provided goods.

        Section 2 introduces the policy choice task, which requires that respondents pick

the most highly valued alternative from among these policies defined on three

dimensions, including improvements in water quality at different times. Section 2 also

describes the sample and the validity tests of the methodology. This formulation permits

the estimation of a logit model with fixed and random parameters across respondents in

Section 3. These models yield information on rates of time preference as a function of

different periods of delay. The mixed logit models permit individual heterogeneity in the

parameter values and relax two key assumptions of the conditional logit model. We

demonstrate the robustness of the results by showing that the two models yield very

similar results. Section 4 explores the quasi-hyperbolic discounting parameter and the

issue of whether uncertainty regarding future payoffs is the influence generating the

apparent hyperbolic discounting pattern. In Section 5 we explore the variables that

account for some of the heterogeneity in time preference, and Section 6 summarizes our

results and their implications.

                             2. Choice Task and Sample Description

Survey Structure

        Our study uses an original survey in which each respondent considered a choice

task such as that presented in Figure 1. The general research strategy was to elicit

respondents’ valuations of improvements that would begin after different periods of

delay. Respondents make five choices among three policy options, where each is defined

on three dimensions: year when improvement begins, amount of water quality

improvement, and cost of the policy per year. Before considering the choices,

respondents receive detailed information regarding the water quality and cost dimensions

of the choices. In the choice task, the respondent indicates the most preferred choice

among the different policy alternatives. The first dimension in Figure 1 is the year when

improvement begins, which we will refer to below as time delay. The amount of time

delay is zero, two, four, or six years. The second dimension is the amount of water

quality improvement, which is the percentage of lakes and rivers in the respondent’s

region that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rates as being “good” for

fishing, swimming, and quality of the aquatic environment.6 The percentage

improvement ranged from 5 percent to 20 percent. Finally, each of the policies generates

costs ranging from $100 to $400. The choice design was generated using a structure in

which alternatives were balanced with respect to utility (Huber and Zwerina 1996). This

 The survey included an extensive discussion of water quality based on the approach taken by the U.S.
EPA (1994) in its National Water Quality Inventory. See Viscusi, Huber, and Bell (2004) for further
description.


                                                    4
approach increases the amount of information that the choices provide about the

parameter estimates.

         The structure of the survey design makes it possible to identify empirically the

individual’s rate of time preference. In effect, for each different time delay, the survey

structure permits an estimate of how much the respondent would have been willing to

give up in terms of lower water quality or higher cost to remain just as well off. The cost

dimension of the policy choice is not needed to estimate this intertemporal tradeoff rate.

However, inclusion of the cost component increases the realism of the policy choice and

will lead to estimates of the cost-water quality improvement tradeoff that can be

compared with estimates using a different survey methodology as an additional validity

check on the survey.

         The policy choice decisions that respondents faced involved four different levels

of cost, four different levels of water quality improvement, and four different periods of

time delay, one of which was no delay. We achieve identification of the time delay water

quality improvement tradeoff using this formulation by varying the time delay for

different levels of water quality improvement.7

Modeling the Effect of Delay

         The costs and water quality improvements had comparable time dimensions, with

each lasting for five years. However, costs uniformly begin immediately while the

benefits begin after 0-6 years. Thus the time discounting considers the value in present

dollars of the level of improvement or of having the improvement occur sooner. To see

the relationship between the present value of costs and improvements, consider the


7
  As an identification check, we also estimated a variety of linear and quadratic specifications and found
that the results were robust. See Rust (1994) for further discussion of identification issues.


                                                      5
standard exponential discounting case. There is a delay of t years before the

improvement begins. Let the person’s utility function be additively separable and linear

in cost c and water quality improvement w, and let the time period of delay be t.8 Then

the present value of the five year imposition of costs beginning immediately is

    [                   ]
c 1 + δ + δ 2 + δ 3 + δ 4 . Similarly, the present value of water quality benefits after a t year

                            [                     ]
delay is given by wδ t 1 + δ + δ 2 + δ 3 + δ 4 . Since the bracketed terms are identical, the

person’s decision reduces to ascertaining whether the value of c is greater than wδ t . Put

somewhat differently, the cost imposition will be worthwhile if the utility of the water

quality improvement in a given year is at least as great as (1 + r)t multiplied by the utility

of the annual cost. Similarly, 1/(1 + r)t units of water quality that will result from

improvements begun immediately will be equivalent to a unit of water quality

improvement begun after a period of t years. In each instance, the fact that the costs and

improvements occur over a five-year period drops out of the analysis, as it serves to

establish a policy context and to put costs and time durations of water quality

improvements on a comparable basis.

         Matters become a bit more complicated based on the quasi-hyperbolic discounting

                                                                     [
model. The present value of the cost stream becomes c 1+ λδ + λδ 2 + λδ3 + λδ 4 . If the         ]
                                                               [                            ]
benefits begin immediately, the present value is w 1 + λδ + λδ 2 + λδ 3 + λδ 4 . The policy is

attractive if the utility of the annual water quality improvement w exceeds the disutility of

                                                                                      [

The bracketed expression and the term are present for all nonzero periods of delay.

8
  We also assume that the discount rate is the same for costs and for improvements. This assumption
facilitates the theoretical discussion and is the norm in the literature, but it is not essential for the
interpretation of the empirical results because the cost time stream never varies.

Consider the five year stream of water quality improvement deferred by t years that is

equivalent to the disutility of the five year cost stream that begins immediately. Let costs

be multiplied by –1 to reflect that fact cost c has a negative utility value. The value of w

must satisfy

                                                                                .         (3)

Compared to the exponential discounting case, hyperbolic discounting boosts the water

quality improvement needed to achieve indifference with the utility of the immediate cost

stream when compared to the exponential discounting case. This relationship reflects the

general phenomenon that hyperbolic discounting differentially reduces the value of all

deferred payoffs by a multiplicative parameter in the quasi-hyperbolic discounting

model. The discussion below will use the exponential discounting case as the reference

point and then examine whether the findings are more consistent with that approach or

hyperbolic discounting.

Sample Characteristics

       In 2004 a group of almost three thousand respondents participated in our

valuation survey. The sample participants were members of the Knowledge Networks

panel, which is a nationally representative computer-based sample. People who do not

have computers are given free internet access through a WEB TV device so that the panel

composition closely parallels the U.S. Census statistics. Sample participants were

compensated for their participation. The response rate to our survey from members of




                                                      7
the panel who were offered an opportunity to participate in the study was over 75 percent.

As documented in Appendix Table A, the demographic profile of our respondent group is

very similar to the mix of the age 18 and over U.S. population.9 We describe the

properties of the sample and present tests of the survey methodology elsewhere.10

         Although the survey is not a contingent valuation survey, it is in the general

family of stated preference surveys, so that it is essential to provide validity tests for the

responses.11 Chief among these tests to be examined below will be a series of scope tests

to ascertain whether subjects prefer more water quality improvement to less and,

similarly, lower values of costs and shorter delays are preferred to higher costs and longer

delays.12 In addition, the survey included an additional series of rationality tests to

determine whether subjects made decisions that did not lead to the choice of a dominated

alternative. Overall, 95 percent of the original sample, or 2,914 individual respondents,

passed the dominated choice test and will constitute the sample considered here.13

         The computer-based survey lasted an average of 25 minutes and included detailed

information pertaining to the meaning of water quality ratings and financial costs so as to

engage people in the survey task. Each of the 2,914 respondents considered a series of

five policy choice tasks, such as that in Figure 1, so that there are a total of 14,570

decisions among the three policies.

9
  The findings in Viscusi, Huber, and Bell (2004) report sample characteristics and tests for influences such
as sample attrition bias and selection effects. That earlier working paper has been augmented by an
additional wave of survey respondents for this paper, and this paper also focuses on a different set of survey
questions.
10
   Magat, Viscusi, and Huber (2000) and Viscusi, Huber, and Bell (2004) describe these other aspects of
preliminary versions of the survey. The current paper provides the first analysis of the questions pertaining
to rates of time preference.
11
   Arrow et al. (1993) discuss the importance of rationality tests as a validation check for stated preference
surveys.
12
   As emphasized by Heberlein, Wilson, Bishop, and Schaeffer (2005), passing a scope test is instructive,
but does not ensure validity.
13
   The empirical estimates reported here are very similar to those obtained using the full sample.

                                          3. Empirical Model

Model Structure

        To analyze the choice task we employ the random utility model developed

McFadden (1974).14 We begin with a conditional logit model and then explore the

sensitivity of the results using a mixed logit formulation. Let Uni be the utility that

individual n derives from choice i. The value of Uni consists of the observable portion

Vni and the unobservable random component                 ni,   or

                                              U ni = Vni + ε ni .                                (4)

The value of the observable component Vni is a function of the policy characteristics Xni

and the personal characteristics Yni. For a given choice set, the value of Yni is the same

across all policy choices, i = 1, 2, 3, so we will designate it Yn. We also permit an

interaction of the policy attributes Xni and the individual attributes Yn, leading to

                                     U ni = X ni + Yn + X ni Yn + ε ni .                         (5)

The probability that individual n chooses policy i is

                                  Pni = Pr ob(U ni > U nj for all j ≠ i ) .                      (6)

Since the Yn term is common to both Uni and Unj based on the construction of the policy

choice task, it plays no role in the estimation, so that the task is to estimate

                  Pni = Pr ob(X ni + X ni Yn + ε ni > X nj + X nj Yn + ε nj for all j ≠ i ) .    (7)

The individual characteristics will enter through the interactions with the three

dimensions of policy choice, or

                                           Vni = X ni + X ni Yn .                                (8)



14
 The notation and formulation that we use here more closely follows that of Train (2003), with
modifications for our survey structure.

We modify this conditional logit formulation to take into account the fixed effects of each

particular policy choice set k given to respondents.15 Let                            k   denote the choice task-

specific intercept. If we modify the model to include this parameter, the general structure

of the model is

                                                                    ψ k + Vnjk

                                                         j=1



but no explicit parameter estimates for           k   are generated.

           The conditional logit model imposes two key assumptions. The most restrictive

assumption is that the random components within each subject are not correlated, which

leads to the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives. A second key

assumption is that the variation in preferences is captured by observed respondent

characteristics included in the model. Below we present comparative results based on a

mixed logit framework that relaxes the independence of irrelevant alternatives

assumption and permits there to be unobserved heterogeneity in tastes.

Scope Tests

           The first set of empirical estimates to be explored is the basic model that includes

only main effects. These estimates will be informative in indicating whether higher cost

levels and longer delays are negatively valued and larger improvements are positively

valued. Thus, the formulation is

     Chamberlain (1980) developed the fixed effects framework for qualitative choice models.


                                                       10
                                U ni = X ni = αw ni + β t ni + γc ni ,                        (11)

where wni is the water quality improvement, tni is the time delay before improvement, cni

is the cost, and all these values are for person n and alternative i. Table 1 presents two

sets of regression estimates for two different samples, where the first sample considers

the responses only to the initial conjoint question and the full sample includes five

observations per respondent. The conditional logit estimates for Question 1 include only

a single observation for each respondent and thus constitute a more rigorous across-

subjects scope test. The estimates for the full sample include observations both across

and within subjects and are conditional fixed effects estimates. The first set of regression

results in each instance is for the continuous versions of the policy choice variables. The

coefficients have the expected signs with more water quality improvements raising the

probability that the alternative is chosen, whereas there is a negative effect of both delay

and cost. The magnitudes of the effects are also very similar for both Question 1 and the

full sample. In each case, all coefficients are statistically significant at the 99 percent

level, two-tailed test. The second set of regression estimates for each of the two samples

focuses on the discrete form of each of the policy choice variables using dummy

variables for three of the four possible variable values. In addition to exhibiting the

hypothesized signs, the magnitudes of the variables follow the expected pattern, as larger

water quality improvements are increasingly valued and longer delays and higher cost

levels become increasingly unattractive.

       These results can also be used to derive the willingness to pay for water quality.

Taking the total derivative of utility and setting it equal to zero yields

                                  dU = αdw + β dt + γdc = 0 .                                 (12)

The marginal value of each unit increase in water quality is given by the marginal rate of

substitution between c and w, or

                                               ∂c − α
                                                  =   ,                                               (13)
                                               ∂w   γ

which is $24.96 for the Question 1 estimates and $23.17 for the full sample.16 Because

our interest in the Question 1 sample is only from the standpoint of an across-subjects

scope test, the subsequent analysis focuses on the full sample.

        As a first step toward estimating the rate of discount, consider the overall tradeoff

between improvement and delay. This marginal tradeoff rate is given by

                                               ∂w − β
                                                  =   ,                                               (14)
                                               ∂t   α

which is 2.235 for the Question 1 estimates and 2.186 for the full sample. For the

midpoint survey structure water quality improvement level of 12.5 percent, the equivalent

water quality with one year of delay based on the full sample estimates satisfies

                                                  12.5 + 2.186
                                         12.5 =                ,                                      (15)
                                                      1+ r

where solving for r yields an average value of r of 17.49 percent. The analogous result

for the Question 1 responses is 17.88 percent. These estimates of the discount rate are

drawn from an oversimplified model that does not permit possible interactions between

time delays and improvements, which from an economic standpoint is the central concern

and which will be the focus of the analysis below.




16
  These values are very similar to the estimates generated with a different survey methodology reported in
Viscusi, Huber, and Bell (2004).


                                                    12
Conditional Logit Estimates of Delay Interactions

       Although respondents may have preferences regarding policy delays generally,

the main matter of interest is how delays affect their valuation of water quality

improvements and what rates of discount are implied by these preferences. To examine

these issues, we formulate three conditional logit specifications. The first set of estimates

in Table 1 adds a Delay x Improvement interaction term to the main effects equation, or

                         U ni = X ni = αw ni + β t ni + γc ni + θw ni t ni .              (16)

The utility gain associated with water quality improvements should be smaller for longer

delays t so that should be negative. The empirical estimates yield the expected negative

effect of the interaction of time delay and water quality improvement. Whereas one unit

of immediate water quality improvement has a value of 0.1438, the value of an

improvement that occurs after one year is (0.1438 – 0.0086) = 0.1352, dropping to

(0.1438 - 6 x 0.0086) = 0.0922 by year 6.

       This simple interaction constrains the effect of delay to be a constant value of

improvement irrespective of the extent of delay. As a result, the marginal effect of long

delays on the implied rate of time preference is greater for long delays than for short

delays. The implied average rate of discount is 6.4 percent for a one period delay, 6.7

percent for the midpoint delay value of three years, and 7.7 percent for the upper bound

delay period of six years. This rising pattern of rates of time preference is the opposite of

the hyperbolic discounting pattern, but the observed pattern is a consequence of the

constraints imposed on the estimation.

       To provide a more realistic picture of how the length of delay affects the discount

rate, the second equation estimated in Table 2 includes a quadratic delay interaction with



                                                13
improvement. This specification permits there to be nonlinearity in the influence of delay

on the valuation of improvements, leading to

                                                                                         2
                       U ni = X ni = αw ni + β t ni + γc ni + θ1 w ni t ni + θ 2 w ni t ni .       (17)

The value of     1   is negative, and     2   is positive, indicating a diminishing effect of delay on

the utility of improvements.

         The quadratic specification generates the temporal pattern of discounting that is

consistent with the hyperbolic discounting model. A one-year delay has an associated

rate of time preference of 10.6 percent. This average rate of time preference declines to

10.4 percent for two years, 10.0 percent at the midpoint delay value of three years, 9.7

percent for four years, 9.2 percent for five years, and 8.5 percent for six years. Though

these rates of time preference seem high relative to the cost of capital and discount rates

used by the government, these estimates are in a more reasonable range than have been

found in many studies of real world choices in product markets and the labor market.17

         Even the quadratic specification imposes some structure on the discount rate

variation with the length of the period, as would other continuous models of discounting.

Because the delay variable can take on only three nonzero values of two (Delay 2), four

(Delay 4), and six (Delay 6) years of delay, we examine a final discrete variable

specification for each of these delay periods that captures the full range of these estimates

given by

     U ni = X ni = αw ni + βt ni + γc ni + ξ 1 w ni Delay 2 + ξ 2 w ni Delay 4 + ξ 3 w ni Delay 6 .(18)




17
  These studies include, for example, the implied discount rates based on appliance energy efficiency
decisions, used car purchases, and decisions involving risky jobs. Frederick, Loewenstein, and
O’Donoghue (2002) provide a review, and Hausman (1979) provides an early example of this approach.


                                                       14
           The introduction of separate categorical variables for the delay periods leads to a

more pronounced effect of the initial period of delay, consistent with the hyperbolic

discounting model. The results in the final column of Table 2 indicate that the effect on

the utility of improvements of a two-year delay is more than half the effect of a six-year

delay. The estimates in the final column of Table 2 can also be used to calculate the

discount factor, or similarly the implied rate of interest. Consider for the general case of

an n year delay, for n = 2, 4, and 6. Since

                                          βδ n = β + ξ n ,                                  (19)

the value of is given by

                                        δ = [1 + ξ n / β ]
                                                         1/ n
                                                                .                           (20)

           The substantial influence of early delays is reflected in the estimated rate of time

preference. For a two-year delay, respondents exhibit a 14.3 percent rate of interest. The

utility loss associated with a four-year delay is very similar to that of a two-year delay,

with the consequence being that the average rate of time preference is 8.4 percent. For

the six-year delay, the average implied rate of interest over that period is 8.7 percent,

which is also well below the initial value of 14.3 percent.

           The value of given by equation 20 is a nonlinear function of the parameters

and   n.   It is nevertheless feasible to construct 95 percent confidence intervals for ,

which are (0.85, 0.89) for a two-year delay, (0.91, 0.94) for a four-year delay, and (0.90,

0.94) for a six-year delay. These estimates for in turn imply confidence intervals for

the rates of time preference r, which in terms of interest rate percent, are (11.8, 17.0) for a

two-year delay, (6.6, 10.4) for a four-year delay, and (6.7, 10.7) for a six-year delay. The

confidence intervals for the four-year and six-year delay are quite similar. The distinctive



                                                 15
confidence interval is for the two-year delay, which is reflective of respondents’ very

different rate of time preference for the more immediate period of delay.

Mixed Logit Estimates

           To explore the robustness of the conditional fixed effect logit estimates, we also

estimate the equations in Table 2 using a mixed logit model. The mixed logit model

generalizes the conditional logit model on several dimensions. First, it does not require

the independence of irrelevant alternative assumption of the conditional logit framework.

Second, rather than assuming homogeneous preferences and estimating a single

parameter for each variable, the mixed logit model yields estimates of the mean and

variance of the individual level parameters, thus providing information on the extent of

individual variation in the coefficient estimates. Third, the estimation approach we use

takes into account unobserved factors that will affect particular policy choices by the

respondent, leading to possibly correlated errors across the repeated choices. The utility

of person n of policy j in choice set k for the analog of equation 16 is

                             U njk = Vnjk = α n w njk + β n t njk + γ n c njk + θ n w njk t njk .   (21)

Note that compared to the parameter estimates in equation 15 above, the values of , , ,

and are now permitted to vary across individuals in the sample rather than estimating a

single value for each parameter. However, for each of the five choice sets, the values of

 n,   n,   n,   and   n   are the same across the choices for the particular individual.

           The particular estimation approach used is the hierarchical Bayes estimation

procedure, which shares the same behavioral model yields estimates virtually equivalent




                                                             16
to mixed logit. 18 The hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedure assumes that each

individual’s parameters come from a mixture of the aggregate distribution of values with

choices that the respondent makes. The mixed logit estimation approach assumes that the

parameter vector is normally distributed with mean b and covariance W, and the error

term ε njk is iid extreme value. The coefficient vector is assumed to be independent of the

stochastic ε and w, t, and c, which are non-stochastic. In contrast, the hierarchical Bayes

procedure treats b and w as stochastic. Both procedures derive their estimates using

simulation methods. The approach takes as its prior estimate of the parameters

coefficient values that account for the derived heterogeneity across respondents and the

individual’s choices. Combining the prior with the likelihood function for the data yields

the posterior distribution. Gibbs sampling is then used to take repeated measures of b and

W from the posterior distribution. Draws are repeated until the conditional posterior

estimates converge. As shown in Huber and Train (2001), the hierarchical Bayes

estimates are virtually equivalent to those yielded by classical maximum likelihood

mixed logit approaches. The mean and variance of the Bayesian estimator are

asymptotically equivalent to the classical maximum likelihood estimates. Moreover, the

hierarchical Bayes estimation is less subject to problems of identification.

        The estimates in Table 3 present the mean value of the estimated coefficients

across the sample as well as the standard deviation of the individual coefficients’ values.

The various coefficients associated with the delay terms have associated standard

deviations that are relatively large, indicating quite substantial heterogeneity in rates of

discount across the sample.

18
  For discussion of the properties of hierarchical Bayes estimates, see Huber and Train (2001) and Train
(2003).


                                                    17
        The mean values of the mixed logit parameters indicate tradeoff rates that closely

parallel the conditional fixed effect logit results. Because the utility scale is invariant

with respect to a positive linear transformation, it is the coefficient ratios and relative

coefficient values that are most instructive. The rates of time preference for the linear

Delay x Improvement interaction are almost identical to the conditional logit estimates:

6.3 percent for a one-year delay, 6.7 percent for the midpoint survey delay period of three

years, and 7.7 percent for the six-year delay period.

        The second column of estimates in Table 3 presents the mixed logit version of the

policy choice equation in which there is both a linear and quadratic delay interaction.

The linear Delay x Improvement interaction is negative, and the quadratic (Delay x

Improvement) interaction is positive, as in the conditional logit estimates. The implied

rates of time preference are consistent with a hyperbolic discounting pattern of declining

rates of interest, with the values dropping from 10.9 percent with a one-year delay to 10.3

percent for a two-year delay, 9.5 percent for a three-year delay, 8.5 percent for a four-

year delay, 7.4 percent for a five-year delay, and 6.2 percent for a six-year delay. The

higher rates of interest for short delays are very similar to the conditional logit estimates,

and there is a declining rate of interest with the extent of delay, but the amount of this

decline is greater for the mixed logit estimates of the mean delay-improvement effects

across the sample, as compared to the overall sample parameter estimates of the

interaction with the conditional logit model.

        The differences between the two sets of estimates are apparent in Figure 2, which

illustrates the discount factors for improvements occurring with different periods of

delay. For the first three years of delay the discount factors are almost identical for the




                                              18
conditional fixed effects logit and mixed logit estimates. Thereafter the discount factor

implied by the mixed logit estimates becomes increasingly greater than that implied by

the conditional logit model, which is a reflection of the somewhat lower average rate of

time preference implied by the mixed logit results.

       The final set of estimates in Table 3 presents the unconstrained estimates in which

the different delay categories in the survey are interacted with the level of improvement.

The implied average rate of interest is 12.7 percent for a two-year delay, 8.0 percent for a

four-year delay, and 7.9 percent for a six-year delay. This pattern accords with the

hyperbolic discounting model in that there is a very high initial rate of discount followed

by a decline and comparative flattening of the rate of time preference. Unlike the

conditional logit results, there is no minor increase in the point estimate of the average

rate of time preference with a six-year delay.

       The unusual pattern of discounting associated with these results can be illustrated

by examining the term structure of the implied rates of interest. Let rfg be the implied

annual rate of time preference for the time period extending from period f to period g.

Consider the estimates using the time delay interval variables for both the conditional

logit and mixed logit models. The first column of Table 4 summarizes the pattern of

discount factors δ 0g for the three different periods of delay, and column 2 summarizes

the average rates of time preference r0g . The substantial weight placed on initial payoffs

and the decline in average rates of time preference are inconsistent with the standard

exponential discounting model. The steepness of the decline in rates of time preference

after the initial period generates an additional anomaly in the discounting pattern.

Following the literature on term structure of interest rates, one can calculate the discount



                                             19
rate for the marginal two-year period. For the first two-year period, the average rate of

time preference and the marginal two-year rate of time preference are 14.3 percent for the

conditional logit estimates. The marginal value of the rate of time preference over the

period extending from period 2 to period 4 for the conditional logit model is the value of

r24 that satisfies

                             (1 + 0.084)4 = (1 + 0.143)2 (1 + r24 )2 ,                    (22)

or r24 = 2.8 percent. Table 4 also reports the marginal rates of time preference for the six-

year time delay for the conditional logit results as well as parallel results for the mixed

logit estimates. For each set of estimates, the results display a common general pattern.

Because the high average rate of interest over different period of delay exhibits a sharp

decline and then remains relatively flat, the marginal rate of time preference drops

substantially and then increases. To achieve the great drop in the average rate of time

preference for four years of delay, the marginal rate must drop substantially. However,

because the average rate of time preference declines for a six-year delay but not greatly,

the marginal rate of time preference subsequently rises. The high present value premium

associated with hyperbolic discounting in this context consequently introduces a lack of

monotonicity in the temporal pattern of marginal discount rates.

        The pattern of discount factors associated with a g year delay, which is denoted

by δ 0g , also is anomalous. Based on the empirical structure of the model, δ 00 is set equal

to 1.0. As shown in Table 4, under the exponential discounting case, the value of δ 02 =

0.77 for the conditional logit model and 0.79 for the mixed logit should be the square of

their respective average annual discount factors of 0.88 and 0.89. Similarly, if δ 04 = 0.72

(conditional logit) or 0.74 (mixed logit), then the associated constant annual value of δ is


                                               20
given by 0.92 (conditional logit) and 0.93 (mixed logit). These discount factors are

above the annual value for the initial two-year delay. Finally, for δ 06 = 0.61 (conditional

logit) and 0.63 (mixed logit), the implied annual value of δ assuming exponential

discounting is 0.92 (conditional logit) and 0.93 (mixed logit). Thus, the implied annual

discount factor assuming exponential discounting begins at a low level, then rises and

flattens out.

                        4. The Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting Parameter

Estimates of the Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting Parameter

            The analysis thus far has presented estimates of annual discount factors based on

the exponential discounting framework. It is clear from the observed discount rate

pattern that the results are inconsistent with this formulation and have the general

characteristics associated with the hyperbolic discounting model. If we recast the results

in the quasi-hyperbolic discounting framework, it is possible to generate estimates of the

quasi-hyperbolic discount rate parameter that governs the extent of the departure from

exponential discounting.

            First, consider the implications of the conditional logit results. The utility of a

                                                            [                    ]
one unit improvement with a two-year delay is λδ 2 w 1 + δ + δ 2 + δ 3 + δ 4 , which is 0.114

based on the coefficient estimates. Similarly, the utility of a unit improvement with a

four-year delay is λδ 4 w[1 + δ + δ 2 + δ 3 + δ 4 ] , which is 0.107. The ratio of these utilities

     2
is       , which produces an estimate of of 0.969. Taking the ratio of the zero delay utility

to the utility after a two-year delay produces




                                                  21
                              0.148
                                      =
                                            [
                                          w 1 + λδ + λδ 2 + λδ 3 + λδ 4      ].                       (23)
                              0.114                 [
                                          λδ w 1 + δ + δ + δ + δ
                                                2            2    3     4
                                                                            ]
After substituting for the value of of 0.969, this equation yields a value of of 0.48.19

          Analogously, one could have used the estimate of implied by the ratio of the

six-year delayed improvement to the two-year delay. Because of the change in rates of

time preference over time, this approach yields a somewhat different estimate of of

0.943, which implies a value of of 0.58.

          One can generate similar estimates based on the mixed logit results. Using the

two-year and four-year delay results we generate a value of of 0.967 and a value of of

0.53. With the six-year versus two-year delay as the initial contrast, = 0.948 and =

0.61. The final column of Table 4 summarizes these results.

          Both the conditional logit and mixed logit estimates reflect a similar pattern, with

     ranging from 0.48 to 0.61, with the higher values derived from the values based on

the longer periods of delay.20 In each case, however, the discrepancy between the values

of and 1.0 serves as a measure of the extent of departure from the exponential

discounting model.

Probabilistic Deferred Benefits

          The general structure of the survey provided respondents with a series of

hypothetical policy choices affecting water quality in their region, including choices in

question blocks in addition to those being considered here. As a result, it would not be

reasonable for respondents to assume that all of these policies would be implemented.

19
   This calculation assumes that respondents processed the five year period of water quality improvements,
which appears twice in the survey text in Figure 1. Post-survey debriefings of respondents revealed no
evidence of misunderstanding of the length of the period of improvement and did indicate explicit
awareness of the length of the period.

discounting parameter, which are in the 0.5 to 0.8 range, see DellaVigna and Malmendier (2005).

The possibility that policy outcomes may not actually occur should not be problematic,

since there will be no costs incurred for policies that are purely hypothetical. However, if

respondents believe that they will be charged for policies offering deferred benefits but

that these benefits will not in fact occur, they may exhibit a preference for policies with

near term effects if they perceive a greater chance of receiving the benefits. Thus,

estimates of rates of time preference may be confounded with time-varying probabilities

that the benefits will be received.

        This probability issue arises more generally in hyperbolic discounting studies.

Recall the standard weighting system of the quasi-hyperbolic discounting case, which we

define above as λδ T for periods T >1 and a value of 1 for immediate payoffs, where 0<

<1. If respondents believe that the probability of receiving any deferred benefits is some

constant value , then discounted expected utility with probabilistic benefits and

exponential discounting will be equivalent to quasi-hyperbolic discounting with no future

uncertainty regarding benefits. If the probability of receiving the benefits declines with

the delay t, the observed relationship will still adhere to the general hyperbolic

discounting relation with declining discount rates over time.

        To test for whether respondents believe that there is a negative relationship

between time delay and the likelihood of receiving benefits, the survey included a

question that asked respondents to assess the probability that the benefits would be

received.21 In an initial large national pretest of several hundred respondents, each


21
  More specifically, the survey wording was of the following form:
Suppose an improvement in water quality was promised in six years, how likely is it that the improvement
would actually occur?
   No Chance               Not Likely         Even Money              Likely                   Certain
  0%      10%         20%      30%      40%        50%      60%      70%        80%         90%      100%



                                                   23
subject assessed the probability of receiving the benefits for each of the four time delay

possibilities, ranging from zero to six years. However, there was very little variation in

the assessed probabilities for each time delay period. Such invariance could occur in a

within-subject format if respondents anchored on their response for the first time delay

period presented and gave the same or very similar assessments for the other periods. To

avoid such anchoring effects, the results reported here are for single time delay questions

administered across subjects.

           Even with this across-subject design there was little variation in the assessed

probabilities of receiving the policy benefits. For the zero-year delay case, the

probability was 0.373. This assessed value rose to 0.422 for a two-year delay and 0.421

for a four-year delay or a six-year delay. While the assessed probability for the zero-year

delay is significantly less than for the two-year delay, the magnitude of the difference is

not great.22 The probabilities for delays of two years and four years are virtually

identical, with no statistically significant differences among them.

           Overall, there is no evidence of increasing skepticism of policy benefits as the

time delay is increased. The time-related pattern of discounting for this study is not

attributable to time-dependent probabilistic concerns.

                   5. Conditional Fixed Effect Logit Estimates with Interactions

           By including a series of interactions of personal characteristic variables with the

main effects in the conditional logit model, it is possible to analyze some explicit

determinants of individual heterogeneity in the model. Table 5 reports estimates for six

main effects and a set of eight interactions for each of these variables.23 The inclusion of


22
     In particular, the t statistic is 3.66.
23
     In this formulation, we specify all variables in terms of their deviations from the mean.


                                                        24
such a large set of interactions eliminates the statistical significance of the Delay 2 x

Improvement interaction, but otherwise the signs of and significance of the main effects

are not influenced by the extensive set of interactions.24

         A variable of central interest with respect to time preference is individual age, as

older respondents will have a shorter period of time during which they can experience the

benefits of a policy. The age variable has a negative interaction with delay, indicating that

policy delays generally are less attractive as one grows older. Moreover, there is a

significant negative effect of age on the Delay 2 x Improvement interaction, which is the

critical term that drives the extent of hyperbolic discounting and strong present

orientation. This positive relationship of age and rates of time preference is also

consistent with the evidence on rates of discount of older people found by Read and Read

(2004).25 Moreover, other studies of valuation of environmental benefits have found a

negative effect of age, especially for policies with deferred effects such as those relating

to global climate change.

         Three of the included variables serve as explicit measures of individual

differences in preferences toward the environment: whether the respondent is a member

of a major environmental group (Environmentalist), whether the respondent makes use of

lakes and rivers for recreational purposes (Visited Water), and the density of lakes in the

respondent’s state of residence (Lake Density). As one might expect, environmentalists

were more willing to incur costs that would finance water quality improvements. Those

how have visited water bodies have a higher marginal utility of delayed water quality

improvements and are less tolerant of policy delays generally. Interestingly, those who

24
   Several other interactions were explored but were never statistically significant. These included
interactions with self-reported stress levels, smoking status, and (age)2.
25
   Read (2001) provides further examination of the age-discounting relationship.


                                                     25
have visited water bodies have significant positive delay x improvement interactions in

all three instances. Those who visit water bodies do not reduce their valuation of

improvements in water quality to the same extent as the others, but these users of water

are more averse to delays generally. Respondents who live in states with a higher density

of lakes have a negative overall valuation of delays.

        Race and gender are sometimes influential as well. Black respondents have a

greater present orientation in that they are more averse to delays generally but not to the

six year delay interacted with improvements, and appear to be less cost sensitive. Female

respondents are also less cost sensitive than men but otherwise do exhibit not exhibit any

statistically significant differences.

        The years of education and household income variable should have similar

influences to the extent that education is a proxy for lifetime wealth. Higher levels of

education also may also reflect a lower revealed rate of time preference. Better educated

respondents have greater unwillingness to incur delays of four years. Those with more

income are less sensitive to costs, which will raise the cost-improvement tradeoff that

they are willing to make.

                                         6. Conclusion

        People would rather have improvements in environmental quality that occur now

rather than later. This expected result is quite consistent with economic rationality.

Similarly, some results such as the positive relationship of education and income on

valuations of the environment and the effect of age in accentuating the importance of

time delay also followed expected patterns. The survey results also passed consistency




                                              26
tests in that more water quality was preferred to less, and steadily higher levels of cost or

time delay were each viewed as increasingly undesirable.

       Notwithstanding these plausible aspects of behavior, the intertemporal

preferences displayed by respondents were inconsistent with the stationarity property in

the canonical exponential discounting model. Revealed annual rates of time preference

decline with the time delay before benefits occur. The estimated pattern of discount

factors for different periods of delay is consistent with observed patterns in the

hyperbolic discounting literature. To accommodate the initial steep decline and

subsequent flattening of the rate of time preference-time delay relationship, the temporal

pattern of marginal rates of time preference declines and then rises, but remains below

the rate of time preference for the initial period of delay. The estimates of the quasi-

hyperbolic discounting parameter with values from 0.48 to 0.61 indicate the substantial

weight placed on immediate payoffs and the presence of a considerable departure from

the exponential discounting model. This study also was the first to test for whether

uncertainty about remote payoffs accounted for a value below 1.0. There was no

evidence of such an influence.

       The temporal inconsistency of individual discount rates combines with the low

weight that respondents place on deferred environmental improvements to provide a

sobering message for policy makers. Most environmental policies do not have immediate

benefits, but individuals have a strong preference for immediate results. These

preferences in turn will generate political pressures that will foster a present orientation

for government policies. One partially reassuring result is that as the delay time is




                                              27
extended, the marginal discount rate declines so that very long-term effects are not

increasingly disadvantaged.

Imagine again that you have recently moved to another region of the country, where
water quality is 50% Good.

Imagine that the government is considering several policies that would temporarily
increase water quality in your region. Once the policy is in effect, the improvement lasts
for five years, then water quality returns to its previous level. Regardless of when the
improvement begins, the cost of each begins immediately and continues for five years.

Which of the three policies below would you most prefer?
