                                          ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the evolution of socio-emotional skills over the life cycle and across
generations. We start by characterising the evolution of these skills in the first part of the life
cycle. We then examine whether parents' socio-emotional skills in early childhood rather than in
adolescence are more predictive of their children's socio-emotional skills. We exploit data from
the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) and focus on two dimensions of socio-emotional skills:
internalizing and externalizing skills, linked respectively to the ability of focusing attention and
engaging in interpersonal activities. When looking at the evolution of socio-emotional skills over
the life cycle, we notice a considerable amount of persistence which leads to a rejection of the
simple Markov dynamic models often used in the literature. The BCS70 contains data on the
skills of three generations. Moreover, the skills for cohort members and their children are not
observed at the same calendar time, but at similar ages. We establish that parents' and children's
socio-emotional skills during early childhood are comparable and estimate intergenerational
mobility in socio-emotional skills, examining the link between the parent's socio-emotional skills
at age 5, 10 and 16 and the child's socio-emotional skills between ages 3 and 16. We show that
the magnitudes of intergenerational persistence estimates are smaller than the magnitude of
intergenerational persistence estimates in occupation and income found for the United Kingdom.
Finally, we estimate multi-generational persistence in socio-emotional skills and find that the
grandmother's internalizing skill correlates with the grandchild's socio-emotional skills even
after controlling for parental skills.

1       Introduction
It is now widely accepted that human development has many dimensions and that different types
of skills are important determinants of many life course outcomes, ranging from economic vari-
ables, such as labour market earnings and criminal activities, to subjective well-being and health
(Almlund et al., 2011). These different skills include cognitive abilities and socio-emotional skills;
the former are brain-based skills that are important to complete simple and complex tasks and are
related to learning, paying attention and solving problems rather than with any actual knowledge,
while the latter refer to psychological and preference parameters, such as social and emotional
skills, locus of control and self-esteem, personality traits (e.g. conscientiousness), risk aversion
and time preferences.
     It is well established that parental skill endowments and investment play an important role in
determining their children's skills, especially in the early years of life, due to the brain's rapid
development and malleability (Cunha and Heckman, 2007) and the fact that parents are typically
the main source of interaction for very young children. It is therefore likely that different types of
skills are transmitted across generations and that this transmission plays an important (although
not exclusive) role in the intergenerational transmission of inequality. The economic literature has
examined extensively the intergenerational transmission of income and education. The evidence
on the intergenerational transmission of socio-emotional skills is nevertheless still scarce despite
the fact that these skills are now accepted to be important in determining different dimensions of
well-being.1
     In this paper, we study different aspects of the evolution of socio-emotional skills over the life
cycle and across generations. We do so by exploiting some of the unique longitudinal dimensions
of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). In addition to information about the main subjects of
the study, who are followed from birth onwards, the BCS70 also contains information about their
parents and about offspring they had by age 34.
     First, to study the dynamics of socio-emotional skills over the life cycle and across generations,
we need to define what they are and how they are measured. We use factor analysis to extract two
dimensions of socio-emotional skills, which we label 'internalizing' and 'externalizing'. As the
previous literature points out, the first measure captures children's ability to focus their drive and
determination, while the second one captures their ability to relate to others. Since we analyse
socio-emotional skills measured at different ages and for different generations, we pay attention
to the comparability of these measures.
     We then present three contributions to the understanding of the evolution of socio-emotional
    1
     An excellent review paper on intergenerational mobility is Black and Devereux (2011). Some prominent studies
on mobility are, for example, Chetty et al. (2014), who have mapped the geography of intergenerational mobility in
the United States. Card et al. (2018) have studied the intergenerational transmission of human capital for children born
in the 1920s and educated during an era of expanding but unequally distributed public school resources in the United
States. Alesina et al. (2019) have mapped the intergenerational mobility in educational attainment in Africa. Guell et al.
(2015) propose an alternative approach to measure mobility by using cross-sectional data on income and the surname
of the individual. There is also a growing interest in intergenerational mobility in other outcomes, such as in wealth
(Charles and Hurst, 2003) and health (Halliday et al., 2019).

skills. First, we characterise the dynamic properties of skill development and show that the simple
Markov structure often used in the literature, where the level of skills at a certain age are a "suffi-
cient statistic" for the level of subsequent skills, might be missing some important elements of the
process. In particular, we show that the dynamic process for these skills may be quite complex and
might involve the interactions between different dimensions. We also show the returns that socio-
emotional skills have on adult outcomes. Second, we study the intergenerational transmission of
skills by investigating to what extent parents' socio-emotional skills, measured when they were
aged 5, 10 and 16, are associated with their children's socio-emotional skills between the age of
3 and 16. Our findings show that parental internalizing and externalizing skills during childhood
predict their child's internalizing and externalizing skills between the age of 3 and 16.2 Finally,
a unique feature of the data we use is that allows us to estimate the association of grandparents'
socio-emotional skills with the socio-emotional skills of their grandchildren. We show that the
association of socio-emotional skills might be relevant across more than one generation.
     Our study is not the first to look at the correlation of socio-emotional skills in the early years
on adult outcomes or at the intergenerational transmission of these skills. Heckman et al. (2013),
Nandi and Nicoletti (2014), and Gensowski (2018), for instance, present evidence on the returns
to socio-emotional skills. As for the intergenerational transmission of skills, two important contri-
butions to this literature in economics are Anger (2012) and Dohmen et al. (2011). These papers
use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) to study respectively the trans-
mission of socio-emotional skills and attitudes from parents to children during adolescence and
young adulthood. In another contribution, Gronqvist et al. (2016) use Swedish data from military
enlistment records to study intergenerational transmission of cognitive and socio-emotional skills.
The sample used in the analysis includes only men aged 18. Alana et al. (2017) study the trans-
mission of risk attitudes from mothers to children through elicitation of risk in an incentivized
experiment in Turkey. The psychological literature has also studied the intergenerational corre-
lation of socio-emotional skills. Loehlin (2005) reviews several studies3 and concludes that the
correlation in socio-emotional skills tends to be around 0.10 to 0.15 for young adult children but
argues that those are likely to be underestimated because of self-reported measures, age, sample.
Groves (2005) is another review situating these estimates between 0.14 and 0.29. Some of these
studies are based on a small number of observations and lack representativeness. In any event, the
estimates reviewed above are higher than the associations we find for age compatible associations
in early childhood (see, e.g., Appendix B).
     Relative to the existing literature mentioned above on the intergenerational transmission of
socio-emotional skills, this paper overcomes two drawbacks of existing analyses by exploiting
unique features of the BCS70 data. First, the studies mentioned above, like most if not all of
the existing literature, focus on measurements obtained during adolescence and early adulthood.
At these development stages, skills and attitudes are likely to have developed and changed for
   2
     Aside from other conventional measures for intergenerational mobility, we also use a new metric for mobility
across generations which may be of interest on its own: the spectral gap mobility index.
   3
     An example is Duncan et al. (2005) who uses the data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to
study personal traits and behaviours measured during adolescence.


                                                        3
other reasons, such as schooling and peer effects, which can be picked in the correlation, while
socio-emotional skills are not fully developed during childhood and may still be quite malleable
(Almlund et al., 2011). Adolescents' socio-emotional traits may not bear a strong resemblance
to their parents' socio-emotional traits if they have changed for other reasons in such a way that
the intergenerational correlation for young adults decreases in size. This hints at a life cycle bias
which is similar to the one we encounter when we use data about earnings that do not correspond
to life earnings to study mobility.
     Second, the main direction of intergenerational transmission is presumably from parents to
their children, but it is also possible that children influence their parents' values and socio-emotional
skills. Previous studies, like some of those mentioned above, use contemporaneously measured
parents and children's socio-emotional skills, which makes it difficult to rule out the possibility
that children influence their parents' skills. A high (low) correlation between parents and chil-
dren's socio-emotional skills and attitudes could, therefore, be found because of a convergence
(or divergence) in skills and attitudes during adulthood when the children can also affect parents'
personality and attitudes.4
     We tackle these two concerns by using multiple measures of socio-emotional skills collected
in different waves of the BCS70. We observe the BCS70 subjects' socio-emotional skills at the
age of 5, 10, and 16 and examine their association with their children's skills between the ages
of 3 and 16. First, using multiple observations of socio-emotional skills over the life cycle mit-
igates the `lifecyle' bias we allude to above and allows us to investigate whether parents' socio-
emotional skills in early childhood rather than in adolescence are more predictive of their child's
socio-emotional skills. Second, and relatedly, socio-emotional skills are not contemporaneously
measured in the BCS70. Parents' skills are measured during their childhood (at age 5, 10 and 16),
while their children's skills are measured 18 years later. Therefore, the main direction of intergen-
erational transmission is presumably from parents to their children, ruling out the possibility of
children influencing their parents' personality.
     In addition to linear correlations between the parent and child's socio-emotional skills, we
present estimates of intergenerational transmission of socio-emotional skills based on rank regres-
sions and intergenerational transition matrices, as in Chetty et al. (2014). While we are aware
of the problems that may arise in rank regressions, we notice that the evidence we obtain from
different methodologies is very similar.
     We also compare the intergenerational mobility estimates on socio-emotional skills to the ones
of the intergenerational persistence in other economic domains. We find a higher mobility in
socio-emotional skills than in the intergenerational transmission of occupation (Bell et al., 2018)
and income (Gregg et al., 2017; Rohenkohl, 2019) in the United Kingdom.5 Finally, we contribute
to the literature by investigating to what extent the interdependence between the internalizing and
   4
      Dohmen et al. (2011) try to tackle reverse causality due to contemporaneous measurements by using religion as an
instrumental variable for the child's attitude, but the first stage indicates a weak instrumental variable problem even if
one accepts its validity.
    5
      Rohenkohl (2019) uses income using data from the BHPS and Understanding Society survey, while Gregg et al.
(2017) and Belfield et al. (2017) use data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the British Cohort
Study (BCS).

externalizing socio-emotional skills can play a role in the intergenerational skill transmission. We
study which one of the two skill dimensions correlates to the other dimension more.
    We examine multi-generational transmission of socio-emotional skills from grandmothers to
grandchildren. Information on grandmother and grandchildren's socio-emotional skill is rarely
found in any dataset. The BSC70 is an exception because the cohort members' mother was asked
to complete the Malaise Inventory (Rutter et al., 1970) at the 1975, 1980 and 1986 sweeps.6
    The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the 1970 British
Cohort Study data used in the analysis. Section 3 presents the derivation of the two dimensions of
socio-emotional skill and Section 4 the measures of persistence in the process of human develop-
ment examined in this paper. In Section 5, we present the estimates about the life cycle dynamics
of socio-emotional skills. In Section 6, we present the estimates of the life cycle dynamics and
intergenerational mobility in socio-emotional skills. Section 7 investigates multi-generational per-
sistence in socio-emotional skills by examining the correlation between grandmother and grand-
child's socio-emotional skill. Section 8 summarizes the results and concludes.


2       Data sources
We make use of a unique longitudinal database, the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), which
follows the lives of around 17,000 individuals born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single
week of 1970 and is publicly available at the UK Data Service. Cohort members have been con-
tacted nine times, resulting in information at age 5, 10, 16, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42 and 46. We use the
age 5, 10, and 16 sweeps to derive socio-emotional measures for the cohort members. The age 34
sweep also provides substantial information on the offspring of the cohort members, including a
number of tests aimed at measuring their socio-emotional skills. We concentrate on the sample of
cohort members linked to their children and present descriptive statistics on the sample of BCS70
with children in Table C3 in Appendix C.7
    The BCS70 sample's socio-emotional skills were measured at ages 5, 10 and 16 using the
Rutter A and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). These tests were also administered
during the age 34 sweep to the children of the cohort members aged between 3 and 16. In Table
1, we present the questions from these tests (Rutter et al., 1970; Goodman, 1994).
    The Rutter and SDQ are behavioural screening scales, where mothers are asked whether their
children exhibit a series of behaviours, known as the items of the scale.8 Items are rated on three
levels: `Does not apply', `Somewhat applies', `Certainly applies'. Since they are all behaviours
indicating lower skills, we recode all of them in reverse for the ease of interpretation, with higher
    6
      Johnson et al. (2013) study multi-generational mobility in mental health across three generations using the BCS70,
but find no correlation between the grandmother and grandchild's mental health. In the psychiatry literature, Hancock
et al. (2013) do a similar exercise in Australia. We discuss their approach to study multi-generational mobility in mental
health when we measure multi-generational in socio-emotional skills.

      The SDQ scale was developed to consider advances in child psychopathology and includes positive as well as
undesirable traits.

Note. The Rutter and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire items are rated on three levels: `Does not apply', `Somewhat applies', `Certainly
applies'. Since they are all behaviours indicating lower skills, we recode all of them in reverse, i.e. `Certainly applies' = 0, `Somewhat applies' =
1, `Does not apply' = 2. The question of the Rutter items in the BCS70 administered when parents were 16 years old refers to the teenager. Items

only to the children aged 6-16.



values associated with better socio-emotional skills (i.e. `Certainly applies' = 0, `Somewhat ap-
plies' = 1, `Does not apply' = 2).9


3       Modelling the dimensions of socio-emotional skills
Socio-emotional skills are intrinsically difficult to measure. Factor analysis is commonly used to
estimate socio-emotional skill measures from a number of behavioural screening scales, where
parents or teachers are asked to evaluate a number of items on the child's behaviour. Table 1 is
an example of the type of measures available and provides those measures we use in our factor
    9
     We augment the Rutter Scale with three additional parent-reported questions from the parental questionnaire, items
A, B, and D in Table 1. These are rated on 4 levels: `Never in the last 12 months', `less than once a month', `at least
once a month', `at least once a week'. We recode these into binary indicators, with `Never' and `Less than once a
month' to 1 and zero otherwise. At the age 10 sweep, the Rutter A scale is continuous from 0 to 100, where 0 means
`Does not apply' and 100 means `Certainly applies'. We recode it in reverse. In order to make it comparable to the
Rutter A scale in the other waves, we recode the items as follows: if the response is below 40, we code the answer as
0; if the response is between 40 and 70, we code the answer as 1; if the response is between 70 and 100, we code the
answer as 2.


                                                                  6
analysis. We follow the literature and focus on two factors for the (internalizing and external-
izing) socio-emotional skills encoded in these questions. With these variables, we start with an
exploratory factor analysis to understand which of the available measures correspond to each of
these factors. We then proceed to estimate a factor model.


3.1    Exploratory analysis
In what follows, we analyse the persistence over the life cycle and across generations of the two
factors that are typically used to represent socio-emotional skills. This approach has been used in
the previous literature (Attanasio et al., 2020; Moroni et al., 2019), where they have been labeled
as `externalizing' and `internalizing' skills. The first measure captures the ability of children to
focus their drive and determination and the second one their ability to relate to others.
    To justify our focus on two factors, we perform an exploratory factor analysis. We concentrate
on the 11 items from the Rutter A and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scale which
are common across the cohort members and their children (Table 2). Finally, we estimate the factor
loadings from the exploratory factor analysis, based on decomposing the polychoric correlation
matrix of the items and using weighted least squares (Olsson, 1979).10 The solution is rescaled
using oblique factor rotation (Hendrickson and White, 1964). Table 3 presents the factor loadings
which show a clear separation between items. In particular, we highlight that the factor loadings
have a similar magnitudes across groups, pointing out that there is a similar association between
the item and the factor across groups.




  10
     The polychoric correlation is an estimate for the correlation between two normally distributed continuous random
variables observed as ordinal variables.

3.2   Factor model
To model formally the relationship between internalizing and externalizing skills and the avail-
able measures, the Rutter and SDQ items, based on the results of the exploratory analysis de-
scribed in section 3.1, we specify a factor model. We consider four groups of individuals c 
{C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 }, corresponding respectively to the children of the cohort members, and the co-
hort members at the age of 5, 10 and 16. Each individual is denoted by i = 1, ...., Nc . For each
individual and group, we observe categorical item responses Xijc , corresponding to the common
Rutter/SDQ scale questions (Table 2) where j indexes the 11 available items. We follow the liter-
ature and assume a latent bi-dimensional vector of externalizing and internalizing socio-emotional
skills ic = (ic  EXT ,  IN T )
                        ic
    The relationship between the latent factors ic and the available measures Xijc is characterised
by item- and group-specific intercepts vjc and loadings jc and is affected by an independent
measurement error term uijc . The measures are defined in terms of the following variable:

                                      
                                     Xijc = vjc + jc ic + uijc                                      (1)

We consider a dedicated factor structure, where each item loads only on one latent dimension, and
follow the structure found in the exploratory factor analysis (Heckman et al., 2013; Conti et al.,
2010). We estimate the baseline model which is characterized by the bare minimum number of
assumptions with the parameterisation defined below (Wu and Estabrook, 2016).
    Given the specification of the behavioural scale, the measures Xijc have a discrete nature and
take one of an ordered number of values. To allow for such measures we introduce item- and
group-specific threshold parameters jc as follows:

                                            
                     Xijc = s     if s,jc  Xijc  s+1,jc          for   s = 0, 1, 2                  (2)

with 0,jc = - and 3,jc = . We assume that the latent factors and the measurement error
terms are normally distributed:

                                       2                          2
                            ic  N (c ,  c
                                          )       and uijc  N (0, c )                               (3)

     Finally, we make the normalisation assumption needed to deal with factor indeterminacy by
setting the mean c and the variance      2 of the factor equal to 0 and 1 respectively. In addition, the
                                          c
intercepts vjc are equal to zero and the error variance c 2 to 1 , while the loadings  and threshold
                                                                                       jc
jc are free to vary.
     Having estimated the factor model, we can use it to predict the latent factors ic for any indi-
vidual, based on their observed values of the Rutter/SDQ items. These latent factors are weighted
sums of the observed items, with the weights determined by the parameters of the fitted model.
Indicators which are more reliable measures of a factor ­ namely those with larger loadings jc ­
will receive higher weights in the calculation of a factor score for that factor. Figure 1 shows the
distributions of the two latent factors: internalizing and externalizing skills.

Note. These figures present the distributions of the internalizing and externalizing socio-emotional skills for the children and
parents respectively at age 5, 10, and 16. Higher scores correspond to better skills. The distribution is estimated nonparametri-
cally, using an Epanechnikov kernel. The scale of the Rutter/SDQ items at the age-5, age-16 and child-questionnaire sweep is
categorical. The scale of the Rutter items at the age-10 sweep is converted to a categorical variable.


                                                              11
    In Appendix A, we follow Attanasio et al. (2020) and test for measurement invariance since
any comparison between socio-emotional skills across different generations requires that the socio-
emotional measures we derived have the same relationship with the latent constructs (Vandenberg
and Lance, 2000; Putnick and Bornstein, 2016).


4     Measuring persistence in the process of human development
We perform the analysis of life cycle and intergenerational persistence of socio-emotional skills in
two steps. First, we estimate the two factor scores (internalizing and externalizing) for the cohort
members and their children, as outlined in section 3.2. We then estimate the relevant persistence
measures with different types of regressions, which we discuss below. In principle, we could
estimate all the parameters of interest in one step, estimating the relevant factor models and the
regressions that describe their relationships jointly. However, since our measured indicators are
categorical this approach could be computationally costly.


4.1   Life cycle persistence
To estimate the life cycle persistence of socio-emotional skills we estimate various versions of the
following regressions.


   j      j    j      j     j      j    j      k     j      k              j
 Yi, 16 = 16 + 1,16 Yi,10 + 2,16 Yi,5 + 1,16 Yi,10 + 2,16 Yi,5 +  Xi +     i,16 ,   j, k = int, ext. (4)

              j      j    j      j    j      k                j
            Yi, 10 = 10 + 1,10 Yi,5 + 1,10 Yi,5 +  Xi +       i,10 ,      j, k = int, ext.           (5)

where the subscript i identifies a member of the cohort and the superscripts j and k refer to the
particular dimension of socio-emotional skills we consider, where internalising or externalising
skills. Equation (4) models the skills at age 16, while equation (5) is for the skills at age 10. In
both cases we let the skills at a given age to depend on the lagged value of that skill as well as
other skills.
     In modeling the evolution of socio-emotional skill and characterising their persistence over the
life cycle, we let not only the skills observed at the most recent age to play a role but also skills
observed at previous ages. In this sense our model deviates from the standard Markov assumption
normally used in the literature.
     We further generalise the models in equations (4) and (5) to consider also the association of
socio-emotional skills with past cognitive skills. For the age 16 socio-emotional skills we consider
the following model:


               j
             Yi, 16 =      j    j      j     j      j    j      k     j      k
                           16 + 1,16 Yi,10 + 2,16 Yi,5 + 1,16 Yi,10 + 2,16 Yi,5                      (6)
                         j       cog   j      cog             j
                        +1 ,16 Yi,10 + 2,16 Yi,5 +  Xi +      i,16 ,   j, k = int, ext.


                                                 12
while for the age 10 skills we have:

        j      j    j      j    j      k    j      cog                 j
      Yi, 10 = 10 + 1,10 Yi,5 + 1,10 Yi,5 + 1,10 Yi,5 +  Xi +          i,10 ,   j, k = int, ext.   (7)

     As cognitive skills can be important in several dimensions, we also estimate a regression sim-
ilar to equation (6), but with the level of cognitive skills on the left-hand side.
     Finally, using the age 42 sweep, we relate a number of adult outcomes, including employment,
earnings and the probability of smoking, to both cognitive and socio-emotional skills at age 5, 10
and 16.


4.2    Intergenerational mobility
To study how socio-emotional skills can be transmitted across generation, we relate a number of
outcomes observed on the children of our cohort members to a number of outcomes observed in
their parents before they reached adulthood.
    In particular, for each parent and child in household i we estimate:

                                  YiC =  +  Yi
                                             P
                                               +  Xi +             i                               (8)

where YiC is the child i's socio-emotional skill score and Yi      P is a vector of child i's parent's

socio-emotional skill observed at the age of 5, 10, and 16.  is a vector of parameters measuring
intergenerational mobility in socio-emotional skills (i.e. internalizing and externalizing skills).
Higher values of the coefficient  correspond to lower mobility. In our specifications, we control
for a vector Xi of individual's characteristics, which include the region of birth fixed effects, the
parent's gender, the child's gender and age, the number of children in the household, the mother's
age at the parent's birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the parent is the first born, the parent's employment
status at the age of 34, the grandparent's employment status, education and profession in 1975 and
the number of children in the parent's household when the parent is 5 years old. We include
these controls to consider some other possible channels that might relate to skills. For example,
the employment variables are here to proxy for other channels like income that might explain
skills. Region of birth fixed effects can account for the fact that parents were born in different
geographical areas. We also include controls on family characteristics to consider the fact that the
family composition can influence skills.

Rank regression     For each parent and child in household i we estimate:

                                   C
                                  Ri =  +  RP
                                            i +  Xi +              i                               (9)

where RiC is the child i's socio-emotional skill score (rank) and RP is a vector of child i's parent's
                                                                     i
socio-emotional skill score (rank) at the age of 5, 10, and 16.  is a vector of parameters measuring
intergenerational mobility (relative) in socio-emotional skills (i.e. internalizing and externalizing



                                                 13
skills). Higher values of the coefficient  correspond to lower mobility. We control for a vector
Xi of individual's characteristics which are the same as above.
    We follow Chetty et al. (2014) and estimate rank regressions to capture monotone relation-
ships possibly not encoded in the simple correlation between socio-emotional skill scores. The
relationship between parents' and children's socio-emotional scores is often non-linear, making a
simple linear correlation possibly not a good summary of mobility at all points of the distribution.
Another advantage of the rank-based measure is to possibly reduce the attenuation and lifecycle
bias (Nybom and Stuhler, 2017).
    We need to consider that data come from the prediction of the factor model estimated in section
3. Therefore, we compute standard errors for equations 8 and 9 by bootstrapping both the factor
model and the regression. More specifically, first, we generate 1000 samples by block sampling
with replacement from the original sample (i.e. we randomly draw the entire history of the parent-
child link with replacement from the original sample). Second, for each bootstrap sample, we
estimate the factor model, predict the factors and then estimate the intergenerational mobility
regression.

Absolute mobility indexes Another common measure of intergenerational mobility is to study
the children's outcomes from parents at a given quintile in the distribution (Chetty et al., 2014).
For example, a measure which is often reported is the probability of going from the lowest to the
highest quintile of the socio-emotional skill distribution (Corak and Heisz, 1999).

                                           C      P
                                 LH = P r(Ri  80|Ri < 20)                                       (10)

     We thus produce non-parametric matrices of transition probabilities across quintiles of the
socio-emotional skill distribution. We do this for the parents' internalizing and externalizing skill
at the age of 5, 10 and 16 to document how mobility may differ at different points of the socio-
emotional skill distribution.
     To facilitate comparison across the several matrices, we propose a summary measure to com-
pare the different transition matrices and order them in terms of mobility. Our measure is based
on the difference between the largest and the second largest eigenvalues in the transition matrix.
This difference is usually referred to as the `spectral gap.' We thus call this measure the `spectral
gap mobility index'. This measure is useful to understand how far the intergenerational transition
matrices are from an identity matrix which corresponds to a table with no mobility across quin-
tiles: all its eigenvalues are equal to one and the measure above, (1 - second largest eigenvalue),
is zero. The discrepancy between one and the second largest could be seen as a departure from
zero mobility, where higher numbers of the 'spectral gap mobility index' corresponds to higher
mobility.

5         Persistence in childhood socio-emotional skills over the life cycle
Table 4 presents the estimates of various versions of equations (4) and (5). The parameters' esti-
mates we present measure the degree and modality of persistence of socio-emotional skills over
the life cycle for the cohort we are considering. We estimate the parameters for the process of
both internalizing (columns 1-4) and externalizing skills (columns 5-8) at different ages.11 For
all specifications we include a set of controls, which are the cohort member's gender, the age of
the cohort member's mother at birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the cohort member is the first born,
the employment status, education and profession of the cohort member's parent in 1975, and the
number of children in the cohort member's household when the cohort member is 5 years old. In
columns 1 and 5, we study to what extent parental skills at the age of 5 can predict their own skills
at the age of 10, whereas in other columns, we study to what extent parental skills at the age of 5
and 10 can predict their own skills at the age of 16.
     An interesting pattern emerges from the results in Table 4. Socio-emotional skills both at age
5 and at age 10 predict skills during adolescence. Table 4 shows that one unit increase in the
internalizing skill at the age of 5 corresponds to 0.319 unit increase in the internalizing skill at
the age of 16, while one unit increase in the internalizing skill at the age of 10 corresponds to
0.127 unit increase in the internalizing skill at the age of 16 (column 4). Even more surprisingly,
one unit increase in the internalizing skill at the age of 5 corresponds to 0.229 unit increase in the
externalizing skill at the age of 16, while one unit increase in the externalizing skill at the age of 5
corresponds to 0.181 unit increase in the externalizing skill at the age of 16 (column 8).12
     Remarkably, skills at age 5 (both internalising and externalising), are important in predicting
skills at age 16, even after controlling for skills at age 10. This evidence is suggestive of the im-
portance of early childhood in the skill formation process. Usually, when studying skill formation,
researchers estimate first-order Markov chain processes, where the skills today depend only on the
skills in the previous period. When data for adjacent periods are not available, by recursive sub-
stitution, one can get an expression where skill today depend on skills on the previous available
period. However, if the model's assumptions are valid, conditioning on a certain period skills,
future skills should not depend on the level of development in previous periods. Our results point
towards extending these models to consider the skills not only in the previous period but also in
earlier periods, especially in the early childhood.
     The richer persistence we document can be due to a variety of reasons. First, our finding
could be due to the fact that early childhood skills are better measured than the ones at the age
of 10. Therefore, this would imply that they better predict subsequent development. However,
it is also important to notice that the magnitudes of the coefficients of the skills at the age of 5
do not substantially change as we include controls. Table 4 shows that one unit increase in the
internalizing skill at the age of 5 corresponds to 0.384 unit increase in the internalizing skill at the
age of 16 when we do not control for externalizing skills (column 2), while the effect does not
change substantially when we include controls for externalizing skills (column 4). Second, it is
    11
         Table C6 in Appendix C presents the contemporaneous correlation of internalizing and externalizing skill measures.
    12
         A similar pattern emerges if we use a rank regression, of the type we estimate for intergenerational correlations.


                                                              15
possible that the significance of early years development captures the presence of individual (in
this case family) fixed effects. Finally, it is possible that specific ages are particularly salient and
important for the process of development. We cannot distinguish among these different sources of
persistence without richer data. We leave this investigation to future research.
    Another important pattern that the data highlight is the interdependence of skills. Namely,
externalizing skills can predict internalizing skills and vice-versa. Columns 4 and 8 of Table 4
constitute strong evidence in this respect. Internalising skills at age 5 seem to be particularly
important to predict age-16 skills of both types considered. Analogously, both externalising skills
at age 5 and 10 are important for age-16 socio-emotional skills.

    As mentioned above, to investigate further the process of socio-emotional skills formation, we
consider a specification where, in addition to the socio-emotional skills at age 5 and 10, in the
regressions for socio-emotional skills at age 16, we also consider cognitive skills at ages 5 and
10. We report the results in Table 5. We note that in the richer specifications in columns 4 and
8, these cognitive skills are not associated significantly with socio-emotional skills of either type
considered.
    In Table 6, we also relate cognitive skills at age 16 with different types of skills at ages 5
and 10.13 Interestingly, the dynamic patterns that emerge for cognitive skills are different from
those for socio-emotional skills. In the richest specification considered in Column 5, it seems that
in addition to cognition at age 10, cognition at age 16 seems to be associated with internalising
socio-emotional skills at age 5. This evidence is confirmed by the more parsimonious specification
in column 3. Whereas test statistics for the hypothesis that coefficient on socio-emotional skills
are jointly zero are associated with rather small p-values, this appears to be mostly driven by
   13
     The response rate is lower at the age-16 sweep because of a teacher-led industrial strike disrupting the dissemination
of the questionnaire. Only 2 cognitive tests (spelling test and vocabulary test) were fully completed out of 4 tests.

copy simple designs adjacently), Human Figure Drawing (child draws an entire human figure), English Picture Vocabulary Test (child
identifies the picture referring to a word among four pictures). The cognitive skill at the age of 10 comes from a simple factor model
where four tests where combined: Shortened Edinburgh Reading Test, Friendly Math Test, Spelling Dictation Task and Pictorial
Language Comprehension Test.


internalizing socio-emotional skills.14
    Our next step is to check whether skills during early childhood can predict their outcomes
later in life. This allows us to contextualise our estimates on the evolution of socio-emotional
skills, given previous findings on how those relate to economic outcomes later in life. Table
7 presents regressions of behavioural and economic outcomes at the age of 42 on skills during
childhood. We highlight that socio-emotional skills during childhood can predict whether the
cohort member smokes, is employed and how much she or he earns per week, conditional on
being a paid employee or self-employed at the age of 42. These results are robust even after
controlling for own cognitive skill at the ages of 5 and 10 and the inclusion of their controls, such
as the cohort member's gender, the age of the cohort member's mother at birth, a dummy equal to
1 if the cohort member is the first born, the employment status, education and profession of the
cohort member's parent in 1975, and the number of children in the cohort member's household
when the cohort member is 5 years old.
    A final pattern we document is the socio-economic gradient in socio-emotional skills. Figure
2 presents the socio-economic gradient in socio-emotional skills for the sample of BCS70 cohort
members for which we observe socio-emotional skills at ages 5, 10 and 16 for internalizing and
externalizing skills.15 We also report the p-value from Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of equality
   14
      The bootstrapped p-value for the test of the hypothesis that the coefficients on the internalising skills in column 5
are jointly zero is 0.081, while the p-value for a similar hypothesis for the externalising skill coefficients is 0.930.
   15
      The socioeconomic status is the mother's education at the age-5 sweep; namely, a dummy equal to 1 if the mother


                                                                  17
between the distributions by socioeconomic gradient.
    These tests document that there is a statistically meaningful difference in externalizing socio-
emotional skills between the children of mothers with different educational attainment, but not for
internalizing skills. This gap is already visible at age 5 and is persistent over the life cycle. Given
the association of age 5 socio-emotional skills with a variety of adult outcomes, including earn-
ings, this result is informative about the origin of background gaps in a variety of outcomes. We
present a similar analysis for gradient in socio-emotional skills by the mother's pregnancy smok-
ing (maternal smoking is a dummy equal to 1 if the mother reported smoking during pregnancy) in
Figure 3, where the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics are statistically significant at conventional
significance levels for both internalizing and externalizing skills.

economic outcomes at age 42 (parent-children link). The cognitive skill measure at the age of 5 comes from a simple factor model
where three tests are combined: Copy Designs (child is asked to copy simple designs adjacently), Human Figure Drawing (child draws
an entire human figure), English Picture Vocabulary Test (child identifies the picture referring to a word among four pictures). The
cognitive skill at the age of 10 comes from a simple factor model where four tests where combined: Shortened Edinburgh Reading
Test, Friendly Math Test, Spelling Dictation Task and Pictorial Language Comprehension Test. The cognitive skill at the age of 16
comes from a simple factor model where two tests where combined: the Vocabulary and Spelling Tests. Employed is a dummy for
being in paid employment or self-employment, either full or part time. Gross weekly pay is weekly pre-tax pay from the respondent's
main activity, conditional on being a paid employee or self-employed. Other controls include the cohort member's gender, the age
of the cohort member's mother at birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the cohort member is the first born, the employment status, education
and profession of the cohort member's parent in 1975, and the number of children in the cohort member's household when the cohort
member is 5 years old. The p-value for the test that the socio-emotional skill coefficients are jointly zero is computed as follows by
bootstrapping the entire procedure. For each bootstrapped sample, we estimate the factors, run the regression and estimate the Wald
statistics (the weighting matrix for the Wald statistic is obtained by using the bootstrap sample (Hall and Wilson, 1991)). This gives
us the distribution for the Wald statistic once recentered (by subtracting the mean of the empirical distribution). So we compute the
percentile of the Wald statistic for the hypothesis we want to test in the empirical distribution for the test statistic obtained from the
bootstrap samples. One minus that is the p-value.

cognitive skill measure comes from a simple factor model where three tests administered at the age of 5 are combined: Copy Designs
(child is asked to copy simple designs adjacently), Human Figure Drawing (child draws an entire human figure), English Picture
Vocabulary Test (child identifies the picture referring to a word among four pictures). The cognitive skill at the age of 10 comes from
a simple factor model where four tests where combined: Shortened Edinburgh Reading Test, Friendly Math Test, Spelling Dictation

The p-value for the test that the socio-emotional skill coefficients are jointly zero is computed as follows by bootstrapping the entire
procedure. For each bootstrapped sample, we estimate the factors, run the regression and estimate the Wald statistics (the weighting

statistic for the hypothesis we want to test in the empirical distribution for the test statistic obtained from the bootstrap samples. One
minus that is the p-value.

6         Intergenerational mobility in socio-emotional skills
As discussed above, we study the transmission across generations of socio-emotional skills esti-
mating equation (8). We do so using the sweep that contains information on the children of the
1970 cohort, which was collected when the cohort members were about 34. We report the results
of this exercise in Table 8, with the outcome variable being the child's internalizing or externaliz-
ing skills. In what follows, we refer to the cohort members as parents.
     In the regression, we include a set of controls, which are the parent's gender, the child's gen-
der, the number of children in the household, the mother's age at the parent's birth, a dummy equal
to 1 if the parent is the first born, the parent's employment status at the age of 34, the grandpar-
ent's employment status, education and profession in 1975, the number of children in the parent's
household when the parent is 5 years old, region of the parent's birth fixed effects and age of
child fixed effects. In columns 1-3, the outcome variable is the child's internalizing skill, while in
columns 4-6 the outcome variable is the child's externalizing skill.
     In Table 8, we observe that parental skills during their childhood are important predictors of
their children's skills even after including a large set of controls. In particular, one unit increase
in the parent's internalizing skill at the age of 16 translates into a 0.109 unit increase in the child's
internalizing skill (column 1), while one unit increase in the parent's externalizing skill at the age
of 10 translates into a 0.078 unit increase in the child's internalizing skill (column 2). In column
3, we study the relationship between the child's internalizing skills and the parent's skills and
find that the magnitude of the coefficients of the parent's internalizing skill at the age of 16 and
externalizing skill at the age of 10 increases when we control for other dimension of the socio-
emotional skill. This points towards the importance of considering an interdependence across
skills in the transmission process.
     On the other hand, in columns 4-6, we study the relationship between the child's externalizing
skill and the parental skills (Table 8). The parent's internalizing skill at the age of 16 is still an
important predictor for the child's skill. One unit increase in the parent's internalizing skill at the
age of 16 translates in 0.191 unit increase in the child's externalizing skill (column 4). This effect
still remains significant and the magnitude of the coefficient decreases slightly once we control
for parental externalizing skills. Namely, in column 6, we observe that one unit increase in the
parent's internalizing skill at the age of 16 translates in 0.148 unit increase in child's externalizing
skill. While one unit increase in the parent's externalizing skill at the age of 10 translates in 0.149
unit increase in the child's externalizing skill (column 5) and in 0.229 unit increase in child's
externalizing skill when we control for the parent's internalizing skills (column 6).16
     Figures 4 and 5 present the binscatter plots for rank regressions (equation 9) when we residual-
ize the socio-emotional skill rank and correlate the residualized rank of the child's socio-emotional
skills (internalizing and externalizing) with the residualized rank of the parent's skills at the age
of 5, 10 and 16. This is done in two steps. First, we regress each socio-emotional skill rank on the
parent's gender, the child's gender, the number of children in the household, the mother's age at
    16
         The R2 s have the same magnitude as in Anger (2012), Dohmen et al. (2011) and Charles and Hurst (2003).

the parent's birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the parent is the first born, the parent's employment status
at the age of 34, the grandparent's employment status, education and profession in 1975, the num-
ber of children in the parent's household when the parent is 5 years old, region of the parent's birth
fixed effects and age of child fixed effects and obtain the residualized rank. Second, we correlate
the residualized rank of parent's and child's skills. This method should reduce the bias from other
possible channels that can affect skills and make the results comparable to estimates in Table 9.
     An interesting pattern emerges from the figures: the rank of parent's socio-emotional skills
during childhood is positively associated with the rank of child's skills. This pattern holds for both
dimensions of socio-emotional skills. The magnitude of the rank slope ranges between 0.05 and
0.16. In Appendix B, we present similar scatter plots for the intergenerational mobility equation
(8) in levels (residualized socio-emotional skills) and for the rank regressions equation (9) when
we do not include any controls.17
     The magnitudes of our estimates in the rank regressions are smaller than the ones in the inter-
generational mobility in occupation found in Bell et al. (2018), who use the Longitudinal Study of
England and Wales (LS), and income found by Rohenkohl (2019) who uses data on income from
the BHPS and Understanding Society survey and Gregg et al. (2017), who use data from the Na-
tional Child Development Study (NCDS) and the British Cohort Study (BCS).18 The nightingale
rose chart in Figure 6 compares the rank regression coefficients from the studies mentioned above
(without controls) when equation 9 is estimated without controls (see Figures B2 and B1).19
     Table 9 presents the estimates for equation (9) respectively with the outcome variable being
the rank of the child's internalizing and externalizing skills. We include a set of controls, which
are the parent's gender, the child's gender, the number of children in the household, the mother's
age at the parent's birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the parent is the first born, the parent's employment
status at the age of 34, the grandparent's employment status, education and profession in 1975,
the number of children in the parent's household when the parent is 5 years old, region of the
parent's birth fixed effects and age of child fixed effects. In columns 1-3, the outcome variable is
the rank of the child's internalizing skill, while in columns 4-6 the outcome variable is the rank of
the child's externalizing skill.20
     The rank regressions in table 9 show that an increase in one rank in the parent's internalizing
skill at the age of 16 translates in 0.107 increase in the rank of child's internalizing skill (column
1), while an increase in one rank in the parent's externalizing skill at the age of 10 translates in
0.125 increase in the rank of the child's internalizing skill (column 2). These coefficients remain
significant when we study to what extent skills are interdependent in the transmission process in
  17
      In this instance, the relationship is nonlinear as previously noticed by the literature (Chetty et al., 2014).
  18
      Similar results have been found by Belfield et al. (2017), who use data from the National Child Development Study
(NCDS) and the British Cohort Study (BCS).
   19
      We urge caution in comparing our results to the findings in intergenerational mobility in income and/or occupation
because of different datasets, variables and model specifications.
   20
      At the age 10 sweep, teachers were also asked to answer socio-emotional questions similar to the ones asked to the
parents in the Rutter A questionnaire. We can also do the same exercise and estimate the intergenerational mobility in
socio-emotional skills by using the questions answered by the teachers - instead of the parents - at the age 10 sweep.
We present the results from the rank regression in Table B2 in Appendix B and highlight that we find similarities in our
estimates.

column 3. In columns 4-6, we study the relationship between the rank of the child's externalizing
skill and the parental skills. Importantly, the parent's internalizing skill at the age of 16 and
externalizing skill at the age of 10 are still important predictors for the other dimension of the
child's socio-emotional skill. An increase in one rank in the parent's internalizing skill at the age
of 16 corresponds to 0.139 increase in the rank of the child's externalizing skill and an increase
in one rank in the parent's externalizing skill at the age of 10 corresponds to 0.253 increase in the
rank of child's externalizing skill (column 6).
     As mentioned previously, some results in the extant literature focus on measurements taken
contemporaneously for parent and child. Here we provide evidence on what we would encounter
if we were to use contemporaneous measures of socio-emotional skills as in Dohmen et al. (2011)
and Anger (2012), for example. Tables 10 and 11 present the estimates for intergenerational mo-
bility for level and rank regressions when we use socio-emotional skill measures which are con-
temporaneously measured for parents and children. Parents at the age-34 sweep were asked some
socio-emotional related questions, which we exploit to measure socio-emotional skill. We focus
on the internalizing skill which is derived by a multi-factor model that considers 3 items (unhappy,
worried and fearful) common across the 4 different waves. Column 1 in the tables reproduces the
estimates from Column 1 in Tables 8 and 9 using this alternative measure for internalizing skills.
Column 2 in the tables shows estimates using contemporaneous measures. Table 10, for example,
shows that an increase in one unit in the parent's internalizing skill translates in a 0.253-unit in-
crease in the child's internalizing socio-emotional skill. This coefficient is more than three times
as large as the coefficient we observe when we use measures of socio-emotional skills collected
in different waves and at different ages (column 1, Table 10).21 In column 3, we present estimates
from an instrumental variable regression where the socio-emotional skill at the age 34 is instru-
mented by their own socio-emotional skill during childhood. The coefficient is noisily estimated
and not significant, but its magnitude is even higher. Finally, column 4 presents the first stage of
the instrumental variable regression and F -statistics for the first stage are presented in the notes to
the tables.
     Finally, Tables 12 and 13 report the transition matrices by quintile of the socio-emotional skill
distribution. We report them for the parents' internalizing and externalizing skills at the age of 5,
10 and 16. The transition probabilities report measures of directional mobility, highlighting how
mobility may change at different quintile of the socio-emotional skill distribution. One advantage
of reporting transition matrices is to gain a deeper understanding on whether intergenerational
persistence in socio-emotional skills arises from what happens in the tails. Interestingly, children
of very low socio-emotional or very high socio-emotional skill parents mostly stay in the same
quintile as their parents, while children of parents in the middle of the socio-emotional skills
distribution often end up in a different quintile from their parents.
     We also notice that there are large variations in the percentage of children staying in the same
   21
      Fewer items are used to compute the socio-emotional skill measure since the age-34 sweep asked fewer socio-
emotional related questions. Interestingly, our estimates of intergenerational mobility do not change even if we change
the items considered to measure socio-emotional skills. We notice that the estimates of mobility from column in Table
9 are robust and similar to the ones in column 1 in Table 11.

quintile of their parents as well as those moving up or down across different skills and ages. The
probability of moving from the lowest to the highest quintile ranges from 13.1 to 21.1, highlight-
ing the importance of distinguishing among skills. For each matrix, we also present the `spectral
gap mobility index' introduced earlier to facilitate comparison across matrices. The intergenera-
tional transition matrix with higher mobility is the one relating the child's internalizing skill to the
parent's externalizing skill at the age of 5, while the one with lower mobility is the one relating
the child's externalizing skill to the parent's externalizing skill at the age of 10. The correlation
between this measure and the rank regression coefficient estimates is -0.75 (the correlation is neg-
ative because a higher rank coefficient implies lower mobility, while a high spectral gap mobility
index implies higher mobility). This high correlation comes mostly from the mobility measures
of child's externalizing skill on parent's skill (the correlation is -0.90: almost the same ranking)
rather than the child's internalizing skill on parent's skill (the correlation is -0.26).

to the mobility measures (i.e., coefficients from the rank regressions) in other economic domains. Bell et al. (2018) and Rohenkohl (2019) study an
older cohort born respectively in 1974-83 and 1973-1991. Gregg et al. (2017) study mobility in income in the BCS70. Higher values of the rank
coefficient correspond to lower mobility.

Note. All standard errors in parentheses are obtained using 1,000 bootstrap repetitions, taking into account the factor estimation stage
that precedes the regression (*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1). The table presents estimates for equation 9 on the intergenerational
mobility in socio-emotional skills. The internalizing skill is derived by a factor model that considers 3 items (unhappy, worried and
fearful) common across the 4 different waves. Column 1 presents the regression of the child's internalizing skill on the parent's
internalizing skill at the age of 5, 10 and 16. Column 2 presents the regression of the child's internalizing skill on the parent's
internalizing skill at the age of 34. Column 3 presents the regression of the child's internalizing skill on the parent's internalizing skill
at the age of 34 instrumented by the parent's internalizing skill at the age of 5, 10 and 16. Column 4 presents the first stage of the
instrumental variable regression. The F-statistics for exclusion of the instruments is 13.46. Other controls include the parent's gender,
the child's gender, the number of children in the household, the mother's age at the parent's birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the parent is
the first born, the parent's employment status at the age of 34, the grandparent's employment status, education and profession in 1975
and the number of children in the parent's household when the parent is 5 years old.

Note. The Tables present the percent frequency with which a child is in certain internalizing quintile (row) when parent is in a certain
socio-emotional quintile (column). The spectral gap mobility index is computed by taking the difference between one and the second
largest eigenvalues of the transition matrices. The transition matrices are stochastic matrices; therefore, their largest eigenvalue is
always one. The discrepancy between one and the second largest could be seen as a departure from zero mobility, which corresponds
to an identity matrix. Higher numbers of the spectral gap mobility index corresponds to higher mobility.

Note. The Tables present the percent frequency with which a child is in certain externalizing quintile (row) when parent is in a certain
socio-emotional quintile (column). The spectral gap mobility index is computed by taking the difference between one and the second
largest eigenvalues of the transition matrices. The transition matrices are stochastic matrices; therefore, their largest eigenvalue is
always one. The discrepancy between one and the second largest could be seen as a departure from zero mobility, which corresponds
to an identity matrix. Higher numbers of the spectral gap mobility index corresponds to higher mobility.

7        Multi-generational persistence in socio-emotional skills
During the 1975, 1980 and 1986 sweeps, the mothers of the subjects (i.e., grandmothers to the
children of the 1970 cohort) were also asked some socio-emotional related questions. We exploit
these data to study multi-generational persistence in socio-emotional skills that is, the relationship
between the grandmother and grandchild's socio-emotional skills.
    The data on the grandmother's socio-emotional skill in adulthood come from the cohort mem-
bers' mothers who have completed the Malaise Inventory (Rutter et al., 1970) in the 1975, 1980
and 1986 sweeps.22 Table 14 presents the set of 24 'yes-no' self-completion questions asked to
the grandmothers to measure their levels of psychological distress, or depression.23 Individuals
responding `yes' to eight or more of the 24 items are considered to be at risk of depression.24
    We focus only on one dimension of socio-emotional skill, `internalizing skills', for which we
have data comparable between grandmothers and grandchildren. Table 15 shows the questions
retained from both waves. Subsequently, we fit a multi-group factor model to derive the factor
score, as outlined in section 3, in order to study multi-generational mobility in socio-emotional
skills.
    We begin by studying intergenerational mobility in socio-emotional skill by correlating the co-
hort member's and the mother's internalizing skill. Table 16 presents the estimates from the level
regressions, while Table 17 presents the same estimates from the rank regression. We include a set
of controls which are the cohort member's gender, the age of the cohort member's mother at birth,
a dummy equal to 1 if the cohort member is the first born, the employment status, education and
profession of the cohort member's parent in 1975, and the number of children in the cohort mem-
ber's household when the cohort member is 5 years old. We still find that the mother's internalizing
skill is positively correlated with the cohort member's socio-emotional skills. However, we urge
caution in comparing these results to the main estimates for the following reasons. First, the con-
trols we include are different. Second, the measures of skills for the mothers (aged around 25 years
old in 1975) and the cohort members are contemporaneous. These results hint at the bias that we
highlight in Section 6 when we estimate intergenerational mobility in socio-emotional skills us-
ing contemporaneous measures. The intergenerational mobility coefficients obtained from using
contemporaneous measures of socio-emotional skills for the sample of parents and children (see
column 2 of Tables 10 and 11), estimated at around 0.25 in both cases, has the same magnitude as
the estimates obtained for the sample of grandmothers and parents, which uses contemporaneous
measures of socio-emotional skills (see column 1 in Table 16 and 17). Interestingly, these results
    22
      The Malaise Inventory was developed from the Cornell Medical Index Health Questionnaire which is comprised
of 195 self-completion questions.
   23
      In the 1975 sweep the scale is binary, in the 1980 sweep the scale is continuous from 0 to 100 and in the 1986
sweep the scale is categorical with 3 categories. We converted them to binary. We converted the continuous scale form
0 to 100 (where 100 means "most of the times") to 'no behavioural problem' (dummy equal to 1) if the answer is below
80 and 'yes behavioural problem' (dummy equal to 0) if the answer is above 80. We have tried different cutoffs and the
results are robust.
   24
      Rodgers et al. (1999) show that that the internal consistency of the scale is acceptable and holds in different
socioeconomic groups. Rutter et al. (1970) notice that 'the inventory differentiates moderately well between individuals
with and without psychiatric disorder'.



                                                          34
do not depend on which items we include or not to derive the internalizing skill (in Tables 10 and
11, we use only 3 items to derive the internalizing score).25
     Tables 18 and 19 present the estimates for multi-generational persistence in the internalizing
skill respectively when the outcome variable is the child's raw internalizing score and the rank of
the internalizing score. We include a set of controls which are the parent's gender, the child's gen-
der, the number of children in the household, the mother's age at the parent's birth, a dummy equal
to 1 if the parent is the first born, the grandparent's employment status, education and profession
in 1975, the number of children in the parent's household when the parent is 5 years old, region of
the parent's birth fixed effects and age of child fixed effects.
     The estimates show that the grandmother's internalizing skill in adulthood is predictive of the
grandchild's internalizing skill. This finding hints at a strong persistence in socio-emotional skills
which goes back even to the grandmother's generation. For example, Table 19 shows that an
increase in one rank in the grandmother's internalizing skill in 1975 translates in an increase in
0.086 rank in the grandchild's internalizing skill (column 1) and in 0.053 rank in the grandchild's
internalizing skill after we control for parental skills (column 5). The multi-generational mobility
coefficient - namely, the grandmother's internalizing skill at the 1975 sweep - is significant when
we do not include any controls for the parent's internalizing skill (column 1). This effect is also
robust to controlling for the parents internalizing skills in the rank regressions on Table 19, though
not in the linear regression in Table 18 hinting at potential `masking' by outliers (see (Rousselet
and Pernet, 2012)).26
     A strand of the literature has investigated multi-generational mobility in mental health, which
is related to a certain extent to socio-emotional skills. Johnson et al. (2013) study multi-generational
mobility in mental health across three generations by using the BCS70, but find no correlation be-
tween the grandmother and grandchild's mental health. Their approach to study multi-generational
mobility suffers from some of the problems which we have mentioned in the introduction and dis-
cussed in Section 6. They measure parents' mental health during adulthood, while they measure
children's mental health during childhood. In addition, contemporaneous measure of parents' and
children's mental health are used from the age-34 sweep, which could lead to reverse causality if
the disruptive child affects the parents' mental health.27


  25
       One alternative to discipline our estimates would be a statistical model where

                         YiC = YiP + i ,         YiC =  ~iP + ~i
                                                       ~Y            and   YiC =     ~iG + i ,
                                                                                 ~ × Y

where YiC and YiP are child and parent skills in childhood as previously defined and Y       ~iP and Y ~iG are parent and
grandparent skills in adulthood.
   26
      The p-value for a bootstrapped Wald test that the grandmothers' internalizing skill coefficients are jointly different
from zero is 0.06 in column 5 from Table 19. For the linear regression (column 5 from Table 18), the p-value for such
a joint test is 0.573.
   27
      Some other reasons for why Johnson et al. (2013) find no multi-generational correlation after controlling for parents
could be the following. Their measure of grandchildren's mental health is not directly comparable to the ones of
grandmothers and parents. For grandmothers and parents, they use the same questions, while for grandchildren they
sum all the responses from SDQ which contains some items that are not mental health related. Finally, their measure of
mental health is obtained by averaging the responses to the mother mental health questionnaire, instead of estimating a
factor model.

                        combine to measure levels of psychological distress, or depression. The 24 items of
                        the inventory are 'yes-no' questions.

Note. All standard errors in parentheses are obtained using 1,000 bootstrap repetitions, taking into account the factor estimation stage
that precedes the regression (*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1). The table presents estimates for equation 9 on the intergenerational
mobility in socio-emotional skills (regression of parent's socio-emotional score on grandmother's socio-emotional score (internalizing)
and parent'socio-emotional skill at age 5, 10 and 16). Other controls include the cohort member's gender, the age of the cohort
member's mother at birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the cohort member is the first born, the employment status, education and profession
of the cohort member's parent in 1975, and the number of children in the cohort member's household when the cohort member is 5
years old. The p-value for the test that the socio-emotional skill coefficients are jointly zero is computed as follows by bootstrapping
the entire procedure. For each bootstrapped sample, we estimate the factors, run the regression and estimate the Wald statistics
(the weighting matrix for the Wald statistic is obtained by using the bootstrap sample (Hall and Wilson, 1991)). This gives us the
distribution for the Wald statistic once recentered (by subtracting the mean of the empirical distribution). So we compute the percentile
of the Wald statistic for the hypothesis we want to test in the empirical distribution for the test statistic obtained from the bootstrap
samples. One minus that is the p-value.

Note. All standard errors in parentheses are obtained using 1,000 bootstrap repetitions, taking into account the factor estimation stage
that precedes the regression (*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1). The table presents estimates for equation 9 on the intergenerational
mobility in socio-emotional skills (rank-rank regression of grandchild's socio-emotional score on grandmother's socio-emotional score
(internalizing) and parent'socio-emotional skill at age 5, 10 and 16). Other controls include the parent's gender, the child's gender,
the number of children in the household, the mother's age at the parent's birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the parent is the first born, the
grandparent's employment status, education and profession in 1975 and the number of children in the parent's household when the
parent is 5 years old. The p-value for the test that the socio-emotional skill coefficients are jointly zero is computed as follows by
bootstrapping the entire procedure. For each bootstrapped sample, we estimate the factors, run the regression and estimate the Wald
statistics (the weighting matrix for the Wald statistic is obtained by using the bootstrap sample (Hall and Wilson, 1991)). This gives
us the distribution for the Wald statistic once recentered (by subtracting the mean of the empirical distribution). So we compute the
percentile of the Wald statistic for the hypothesis we want to test in the empirical distribution for the test statistic obtained from the
bootstrap samples. One minus that is the p-value.

8    Conclusion
This study investigates the life cycle dynamics and the intergenerational mobility in socio-emotional
skills in the United Kingdom by using unique data from the 1970 British Cohort Study. We notice
a considerable amount of persistence in the life cycle dynamics of socio-emotional skills, provid-
ing suggestive evidence of the importance of early childhood in the skill formation and pointing
towards extending these models to consider the skills not only in the previous period but also in
earlier periods, especially in the early childhood.
    In addition, our results contribute to the literature by providing an estimate of intergenera-
tional mobility, which tackles some of the concerns on previous ones. First, the possibility to use
multiple observations of socio-emotional skills over the life cycle mitigates the 'lifecyle' bias and
questions whether parents' socio-emotional skills in early childhood rather than in adolescence
are more predictive of their child's socio-emotional skills. Second, socio-emotional skills are not
contemporaneously measured in the BCS70. This means that the main direction of the intergen-
erational transmission is presumably from parents to their children, ruling out the possibility of
children influencing their parents' personality. We also move away from estimating the correla-
tion between parents and children's socio-emotional skills and estimate a rank regression of child's
socio-emotional skills on parents' socio-emotional skills measured at the age of 5, 10 and 16. A
comparison of our estimates to the ones on the intergenerational mobility in other economic do-
mains shows that our estimates have a smaller magnitude to the ones found in the intragenerational
mobility in income and occupation in the United Kingdom (Bell et al., 2018; Gregg et al., 2017;
Rohenkohl, 2019).
    Multi-generational mobility in socio-emotional skills is finally investigated. We select items
from the behavioural questionnaires which are comparable across children, parents and grand-
mothers. We adopt methodological advances in multi-group factor analysis to establish that the
grandmother and grandchild's socio-emotional skill measures are comparable. Our estimates
show that the transmission of socio-emotional skills is quite persistent. The grandmother's socio-
emotional skill predicts her own grandchild's socio-emotional skills.

A       Measurement invariance
As in Attanasio et al. (2020), we test for measurement invariance since any comparison between
socio-emotional skills across different generations requires that the socio-emotional measures we
derived have the same relationship with the latent constructs (Vandenberg and Lance, 2000; Put-
nick and Bornstein, 2016). Specifically, the items in the age 5, 10 and 16 sweeps for the cohort
members and the child-sweep must measure internalizing and externalizing in the same way.
     This is a formally testable property following the assumptions introduced by Wu and Es-
tabrook (2016). Intuitively, this is done by comparing the baseline model, namely the maximal
identifiable model, with a series of models with stronger restrictions on the item- and cohort-
specific intercepts vic and loadings ic , requiring them to be the same across groups. Their fit is
compared to see if the models with stronger restrictions have a worse fit. If this is not the case, the
invariance is achieved.
     We estimate three models with additional restrictions that we can compare with the baseline
model and assess their relative fit. First, we estimate the threshold invariant model which is ob-
servationally equivalent to the baseline model when each item is a categorical variable with three
categories (Wu and Estabrook, 2016). We highlight that the number of parameters and fit are
indeed the same for the baseline and threshold invariant model.
     Second, we estimate the loading- and threshold-invariant model, which imposes stronger re-
strictions. Namely, we impose that the factor loadings ic and the threshold on the parameters
must be the same between parents and children. This means that the items in the Rutter/SDQ scale
from the children and parents have the same relationship with the latent skill because the factor
loadings are the same across groups. If the fit of the model is similar to the baseline one, then
socio-emotional skills can be placed on the same scale and we can compare the variance.
     Third, we estimate a loading-, threshold-, and intercept-invariant model. Namely, we impose
that the factor loadings jc , the intercepts vjc and the threshold be the same between parents and
children. If the fit of the model does not worsen compared to the baseline model, we can also
compare the means of the socio-emotional skills between the two groups.
     Table A1 compares the fit of each model. We first present the 2 statistic, but also other alterna-
tive goodness-of-fit indices commonly used, such as the root mean squared error of approximation
(RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI).2
     The baseline model fits the data well. When we restrict the threshold and loadings to be the
same across groups, this yields a fit comparable to the baseline one. The fit worsens when we also
    2
     The RMSEA is defined as (2 - df )/df (N - 1), where df are the degrees of freedom and N is the sample
size. Lower values imply a better fit and MacCallum et al. (1996) suggest measures between 0.05 and 0.08 to be fair.
On the other hand, CFI and TLI determine how far our model is from the model with the model where the variables
have no correlation across them). The CFI is defined as ( Null Model - Alternative Model )/ Null Model , where = 2 - df ,
whereas the TLI is defined as ( Null Model - Alternative Model )/( Null Model - 1), where now = 2 /df . Both indices are
between 0 and 1 and a higher value corresponds to a better fit for the alternative model.

B    Mobility in socio-emotional skills
In this section, we report additional estimates of mobility in socio-emotional skills. Figures B1
and B2 report binned scatter plots of the rank regression for internalizing and externalizing skills
when we do not include any controls. Figures B3 and B4 present non-parametric binned scatter
plots of the relationship between the children's and the parent's residualized socio-emotional skill.
Table B2 presents estimates for equation 9 on the intergenerational mobility in socio-emotional
skills (rank-rank regression of child's socio-emotional score on parent's socio-emotional score
at the age of 5, 10 and 16), where socio-emotional skill at the age-10 sweep are derived from
questionnaire administered to teachers.

  Note. These figures present non-parametric binned scatter plots of the relationship between children's and parent's percentile
  socio-emotional skill ranks. These figures are based on the socio-emotional skill scores built from factor analysis. Each panel

  equally sized (4 percentile point) bins and plot the mean child percentile rank versus the mean parent percentile rank within each
  bin. The slopes are estimated using an OLS rank-rank regression on the microdata on the two dimensions of socio-emotional
  skill. All standard errors in parentheses are obtained using 1,000 bootstrap repetitions, taking into account the factor estimation

  panel plots the mean child socio-emotional skill within each parent socio-emotional skill bin. To construct each series, we group
  parents into 25 equally sized (4 percentile points) bins and plot the mean child's skill versus the mean parent's skill within each
  bin. The slopes are estimated using an OLS linear regression on the microdata on the two dimensions of socio-emotional skill.
  All standard errors in parentheses are obtained using 1,000 bootstrap repetitions, taking into account the factor estimation stage
  that precedes the regression.

that precedes the regression (*** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1). The table presents estimates for equation 9 on the intergenerational
mobility in socio-emotional skills (rank-rank regression of child's socio-emotional score on parent's socio-emotional score at the age
of 5, 10 and 16). Socio-emotional skill at the age-10 sweep derived from questionnaire administered to teachers. We do not include
items for disobedient and aches because teachers were not administered such questions. Other controls include the parent's gender,
the child's gender, the number of children in the household, the mother's age at the parent's birth, a dummy equal to 1 if the parent is
the first born, the parent's employment status at the age of 34, the grandparent's employment status, education and profession in 1975
and the number of children in the parent's household when the parent is 5 years old.
