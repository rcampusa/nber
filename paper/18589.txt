The Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign and Russia's Mortality Crisis

                                             ABSTRACT

Political and economic transition is often blamed for Russia’s 40% surge in deaths between 1990 and
1994. Highlighting that increases in mortality occurred primarily among alcohol-related causes and
among working-age men (the heaviest drinkers), this paper investigates an alternative explanation:
the demise of the 1985-1988 Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign. Using archival sources to build a
new oblast-year data set spanning 1978-2000, we find a variety of evidence suggesting that the campaign’s
end explains a large share of the mortality crisis – implying that Russia’s transition to capitalism and
democracy was not as lethal as commonly suggested.

    Crude death rates in Russia soared by 40% between 1990 and 1994, climbing
from 11 to nearly 15.5 per thousand.1 By 2009 standards, the decline in male life
expectancy at birth (by nearly 7 years, to 57.6) would tie Russian men with their
counterparts in Bangladesh, falling short of male longevity in less-developed
countries with troubled population health histories (Botswana, Haiti, North Korea,
and Yemen, for example). The magnitude of this surge in deaths – coupled with
the Soviet Union’s international prominence – has prompted observers to term
this demographic catastrophe “the Russian Mortality Crisis.”


    The underlying cause of the mortality crisis has been hotly debated, but most
accounts implicate Russia’s political and economic transition.2 Specific
transition-related explanations include: a decline in economic output and
employment (Cornia and Paniccia 2000; Brainerd 2001), rapid privatization
(Stuckler, King, and McKee 2009; Stuckler, King, and McKee 2012),
physiological and psychological stress (Shapiro 1995; Bobak and Marmot 1996;
Kennedy, Kawachi, and Brainerd 1998; Leon and Shkolnikov 1998; Gavrilova et
al. 2001), rising inequality (Lynch, Smith, Kaplan, and House 2000; Denisova
2010), reductions in the relative price of vodka (Treisman 2010), and
deterioration of the medical care system (Ellman 1994).3


    The proximate cause of the crisis is less controversial: alcohol consumption
soared in Russia between 1990 and 1993 (Leon et al. 1997; Treml 1997;

Shkolnikov et al. 1998; Walberg et al. 1998).4 The types of deaths that increased
most during the transition were related to alcohol, either directly (alcohol
poisonings and violent deaths) or indirectly (heart attacks and strokes) (Leon et al.
1997; Gavrilova et al. 2000; Brainerd and Cutler 2005). Although most diseases
disproportionately kill the young and the old, crisis deaths were also concentrated
among working age men – the demographic group that drinks the most.5


    Recognizing the central role of alcohol, we investigate an alternative
explanation for the Russian mortality crisis. Rather than the transition to
capitalism and democracy, we study the coincident demise of the (reputedly
successful) 1985-1988 Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign (Leon et al. 1997;
Shkolnikov and Nemtsov 1997; Cockerham 1999). The campaign was
unprecedented in scale and scope – and it operated through both supply- and
demand-side channels, simultaneously raising the effective price of drinking and
subsidizing substitutes for alcohol consumption. At the height of the campaign,
official alcohol sales had fallen by as much as two-thirds (Russians responded by
increasing home-production of alcohol called samogon – although our estimates
suggest not by nearly enough to offset the reduction in state supply).6 In practice
the campaign lasted beyond its official end– restarting state alcohol production
required time, and elevated alcohol prices lingered.


    Figures 1a and 1b depict our basic logic (Human Mortality Database 2011).
Both crude (Figure 1a) and age-adjusted (Figure 1b) Russian death rates increased
linearly between 1960 and 1984, plummeted abruptly with the start of the
campaign in 1985, remained below the pre-campaign trend throughout the latter
1980s, rose rapidly during the early 1990s to a temporary peak in 1994, and then

question the role of alcohol consumption in explaining the mortality crisis.

  Death rates among males ages 35-44 rose by 74% between 1989 and 1994, for example.

  Throughout the paper, we use the term “samogon” to mean illegal alcohol generally.

largely reverted back to Russia’s long-run trend.7 The crisis could therefore be
the combined result of lagged ‘catch-up’ mortality (as relatively weak marginal
survivors saved by the campaign die at higher rates) together with reversion to the
long-run trend. A lagged effect of alcohol consumption on mortality is consistent
with findings in the medical literature on the delayed effects of alcoholism on
both liver cirrhosis and heart disease (see, for instance, Holder and Parker 1992;
Laonigro et al. 2009; and Savolainen, Penttila and Karhunen 1992). We develop
additional evidence on this point in the appendix using data from the Framingham
Heart Study.


                                [ Insert Figures 1a and 1b Here]


    We begin by establishing the association between the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol
Campaign and Russian mortality during the latter 1980s.8 Because adequate sub-
national data has not previously been compiled, doing so requires digitizing and
harmonizing archival Russian data sources to create a new panel data set of
Russian oblasts spanning years 1970-2000.9 Our reduced-form approach then
flexibly traces-out oblast-level changes in alcohol consumption and mortality over
time which vary in proportion to pre-campaign alcohol consumption. This
approach allows the data to tell us, in a flexible way, the lagged effects of the
campaign and its end on Russian mortality.


    Because the campaign was highly multifaceted and adequate data on its
individual components are largely unavailable, we use pre-campaign alcohol
consumption interacted with year dummies as a summary measure of campaign
intensity (assuming areas with greater pre-campaign alcohol consumption to be

  This relationship has previously been studied only qualitatively or using aggregate national-level
data – see White (1996), Treml (1997), Avdeev et al. (1998), and Nemtsov (2000). Balan-Cohen
(2007) finds superior health indicators among children born during the campaign.

  Oblasts are Russian administrative units; Data available online.

disproportionately affected – following Bleakley (2007) and (2010), Qian (2008),
Miller and Urdinola (2010), and Nunn and Qian (2011), for example).10 Overall,
we find that the campaign is associated with about 400,000 fewer deaths per year,
a reduction of 24% relative to the pre-campaign crude death rate.


     We then extend our framework to study the link between the end of the Anti-
Alcohol Campaign and Russia’s transition-era mortality crisis. Harder-drinking
oblasts prior to the campaign not only experienced larger mortality declines
during the late 1980s, but they also experienced disproportionate increases in
deaths during the 1990s. This relationship peaked in the middle of the decade and
matches temporal patterns predicted by independent simulations.11 Causes of
death more closely related to alcohol consumption (circulatory disease, accidents
and violence, and alcohol poisoning) also increased relatively more in these
oblasts during the 1990s. Importantly, these relationships are robust to – and in
some cases are in fact strengthened by – controlling for local economic conditions
during the transition period (GDP per capita, the employment rate, and
employment in private manufacturing – a measure of privatization). All in all,
our estimates explain a large share of the Russian mortality crisis.


     We conclude by conducting complementary simulation analyses of the
temporal relationship between alcohol consumption and survival (using the
longest-running panel survey of drinking and mortality of which we are aware –
the Framingham Heart Study) and documenting patterns of mortality
commensurate with campaign exposure in other former Soviet States and Eastern
European countries. On the latter, former Soviet states in the West and in the
Baltics exhibit similar mortality declines during the late 1980s followed by

   Bleakley (2007) and (2010), Qian (2008), Miller and Urdinola (2010), and Nunn and Qian
(2011) study population-wide health programs and interventions by assuming that areas with
greater pre-campaign exposure to a disease agent or risk-factor benefitted disproportionately.
11
   Using Framingham Heart Study data, we find temporal relationships that are consistent with the
pattern of mortality over time that we observe following the end of the anti-alcohol campaign (see
Appendix 3).




                                                5
similar surges during the early 1990s. This pattern is also present – but attenuated
– in former Soviet states with large Muslim populations for whom alcohol policy
matters less (in the Caucuses and Central Asia). By contrast, mortality patterns in
Eastern European countries undergoing political and economic transitions but not
subjected to the campaign (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak
Republic) are starkly different. These cross-national patterns are consistent with
the demise of the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol campaign playing an important role in
the Russian Mortality Crisis. Taken together, our results suggest that Russia’s
transition to capitalism and democracy per se was not as lethal as often suggested.


        I. Drinking in Russia and the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign


      A. Alcohol Consumption in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation
     The Soviet Union – and Russia in particular – historically ranks among the
world’s heaviest drinking countries. Alcohol consumption rose steadily between
1950 and 1985 – between 1960 and 1979 alone, alcohol sales nearly quadrupled
(with disposable household income spent on alcohol reaching 15-20%) (Treml
1982; Segal 1990; Tarschys 1993; White 1996; McKee 1999). Just prior to the
anti-alcohol campaign, annual consumption of pure alcohol in the Soviet Union
exceeded 14 liters per capita (compared to 8 liters in the United States) (Nemtsov
2000). This figure is roughly equivalent to adult males consuming half a liter of
vodka every two days (Ryan 1995).12 Given lower levels of drinking in Soviet
states with more Muslims (in the Caucasus and Central Asia, for example), the


12
  In addition to the quantity consumed, the type and pattern of alcohol consumption in Russia
(compared to other heavy-drinking countries like France) has important implications for mortality.
A disproportionate amount of consumption can be characterized as ‘binge drinking’ (defined as
three or more measures of alcohol within 1 to 2 hours), especially on weekends and holidays
(Bobak et al. 1999; Chenet et al. 1998; Malyutina et al. 2001; McKee and Britton 1998). Alcohol
abuse and binge drinking are linked not only to accidents and violent deaths, but more
quantitatively important, they are key risk factors for heart attacks and cardiovascular disease
(McKee and Britton 1998; McKee, Shkolnikov and Leon 2001; O’Keefe, Bybee and Lavie 2007;
Rehm et al. 2009;Tolstrup et al. 2006). Recent estimates suggest that alcohol abuse is responsible
for more than half of all deaths in Russian cities among those ages 15-54 (Leon et al. 2007;
Zaridze et. al. 2009).




                                                6
counterbalancing rate for Russia alone was presumably much higher (Shkolnikov
and Nemtsov 1997).


                        B. The Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign
     By the early 1980s, alcohol abuse was widely recognized as a major cause of
death, absenteeism, and low labor productivity in the Soviet Union.13 Although
difficult to estimate, observers suggest that alcohol’s cost to the Soviet economy
during the 1980s totaled about 10% of national income (Treml 1987; Segal 1990;
Tarschys 1993; White 1996).


     In response, the Politburo and the Central Committee passed resolutions
entitled “Measures to Overcome Drunkenness and Alcoholism” in May of 1985
(shortly after Mikhail Gorbachev became Secretary General). These decrees and
subsequent directives of the Central Committee and the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet ushered in the country’s most stringent anti-alcohol policies since its 1919-
1925 prohibition. Given tight state control of social and economic affairs, rapid
implementation and rigid adherence to campaign mandates were possible.


     The Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign consisted of seven broad measures
designed to raise the effective price of drinking and subsidize substitute activities.
Four were clearly supply-oriented. First, state production of alcohol was
drastically reduced. Between June 1985 and May 1986 alone, state production of
vodka and hard liquor declined by 30-40% (Segal 1990) and cognac production
fell by 44% (White 1996). Second, substantial new restrictions were placed on
alcohol sales. Liquor stores were not allowed to sell vodka or wine before 2pm
on business days, restaurants were no longer permitted to sell hard liquor, and the
official drinking age rose from 18 to 21. Sales near factories, educational
institutions, hospitals, and airports were prohibited. Third, the government

13
  Alcohol played a central role in violent crimes and traffic accidents as well. According to then
Interior Minister Vitalii Fedorchuk, two-thirds of all murder, battery, and rape as well as 70-80%
of “hooliganism” were committed under the influence of alcohol (Reid 1986; Treml 1991).




                                                 7
increased alcohol prices substantially. In 1985 alone, the price of vodka, liqueurs,
and cognac rose by 25% (McKee 1999), and prices were increased by about 25%
more in 1986 (White 1996). Fourth, heavy new sanctions for public drunkenness
and other alcohol-related offenses were introduced. Fines for workplace
intoxication were one to two times the mean weekly wage, and both home
production of alcohol and possession of homebrew equipment were punishable by
large fines or imprisonment.


     Three other measures focused on reducing the demand for alcohol. One was
heavy subsidization of substitute activities; all Soviet oblasts were required to
build and modernize leisure facilities (like parks and sport clubs) and to promote
cultural activities. Another was media propaganda and health education programs
together with bans on glamorous media depictions of drinking. To encourage
sober lifestyles, the government also created a national temperance society (the
“All-Union Voluntary Society for the Struggle for Temperance”) – within three
years, the society had 428,000 branches and more than 14 million members
(White 1996). Finally, the government made large efforts to improve the
treatment of alcoholism. Health care system responsibility for compulsory
treatment of alcoholism was expanded, and physician supervision of treatment
was required for up to five years.


     Aggregate state alcohol sales fell by more than 50% between 1984 and 1988
(White 1996). Official figures overstate the decline in alcohol consumption,
however, because they do not capture the “moonshining” response to the
campaign. Russians have a long-standing tradition of producing samogon
(literally, “distillate made by oneself,” a generic term for illegal alcoholic
beverages made from sugar, corn, beets, potatoes, and other ingredients) – and did
so more vigorously during the campaign (as Appendix Figure 1 shows).14

14
  A fictitious type of samogon called tabouretovka is made from wooden stools (or “tabourets”)
(Petrov, Dovich, and Il'f 1997). There were more extreme efforts to obtain alcohol as well: sales
of alcohol-based glue increased from 760 to 1000 tons between 1985 and 1987; sales of glass




                                                8
   Reductions in alcohol consumption also varied considerably across Russia.
Central to our identification strategy, areas with higher alcohol consumption rates
prior to the campaign experienced systematically larger declines during the
campaign (Bleakley 2007 and 2010). Appendix Figure 2 shows oblast-level mean
alcohol consumption rates for years 1980-1984, Section II describes how we use
this variation in our empirical analysis, and Section III investigates the
mechanisms underlying this relationship.


                     C. The Demise of the Anti-Alcohol Campaign
   The Soviet Central Committee officially ended the anti-alcohol campaign in
October 1988 (because of its unpopularity and the loss of revenue from alcohol
sales).15 In practice, however, the campaign extended beyond its official end for
several reasons. First, increasing state production of alcohol required time; vodka
production did not reach pre-campaign levels until 1993, for example (White
1996). Second, some campaign sales restrictions (against vodka sales on
Sundays, for example) remained in place (White 1996). Third, alcohol prices
remained high – 75% higher in 1989 than at the beginning of the campaign in
1985 (authors’ calculations). Overall, the result was that the campaign lingered –
both official and total alcohol consumption rates (including samogon) did not
return to pre-campaign levels until the early 1990s. Appendix Figure 1 shows this
slow recovery in our own data, concurring with Nemtsov’s (2000) suggestion that
1991 was the campaign’s de facto end date.


                             II. Data and Empirical Strategy




cleaners rose from 6,500 to 7,400 tons over the same period; and there was large-scale theft of
industrial alcohol (Treml 1997).
15
   The campaign was also politically divisive within the communist party, and two important
proponents of the campaign (Yegor Ligachev and Mikhail Solomentsev) retired from the Politburo
at the end of 1987.




                                              9
     We used archival sources to create a new panel data set covering 77 Russian
oblasts between 1970 and 2000.16 Table 1 presents descriptive statistics from this
data set by study period. In this section we summarize our key sources and
variables; Appendix 1 provides greater detail about each source (the intersection
of all key variables is generally years 1970, 1979, 1980, 1984-1987, and 1989-
2000).
                                      [ Insert Table 1 Here ]


     A. Economic, Demographic, and Alcohol Data from Goskomstat and Rosstat
                                            Yearbooks
     We obtained core demographic and alcohol variables from several types of
statistical yearbooks compiled by Goskomstat (the Soviet national statistical
agency) and Rosstat (the Russian Federation’s national statistical agency). Some
yearbook data is available through East View Information Services, a provider of
Eurasian archival source materials. We obtained the remainder from the Hoover
Institution’s “Russian/Soviet/Commonwealth of Independent States Collection”
print archives (available in hard-copy format in Russian).17 To fill gaps in the
coverage of these sources, we also used archival records published by scholars
outside of the Soviet Union (New World Demographics 1992; Treml and Alexeev
1993; Vassin and Costello 1997; Vallin et al. 2005; Heleniak 2006).


     Vital Records.— Our core mortality variables are crude death rates per 1,000
population, and alcohol poisoning death rates by gender per 100,000 population.
Russian death certificates are certified by physicians (or in less than 10% of the
cases, by paramedics), and evaluations of Russia’s mortality statistics generally



16
   All data compiled for this project are available upon request. In addition to true administrative
oblasts, our dataset contains 22 krai and autonomous republics as well. For simplicity, we
generically refer to all of these regions as oblasts. We exclude autonomous okrugs from our
analysis because information about them is not available for a number of years; we also exclude
Chechnya and Ingushetia (typically reported together as Chechnya-Ingush prior to 1991) because
of war-related inconsistencies in the data.

conclude that they are satisfactory in quality with modest under-reporting rates
(Andreev 1999; Bennett, Bloom and Ivanov 1998; Leon et al. 1997).18


     Causes of death in the Soviet Union were classified using a Soviet system with
175 categories; these categories were later harmonized with codes from the World
Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD-9).19 Goskomstat’s and Rosstat’s statistical yearbooks contain little cause-
specific mortality data at the oblast level, however. Given our focus, we have
compiled information on deaths directly linked to alcohol consumption
(cardiovascular disease, alcohol poisoning, and accident/violent deaths), deaths
more indirectly related to alcohol (digestive and respiratory disease deaths), and
deaths not closely alcohol-related (cancer deaths) (Vallin et al. 2005). We
obtained data on alcohol poisoning deaths for additional years from Vladimir
Shkolnikov and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research
(Vallin et al. 2005). Other causes of deaths at the oblast level are unfortunately
not available over our period of interest.


     Alcohol Sales.— As the sole legal producer and distributor of alcohol in the
Soviet Union, the government maintained records of alcohol sales (in liters) for
principal alcoholic beverages (vodka, beer, wine, cognac, and champagne).20


18
   Exceptions are Tuva’s statistics and regions in the North Caucasus, where reports suggest that
infant mortality under-reporting was as high as 25% during the 1980s (Blum and Monnier 1989).
These specific oblasts are Tuva, Dagastan Republic, Ingushitya Republic, Chechen Republic,
Kabardino-Balkarskaya Republic, Karachaevo-Cherkesskaya Republic, North Osetiya-Alaniya
Republic, Krasnodarskiy Krai, and Stavropolski Krai. We repeat the analyses shown in Table 3
excluding these oblasts – Appendix Table 1 shows that the results are similar.
19
   The Russian Federation used the Soviet cause of death classification system until 1999 but also
began using the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system in parallel in 1993
(see Shkolnikov, Mesle and Vallin 1993; Shkolnikov, McKee and Leon 2001). Cause of death
records are generally less reliable than other types of mortality data, so we emphasize our crude
death rate analyses but supplement them with analyses of cause-specific mortality.

   This data excludes information about alcohol sold on military bases. Beginning in 1992, it also
excludes alcohol sales at private trade outlets and restaurants. Data for cognac and champagne
sales data are only available beginning in the late 1990s (although they constitute a small share of
total sales). Finally, it does not measure quality. According to the Russian Trade Committee, the
share of alcoholic beverages rejected as substandard was 5.6% in 1991, rising to 12.4% in 1992,
25.6% in 1993, and 30.4% in 1994 (Nemtsov 2002).




                                                 11
Sales by type of beverage are reported in liters of pure alcohol for some years and
in thousands of dekaliters in other (partly-overlapping) years. We converted sales
data for all years into liters of pure alcohol, following Andrienko and Nemtsov
(2006) by assuming each type to have the following alcohol content: vodka: 40%;
wine: 14.4%; cognac: 18%; champagne: 22.8%; beer before 1995: 2.85%; beer
between 1995 and 1999: 3.37%; and beer after 2000: 3.85%.21 For each oblast-
year, we divide liters of pure alcohol by the corresponding population estimate,
yielding rates of pure alcohol consumption per person for years 1970, 1980-1992,
and 1996-2002. White (1996) uses retrospective survey data to suggest that sales
data during campaign years were generally not manipulated by politically-
motivated officials.


     Alcohol Production and Prices.— Prior to 1992, the Soviet government
controlled alcohol production and set prices administratively (i.e., they were not
determined by markets). We use the available, albeit highly incomplete, data on
production and prices to speculate (in the conclusion) about the salient
mechanisms through which the campaign operated. Government production data
are available for vodka, the most popular alcoholic beverage during our study
period (covering years 1970, 1979, 1980, 1985, and 1990-2000) and for pure
alcohol production (covering years 1989-1992, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1999-
2000).22


     Oblast-level alcohol prices are only available for post-transition years; annual
vodka price data covers years 1992 forward, for example (Goskomstat Rossii
1996c; 1996d; 1997e; 1998e; 2002c; 2006c). For earlier years (1980, 1985 and
1989), we can calculate the implied annual price of pure alcohol from total sales
(recorded in rubles) divided by the total quantity sold.


21
   For years possible, we verify the validity of our calculations through direct comparison with
data on sales measured in pure alcohol.
22
   We use vodka’s share of total alcohol production in 1990 at the oblast level to estimate vodka
production in 1989.




                                                12
     Other Covariates.— Some of our analyses control for other determinants of
mortality and for other factors proposed to explain the Russian mortality crisis.
We assembled oblast-year data on health care infrastructure and workforce (the
number of hospitals and the number of doctors per capita) and crude birth rates
using Goskomstat and Rosstat Yearbooks. We also collected data on employment
rates and employment rates in private manufacturing from Brown, Earle, and
Gehlbach (2009) and Earle and Gehlbach (2010); income per capita from Treml
and Alexeev (1993); and immigration and emigration flows from Andrienko and
Guriev (2004).23


           B. Estimating Total Alcohol Consumption (Including Samogon)
     Official alcohol sales data do not accurately reflect total alcohol consumption
because many Russians make samogon at home. Because comprehensive
estimates of oblast-year samogon production are not available, we extend the
work of Nemtsov (2000) to estimate it for the 1980s and early 1990s. Sugar is a
critical ingredient in samogon, so one approach is based on sugar sales that
exceed estimated dietary consumption (Nemtsov 1998). However, this method
fails for years 1986 and later when sugar was rationed (Treml 1997).


     Nemtsov (2000) therefore developed an alternative indirect technique using
forensic records. Both the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation mandate that
each oblast’s forensic bureau perform autopsies for all violent and accidental
deaths as well as deaths with unclear causes. Importantly, these mandatory
autopsies systematically document blood alcohol content (albeit in a non-random
sample of Russians).24 Nemtsov (2000) used these records to estimate the
association between blood alcohol concentrations and total alcohol consumption,
recovering implied samogon consumption. Using these estimates, he then
predicted samogon consumption for twenty-five oblasts between 1980 and 1992
23
   Other work (such as Stillman and Thomas 2008) investigates the health consequences of
Russia’s economic crisis late in the 1990s.
24
   The autopsy records used by Nemtsov were not made public during the Soviet era, so
manipulation for external political purposes is likely not a concern.




                                              13
(Nemtsov 2000).25 Despite their imperfections, the autopsy-based estimates
closely match sugar-based estimates in overlapping years and outperform other
methodologies (based on hospital admissions for alcohol-induced psychosis,
cirrhosis deaths, and pancreatitis deaths, for example) (McKee 1999; Nemtsov
2000; Balan-Cohen 2007).


     We use estimates published in Nemtsov (2000) – together with some algebraic
manipulation – to recover underlying parametric relationships (Appendix 2
describes the details of these calculations and their validation). We then use these
parameters to predict oblast-year samogon consumption and calculate total
alcohol consumption as the sum of official sales and samogon for years 1980-
1992.26 As Appendix Figure 1 shows, samogon consumption rose sharply as
official alcohol sales fell during the campaign, closely matching aggregate
relationships reported by others (Nemtsov 2000). In our analyses, we use both
official alcohol sales and total alcohol consumption estimates in parallel.


                                    C. Empirical Strategy
     Our empirical approach estimates the relationship between the Anti-Alcohol
Campaign and both (a) contemporaneous mortality during campaign years and (b)
subsequent mortality during transition years using a reduced-form approach.
Specifically, we pool together all sample years and estimate the association
between oblast-year death rates and interactions of oblast-level mean alcohol
consumption prior to the campaign with year dummy variables. This strategy

25
   These oblasts are Altai krai, Amur, Bashkiria, Ekaterinburg, Ivanova, Khabarovsk, Kaluga,
Karelia, Kemerov, Kursk, Leningrad, Moscow city, Moscow oblast, Murmansk, Novgorod,
Novosibirsk, Omsk, Orel, Rostov, Samara, Saratov, Sakhalin, St. Petersburg city, and Yaroslav.
26
   In short, Nemtsov (2000) provides an unadjusted OLS regression coefficient for the relationship
between samogon/illegal alcohol (IA) and official alcohol sales (OS) in 1990, and he also reports
correlation coefficients between official sales and samogon for years 1983, 1985 and 1990 (years
preceding, during, and after the campaign). The regression coefficient is equal to
Cov(IA,OS)/Var(OS), and the correlation coefficient r = Cov(IA,OS)/(Var(IA) 1/2×Var(OS)1/2).
Using the variance of official alcohol sales for years in our dataset and assuming the variance of
samogon to remain constant over time, we calculate implied regression coefficients for each year
1980-1992. We then use these year-specific regression coefficients and our oblast-year official
sales data to predict total alcohol consumption (including samogon).

follows Bleakley (2007, 2010), Qian (2008), Miller and Urdinola (2010), Nunn
and Qian (2011) and others in assuming that areas with greater pre-campaign
exposure to a disease agent benefitted more from a population-wide campaign
against the disease.27 In our case, a particular advantage of this approach is that it
effectively provides a summary measure of campaign intensity (given that the
campaign is highly multifaceted and that data on its individual components is
generally unavailable). To flexibly trace out the differential time path of
mortality in harder-drinking oblasts relative to more temperate ones during
campaign and transition periods, we estimate variants of the following basic
equation for oblasts o and years y:


     (1) mortalityoy = α + Σtβt[(mean pre-campaign alcohol consumption)o×(year)yt] + δo +
                                                  δy+ εoy,



where mortality is a death rate (crude death rates per 1,000 or cause-specific death
rates per 100,000), (mean pre-campaign alcohol consumption) is the mean of
oblast o’s total alcohol consumption during sample years prior to the campaign
(1980-1984), and δo and δy represent oblast and year fixed effects. We also
estimate variants of equation (1) that include oblast-specific linear time trends and
oblast-year health system controls (doctors per capita and hospital beds per
capita). We hypothesize that βt<0 during campaign years (as oblasts with higher
pre-campaign alcohol consumption are disproportionately affected by the
campaign) and βt>0 during transition years (as oblasts with larger reductions in
mortality during the campaign experience larger death rate increases after its end).


                                    D. Graphical Evidence
     Before turning to econometric results, we first use our data set to examine
graphical relationships between the anti-alcohol campaign and Russian crude

27
  This could be true for many reasons – supply restrictions could be targeted to these areas, price
elasticities of demand may be greater in these areas, etc. In Section III we investigate the
underlying mechanisms associated with variation in campaign intensity.

death rates. Figure 2 shows death rates over time by pre-campaign drinking rates.
To construct this figure, we calculate mean total alcohol consumption in each
oblast for years 1980-1984. We then graph crude death rates between 1970 and
2000 for the top and bottom quartiles of the distribution of pre-campaign alcohol
consumption. Consistent with an effective anti-alcohol campaign, oblasts in the
top quartile experienced larger crude death rate reductions in the latter 1980s
during the campaign. Then, during Russia’s subsequent political and economic
transition, this relationship reverses. Between 1990 and 1994, larger crude death
rate increases occurred among oblasts with more pre-campaign drinking – and
oblasts with less pre-campaign drinking experienced smaller increases. Overall,
Figure 2 is consistent with the campaign’s end playing an important role in the
mortality crisis.

                                     III. Results


               A. Russian Mortality during the Anti-Alcohol Campaign
   Alcohol Consumption and Mortality.— In estimating equation (1), we assume
that oblasts with higher pre-campaign alcohol consumption (i.e., that had greater
pre-campaign exposure to a disease-causing agent) benefitted relatively more
from the population-wide campaign through larger reductions in alcohol
consumption. Before analyzing changes in crude death rates, we first show that
empirical patterns of drinking over time support this assumption. Regressing per
capita alcohol consumption on interactions between mean pre-campaign alcohol
consumption and campaign year dummies, Table 2 shows that each additional
liter of alcohol consumed per person per year prior to the campaign is associated




                                         16
with 28%-69% decline in per capita alcohol consumption during campaign
years.28
                                     [ Insert Table 2 Here ]


     We then directly estimate changes in crude death rates during the Anti-Alcohol
Campaign using equation (1). Table 3 reports year-specific β estimates, tracking
differential mortality time paths of oblasts with varying levels of pre-campaign
alcohol consumption. Focusing on the 1980s, these estimates fall significantly
below zero in 1985 and continue to fall further during the campaign, reaching
their lowest point in 1988 (significantly lower than in 1985) before rising again
and becoming insignificant by the time of transition. Table 3 shows that this
pattern of results is robust to the inclusion of oblast-specific linear time trends and
other available oblast-year controls (per capita number of doctors and per capita
number of hospital beds).29 Appendix Table 1 also shows that these results are
not generally sensitive to the exclusion of oblasts with lower quality vital
statistics.30


                                     [ Insert Table 3 Here ]


     Figure 3 shows death rate changes and 95% confidence intervals implied by
median pre-campaign alcohol consumption (14.38 liters per capita each year)
throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This figure is based on our flexible reduced-
form estimates of the effect of changes in alcohol consumption (with a median
decline of about 20% during campaign years). During the campaign, the median
oblast’s mortality decline in 1985 was -2.07 per 1,000 population, falling to -3.46

28
   We use sample years prior to 1990 to estimate this relationship (we only have our total alcohol
consumption measure for years up to 1992).
29
   Instead of the reduced-form approach in Table 3, we can also use a similar TSLS strategy,
instrumenting for campaign-year alcohol consumption with average pre-campaign alcohol
consumption interacted with year dummies. While the TSLS estimates generally corroborate our
reduced-form findings (available upon request), they only identify the contemporaneous mortality
effect of the campaign and ignore important dynamic effects which our reduced-form approach
captures.
30
   Footnote 20 provides the names of these oblasts.

per 1,000 in 1988 and rising back towards zero by 1990. This temporal pattern of
implied changes in crude death rates closely matches the year-to-year aggregate
deviations during the campaign from Russia’s long-term death rate trend shown in
Figures 1a and 1b.31 Scaling the implied death rate changes by Russia’s
population in 1984, they imply approximately 1.6 million fewer deaths during the
four campaign years, with annual death rates 24% below pre-campaign rates (on
average).32


                                      [ Insert Figure 3 Here ]




        B. The Anti-Alcohol Campaign and Russian Mortality during the 1990s
     Having established the relationship between the Anti-Alcohol Campaign and
reductions in mortality during the 1980s, we then investigate how the end of the
campaign is related to the subsequent surge in mortality during Russia’s political
and economic transition. Returning to Table 3, we examine year-specific β
estimates from equation (1) for years throughout the 1990s. These estimates track
how increases in transition-era mortality vary with pre-campaign alcohol
consumption – and mortality declines during the preceding campaign. After
returning to zero in 1991/1992, the estimates then become positive in 1993, rise
sharply to their peak in 1994/1995, and then fall again in the latter 1990s.
Importantly, this temporal pattern of estimates closely matches aggregate
deviations from the long-term mortality trend during crisis years as shown in
Figures 1a and 1b.


31
   Appendix Table 3 reports implied crude death rates changes at median pre-campaign alcohol
consumption as well as one standard deviation above and below the median.
32
   Averted deaths are calculated by first multiplying coefficient estimates for interactions between
pre-campaign mean alcohol consumption and year dummies with median pre-campaign
consumption, yielding implied changes in crude death rates. For 1985, 1986, 1988, and 1989, this
is: -0.14×14.38=-2.07, -0.20×14.38=-2.81, -0.24×14.38=-3.47, and -0.21×14.38=-3.03
(respectively). These implied changes in crude death are then scaled by the size of the Russian
population in 1984 (141,525,504) to obtain implied deaths averted. For 1985, 1986, 1988, and
1989, this is: 293,059; 398,887; 490,468; and 429,414 deaths averted (respectively). Summing
over campaign years yields 1,611,828 averted deaths.




                                                18
     Figure 3 plots changes in death rates implied by these estimates for median
pre-campaign alcohol consumption. At the height of the mortality crisis rebound
in death rates, excess deaths implied by our model were 5.85 per 1,000. Scaling
these estimates by Russia’s population in 1989, this implies 2.15 million excess
deaths between 1992 and 1995, an average increase of 43% across these years
relative to 1989.33 Although our estimates are accompanied by wide confidence
intervals, they suggest that the end of the Anti-Alcohol Campaign played a
leading role in explaining Russia’s mortality crisis.


     Cause-Specific Mortality.— Next, we examine changes in three groups of
cause-specific death rates with differential relatedness to alcohol consumption.
Those most closely related to alcohol are alcohol poisonings, deaths due to
cardiovascular disease, and accidents/violent deaths. Causes more indirectly
linked to alcohol are respiratory diseases and digestive diseases. Finally, cancer
deaths are most weakly related to alcohol (and occur only after a long period of
time).


     Estimating equation (1) using cause-specific deaths per 100,000 as dependent
variables, Figures 4, 5a and 5b show implied changes in cause-specific mortality
for median pre-campaign alcohol consumption.34 Alcohol poisonings, circulatory
disease deaths, and accidents/violent deaths rise considerably during the early
1990s in proportion to intensity of the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign, and
their temporal pattern matches the changes in crude death rates implied by Table


33
   Relative to 1989, there were 223,698 excess deaths in 1992, 545,596 in 1993, 717,623 in 1994,
and 620,067 in 1995. We calculated the number of implied excess deaths by first multiplying
coefficient estimates for interactions between pre-campaign mean alcohol consumption and year
dummies with median pre-campaign consumption, yielding implied changes in crude death
rates. For 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, this is: 0.047×14.38=0.68, 0.221×14.38=3.18,
0.34×14.38=4.89, and 0.407×14.38=5.85 (respectively). These implied changes in crude death
rates are then scaled by the population in 1989 to obtain implied excess deaths. For 1992, 1993,
1994, and 1995, this is: 99,338; 467,101; 718,617; and 860,227 excess deaths (respectively),
totaling 2,145,283 deaths.
34
   See Appendix Table 2 for the complete regression results.




                                               19
3. Consistent with gender differences in alcohol consumption (see Bobak et al.
1999 and Zaridze et al. 2009, for example), Figure 4 shows that alcohol
poisonings rise much more for men than for women. Figure 5a then shows that
the most quantitatively important increases occur among cardiovascular disease
deaths and accidents/violence (a large medical literature implicates alcohol
consumption as a leading risk factor for heart attacks and strokes).35 Predicted
respiratory and digestive disease death rates rise to lower levels (consistent with
their weaker relationship to alcohol consumption), and the trajectory of predicted
cancer deaths is essentially flat throughout the 1990s (shown in Figure 5b).36


                              [ Insert Figures 4, 5a and 5b Here ]


     Robustness to Controlling for Local Economic Conditions.— We then
consider alternative explanations for our main findings. Given the emphasis that
previous research on the mortality crisis has placed on changing economic
circumstances, we begin by assessing the robustness of our results to the inclusion
of controls for local economic conditions. Oblast-year data is available for real
income, the employment rate, and the employment rate in private manufacturing
(“privatization”) in years 1991 and later. We first re-estimate equation (1) using
data from these years – and we then repeat our estimation including these local
economic controls. Table 4 Panel A shows that our estimates without economic
controls (indexed to 1991) exhibit the same temporal pattern of mortality
throughout the 1990s – and importantly, the estimates do not change in a
meaningful way with these additional controls. Our findings therefore suggest
that campaign-related increases in death rates during the 1990s cannot be
explained by “privatization” or other changes in local economic conditions.


                                [ Insert Table 4 Panel A Here ]
35
   The medical literature suggests that cardiovascular disease deaths should be quantitatively most
important (Chenet et. al. 1998; Britton and Mckee 2000; Corrao et. al. 2000; Hemström 2001;
McKee, Shkolnikov, and Leon 2001; Corrao et. al. 2002; Ramstedt 2009).
36
   Similarly, infant mortality is not associated with campaign intensity during the transition era.




                                                20
     We then assess the sensitivity of our findings to other oblast-year controls
(immigration and emigration as well as health system measures). These controls
are available for years 1990 and forward, so we re-estimate equation (1) using
these years and then include the additional controls. As Table 4 Panel B shows,
our results again do not appear to be explained by these other factors.


                                [ Insert Table 4 Panel B Here ]


                      IV. Simulations and Cross-Country Evidence


         A. Simulation Evidence on the Temporal Relationship between Alcohol
                                Consumption and Mortality
     Although the anti-alcohol campaign lingered for several years after its official
repeal (alcohol consumption did not reach its pre-campaign levels until the early
1990s), the Russian mortality crisis followed the campaign’s end by several years.
This temporal relationship is unsurprising given that the consequences of drinking
become manifest over time (as subsequent heart attacks and strokes, for example).
To investigate more carefully the timing of deaths following a sharp decrease and
subsequent resumption of drinking, we use unique longitudinal data from the
Framingham Heart Study in the United States to estimate mortality hazards
associated with alcohol consumption. Using these estimates, we then simulate
reductions in drinking analogous to those under the anti-alcohol campaign
followed by increases in drinking observed during Russia’s political and
economic transition.37 Overall, we find strikingly similar temporal patterns of
mortality, with excess deaths emerging 2-3 years after the resumption of pre-
campaign drinking and lasting for more than a decade. Appendix 3 presents these
analyses in detail.

37
  Levels of alcohol consumption vary from country to country; however, the simulations will still
be informative about the mortality response to sudden (and drastic) changes in alcohol
consumption.




                                               21
     B. The Anti-Alcohol Campaign across Other Former Soviet States and Eastern
                                             Europe
     Finally, if the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign explains an important part of
the Russian Mortality Crisis, then temporal patterns of mortality commensurate
with campaign exposure should be present across other Eastern European
countries. Other former Soviet states also experienced the campaign, and the
campaign’s impact should vary systematically with ethnic/religious composition
(with larger campaign-year reductions and larger transition-year increases in
countries with lower concentrations of Muslims).38 Alternatively, non-Soviet
Eastern European countries had no anti-alcohol campaign – and therefore should
have different temporal patterns of mortality despite experiencing similar political
and economic transitions.


     Figure 6 shows crude death rate comparisons between Russia and three groups
of countries: former Soviet states with a small share of Muslims (Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova), former Soviet states with a
larger share of Muslims (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan), and non-Soviet Eastern European countries (the
Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Poland). Each panel shows
de-trended crude death rate means for one of these country groups (and Russia for
comparison), plotting residuals obtained by regressing country-year crude death
rates on a linear year variable (Demoscope 2009; World Bank 2010). Former
Soviet states with low Muslim concentrations exhibit both crude death rate
decreases during the latter 1980s and death rate increases during the early 1990s
similar to those in Russia. Alternatively, former Soviet states with higher Muslim
concentrations experienced campaign year reductions and transition year-

38
  Given Islam’s prohibition of intoxicants, we exploit variation in the concentration of Muslims
across the former Soviet Union. The underlying logic is that former Soviet states with relatively
more Muslims should experience smaller absolute declines in deaths during the campaign and
smaller increases in mortality during transition years. Guillot, Gavrilova, and Pudrovska (2011)
report congruent evidence from Kyrgyzstan.




                                                22
increases that are muted considerably. Finally, death rates over time in non-
Soviet Eastern European countries appear unrelated to those in Russia (see also
Mesle 2004). These patterns of mortality during the 1980s and 1990s across
former Soviet States and Eastern European countries are consistent with our
oblast-level findings for Russia.


                                [ Insert Figure 6 Here ]


                                    V. Conclusion


  This paper demonstrates an important but under-recognized link between the
Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign and Russia’s mortality crisis. Intervening on
a variety of margins, the campaign simultaneously raised the cost of drinking and
subsidized substitute activities. Alcohol consumption declined markedly, and
Russia's crude death rate fell by an average of 24% per year, implying roughly
1.61 million fewer deaths during the latter 1980s. However, the campaign’s
unpopularity and public finance impact led to its repeal shortly before the collapse
of the Soviet Union. The Russian death rate subsequently climbed rapidly – and
the increase associated with the campaign's end explains a large share of the
Russia's Mortality Crisis (roughly 2.15 million deaths). Former Soviet States and
the rest of Eastern Europe also experienced similar temporal patterns of mortality
commensurate with their exposure to the Anti-Alcohol Campaign.


  If our thesis is correct, then an important subsequent question is: through what
underlying behavioral factors did the campaign operate? Unfortunately, data
limitations prevent us from providing a definitive answer. In one approach that
we tried, we estimated variants of equation (1) to analyze the campaign’s
relationship with both official state production of vodka and an alcohol price
index. The results suggest little evidence that our summary measure of campaign
intensity operates either through differential supply shifts or through differential




                                         23
price increases. However, we are hesitant to draw conclusions given the
limitations of the state vodka production and alcohol price index data noted
earlier. We emphasize that this is an important area for further research.


     Overall, a key implication of our main findings is that Russia’s transition to
capitalism and democracy was not as lethal as commonly suggested (Stuckler,
King, and McKee 2009). However, our findings also do not necessarily imply
that alcohol prohibition raises welfare (in Russia or elsewhere), even if it saves
lives. Health is only one argument of welfare, and health-improving restrictions
on individual choices can cause harm as well as do good.39




39
  Negative externalities and the role of addiction introduce ambiguity into welfare evaluations of
alcohol policies and are beyond the scope of our paper (Becker and Murphy 1988; Becker,
Grossman, Murphy 1994; Gruber and Koszegi 2001).

Data on death rates, official alcohol sales, doctors, hospital beds, internal immigration and emigration, income, and employment are available in annual
statistical yearbooks compiled by Goskomstat and Rosstat. We obtained this statistical yearbook data through East View Information Services and the
Hoover Institution’s “Russian/Soviet/Commonwealth of Independent States Collection” print archives with supplementation from New World
Demographics (1992), Treml and Alexeev (1993), Vassin and Costello (1997), Vallin et al. (2005), and Heleniak (2006) as well as from Vladimir
Shkolnikov and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. Data on employment in private manufacturing are from Brown,
Earle, and Gehlbach (2009) and Earle and Gehlbach (2010); data on emigration and immigration is from Andrienko and Guriev (2004). We
constructed estimates of total alcohol consumption by extending the work of Nemtsov (2000) for estimating illegal alcohol production. See
Appendices 1 and 2 for details. Crude death rate is per 1,000 population. Alcohol sales and consumption is liters per capita. Cause-specific death
rates are per 100,000 population.

Data on official alcohol sales were obtained from annual statistical yearbooks compiled by Goskomstat and Rosstat
through East View Information Services and the Hoover Institution’s “Russian/Soviet/Commonwealth of Independent
States Collection” print archives with supplementation from New World Demographics (1992), Treml and Alexeev
(1993), Vassin and Costello (1997), Vallin et al. (2005) as well as from Vladimir Shkolnikov and colleagues at the Max
Planck Institute for Demographic Research. Official alcohol sales augmented with estimates of illegal alcohol
production by extending the work of Nemtsov (2000) (see Appendices 1 and 2 for details). Data sources for additional
control variables available in Appendix 1. Table cells report OLS estimates obtained from equation (1) for interactions
between oblast-level mean pre-campaign alcohol consumption and campaign year dummy variables. All specifications
include oblast and year fixed effects. Alcohol consumption measured in liters per capita. Oblast-year samples are
restricted to years prior to 1990 (1970, 1978, 1980, 1985, 1986, 1988, and 1989) and exclude Tuva, Dagastan Republic,
Ingushitya Republic, Chechen Republic, Kabardino-Balkarskaya Republic, Karachaevo-Cherkesskaya Republic, North
Osetiya-Alaniya Republic, Krasnodarskiy Krai, and Stavropolski Krai. Standard errors clustered at the oblast level
shown in parentheses. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, and ***p<0.01.

                                        Appendix I: Data

       This appendix describes the sources used to construct our new oblast-year panel data set
spanning 1970-2000 that includes mortality rates, official alcohol sales, alcohol prices, alcohol
production, and socio-economic and demographic characteristics. We use the term “oblast”
throughout, but geographic areas also include several krais (Altaiskii, Krasnodarskiy,
Krasnoyarskii, Khabarovskii, Primorskii, Stavropolski) and autonomous republics (Altai,
Bashkortostan, Buryatiya, Chuvash, Dagastan, Kabardino-Balkarskaya, Kalmykaya,
Karachaevo-Cherkesskaya, Karelia, Khakasiya, Komi, Marii-El, Mordovaya, North Osetiya-
Alaniya, Sakha, Taatarstan, Tuva, Udmurtskaya). We exclude autonomous okrugs (Aginsky,
Eventsky, Chukotsky, Khanty-Mansiisk, Komi-Permiatsky, Koryaksky Nenets, Nenetsky,
Taimyrskii (or Dolgano-Nentsky), Usy-Ordynsky, Yamalo-Nenetsky) from the analysis because
we do not have information about them for several key years. Overall, our analyses therefore
generally include 77 oblasts (including krais and republics).

         From the 1960s until 1986, statistics on deaths, alcohol production/consumption, and
crime were collected but not made publicly available for political purposes. Under Glasnost and
Mikhail Gorbachev’s leadership, however, the Central Statistical Office of the Soviet Union
(Goskomstat) resumed publication of oblast-level mortality statistics in annual demographic
yearbooks in 1986 (publication of official alcohol sales data and crime statistics resumed shortly
thereafter – in 1987 and 1988, respectively). Since the 1980s, an estimated 94% of all deaths in
Russia have been medically certified (with the remainder certified by trained paramedics called
feldshers) (Shkolnikov et al. 1996). Oblast governments then use these death records to
construct oblast-level mortality statistics by age, sex, and cause. In principle, these oblast-year
statistics are available from Goskomstat (and its successor Rosstat). Obtaining these records is
not easy in practice, so we also conducted a comprehensive search of all Russian and English
language publications with statistics on mortality, alcohol, and crime in constructing our data set.

                                         A. Vital Statistics

        Our primary dependent variable is the crude death rate (CDR), which is defined as the
number of deaths per 1,000 people. The CDR is calculated as the number of deaths from all
causes in a calendar year divided by the mid-year de facto population (the official inter-censual
population estimate) and is available for years 1970, 1978, 1980, 1985, 1986, and 1988-2000
(Goskomstat SSSR 1987; New World Demographics 1992; Goskomstat Rossii 1992; 1993a;
1995; 1996b-2005b).

       We also study death rates (per 100,000 population) by several categories of causes. In
the Soviet Union, cause-specific deaths were reported using a Soviet classification system
containing 175 categories. These were later reclassified according to the World Health
Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (see below). Given the focus of
our study, an important cause of death is alcohol poisoning (a marker for a broader set of
alcohol-related deaths). The Soviet Union and Russian Federation require that sudden,
unexpected deaths be investigated (by autopsy). Cases of alcohol poisoning are identified when
blood alcohol concentrations exceed 250 mg/dl and in the absence of other apparent causes.
Alcohol poisoning deaths are reported separately for men and women and are available for years
1978/9 and 1988-2000. These data were graciously provided by Vladimir Shkolnikov. To
convert alcohol poisoning deaths (which are reported by age group for years 1989-2000) into
overall death rates (per 100,000), we use the 1998 European Standard Population. Alcohol
poisoning death rates are then the weighted average of the age-specific rates (using standardized
population shares as weights).

        In addition to alcohol poisonings, we study data on deaths by other major causes:
neoplasms/cancers (group 2, codes 140-239), circulatory diseases including cardiovascular
diseases (group 7, codes 390-459), acute respiratory infections (group 8, codes 460-519),
diseases of the digestive system (group 9, codes 520-579) and accidental/violent deaths
(accidents, other poisonings, homicide, and suicide (group 17, codes 800-999). About half of
deaths in the last category are thought to be alcohol-related (Nemtsov 1998; 2000). These data
are available for 1978/8, 1988/9 and annually since 1990 (Goskomstat Rossii 1993b; Goskomstat
Rossii 1996b-2005b; Vallin et al. 2005).

        Evaluations of Russia’s mortality statistics generally conclude that they are acceptable in
quality with relatively little under-reporting. Exceptions are Tuva and regions in the North
Caucasus (Dagastan Republic, Ingushitya Republic, Chechen Republic, Kabardino-Balkarskaya
Republic, Karachaevo-Cherkesskaya Republic, North Osetiya-Alaniya Republic, Krasnodarskiy
Krai, and Stavropolski Krai) where studies of infant mortality under-reporting suggest rates as
high as 25% during the 1980s (Blum and Monnier 1989). The cause of death statistics appear
somewhat less reliable as many alcohol related deaths seem to be classified as cardiovascular
disease or cause unknown (Andreev 1999, Gavrilova et. al. 2005, Zaridze et al. 2009).

        Between 1969 and 1991, the Soviet cause-of-death classification system was changed
three times (in 1970, 1981 and 1988). The Soviet system from 1965 to 1970 was similar to WHO
ICD-8 codes, and the revisions in 1981 and 1988 closely resembled WHO ICD-9 codes
(Goskomstat created a key matching the two) (Shkolnikov et al. 1996). The analyses of Vallin et
al. (1996) suggest that the changes in 1970 and 1981 did not influence the registration of deaths
from major causes (at least at ages up to age 65) (Vallin et al. 1996). The 1988 revision simply
merged the previous classification’s ‘employment-related’ and ‘non-employment-related’
alcohol poisoning subgroups into a single category. A comparison of data from Russia and the
three Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania which shifted before 1999) shows no
discontinuity, suggesting that data before and after the coding change are roughly comparable
(Mesle et al. 1996).

                                     B. Population Measures

       Population estimates used to convert deaths into death rates are based on the Soviet
censuses of 1970, 1979, and 1989 Soviet censuses and the 2002 census of the Russian
Federation. These censuses were conducted on January15, 1970; January17, 1979 and 1989; and
between October 9 and 16, 2002. Using census population counts, Goskomstat produced official
population estimates for January 1 of each census year. For inter-census years, oblast statistical
offices estimated their populations using information on births and deaths as well. Population
estimates were also adjusted using data on internal migration collected by the Ministry of the
Interior. Mid-year de facto populations used as denominators for constructing rates are calculated
as arithmetic means of population estimates at the beginning of a given year and the subsequent
year (Goskomstat SSSR 1990; New World Demographics 1992; Goskomstat Rossii 1993c;
Goskomstat 1996a-2005a).


                                         C. Alcohol Sales

        As a monopolist, the government of the Soviet Union decided official alcohol production,
pricing, foreign trade, and domestic distribution. Goskomstat collected statistics on alcohol sales
from reports of government retail trade networks across the country (but do not alcohol sold on
military bases). After Russia’s political and economic transition, Rosstat continued collecting
data in the same way, although data after 1992 do not include legal private trade and restaurant
sales. More importantly, official sales statistics also do not include illegal home production of
alcohol (samogon).

        Data on official sales are reported in billions of rubles and in volume of pure alcohol for
years 1970, 1980, 1985 and 1989. In addition, official sales data are reported in liters of pure
alcohol per person for 1970, 1980, 1984, 1985 and 1989-1992. We also have information on
sales of specific types of alcoholic beverages (vodka, wine, beer, champagne, and cognac). The
numbers for individual beverages sales are reported in liters per person and are available for
years 1970, 1980-1992, and 1997-2000. Sales data for cognac and champagne were available
since 1999 only. We converted the sales data for specific types of beverages into total sales of
pure alcohol using the following assumptions about alcohol concentrations for each type of
beverage (from Andrienko and Nemtsov 2006): Russian vodka 40%; wine 14.4%; cognac 18%;
champagne 22.8%; beer 2.85% (before 1995), 3.37% (between 1995 and 1999), and 3.85% (after
2000). To summarize, we calculate alcohol consumption per capita in liters of pure alcohol from
sales of different types of alcoholic beverages using the following formula:

     Liters of Pure alcohol = 0.144*wine + 0.4*vodka+ 0.228*champagne + 0.18*cognac +
      0.285*beer*1(1970-1994) + 0.337*beer*1(1995-1999) + 0.389*beer*1(2000-2005).

We thus generate a panel of oblast-level total alcohol sales data from 1970 to 2000 (with data
missing between 1971 and 1979). The data prior to 1997 (when both official sales and sales of
specific beverages types are reported) show that our calculations using beverage-specific data
closely matches the Goskomstat official data on pure alcohol sales.

                                D. Alcohol production and prices

       The government controlled alcohol production and prices which were set by the
administration and not determined by market forces during the Soviet regime. The most
comprehensive information on production is available for vodka which is also the most popular
beverage in Russia. Data on vodka production are reported in 1,000 liters for 1970, 1979, 1980,
1985 and 1990-2000 (Goskomstat Rossii 1993a; 1998g; 2000g; 2002g; 1999h-2004h; TsCU
SSSR 1971; 1980). In addition, we have information on production of pure alcohol in rubles per
person for 1989-1992, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1999-2000 (Goskomstat SSSR 1989b; Goskomstat
Rossii 1993a; 1995a; 1997f; 1998f; 1999h-2004h). We use the oblast-specific share of vodka
production in total alcohol production in 1990 to construct vodka production in 1989 (from
information on pure alcohol production).

         Alcohol prices are available at the oblast level only following Russia’s political and
economic transition. Specifically, we have annual information about the price of a liter of
domestic vodka at the end of year beginning in 1992 (Goskomstat Rossii 1996c; 1996d; 1997e;
1998e; 2002c; 2006c). For earlier years, we calculate alcohol prices using information on official
alcohol sales and production. For alcohol sales, we have data in liters per person and rubles for
years 1970, 1980, 1985, and 1989. In addition, we have data on alcohol production both in 1,000
liters and rubles per person for 1999-2000. We then calculate the price of a liter of pure alcohol
between 1970 and 1989 by dividing total sales in rubles by the total quantity sold (or produced).
Similarly, we calculate the price of pure alcohol after 1999 by multiplying total alcohol
production in rubles per person by the oblast population and then dividing by total alcohol
produced (in liters).

                                       E. Other Covariates

        To control for other factors influencing mortality in Russia, we assembled oblast-year
data on employment, income, health care infrastructure, fertility, and migration. Employment is
measured as the number of people employed per 1000 population and is available for 1985 and
all years beginning in 1990 (Goskomstat Rossii 1997f, 2002j, 2006j). We also use data on the
share of employment in private manufacturing, which is available for all years beginning in 1992
(Brown, Earle and Gehlbach 200, Earle and Gehlbach 2010). Income is measured as average
income per month in real Rubles and is available for years 1970, 1980, 1985, 1989-1992, and all
years beginning in 1994 (Goskomstat Rossii 1992, 1993a, 1996a-2005a, Treml and Alexeev
1993). Our health care infrastructure and workforce measures are the number of hospital beds
per capita and the number of doctors per capita; these variables are available for years 1970,
1975, 1980 and all years beginning in 1985 (Goskomstat Rossii 1994, 1997f-2001f, 2002i-2005i,
Goskomstat SSSR 1990b). Crude birth rate data (defined as the number of births per 1,000
population) is available for years 1970, 1980, 1985-1986, and all years beginning in 1988
(Goskomstat SSSR 1987, Goskomstat Rossii 1992, 1993a, 1995, 1996b-2005b, New World
Demographics 1992). Finally, data on immigration and emigration flows are available for all
years beginning in 1989 (Andrienko and Guriev 2004, Goskomstat SSSR 1990a, Goskomstat
Rossii 1993b, 1995, 2002i-2005i).

     Appendix II: Estimation of Total Alcohol Consumption (Official Alcohol Sales and
                                  Samogon Production)

        Official alcohol sales data measure sales of state-produced alcoholic beverages.
However, anecdotal evidence suggests that illegal production of alcoholic beverages – especially
samogon – increased during the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol campaign. Because comprehensive
oblast-year estimates of illegal alcohol production are not available, we extended the work of
Nemtsov (2000) to estimate illegal alcohol production and consumption for the 1980s and early
1990s.

        Nemtsov (1998, 2000) developed two indirect methods for estimating illegal alcohol
consumption. First, Nemtsov (1998) exploits the fact that sugar is the main ingredient required
for samogon production. For Moscow prior to 1986 (when the Soviet Union began to ration
sugar), he used sugar sales data to estimate excess sugar sales by subtracting standard dietary
requirements of sugar from total sugar sales.1 Excess sugar sales are then converted into
samogon production estimates with information about the sugar concentration of samogon.

         To estimate samogon production for years after 1986, Nemtsov (2000) used forensic
records to develop a second indirect technique. Both the Soviet Union and the Russian
Federation require each oblast’s forensic bureau to perform autopsies for all violent and
accidental deaths as well as for deaths with unclear causes. All autopsies report blood alcohol
content, effectively providing a non-random sample of Russians with measures of alcohol
concentration in the blood. Nemtsov (2000) calculates the ratio of autopsies with positive blood
alcohol content (excluding alcohol poisoning deaths) to the number of autopsies with no blood
alcohol content and parametrically relates this ratio to total alcohol consumption. He then uses
this estimated parametric relationship to predict total (including illegal) alcohol consumption for
25 oblasts between 1980 and 1992, allowing him to recover implied samogon consumption
(Nemtsov 2000).2 Autopsy-based estimates closely match sugar-based estimates for Moscow
between 1983 and 1986 and outperform other methodologies (based on hospital admissions for
alcohol-induced psychosis, cirrhosis deaths, and pancreatitis deaths, for example) (McKee 1999,
Nemtsov 2000, Balan-Cohen 2007).

        To generate oblast-year estimates of total alcohol consumption for key years in our data
set, we use statistical relationships between official alcohol sales and estimated samogon
consumption reported in Nemtsov (2000). Specifically, Nemtsov (2000) uses data from 25
oblasts in 1990 to regress samogon consumption on official alcohol sales, estimating the
following relationship: samogon = 12.38 – 1.02×official sales. He also reports the correlation
coefficient between official sales (OS) and samogon/illegal alcohol (IA) for years 1983, 1985
and 1990. Because the regression slope is equal to Cov(IA,OS)/(Var(OS)) and the correlation
coefficient r = Cov(IA,OS)/(Var(IA)1/2×(Var(OS)1/2), we can use the observed variance of
1
  Nemtsov (1998) uses the minimum amount of sugar sold (per person and month) in the state retail network during
the period 1983 to 1986. The figure he uses – 24.3 kg of sugar (recorded for September of 1985) – is close to the
average sugar consumption (24 kg) in the Soviet Union as reported by the Institute of Nutrition of the Soviet Union
in the Academy of Medical Sciences.

  These oblasts were Altai krai, Amur, Bashkiria, Ekaterinburg, Ivanova, Khabarovsk, Kaluga, Karelia, Kemerov,
Kursk, Leningrad, Moscow city, Moscow oblast, Murmansk, Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Orel, Rostov, Samara,
Saratov, Sakhalin, St. Petersburg city, Yaroslav.
official sales in 1990 to calculate the implied variance of samogon production in 1990.
Assuming the variance of samogon production to remain constant over time, we then use the
observed variance of official sales in 1983 and 1985 to calculate implied regression coefficients
for years 1983 and 1985. We assign the slope in 1983 to pre-campaign years 1980-1984, the
1985 slope to campaign years 1985-1989, and the 1990 slope to post-campaign years 1990-1992.

       We then calculate year-specific regression constants. To do so, we subtract observed
annual national-level official alcohol sales from annual national-level total alcohol consumption
reported by Nemtsov (2000), yielding annual national-level samogon consumption. With
observed official alcohol sales and annual samogon consumption, we are then able to calculate
implied year-specific regression constants.

        Finally, we use these year-specific regression constants and slopes together with our
oblast-year data on official alcohol sales to predict oblast-year samogon consumption. We then
calculate total alcohol consumption as the sum of official sales and samogon consumption for
years 1980-1992. To validate these predictions, we calculate mean total consumption for the
same 25 oblasts studied in Nemtsov (2000), and we then compare annual means with those
provided by Nemtsov (2000) for Russia’s six regions (North and Northwest Region, Central
Region, Northern Caucasus Region, Urals and Volga Region, Western Siberia Region, and
Russian Far East Region). Appendix Table 4 shows that our calculations generally match these
published figures.
 Appendix III: Estimation and Simulation of the Temporal Relationship between Alcohol
              Consumption and Mortality in the Framingham Heart Study

        Many consequences of alcohol consumption occur over time. Specific examples include
cirrhosis, hypertension, heart attacks, and strokes. There are suggestive reports that moderate
alcohol consumption may increase longevity as well. However, given the magnitude of the
decline in alcohol consumption under the Gorbachev Anti Alcohol Campaign, we would expect a
reduction in mortality on balance. Similarly, we hypothesize that the relaxation of constraints to
drinking at the end of the campaign increased mortality. The precise temporal relationship
between contemporaneous alcohol consumption and subsequent mortality is unclear, however.

      The objective of this appendix is to examine this temporal relationship with data from the
Framingham Heart Study, a large longitudinal study uniquely suited for this purpose.

                                 A. The Framingham Heart Study

        Spanning 1948 to the present, the Framingham Heart Study has collected unusually
detailed high-frequency cohort health data from three generations of individuals. At its inception,
the study enrolled 5,209 randomly selected subjects from the population of Framingham,
Massachusetts. Sampling children of the original participants, it then added an additional cohort
of 5,124 individuals (and their spouses) in 1971 and a third generation of grandchildren (and
their spouses) in 2002. Our analyses use individuals from the first cohort observed during years
1948-2000.

        Investigators visit each member of all three cohorts every two years to administer a
detailed questionnaire and medical examination. The study follows every participant until death,
using death certificates to verify dates of death. Beginning with the seventh wave (which was
conducted between 1960 and 1964), the study began collecting information about alcohol
consumption. Specifically, the questionnaires ask respondents how many cocktails, glasses of
beer, and glasses of wine (with a standard drink size specified) they consumed during the past
month.

       Using responses to these questions, we computed total alcohol consumption (grams per
day) by multiplying the number of each type of drink consumed with its average alcohol content
(and summing across the three products). Following the Framingham investigators, we define a
standard drink to be 13.7 grams (0.018 liters) of pure alcohol. This amount of pure alcohol is
found in 12-ounces (0.36 liters) of beer, 5-ounces (0.15 liters) of wine, or 1.5-ounces (0.04 liters)
of 80-proof liquor such as gin, rum, vodka, or whiskey. We adjust for changes during the late
1960s in the alcohol content of liquor (from 100% to 80% proof), the type of wine consumed
(from fortified to table wine), and changes in average serving sizes in calculating total ethanol
consumption. Between waves, we impute alcohol consumption at the level reported in the
preceding wave.

      The Framingham Heart Study provides an excellent source of information about alcohol
consumption and mortality and is distinguished from other longitudinal data sets by its longevity
and data quality. Hence, the Framingham Heart Study is well suited for estimating the temporal
relationship between alcohol consumption and subsequent mortality.



                                          B. Estimation

         Our analysis proceeds as follows. Let  = 1 …  denote each of the  distinct individual
in the study, let  = 1 …  represent the wave in which the individual is interviewed. Individual
 is surveyed first at       years old, and then at   …   assuming that the individual
survives to those ages. While interview waves were generally separated by two years, there was
considerable variation in exact interview dates, and the survey was fielded every single calendar
year after the start of the study. The Framingham sample cohort at wave 1 consists entirely of
adults over the age of 28.

       Let   be the time elapsed between initial entry into the study and wave . We
normalize  = 0 for each individual. Let   be the date (measured relative to  ) that
individual  dies if he/she dies during the observation period, and let   = ∞ if the individual
does not die during the observation period. So an individual will not be observed in wave  if
  >   .

        Let   =   ,  ℎ  ,    , ℎ  !  " represent a vector of mutually
exclusive and collectively exhaustive dummy 1rvariables indicating computed alcohol
consumption category. We assign these dummies based on the amount of alcohol that individual
 reports drinking at time  over the previous four weeks. We assign   = 1 to individuals
reporting no alcohol consumption over the past month,  ℎ  = 1 to individuals in the 0-25th
percentiles of the alcohol consumption distribution (measured in grams of alcohol conditional on
positive consumption),    = 1 to individuals in the 0-25th percentiles of the alcohol
consumption distribution (measured in grams of alcohol conditional on positive consumption),
and ℎ  !  = 1 to people above the 75th percentile. In addition to alcohol consumption, we
observe education ( #  ), which we divide into six mutually exclusive groups: 8th grade or
less, some high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate, and post-graduate.
We also observe the sex of the respondent, coded as a dummy variable,  .

         Appendix Table 5 shows means and standard deviations of our key variables in waves 1,
7 (the first wave asking alcohol consumption questions), 17, and 23. In the initial wave, there
were 5,209 individuals in the cohort. As the sample ages, the number people in the sample
decreases, due mainly to deaths. The proportion of females increases at successive ages because
males have higher mortality rates at these ages. The proportion of the population that never
attended high school decreases substantially over time because those with lower educational
attainment have higher mortality hazards. In wave 7, 59% of the population reported some
alcohol consumption during the preceding month; 17% reported heavy drinking (that is
ℎ  !  = 1). By wave 23, the proportion of the cohort reporting some alcohol consumption
falls to 39%, and the share of heavy drinkers drops to 7%. This is due to both differential
mortality (as we will show) and less drinking with age.
       We first estimate a Cox proportional hazards model of the determinants (including
alcohol consumption) of time to death from entry into the study. Let $ %& be the hazard rate of
mortality for individual  at time . We model the mortality hazard as follows:

(1)               $ %& = $ %& '(%)           + )+ #  + ),  + )-   &


Here, $ %& is the baseline hazard rate. Appendix Table 6 shows the coefficient estimates (and
robust standard errors) from the Cox proportional hazards regression. The results are intuitive.
Males face a substantially higher mortality hazard than females, with a hazard ratio greater than
1.5; each year of age increases the hazard rate by about 8 percent. Those with education beyond
high school have lower mortality hazards. Finally, heavy drinking increases the mortality hazard
by about 11 percent relative to complete abstention. Mild or moderate drinking is associated with
a lower but statistically insignificant mortality hazard.

                                      C. Simulation Analysis

       We next use estimates from the Cox model above to conduct simulation analyses.
Specifically, we analyze temporal patterns of mortality rates for three different counterfactual
scenarios. Scenario 1: we study the evolution of mortality rates over time following a
hypothetical change from heavy drinking to abstention in the entire population. Scenario 2: we
model an event analogous to the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign in which heavy drinkers
become light drinkers and moderate and light drinkers abstain from drinking for five years. At
the end of the five-year “campaign” period, all individuals return to their previous alcohol
consumption path. Scenario 3: we repeat scenario 2 but also include a temporary two-year
increase in alcohol consumption (to levels above the path prior to the campaign) at the end of the
“campaign.” During these two years, previously heavy drinkers return to heavy drinking,
previously moderate drinkers become heavy drinkers, previously light drinkers become moderate
drinkers, and previous abstainers become light drinkers.

predicted by the counterfactual alcohol consumption path:

$2 %& is the predicted mortality hazard path for the 0 1 counterfactual alcohol consumption path,

$2 %& is the observed baseline hazard function, and )2 … )2- are the Cox regression coefficient
estimates.

       To simulate the three scenarios that we describe above, we need predictions for four
counter-factual paths. We need four counter-factual paths for three scenarios because Scenario 1
compares two distinct counter-factual paths, while Scenarios 2 and 3 use one counter-factual
                                                                                       .  such

We calculate a discrete version of (3) for each individual in the population and for each
counterfactual path.

simulation, and we set  = 1,000. For a given iteration, we calculate the time of death in the
simulation for each individual as follows:

        Appendix Figures 3-5 plot effect %& … effect , %&. Appendix Figure 3 shows the
mortality rate difference over time for Scenario 1 (which compares a counterfactual scenario in
which everyone is a heavy drinker against one in which everyone is an abstainer). In the
Framingham study cohort, the move from heavy drinking to abstinence would have lowered
mortality rate for a seventeen-year period. But mortality rates would have risen during the
following seventeen years. This happens because a move to abstinence would preserve alive
some part of the population. This part of the population is presumably at a higher risk of
mortality than other parts because a move to abstinence makes a difference in whether this part
stays alive. In later years, as the population ages and mortality rates necessarily rise, this part of
the population begins to die at higher rates. This compositional effect is analogous to what we
term “catch-up” mortality in Russia after the end of the Gorbachev Anti-Alcohol Campaign.

        Appendix Figure 4 shows the mortality rate difference over time for Scenario 2 (which
compares mortality rates in a counterfactual scenario in which there is a five-year period during
which heavy drinkers become light drinkers and moderate and light drinkers abstain against
observed mortality). This “campaign” changes heavy drinkers into light drinkers and moderate
and light drinkers into abstainers, and all individuals then revert to their pre-campaign drinking
path. Given the results from Scenario 1, it is unsurprising to see an initial reduction in mortality
during the campaign followed by an increase leading to excess mortality beginning three years
after the campaign’s end.

        Appendix Figure 5 shows the mortality rate difference over time for Scenario 3 (which
compares mortality rates in a counterfactual scenario in which the “campaign” from Scenario 2 is
followed by two years of excessive drinking, and then a return to the pre-campaign drinking
path, against observed mortality). The results are qualitatively similar to the previous graph – a
decline in mortality during the “campaign” followed by an increase leading to excess mortality
(larger in magnitude and longer lasting than in Scenario 2) about two years after the end of the
campaign.

        The magnitudes, patterns, and composition of alcohol consumption in the United States
and Russia differ markedly. Our simulations using Framingham Heart Study data are
nevertheless informative about mortality patterns in Russia assuming alcohol consumption and
mortality have an approximately linear (or even convex) relationship. More generally, our
primary objective is simply to establish general temporal relationships between alcohol
consumption and mortality consistent with those observed in Russia during the latter 1980s and
early 1990s.

Data on death rates and official alcohol sales were obtained from annual statistical yearbooks compiled by Goskomstat and Rosstat through East View Information Services and the Hoover
Institution’s “Russian/Soviet/Commonwealth of Independent States Collection” print archives with supplementation from New World Demographics (1992), Treml and Alexeev (1993), Vassin
and Costello (1997), Vallin et al. (2005) as well as from Vladimir Shkolnikov and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research; estimates of total alcohol consumption by
extending the work of Nemtsov (2000) for estimating illegal alcohol production (see Appendices 1 and 2 for details). Data sources for additional control variables available in Appendix 1. Table
cells report OLS estimates obtained from equation (1) for interactions between oblast-level mean pre-campaign alcohol consumption and campaign year dummy variables. All specifications
include oblast and year fixed effects. Crude death rates are per 1,000 population. All oblast-year samples are restricted to years prior to 2000 (1970, 1978, 1980, 1985, 1986, 1988, and
1989-2000) and exclude Tuva, Dagastan Republic, Ingushitya Republic, Chechen Republic, Kabardino-Balkarskaya Republic, Karachaevo-Cherkesskaya Republic, North Osetiya-Alaniya
Republic, Krasnodarskiy Krai, and Stavropolski Krai. Standard errors clustered at the oblast level shown in parentheses. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, and ***p<0.01.
