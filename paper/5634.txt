       We show that modifying       the standard neoclassical   growth model by assuming that

competition   is imperfect makes it easier to explain the size of the declines in output and real

wages that follow increases in the price of oil. Plausibly parametrized    models of this type are

able to mimic the response of output and real wages in the United States.       The responses are

particularly consistent with a model of implicit collusion where markups depend positively on

the ratio of the expected present value of future profits to the current level of output.

   Many authors           have observed      that changes in the prim of oil on world markets appear

to have a significant         effect on economic     activity.    Rasche and Tatom (1981),           Darby (1982),

Hamilton       (1983,    1995), Burbidge      and Harrison (1984),        Gisser and Goodwin          (1986),     Mork

(1989), Carruth,         Hooker and Oswald (1995), and others argue that oil prim shocks were re-

sponsible for substantial        aggregate fluctuations        in recent decades.    In spite of this voluminous

empirical   hterature       suggesting      that oil prim shocks have an important            effect on emnornic

activity, there is little consensus on the re=n                why this is so.

   It is easily argued that an exogenous             increase in the cost of a factor of production              should

reduce the quantity         of final output     that firms will choose to supply.        What is less obvious         is

that the effect should be significant,          if the factor of production       in question accounts for only

a small part of the total marginal mst of production,                  as is true of energy rests. Ind&d,            we

present below a numerical estimate of the predicted                 effect of an increase in energy pric=           in a

‘calibrated”      onesector     stoch=tic     growth model, and show that while the oil price increase is,

predicted      to mntr=t      output,    the effect is only about a’ fifth the six of the response that we

estimate using U.S. data. A ten percent innovation                 in the price of oil is predicted to contract

private sector output          by about one-half     a percent~ our estimat=         indicate instead that such
                                                    ,,.
                                                                                            ....6,,
an innovation       h= on average been associated           with an output        decline of 2.5 percent, five or”

six quarters after the innovation.

    The observed         effects of oil shocks are even more puzzling            when the effects on real wages

me considered       -     well. In standard     growth models,       the predicted     contraction    of the supply

of output      is greater the less real wages fall in response            to the shock, and is greatest if real

wage actually incre=e           (perhaps     because the product      wage rises relative to the consumption

wage). Thus high real wages play a crucial role in explanations                     like that of Bruno and Sachs

(1985) of the effects of the oil shocks of the 1970’s.                Yet, like Bohi (1989)          and Keane and

Prasad (1991),          we find that oil shocks typically        reduce   real wages.     Our estimates suggest

real wages fall by nearly one percent (again, five or six quarters after the innovation)                        for each

ten percent innovation          in oil prices. This is again nearly five times as large an effect as our

calibrated growth model would predict.              But more to the point, variations in the specification



                                                           2
of labor supply behavior          (a point on which our model is obviously               open to criticism)    that

would improve       the model’s     ability to account       for a sharp output        decline (by predicting       a

greater degrm of ‘real wage resistance”)           would result in even less ability to account            for the

observed      decline in real wag=,     and vice versa.       This sugg=ts      that it is the growth     model’s

simple specification        of output supply that must be rejected,           rather than its model of labor

supply behavior.      ‘

    The alternative        that we explore in this paper mntinues            to =sume      a simple aggregative

model of output supply, but drops the assumption                that firms produce for a perfectly       compet-

itive product     market.     Instead, we consider the effects of several simple models of imperfect

competition      in the product     market, introduced        in our previous       papers (1991,    1992, 1995).

We find that allowing for a modest degree of imperfect                competition      significantly increases the

predicted     effects of an energy price increase on both output and real wages. In particular,                  we

show that a model involving implicit collusion               betw=n     oligopolists    can auount    for declines

in both output      and real wages of the magnitude            that we =timate.

    This study complements          our previous work on the effects of innovations              in military pur-

chases on output          and real wages (1992).    As in that study, we are interested in the effects

of oil price changm          not simply because    they appear        to have been an important         source of

aggregate     fluctuations     in the U.S. in rewnt   decades,        but above all because variations        in oil

prices represent     a particularly     good   example       of an exogenous        shock that can be directly

identified    in the data.     As Hamilton     (1985) h=     argued, there is little reason to believe that

changes in the price of oil represent responses to U.S. economic                 conditions,   and in particular

little reuon     to believe that they should be correlated             with changes in the U.S. production

technology.     Indeed, this h= led authors such as Mmey                 (1991) and Hall (1988, 1990) to use

oil price changes as demand-shock            instruments      for other purposes.        We follow them in this

identifying    assumption.

    We proceed      as follows.    In section 1, we estimate          the responses of private sector output

   lIn particular, we do not believe that simply replacing the neoclassical labor supply curve by an efficiency
wage schedule, aa propoeed by C~ruth, Hooker and Oswald (1995), would significantly improve upon the
predictions of the neoclassical g:owth model.

and real wages to oil price increases.          This section provides         the facts that we then seek to

explain.      Section 2 gives an intuitive discussion      of why the existence of imperfect           mmpetition

accentuat~        the reductions in output    and real wages. Section 3 presents the class of aggrega-

t ive intertemporal       general equilibrium    models        that we analyze numerical       y. We show that

a single specification      allows us to nest = special cases a model with perfectly                   competitive

product       markets (closely related to the model of Kim and Loungani                 (1992)),     a model with

monopolist ically competitive       product     markets, a model with Ucustomer markets~ in the style

of Phelps and Winter (1970),         and a model with implicit collusion             in the style of our (1992)

paper.        Section 4 discusses the calibration    of the models.          Section 5 compares        the numeri-

cal r=ponses        of output   and real wages implied          by our various models         with the estimated

responses       from section 1. Section 6 concludes.



1         The Observed Effects of Energy Price Shocks

In this section we discuss our =timates          of the effects on the U.S. economy           of a shock to world

oil prices.      In the models we discuss below,      the variable that matters for the determination

of output       and real wages is the reai price of energy, rather than the level of nominal energy

prices.       Thus it might seem that we should simply seek to identify the effects of innovations

in the real price of energy. But this method          would not identify a shock that we can plausibly

treat as exogenous        with respect to other shocks to the U.S. economy.

        mat     is more plausibly exogenous      in the period we study is the nominal              prim of energy.

The reasons for this, u explaind             in Hamilton       (1985), have to do with the institutions          that

set oil prices in this period.        As he documents,            the nominal     U.S. price of oil in the pre-

 OPEC         period w-   set to a large degree by the Tex=         Wlroad       Commission     (TRC).     The TRC

 tended       to keep the nominal price constant      (and allowed the quantity          produmd         to fluctuate

 so demand        would be met) unless a large exogenous           disturbance    occurred.    Thus, the nominal

 pria      was changed in 1952 as a result of the Iranian nationalization                   of oil assets, in 1956

 as a r-ult       of the Suez crisis and so on.     The policy of keeping the dollar               price of oil fixed

 betw=n        major realignments (that coincided       with exogenous        disturbanm)       wu maintained        in

    the OPEC era. Indeed, Hamilton              (1985) quotes Kuwait’s oil minister M saying the nominal

    oil prim “should be fromn so that the real price (adjusted for inflation)                ... would fall for two

    or three years”.     As a r=ult     of this policy the two major changes in nominal oil pric=           in this

    era were the 1973 oil embargo           in response to the Arab-lsrmli        war and the 1979 increme in

    response to the Iranian revolution.

       The policy of kmping           the nominal oil price nearly constant        between major realignments

    caused by exogenous         events means that innovations          in the real price of oil can also be due

    to unforecatable      changes in U.S. inflation.       These innovations       in U.S. inflation need not be

    exogenous     with respect to U.S. technology          shocks, taste shocks, and the like. We therefore

    consider the bivariate stoch=tic           process for nominal oil prices and a nominal price index for

    the U. S., and orthogonalize         the two innovations        by assuming    that the shock of interest to

    us may affect both nominal           oil prices and U.S. inflation,      but that the orthogonal     shock has

    no eflect on nominal oil pn”ces within the quarter. Thus, it is the innovation                 in the nominal

    oil price that actually      identifies    the exogenous       shock that we are inter= ted in.      But it is

    only the effect of this shock on the forecasted              path of the mal oil price that matters for the

    predictions    of our theoretical      models about the effects of the shock.

        This identifying     =sumption        is not equally defensible over the entire period for which we

    have data. We believe that it makes sense for both the pre-OPEC                      and the OPEC      periods.

    But sometime       in the early     1980’s,    OPEC    lost its ability to keep the nominal        price of oil

    relatively stable.     It is reasonable       to assume that after this point variations       in the demand

    for oil (and even news about its future demand,                as it is a storable   commodity)   began to be

    reflected    in nominal oil prices immediately.          Indeed, simple examination         of the time series

    for nominal oil prims suggests that these prices are no longer formed in the same way in the

    1980’s.     For instance,   quarters      with nominal oil prims the same as in the previous quarter

    no longer occur.      Furthermore,        the growth rate of nominal        oil prices is much more rapidly

    mean-reverting       in this period than it had bmn previously.

        The question is then when the period of exogenous                  nominal   oil price changes ends and

    that of endogenous       nominal oil price changes begins.          Many observers     agree that OPEC lost

much of its power to raise pric=          in the 1980’s but the exact date of the break in OPEC’s           hold

over the oil market is much more controversial.            We approach      this question by observing       that

the stochastic     process   for nominal oil prices is quite different in the 80’s than in the earlier

period, and supposing           that the proper date at which to truncate         our sample is the date at

which this univariate        promss     changes.   As is standard     in the literature (see Andrews        1993)

we suppose that the most likely date of such a regime change is the point which maximizes

the F-statistic    for a break in regime. We thus consider a regression that explains the current

quarterly     percentage     change     in the nominal    price of oil with a constant        and two lags of

the dependent       variable.     We use the producer      price index for crude petroleum         products    as

our nominal       price of oil and our dependent         variable    runs from the fourth quarter of 1947

until the swond      quarter of 1989. The maximal F-statistic             for a break equals 5.92 and arises

when the first part of the sample includes only data until the third quarter of 1980. 2 The

likelihood    ratio for a sample break at the beginning             of the OPEC        regime is much smaller.

The likelihood      that the break occurred          in 1986 when the Saudis retaliated           against    prim

chiseling by severely        lowering    their price is larger but still lower than the likelihood            that

it occurred     in 1980:3.      We thus use this u our break point and only consider               the effect of

nominal oil price changes before this date.

    Analysis of the time series for nominal oil prices and the U.S. price level indicates                     that

both series are stationary         only in first differences.   However their ratio, the real prim of oil,

appears to be stationary           SG that the series are cointegrated.        We thus estimate       a bivariate

vector autoregression        for the two stationary      series, the growth rate of nominal oil prices and

 the logarithm of the real price of oil. The first of our two equations                mak~ the current change

in the logarithm       of the dollar price of oil (~E~) a function         of a constant,    a time trend, and

 lags of this change       = well = lags of the logarithm           of the real price of oil (p~t), defined as

 the price of oil deflated        by the U.S. private value added          deflator.     The second   makes the

 3 degr=   of freedom and is thus significant at a critical level of less than 1 per thousaud (the critical tiue
 at the 1% level is 3.9). This critical level understates the size of the test because we have chosen the point
 where the F-statistic is mbmd.      Indeed, the value of this statistic is below the 10% critical value tabul~d
 in Andrews (1993).

variable    as well w current.    and   lagged     values    of ~E:.      The current value of ~E~ is included

so that the two innovations        are orthogonal       by construction.          We truncated    the lags in both

equations    when the next lag had a t-statistic below one. The estimated coefficients                       for these

two equations        are given in the first two columns of Table 1.

   Treating     the innovations     in the first of these variables            as our exogenous     shock,     we can

combine     these equations    to obtain the impulse response of the real price of oil. This impulse

response is plotted in Figure la together with confidence                  intervals of plus and minus two times

the standard     error. 3 The U.S. general price level responds very little to contemporanmus

incre==      in the nominal price of oil so that the increase in the real price of oil is almost as

large as the innovation       in the nominal oil price (.98 percent for each one percent innovation

in the growth rate of nominal oil prices).           The real price of oil continues to rise after this point

because the nominal price of oil tends to rise further.                  The peak real oil price occurs after 5-7

quarters    (about     1.6 percent higher for each one percent initial innovation                in the nominal oil

prim).     Then, M the higher real price of oil leads the general price level to increase by more

than average and leads nominal oil pric~               to grow by less than average, the real price of oil

returns gradually       to its unconditional      expected      value.

    We also analyze        the effects of this type of shock on output                 and the real wage.           We

measure the first by the real value added produced                  by the private sector which we compute

by subtr~ting        government   value added from total GNP. Our private value added deflator is

then the ratio of nominal to real private value added.                   Our real wage is computed     by dividing

hourly earnings in manufacturing           by the private value added deflator.             We focus on private

value added rather than total GNP because our theories of pricing and production                             decisions

(whether     competitive     or imperfmtly        competitive)      do not apply to the government.              4 We

run separate     regressions explaining          the logarithm      of each of these two variables           with two

lags of the dependent         variable, a time trend, the current value as well = lags of ~E~, and

   3The stmdard errors are calculated using the procedure of Poterba, Rotemberg and Summers                   (1986).
   4We would prefer to eliminate the U.S. oil industry as well, but we lack these data.

lags of the logarithm      of pE:.    5 The results using data from 1948:2 to 1980:3 are given in

the second two mlumns          of Table 1. Once again, we truncated          the lags so that the final lag

has a t-statistic greater than one.        Combining      the regressions in the first two columns with

these latter regr-sions      we obtain     the impulse responses for the output          and the real wage.

These are displayed in Figures 1 b and lc, again with confidenm                 bands of plus or minus two

standard errors.

    Figure lb displays the response           of real private value added.      One observes      that private

output   does indeed      decline    following    a positive   innovation   in oil prices.     A one percent

increase in oil prims results in a reduction          in output of about -.25 percent after 5-7 quarters.

6 One interesting feature of this decline is that output is lower in the second year following

the innovation    than in the first (which is also when real oil prices reach their peak).             Indeed,

the decline is statistically    significant      only from quarter 3 onward.      7

    Figure lC shows the effect on the real wage. This too declines following                 an increase in oil

prims.   Once again, the maximum            decline occurs only in the second year (when it is nearly

-.10 percent for each one percent          increase in oil prices), although     in this case the decline is

statistically   significant even during the first year. 8

    As noted in the introduction,             the simultaneous    observation    of sharp declines in both

output   and real wages is hard to explain within the context               of an aggregative     competitive

model.    To clarify this, we first discuss a stripped-down             model    based on Gordon        (1984).

Then we turn to a more elaborate            set of models and compare        their quantitative    predictions

    ‘An alternative ia to analyze the effect of changes in the nominal price of oil in a VAR consisting of
changes in the nominal oil price, the real price of oil, output and the real wage. We considered such a VAR
as well and obtained results that are essentially identical to those in the text. We report results based on
the regr-ions     because the fact that they contain fewer nuisance parameters mak= the estimata        and their
standard errora easier to interpret and, perhaps, more reliable.
    ‘In regressions that are not reported we also analyzed the response of hours worked in the private sector
and of the unemployment      rate. Oil price increases lead hours to fall and unemployment     to rise aa can be
expected from the fall in output. The increase in unemployment,       as usual, lags behind the falls in output.
    ‘Carruth Hooker, and Oswald (1995) similarly find that the effects of an oil price shock on unemployment
are greateat after 7-8 quarters.
    ‘Because this is the empirical finding of greatest significance for our analysis, we checked its robustn=
in several ways. We reran the regr~ions       dropping the 1974 observations and we also considered separate
regression for the pre- and post-1974 subsamples.     All of these regressions reproduced the negative effect of
nominal oil prices on the real wage though the standard errors were larger because IMS data were included.

2       Oil Price Shocks and Labor Demand:                                            The Role of
        Imperfect Competition

For purposes of this illustration,       we first consider the extremely    simplified production        struc-

ture of Gordon   (1984)    which abstracts       from capital and materials      inputs.     We consider an

emnomy    with many symmetric            firms and a fixed supply      of capital.    Emh of these firms

combines labor and energy to produce           output using the following       production    function


                                             K = Q(v(~t),~t)                                                (1)


where Ht, Et and Yt represent each firm’s labor input, energy input and output respectively.

We assume that both        the V and the Q functions           are increasing    in their arguments.        We

introduce the V function      because we wish to view V w value added, which is produced                  with

labor and capital.     The introduction       of the V function    also allows us to assume that Q is

homogenmus     of degrm one in its two arguments, while diminishing              returns (due to the fixity

of capital) are represented    solely by the strict concavity      of V.

    Choice of the inputs E and H so as to minimize costs of production               in each period implies

that, at each time t, there exists a value pl such that


                                           Q~(v(~~),
                                                  ~~)= PtpEt                                                (2)


                                     Qv(V(~t),     ~~)v~(~t)    = ptwt                                      (3)

where pE~ and wt denote        the prices of energy and labor inputs respectively,             each deflated

by the price of the output       good.     The quantity   pt represents     the inverse of the Lagrange

multiplier ~sociated      with the requirement      that the firm produce       a given level of output.      It

also denotes the ratio of the price of the output          good to its marginal        cost of production.

Thus,   in the case of perfect    competition,      these conditions     must hold in equilibrium         with

pt = 1 at all times. Followi~g       Gordon    (1984), we hold hours worked constant           and we study

the extent to which output       and real wages decline when p~f ris=.

where     SE   denotes the share of energy costs in the value of total output, pEE/Q,                          CEV denotes

the elasticity     of substitution    between energy inputs and value added V, and A denotes                              the

logarithmic      derivative   (i.e., AX      is the derivative            of log X).   These equations      imply that


                                               AWl = –              ‘E       APEt,

    As Gordon        (1984)   argues, the elasticity            of substitution         of energy for value added,       ~Ev,

must be less than one. Otherwise, the model would be inconsistent                              with the rise in the share

of energy as a fraction       of total costs that follows increases in energy prices. The percentage

declin~    in both output and the real wage deflated by the price of output must thus be smaller

than the ratio of energy costs to value added                        (SE/l    – sE ) times the percentage       increase in

energy prices.      In the U. S., the ratio of energy                    costs to value added is about        0.04, so that

the decline in both quantiti~             must be quite small.                 9 While it is possible to obtain      larger

declines in output       if employment         falls, such reductions                in employment   would require that

the real wage fall by even l~s than is indicated                         by the above calculation.     Thus one cannot

obtain substantial       declines in both output             and real wages.

    In f~t,     such real wage declines u it k possible                      to obtain in this model occur only when

one deflates by the price of gross output rather than a value-added                             deflator.    It is useful to

define the value-added        price deflator

                                                  ‘v’    =       K(H,)          .

In the case where the Q function            takes the Leontieff form, this corresponds                     to the standard

GDP deflator.       For other production         functions    the two do not coincide, but pvt is an “ideal”

(Divisia)   valu~added        deflator.   In the case of perfect           competition,      (2)-(4)    can be combined

to yield

                                                   v~(H,)= ~                                                               (5)
                                                                    pvt
Thus, in terms of the valu~added-deflated                real wage, we obtain a labor demand curve that

is invariant with respect to changes in the prim of energy. This means that the competitive

model can account          for a fall in output        and employment              onfy if the real wage in terms of

value added rises. 10

    This labor demand curve provides a useful point of view from which to see why allowanm

for imperfect     competition      matters. When pt differs from 1, equations                    (2)-(4)    yield instead


                                                                                                                           (6)


where $Et is the time t energy share, pEt~t/Qt.                   Equation      (6) gives two reasons for the value

added-deflated      real wage associated with a given level of employment                      to decline when energy

prices rise. The first is that this real wage would fall if the increase in energy prices led to

an increase in the markup pl.             The semnd       is that, even with a fixed markup,                      the term in

square brwkets        will rise as long as the energy share sEt rises and the markup exceeds one.

In particular,     holding the rriarkup and employment                    constant,   we obtain

                                                             -(p     - 1)
                                     A(wt/pvt)     =                                                                       (7)
                                                       (1 - sE)(l         - ~sE)AsE’

As long as the elasticity of substitution          ~Ev <1,         the share of energy sE~ rises with an increwe

in the price of energy, so that the real wage declines.                        Moreover,     the required         percentage

decline is bigger, the larger is the markup.

    The intuition         for this result is clearest        in the case where there is a fixed amount                      of

energy needed to produce           each unit of final good.           Suppose that, initially, the production               of

  10Thus an ener~ price incre& is not equivalent to an adverse technology shock, which would shift this
labor demand     curve.   Energy price incre-s    are treated      as equivalent    in the standard    textbook    view.



                                                             11
a product     requires one dollars’ worth of energy and that the price of energy inputs rises by

20 percent.     Perfectly competitive     firms would be willing to keep their employment                 mnstant

with a mnstant nominal wage as long a their output prices rise by 20 cents. Such an increase

in prices would keep the value-added          deflator constant.       Imperfectly    competitive   firms whose

employment       stayed constant     would    raise their price by more because             they mark up their

entire marginal cost.      With    a markup     of 1.5, the 20 wnt incre~e            in their unit costs leads

them to raise their prices by 30 cents.           Thus, the value-added-deflated            wage of these firms

must fall if they are to keep their employment             constant.



3       A Dynamic General Equilibrium Simulation Model

We now consider       a more general production           function     and construct     a general equilibrium

model that, except      for considering      imperfect    competition,      is similar to those analymd          by

Kim and Loungani        (1992) and Finn (1991),          =pecially     the former.     In particular,     we follow

the real business cycle literature       in ~suming       that mnsumption         and labor supply decisions

are made by a representative         household.

     We consider an economy        with many symmetric firms. Each firm has a production                   function

of the general form

                                             K = Q(W, G(E,, M,))                                                 (8)

where ~,      Et and M~ repr=ent        each firm’s gross output,        energy      input and materials input

respectively,    and Vt is an index of primary inputs (capital and labor) that represents an ideal

index of value added.      Both aggregator        functions     Q and G are assumed to be homogenmus

degree one, incre~ing      in their arguments,      and concave.       This specification    generalizes that of

Bruno and Sachs (1985) to allow for materials costs. The separate inclusion of materials has

an important      quantitative     effect on our results when markets are imperfectly                   competitive

because of the ‘double      marginalization”       distortion    that arises when intermediate           inputs are

not priced at marginal cost. 11

   The value-added     index is ~sumed          to be given by




Here Kt repr~ents      capital inputs, Ht represents hours, Zt is an index of labor augmenting

technical progress, and @t represents fixed costs of production.                Both Zt and Ot are exogenous

parameters from the point of view of the firm. We assume a deterministic                          time trend in Zt

in order to acmunt      for the observed        trend growth in per capita            U.S. output.      In each of

our imperfectly    competitive     models,     we assume a positive        value for @c, so that the model

reproduces   the apparent     absence      of significant       pure profits    in U.S. industry       despite    the

presenm of market power.         A time trend is allowed for the fixed costs as well, so that we can

have a steady state equilibrium          growth path in which the share of fixed costs in total costs

is constant over time.

   Choice of the inputs E, M, and H so M to minimize costs of production                            in each period

(given the capital stock and the quantity produced)                then implies that, at each time t, there

exists a markup pi such that

                              ztQv(Vf,     G(Et, Mt))F~(Kt,         ztHt) = ptwt                                 (12)


where pEt, pM~, and Wt denote the prices of energy, materials and labor inputs respectively,

emh deflated by the price of the output good.                In our symmetric      equilibrium,    we set the prim

PMt equal to one at all times because            each firm’s materials         are the output       goods of other

firms.

    The economy      also contains       a large number of identical           infinite-lived     households.    The

repr=entative     household   seeks to maximize

where @ denotes          a constant    positive    discount       factor,     Nt denotes       the number    of members

per household         in period t, Ct denotes total consumption                 by the household      in period     t, and

Ht denotes      total hours worked by members of the household                           in period t. By normalizing

the number of households             at one, we can use Nt also to represent the total population,                      Ct

to denote      aggregate     consumption,      and so on.      The trend growth of Nt is another                 source of

long-run growth in our model.            We ~sume,      as usual, that U is a mncave function,                  increasing

in its first argument,       and decre=ing        in its semnd argument.

the materials      used in each firm’s production             come out of other firms’ production:                 a single

produced       good    is both an intermediate         good       (materials)      and a final good         (consumption,

inv=tment,       and government        purch~es).      13

  13T0 be more precise, we assume that there are many differentiated  goods (and services), but comider
only a symmetric equilibrium in which each is produced in the same quantity and sold for the same price.
In such a setup there is no problem in assuming that firms must purch~e other firms’ products to use in



                                                             14
    Equations      (14) and (15) assume that there arenor=ource                             costs associated         with energy

production.       No hours or final output must be devoted                      to the energy sector. Thus, equation

(15) ~sumes        implicitly     that energy is freely available at no cost to the oligopolistic                             firms

that sell it; the exogenous                variations       in pE~ represent        variations    in the degree          to which

they succeed in colluding           to keep the price of energy high (here taken M given rather than

modeled),       The rents earned by the producers                    of energy are distributed          to the shareholders

of their firms, which is to say to the representative                      household.       14

    Finally, voluntary accumulation                 of physical capital (or claims to it ) by households                  requires

that

                                                                    Pt+l

at all dates.

    To complete          the model, we need only discuss the determination                          of the markup          pt that

appears      in equations     (10)-(12).          ln the    case   of perfect     competition,      pt =      1 at all   times.      If

firms   have    market    power   in their        product     markets,     ~i can exceed one. The three imperfectly

competitive      theories of the markup that we consider are presented at more length in Rotem-

berg and Woodford           (1991, 1995). The first, which is based on monopolistic                            competition        and

on the asumption            of homothetic           t~tes     over bundl=         of differentiated         goods,   r-ults       in a

constant       markup p greater than one. This markup depends upon the elasticity                                    of substitu-

tion among the differentiated               goods and the homothetiticity                of preferenc=        implies that this

elasticity     is always the same in a symmetric                   equilibrium.

    We also show in titemberg                 and Woodford          (1991 ) that two quite different types of models

with varying markups imply that dmired markups depend only on the ratio of Xt to Yt where

Xt is the present discounted                value of profits gross of fixed costs.               Thus both models imply

their own production, even though these intermediate goods are sold for a price higher than their marginal
production cat.
   14This specification haa the benefit of great simplicity even if it is not M realistic as one would wish. We
obtained essentially identical results when we followed Kim and Loungani (1992) and replaced (15) by an
equation that made Y1 - Mt - p~tEi equal to N, C(w~, ~t ) + [Ki+l - (1 – 6) K,] + G,. In this alternative
specification,  one deducts the ccet of energy from Y( – Ml before one obtains the output available for
consumption,    investment or government purchas~,




                                                                   15
                                                                                                             (17)

where

                                                                                                             (18)

The parameter a in (18) measures the rate at which new products                   are created as well as the

probability    that any mllusive      agrmment      or stock of loyal customers       will survive until the

next period.     Its role is discussed     at length in Rotemberg     and Woodford         (1992).

    According     to the customer     market model of Phelps and Winter            (1970),    the function   p is

decreasing in its argument        The reason is that firms in the customer         market model set prices

by trading off the benefit from exploiting          existing customers    (whose elasticity          of demand is

very low) with the benefit from expanding            their customer base by attracting          new customers

(whose elasticity of demand         is higher).   Expanding     the customer     base is attractive      because

these customers will, at a later date, have low elasticities of demand.             Thought      of in this way,

it is apparent that such firms will set high prices when demand by current customers is high

relative to the demand       that can be expected         by future customers.      Also, prices will be low

if the profits from future sales are more valuable because interest rates are low. Thus, high

values of X/Y      which repr~nt         either high sales in the future, low interest rates or low sales

today, lead to low markups.

    By contrwt,     the function     p is increasing in its argument in the implicit collusion model

of Rotemberg      and Saloner (1986)       and Rotemberg       and Woodford      (1992).     In this model, the

markup is set at the highest level consistent          with having no firm deviate from the collusive

understanding.      The deviations        are prevented     by the threat that they will be followed           by

periods of very low profitability         (price wars). The most effective of these punishments              (and

also the simplest to analyze)       is such that, starting the period after the deviation,            the present

discounted     value of profits    is mro.     This means that a deviating          firm gives up Xt.         On

the other hand, deviations         are more attractive      in the present period     when sales are higher

(because   a deviating firm captura         more sales from its competitors)       and when the markup is

higher (because     this means that there are more profits to obtain           by undercutting          the going


                                                       16
price slightly).    Thus, high values of Xt/ Yt imply that the firms can afford to have higher

values of pt and still avoid deviations.

     To summarize,         four thmries     of markup determination          can be subsumed         by (17).    The

first two theori~     simply assume that p(X/            Y) is a constant function.      A rational expectations

equilibrium     is then a set of stochastic      processes for the endogenous           variabl~   {Y~, Vt, Kt, Ht,

Et, ~t,      Wt, pt, Xt,    At} that satisfy (8)-(12)       and (14)-(18),      given the exogenous      processes

{pEt, Gt, Zt, Nt, @t}.


4       Calibration of Model Parameter Values

In the next section we report             the predicted     responses of output         and real wages to small

changes in pE~, in both the competitive              and imperfectly       competitive     versions of the model

just described.      We analyze      the response to shocks by log-linearizing              the equilibrium      con-

ditions derived in the previous           section,   as in Rotemberg       and Woodford        (1992, 1995),     The

coefficients of the log-linearized         equilibrium     conditions   involve various parameters,        many of

which are standard from real business cycle models, but others of which arise only because

of our explicit treatment        of energy and materials, or because of our allowance for imperfect

competition      and incre~ing      returns. We ‘calibrate~        these parameter        values to be consistent

with various measured          features    of the U.S. economy,          Finally,    the simulations    depend    on

specifying     thmretical    constructs     that correspond      to our empirical        me~ures    of output    and

the real wage. We deal with thee             issues in turn.

     We ensure that the equilibrium           involves stationary       fluctuations    in suitably resealed state

variables, despite trend growth of population               and productivity,       by making certain additional

homogeneity       assumptions.     First, we assume that the representative              household’s   preferences

imply that there exists a u >0            such that H(w, A) is homogeneous             of degree zero in (w, J%),

and that C(w, ~) is homogeneous               of degree one in (w, A%).             15 Second,     we assume that

the exogenous      forcing    variables    {Gt/z~N~ }, {@t/ztN~ } {Nt+l /Nt }, {zt+l/z~ } and {pE~} are

each stationary,      even tbough         { Zt} and {Nt } are only difference-stationary.              Given these

    15Thefamily of utility functions u with this property is discussed in King, Plosser and Wbelo (1988).


                                                           17
~sumptions,        our equilibrium        conditions     can all be written,        in a time-invariant         form,    in

terms of suitably          detrended     endogenous      variables,     such =    it   ~    ~,     and thus admit         a

stationary      solution   in terms of the detrended         variables.

    The economy’s          steady state growth path is a set of constant                   values for the detrended

variables (~t, etc.)        that satisfy the transformed            equilibrium    conditions      in all periods.      We

do not need to solve the equations             for these steady state values, as we are not interested in

explaining      them in terms of more fundamental                determinants,      and indmd we do not bother

to specify the global properties of the utility and production                    functions,     that determine      these

steady state values.          Our conmrn       is rather with the model’s           predictions     regarding      the m-

movements        of the percentage       deviations     of the detrended      variables from their steady state

growth path; we intend to compare these predictions                    with the observed percentage deviations

of the corresponding         variables from their trend growth paths, as reported                    in section    1. The

numerical value        =sumed      for the mefficients      of the linearized equilibrium conditions              (written

in terms of percentage         deviations    of the various detrended         state variables from their steady-

state values) are crucial for this.           These mefficients         are all functions        of various shares and

elasticities,    evaluated    at the steady-state       values of the detrended         state variables.

    The coefficients        of the log-linearized      conditions     are all functions of the model parameters

listed in Table 2. We first discuss the parameters                    relating to the production        function.       The

only properties       of the function       G that matter for the log-linearized               equilibrium   conditions

are the steady-state         value oi sE/sM,    where SE and SM denote the respective shares of energy

and materials       in the value of gross output,          and CEM, the elasticity of substitution                between

energy and materials           inputs,   also evaluated      at the steady-state       factor mix.       Similarly,     the

only relevant properties         of the functions F and Q are summarized                   by the steady-state       values

of four more parameters:           the ratio of labor rests to capital costs, the ratio of intermediate

input rests to the cost of value added, and the two elasticities of substitution                         CKH and EVG.

    The log-linearization         of the transformed        (9) involves coefficients          that depend   also upon

the steady state value of @/V,              the ratio of fixed costs to value added.                Hence this ratio is

another    parameter        that rn~st be given a numerical             value; it indicates       the degree to which



                                                            18
there are increasing returns in the production          of value added.   As in Rotemberg        and Woodford

(1992),     which we follow in the calibration       of several parameters,       we assume that this ratio

takes the value required for zero pure profits in the steady state. 16 We thus ~sume                         that

                                            *          P –1
                                                                                                               (19)
                                            v=l–p(s~+s~)

where p denote       the ratio of price to marginal cost in steady state. As a result, the ratio @/V

is not listed among the parameters           that must be fixed independently         in Table 2. Equation

(19) also implies that the steady-state         shares of the various factor costs in the value of gross

product     are equal to their share       in total costs.    Thus the share ratios just referred to are

all derivable    from the shares 3H, SK, sE, and sM listed in Table 2, and the latter quantities

reprment only three independent           parameters,    as they must sum to 1.

    We assign numerical           values to the six independent      production     function     parameters         as

follows.    In the U. S., the value of oil inputs is at most 4 percent of total value added.                  Value

added in the mining of oil amounts to 1.870 of GDP on average. Imports of crude petroleum,

mineral fuels,     and lubricants      are another   1.670 on average.     Thus the value of oil inputs

is about     3.4% of total value added.         Even if one counts other energy          inputs      that might

be thought      to be close substitutes     for oil (so that their prices increase to a similar extent,

relative to other goods,         when oil prices increase),    the figure does not become          much larger;

for example,     mining of coal amounts to only 0.4% of GDP. Hence sE/(l                 – 9E – 9M) should

equal approximately       .04.

    Next, we asume       that materials constitute       50% of costs. This is less than the 60% share

indicated    by the Berndt and Wood          (1979) data for the U.S. manufacturing            sector.     We have

used a slightly lower number on the grounds              that many service sector industries appear                 to

have lower materialg requirements.           Thus we set sM equal to 0.5 and SE equal to 0.02.                      It

follows that materials     and energy, together,        account   for 52% of costs.    We then obtain           the

labor and capital     shares by assuming,        M in Rotemberg       and Woodford       (1992),         that labor

   16Thia is presumably ensured by entry decisions over the long run, not explicitly modeled on the assumption
that they are of little importance for short-run dynamics. Note that it requires that fixed costs grow at the
same trend rate as output, pr~umdly        thmu~   an incre~    in the number of firma at a constant scale of
operation. See Wternberg and Woodford (1995) for further discussion.

accounts for 7570 of value added.         Thus sH and SK are set equal to 0.36 and 0.12 respectively



    We follow the real business cycle literature in ~suming                that the elasticity of substitution

tKH between capital and labor in the production                  of value added      equals 1. The other two

elasticities of substitution     are less often considered.          We consider         two different     values for

each. One possibilityy is to ~sume          very lit tIe opportunity      for substitution      away from either

materials or energy inputs (which we represent by making both elasticities equal .0001). This

is suggested by the estimates of Berndt and Wood (1979).                  On the other hand, other studi=,

such as Pindyck      and Rote.mberg        (1983),   suggest some degree           of substitutability.       We do

not attempt to use their parameter           values, as their production          function    specification    is not

consistent with the one we ~sume            here. Instead, we have direct 1y estimated              the elasticities

of substitution     Cvc and CEM under assumptions                consistent    with our model        specification,

using data for 20 two-digit          U.S. manuf=turing        sectors.   This estimation       is described    in the

Appendix.     Based on these estimates,        our values for the two elasticities           are eEM = 0.18 and

tvc = .69.

    As shown in Rotemberg            and Woodford     (1992),     the homogeneity         assumptions      described

above imply that all the aspects of preferenus               that matter for our analysis can be d=cribed

by the two parameters CHWand the u. The former is a me~ure                      of the response of labor supply

to a temporary      real wage change,       that is sometimes       called the ‘intertemporal            elasticity of

labor supply”     in the labor literature      (e.g., Card, 1994).        The latter parameter           (introdumd

above in our statement         of our homogeneity        assumptions)         corresponds     to the elwticity      of

consumption       growth    with respect    to chang~        in the real rate of return,         holding    constant

hours worked in both periods.           We assume an intertemporal            elasticity of labor supply of 1.3,

and a o of 2. Th-e         values follow Wtemberg        and Woodford          (1992),   except that a has b=n

reduced from 3 to 2, for closer conformity           with the type of preferences            assumed in the real

business cycle literature.      17

   Other parameters        that enter the linearized          equilibrium     conditions    include the steady-

state shares of consumption,       investment,       and government     purchases      in private value added,

the steady-state    growth     rate of real output,        the steady-state     real rate of return, and the

rate of depreciation      of the capital    stock.      All of these quantiti=       have direct correlates in

the national income acmunts,         and so we calibrate them by assuming                  that the steady-state

values coincide with average values for the U.S. over the post war period.                     Similarly, we use

employment    data to calibrate      the steady-state         share of hours hired (or mnscripted        by) the

government.   The valu~       used here again follow Rotemberg          and Woodford          (1992), where they

are discussed in more detail.

   Finally, we must specify three parameters relating to the equilibrium                   behavior of markups.

The first is the steady-state      value of the markup itself, p. The value that we use for all of

our imperfectly    competitive    models is p = 1.2. This implies that for the typical firm, price is

20% higher than marginal cost, while fixed costs account for one sixth of its total costs. As

discussed in htemberg        and Woodford        (1995), this is well within the range of values for both

market power and increming         returns indicated by a number of studies of U.S. industry. The

second is the el~ticity      of the function    p(X/    Y), evaluated at the steady-state         value of X/Y.

This parameter is the one that distinguishes              our several imperfectly      competitive    models.   In

the static monopolistic       competition      model,    u in the competitive        model,    Cu is zero, as the

markup is constant.       For the customer      market model we let eP equal -1 while we assume that

it equals .15 for the implicit      collusion    model.       (We must assume a positive         value less than

.2 in the latter case, for theoretical       consistency,      as explained    in Rotemberg      and Woodford,

1992.)   The third parameter        that must be calibrated          is the a appearing        in equation   (18).

(Note that this parameter matters only in the case of the two variablemarkup                      models.)   Here

we follow Rotemberg        and Woodford        (1992) in setting a = .9.

    When we present our simulations,            we report the response of real private value added and

of a real wage to energy price shocks.          These simulated response           are intended to correspond

to the responses of the time series that are measured by the U.S. Department                       of Commerce.

Thus, we do not report the simulated responses of the ideal value added index u, or of the real



                                                         21
wage Wt (deflated      by the price of output),     nor of the wage deflated       by the ideal     value-added

deflator,     The available     Commerce     Department       series differ from these constructs        because

there exists a domestic         energy sator.      Lack of disaggregated         data at quarterly      intervals

prevents us from removing          this sector from our measures of private value added and of the

value-added      deflator.   We thus report the theoretical       responses of variables which, like those

mwured        by the Commerce       Department,     include a domestic      energy sector.

     We suppose      that nominal value added is


                                          ~ – pEtEt – ~t + pEtE~


where E: represents          domestic   energy production.       Even though     we assume that all inmme

is received    by a single representative       household,     we are free to assume that for accounting

purposes,     not all of the ell,ergy inputs used are treated            as part of domestic      output.    Real

value added is instead

                                          ~ – pE~Et – ~t + PEOE~

where time O is the base period for the GDP                  accounts.   We furthermore      assume that the

fraction of energy inputs that are counted as dome tic production                  is a constant,    i.e., that


                                                  E: = sDEt                                                   (20)


for some fraction       O < sD < 1. This equation         is somewhat      arbitrary   (since we do not here

model the production          or pricing decisions of energy producers       explicitly).   In the simulations

reported,     we Set sD = .5, as this represents the approximate             share of U.S. oil usage that is

domestically     produwd.       Note that the specification      (20) probably    overstates the negative ef-

fects on U.S. energy production          of a reduction in U.S. energy demand due to a price increase.

Thus our results probably         exaggerate    the extent to which the models (both competitive                  and

imperfectly     competitive)      predict a reduction     of U.S. private value added following             such a

shock.

     The Corr-pending          private value added deflator is defined by dividing the above nominal

value added measure by the real measure.             Hence the real wage plotted in the figures is not

5          Results of Simulations

Figures 2a and 2b display the theoretical                 responses of output and the real wage respectively,

under the parameter              values just discussed.       1s As with all the results we will present,                the

response        is ca.lculatd     for ten quarters following         a unit innovation      in i~t.      The predictions

of four theoretical            models   are compared:       the competitive       model,    the static monopolistic

competition           model,    the customer    market model, and the implicit collusion model.                   In these

figur-      we also reproduce           the ~timated       impulse    responses    (with confidence         bands)     from

Figures lb and lC for purposa                of comparison.

      In Figure 2a, we show the predicted                response of private value added.          For our parameter

values,        the competitive       model     does predict    a contraction      of output     following      a positive

innovation        in oil prims. However, this contraction            is much smaller than is indicated           in Figure

lb.    Output         never falls by more than .06 percent in response to a one percent innovation                            in

oil prices, which is only on~fourth               of the effect that we estimate for quarters 5-7 following

the innovation.          Consistent     with our heuristic discussion of section 2, the predicted                response

for the competitive            model lies above the +2s.e.         boundary   of the confidence       band in quarters

4 through        9.

      The competitive           version of our model        also fails to predict      that the decline         in output

should be significantly            greater in the second year than in the quarters immediately                       follow-

ing the impact.           This means that the erosion of the capital stock following                     an ener~      price

increase do=           not substantially     increme the predicted       output decline.      Hence, to a useful ap-

proximation,          the predicted effect of an oil shock in the competitive              model can be determined

in a framework            where the capital stock is treated           w given (as in our informal             discussion

in section 2). It also suggests that our oversimplified                  treatment     of investment        demand,      ab-

    lswe   ~      considered    Simulation   where we varied the ~umed        values of the elwticiti-      of substitution
~E~ and ~vc.          These variatiom   had only a sma~ effect on our results.



                                                              23
stracting from adjustment        costs of any kind, is probably      innocuous,     at le~t    for our analysis

of the competitive     model.

   Imperfectly     competitive    models are able to account for a more severe contraction.             Simply

=suming       a constant markup of 1.2 results in a predicted          output    decline of -.13 by quarters

5-8, which is twice as large m the one we obtain when p = 1. The implicit                      collusion model

with p = 1.2 and EU= .15 predicts              an even larger decline,    more than -.20 from quarter 5

onward.   The allowance for endogenous            markup variation thus makes the maximum                output

contraction     5070 larger wit bout any change in the assumed steady-state             markup, and makes

it comparable     to the estimated    decline.

   The model with implicit         collusion     implies larger output    declines because       it predicts an

incre~e   in markups.       Markups    rise for two reasons.        First, the incre=ed        price of energy

inputs lowers the return tc capital.           In the event of a permanent        incre~e     in energy pric-,

the equilibrium      capital sto”:k would eventually        fall u a result, but in the transition      period,

real interat     rates would     be lower than normal.         As a result,     the present    value of future

profits increases.     This raises X,/~        and, as a result, markups        are higher until the capital

stock adjusts and the real rate returns to its steady-state            value.

    Second,     as is clear from the estimates in Table 1 and as is shown in Figure la, a shock

to energy prims is generally       followed    by further increases in nominal       and real energy prices.

Starting around six quarters after the shock, real energy prices are expected                  to decline back

to their usual value. Thee       expected     declines further increase Xt/ Yt at that time. The re~on

is that they imply that sales at that point are low and production                 costs are high relative to

the values thee      variables are expected      to have in the future. This means that the temptation

to undercut     the implicitly   collusive agreement at the risk of a future breakdown              in collusion

is unusually low, and the degree of collusion that can be sustained                is accordingly     unusually

high. Thus this model correctly         predicts that the main contraction          of output     should occur

only in the semnd year following            the innovation,    since it is at this time, when real energy

prims are not only high but are also expected               to decline, that Xt/ Yt is significantly      above




                                                       24
its steady-state    value. 19

       The customer market model,        bycontr~t,      predicts alarger     immediate      contraction   than

does the constant-markup        model,    but less of a contraction      in the second year. This is again

because Xt /Y~ rises in the second year, which in this model impli~                 markup reductions,        as

firms sacrifice current profits     to compete        more vigorously     for their future customer        base.

Thus the assumption        of customer    markets r~ults      in a 1=s successful    prediction,    even com-

pared to the static model        of monopolistic       competition.     Given our parameter        values, the

implicit collusion model is the only one whose predicted path for output is always within the

confidence    band.

       The competitive    version of our model has particular difficulty in explaining           the observed

decline in real wagm following       an oil price increase. In the case of the wage deflated by the

Commerce       Department’s     value-added    deflator (Figure 2b), the competitive           model predicts

a very small real wage decline,          only a fourth of the ~timated         decline in the semnd year.

This decline is entirely due to the dom=tic           production      energy, which raises the value-added

deflator.    As in the previous figure, this model predicts little additional         decline in the semnd

year (the decline by the middle           of the second year is only about          a third larger than the

decline that has occurred       by the second quarter following           the innovation).      The predicted

path of wages is above the +2s.e.          boundary     of the confidenm      band in each of the quarters

4-7.

       We find that a higher p alone, regardless of any markup variation,              helps to explain the

real wage decline.       The static model with a constant markup p = 1.2 implies that the value

added deflated wage eventually        falls by -.06 percent for each percent increase in the price of

oil.    This response is inside, but near the edge of, the two standard              error confidence      band

from the estimated response.        The implicit collusion model predicts an even greater decline.

Indeed, in the case of p = 1.2, CM= .15, the predicted                decline is even slightly greater than

the estimated      response in the second year. Furthermore,             this model again predicts a much

   lgIn fact, the model predicts that markups actually fall in the quarter of the innovation, preventing any
output decline at all. This is because Xt/Yt falls, due to the expectation of even higher energy prices in the
next several quarters, despite the first effect mentioned, which raisea X~/Yt even in the first quarter.

sharper decline in the second year than in the first, so that the predicted path of wages tracks

the estimated     path re~onably        well. The customer        market model, by contrast,          predicts    the

lowest real wage in the quarter of the innovation,              with wages gradually returning          to normal

thereafter.     Thus    the implicit    mllusion    model     again best matches       the estimated       reponse,

although the predictions       of all three imperfectly       competitive    models are within the confidena

band in this c~e.



6      Conclusion

We have shown that imperfectly             competitive       models,     and in particular    a model involving

implicit collusion in the product market, can explain the estimated effect of oil price increases

on output and real wages to a much greater extent than can a stochastic                       growth model that

assume     a perfectly    competitive     product    market.     In this conclusion,     we briefly discuss how

our theory relates to other simple aggregative                models which seek to explain for the output

reductions     that followed oil price incre~es.

    It is sometimes       argued that the recessions          following     the oil shocks of the 1970’s were

actually due to the tightening          of monetary    policy     on these occasions,      rather than an effect

of the higher oil prices themselves.         (See, e.g., Darby         (1982),   Bohi (1989 ).) From this point

of view, our development         of a non-monetary          model with imperfect       competition     might seem

to be unnecessary,       and our analysis of the competitive              case with no allowance either for a

feedback      rule for monetary    policy or for nominal          rigidities misleading.      We cannot       engage

at this point in a complete        discussion of models where money has important                  effects.    But it

does seem to us that models where monetary                   policy    matters cannot avoid our conclusions,

at least without       adding considerable     complications.

    Suppose that over our sample period, oil price incre~es                 did lead systematically     to redud

growth of the money supply over subsequent                  quarters.     Suppose furthermore        that one were

to model the real effmts of, changa           in monetary       policy    by postulating     imperfectly      indexed

nominal wage contracts.         In this case the nmclassical            labor supply curve would be repla~d

by a perfectly     elastic labor supply at a real wage that depends upon the nominal price level


                                                         26
for non-energy      output.     In this case, an unexpectedly       low money supply, and consequently

an unexpectedly       low nominal price level, would r-ult           in a contraction     of employment     and

output.     But a condition      like (5) would still apply (in the cwe that firms are perfect             com-

petitors in their product        markets), and this contr~tion        would occur only insofar as the rea,l

wage divided      by the ideal deflator for value added            rose.    Thus it is hard to see how the

hypothesis     of a coincident    monetary tightening        muld explain the sharp decline in real wages

that accompania        the observed contraction      of output.

    If one supposes     that the real effects of monetary         policy are instead due to nominal price

rigidity,   one probably       has to consider   models      in which product      markets are imperfectly

competitive     in the first plain (as in Rotemberg,          1982, and Blanchard       and Kiyotaki,     1987).

This still might seem an alternative to the particular kinds of imperfectly               competitive   models

developed     in this paper.     However, as Blinder (1981)        and Rotemberg        (1983) have observed,

models with sticky prices generally do not imply that oil price increases should have a large

effect on output.     Instead, the price stickiness should buffer the economy from such shocks, by

comparison      with what would happen in the c~e              of flexible prices, sinm markups should be

squeezed at a time of sharply rising nominal marginal costs. Thus such an explanation                     would

require one to argue not simply that the monetary                 contraction   adds to the contractionary

impact of the oil shock, but that the monetary                contraction    is really the whole story, sinw

the oil pri~     increase alone would have had little effect on output              at all.   A large enough

monetary      contraction     could certainly produce     effects upon output and real wages as large as

those we estimate;      but it remains unclear why (given the small effect of the oil price shock

upon costs and hence upon inflationary pressures) such a large monetary contractions                      should

follow oil price increases.

    A leading     alternative    hypothesis,   of course, is that the aggregate effects of energy price

increas~     depend   crucially upon the fact that such shocks affect different sectors differently.

Among this class of explanations,        one must mention the sectoral reallocation           model of Hamil-

ton (1988),     w well as the sticky-price       model    of Ball and Mankiw        (1992).    A quantitative

comparison      of explanations     of this kind with the one offered here must be left for further

    Here we discuss our estimates          of the elasticities of substitution            cEM and tvc,      that are

used in the simulations.       We =timate        th=e elasticities under the assumption            of perfect com-

petition,   because we are especially        concerned      to mrrectly      calibrate    the mmpetitive     model,

the empirical inadequacy       of which we document           in this paper. The same parameter estimates

are then used in all of the simulations,           as we wish to display the consequenms               of variations

solely in our assumptions      about markup determination.                (We note, however, that assumption

of a significant   departure    from perfect       mmpetition          ought to change our estimates         Of EEM

and ~vc as well.)

    The elasticity cEM is defined as the coefficient            in the log-linear        approximation


                                AGEt – AGMi = –(AEt                    – AMt)/cEM


Here AX      denotes   demeaned     first difference     of log X,        for each of the variables.       (Because

our model implies that both         E/M      and G~/G~          are stationary       variables,   such a log-linear

approximation      should be valid in the case of sufficiently small equilibrium                   fluctuations,    for

any smooth      aggregator.     If G is a CES function,            of course,     the log-linear     relationship    is

exact, ) Cost minimization       by firms then impli=          that in equilibrium


                                 ApEt – ApMt = -(AE,               – AM,)/c~M                                      (21)


This follows from equilibrium      conditions       (10) - (11 ) of the text, except that we do not assume

that pM~ = 1 because we analyze sectoral data.

    Our data includ=     separate observations         for materials and services inputs.           To ensure that

the estimation     yields parameters      for our theoretical           model,   we aggregate     these two inputs

into a single “materialsn      category    Divisia aggregation.           Thus

                                          sMEt                            sMSt
                         AMt =                        A~Et     +                     AMst

                        ApMl =                       ApMEt +                         ApMst
                                   sMEt + sMst                         sMEt + sMst

                                                         32
where AMEt and AMSt denote               the growth rates for non-energy            inputs that are materials

and services respectively,    ApMEt and ApMSt are the growth rates for the corraponding                    price

indices and sMEt and sMst are the corresponding                  cost shares.     These aggregates      are then

used together with AEt and ApEt to estimate (21).

    The elasticity ~~c is correspondingly            defined as the coefficient     in


                                   AQGi – AQvt        = -(AGt     - Au)/tvG

    If we assume that all factors are variable and that the firm is a price taker in each factor

market, then cost minimization          again implies


                                    ApGt – Apv~ = –(AGt          – AU)/CVG                                   (22)

where price changes ApEt and Apvt are again constructed                     as Divisia aggregates.     However,

we do not observe a rental prim series for capital.               Moreover,     adjustment     costs for capital

(which,     admittedly   are neglected      in our theoretical     model)     create a wedge between        “rest

of capital”    series constructed    along Jorgensonian         lines and the current marginal product         of

capital.

    An alternative titivating        equation is accordingly      more convenient.        Equation   (22) implies


                              ASGt    – Asvt    = – (AG, - Au)        (1 - :)

where sc~ and s vt are the cost shares of intermediate               inputs and value added respectively.

Furthermore,      under the assumption         of perfect competition,        we can replace the cost shares

set and Svt by the shares of these input costs in the value of total output,                     and still write

Svt =      1 – SC*, so that the above equation        becomes

                                      1

in total cost, (23) is correct only under the =umption  of perfect competition.

   We estimate equations            (21) and (23) using the KLEMS                data for 20 two-digit         U.S. man-

ufacturing     sectors supplied        by BLS Division of Productivity             Research.    We impose common

elasticities on these 20 sectors to obtain relatively                precise estimates that we can use in the

calibration     of our symmetric         model.     We have also examined              independent     sectoral    regres-

sions, and found quali tat ively similar results for most sectors, but with large standard errors

for the coefficient   estimat~.

    We use the cumulative              changa     over two years for the growth            rates appearing        in those

equations.      We construct       th=e     two-year changes        by summing         the annual change          for two

consecutive     years, where the annual changa                are computed         u    indicated    above.     (We have

data for 17 such periods,          from 1950/51       through      1987/88.)     Two-year      growth rates are used

because adjustment         of the factor mix to relative pri~            changes appears not to occur entirely

within a single y-r.            22 Since our simulation           exercise     aims to explore      the effects on the

economy       that occur   during the first two years following                an innovation    in energy prices, we

seek a medium       term elasticity of substitution           rather than one that is valid only for the first

four quarters.     Indeed, our figures show that the largest effects of energy price increase                        occur

in the semnd year after the shock.

    Finally, we allow for the possibility of stochastic                variation in the aggregator            functions   Q

and G, which would add error terms to equations                    (21) and (23).       Hence, we de-trend        (as well

w de-meaning)       all of our growth rates, and we estimate                 (21) and (23) with an instrumental

variable estimator.        The instrument         is the growth      of nominal oil prices over the same two-

year period.     As discussed in the text, we regard this w a largely exogenous                        promss,      and so

   21Even though it is the Divisia version of the standard deflator of “value added”, the second of these
equations, is again valid only under the ~umption      of perfect competition, The reason is, again, that we
USe cost sharea.
   22When we experimented    with one year chang~, we found the results much more sensitive to the normal-
ization of the second stage regression because the instrument is much poorer.

expect   it to be unmrrelated         with stochastic     shocks in the Q and G aggregators,                just as we

expect it to be uncorrelated          with the labor-augmenting              technical shock variable z.

    Regression    coefficients    for regr=sions      of the left and right hand side of (21) and (23) on

the contemporaneous         nominal     oil price   changes      are given     below.

    We observe     that the proposed         instrument        is a statistically       significant predictor   of all of

the changes      that we are interested in, except              AE~ – AM~.          Even if this particular       low t-

statistic indicates   that this is a poor choice of instrument                 (i.e., one not really correlated     with

the shifts we are interested in, and mrrelated with ApEt – ApMt for accidental reasons), then

our use of it can bias our estimate of cEM towards zero.

    The first-stage regressions just reported imply IV estimates of tEM = .177 and cvc = .686.

These are the baseline valu~            used in the paper.            Using the change in the price of oil over

the previous     two-year      period as an additional         instrument       has no material consequenus           on

these results. 23




   ‘In general, the use of several instruments implies that the results depend on the side of the equation
that projected against the instruments in the first stage.        In the c-     of ~EM, the resulting estimate is
0.184 no matter which side of (21) is projected on the instruments.          The estimate of ~vc equals 0.659 if
(1 - .s~i)-lAs~t   is projected on the instrumnti     while it equals 0.670 if AG, - AM is projected. We prefer
the estirnatea with only one instrument because the lagged oil price change doea not result in a significant
coefficient in any of the first-stage regressions, except that for ApEi - ApMl.
