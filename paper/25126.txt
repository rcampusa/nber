Wealth inequality is rising in rich countries. Capital taxation used simply to finance redistribution
may not be able to counteract this trend, but can increased public investment financed by higher
capital taxes? We examine how such a policy affects the distribution of wealth in a setting with
distinct wealth groups: dynastic savers and life-cycle savers. Our main finding is that public
investment financed through capital taxes always decreases wealth inequality when the elasticity
of substitution between capital and labor is moderately high. Indeed, for all elasticities of
substitution greater than a threshold value, at high enough capital tax rates, dynastic savers
disappear in the long run. Below these rates, both types of households co-exist in equilibrium
with life-cycle savers gaining from the higher capital tax rates. These results are robust with
respect to the different roles of public investment in production. We calibrate our model to OECD
economies and find the threshold elasticity to be 0.82.

1    Introduction
Wealth inequality is rising in rich countries (Piketty and Saez, 2014). At the
same time, it is widely recognized that public capital, notably in education
and infrastructure, is underfunded even though it increases efficiency in the
long term (Bom and Ligthart, 2014; Calderón and Servén, 2014). There is
no consensus, however, about how additional public investment should be
financed. One prominent proposal is to tax capital when wealth inequality is
seen as too high, using the proceeds to increase public investment (Diamond
and Saez, 2011; Piketty, 2014; Piketty and Zucman, 2014; Stiglitz, 2012,
2016a).
    In this article, we examine whether taxing capital income and investing
the proceeds into public capital decreases wealth inequality. Our main con-
tribution is to show how the success of this policy depends critically on the
elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. We prove that wealth
inequality decreases in the long term with a moderately high elasticity of
substitution, and we completely characterize how the possible distributional
outcomes depend on the tax rate, forms of public investment, and substi-
tutability.
    Stiglitz (2015b) argues that there is a new set of stylized facts regard-
ing growth and distribution to be explained by macroeconomic modelling.
These stylized facts include an increase in the wealth-income ratio; growing
wealth disparity; a wealth distribution more skewed than the labor income
distribution; and rising top income and wealth shares in nearly all countries
in recent decades (Alvaredo et al., 2017; Novokmet et al., 2017; Wolff, 2017).
Taken together, these stylized facts seem to replace the Kaldor facts that
were integral in the development of the neoclassical growth model. Growing
empirical evidence further suggests that individuals at the top of the wealth
distribution display saving behavior that is markedly different from the re-
mainder of the population: Rich individuals have higher saving rates, which
is consistent with lower time preference rates, obtain a greater share of their
income from capital and, when compared to the rest of society, save more
for posterity rather than for retirement (Attanasio, 1994; Dynan et al., 2004;
Lawrance, 1991; Saez and Zucman, 2016). Models should thus account for
heterogeneous preferences (Krusell and Smith, 1998; Foley and Michl, 1999),
especially with respect to saving behavior (Stiglitz, 2015b, 2016b).
    To address these realities, in a simple framework that allows for inequal-
ity between households even in the long run, we consider how increased
public investment that is financed by capital taxes affects wealth inequality.
We combine the two standard approaches to saving behavior—the dynastic
model and the life-cycle model—in a single framework. This simplification
captures some of the stylized facts by representing the saving behavior of
most citizens as occurring within their “life cycle”, while representing a sec-
ond group of citizens with such high levels of inherited wealth as to make
1       INTRODUCTION                                                                       3


their labor income irrelevant and their saving behavior dynastic. Stiglitz
(2015d) shows this simplification is a limiting case of a model in which
households with highly non-linear savings functions can transition between
(endogenous) wealth groups.1
    Our model distinguishes the two groups by income source, time prefer-
ence rate and saving behavior: “Workers” receive income from labor and
capital and save for life-cycle purposes. “Capitalists”, the top wealth own-
ers, receive only capital income2 and have a dynastic saving motive. This
type of model was originally introduced by Pasinetti (1962) and has been
taken up by Samuelson and Modigliani (1966), Stiglitz (1967, 1969) and
Judd (1985). More recently Baranzini (1991), Klenert et al. (2018), Mat-
tauch et al. (2016), Michl (2009) and Stiglitz (2015b, 2016b, 2018a) have
analyzed related models in which workers also save in a life-cycle fashion,
thus accounting for the importance of retirement savings. In particular,
Mattauch et al. (2016) and Stiglitz (2017) proved that public investment fi-
nanced through capital taxes is Pareto-improving for low tax rates and that
workers prefer higher capital tax rates than capitalists.3
    The present article characterizes all possible distributional outcomes that
can result from financing public investment through (proportional) capital
taxes in an otherwise unregulated closed economy. We prove that, depending
on the value of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor σ, and
on the level of the capital tax τ , three cases can result in the long term. Both
classes can co-exist (“Pasinetti-regime”), but at the margins of the model the
capitalists disappear as their absolute income becomes zero (“Anti-Pasinetti-
regime”) or workers’ savings becomes zero (“Anti-Anti-Pasinetti-regime”).
We thus generalize and unify claims about the distributional outcome of
two-class models with public capital made in Klenert et al. (2018), Mattauch
    1
      The literature analyzing the effect of capital taxation on wealth inequality can be
subdivided into four strands: first, determining the optimal level of capital taxes under
standard weak assumptions about heterogeneity (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1976); second, de-
termining capital tax levels in models with idiosyncratic shocks to productivity or earnings
(Aiyagari, 1994; Bewley, 1977); third, studying the effect of capital taxes when productiv-
ities and endowments are stochastically determined (Champernowne, 1953; Jones, 2015;
Piketty and Saez, 2013); fourth, studying capital tax increases where the distribution itself
is endogenous with varying heterogeneity assumptions and shocks, giving rise to endoge-
nous stochastic processes (Becker, 1980; Bevan, 1979; Bevan and Stiglitz, 1979; Chatterjee
and Turnovsky, 2012; Stiglitz, 1976, 1978a,b). Our contribution is related to the fourth
strand, though here we do not introduce shocks.
    2
      Individuals at the top of the wealth distribution are more likely to be self-employed
entrepreneurs and to receive a higher share of capital income (Wolff, 1998; Diaz-Gimenez
et al., 2011; Wolff and Zacharias, 2013), but see Appendix B.1 for an analysis with “cap-
italists” who also work.
    3
      Klenert et al. (2018) analyze the cases of financing public investment with (linear)
capital-, labor- and consumption taxes in a calibrated numerical framework with endoge-
nous labor supply, also considering the distribution of income and utility explicitly. They
find that, while capital taxes reduce inequality in income, wealth and utility, consumption
and labor taxes do not.

et al. (2016) and Stiglitz (2015c, 2016b, 2018a).
    Specifically, we establish that public investment financed through capital
taxes always decreases wealth inequality for a general production function
as long as the factor share of labor does not approach zero for very high tax
rates. For constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production functions,
the main result is that for any σ there exists a capital tax rate τlim such
that either capitalists disappear or workers’ savings become zero, as long
as steady states exist. In particular, we prove that there exists a threshold
elasticity σ1 such that for any elasticity σ ≥ σ1 , there exists a capital tax rate
τlim at which the economy switches from a Pasinetti to an Anti-Pasinetti
state, so that capitalists disappear. If σ < σ1 there exists a capital tax
rate τlim at which the economy switches from a Pasinetti to an Anti-Anti-
Pasinetti state, so that workers savings (and income), relative to output,
become zero. The Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case results as a two-class steady state
is no longer sustained; the Anti-Pasinetti case is unrelated to steady-state
existence, but due to high savings of workers. The relationship between the
elasticity of substitution and τlim is monotone in all cases. We also establish
by numerical simulations, however, that workers still gain in relative terms
from moderate capital tax rates, even for very low elasticities. The suggested
policy only harms workers for implausible parameter choices.4
    The main intuition behind our results is simple: For high elasticities,
capital taxes increase the share of labor, both directly (from the scarcity
of capital) and indirectly (from the increased productivity resulting from
public investment). So workers, who provide a fixed amount of labor, earn
more and can afford to save more as the value of their labor increases. For
low elasticities, as capital becomes relatively scarce, its share increases. The
division of the population into two distinct groups permits us to represent
these effects in general equilibrium and study the implications for wealth
inequality.
    There has been a recent debate over the value of the elasticity of substi-
tution. For example, Chirinko (2008) show that 26 out of 31 studies find an
elasticity of substitution between capital and labor (significantly) below 1.
By contrast, Piketty and Saez (2014) and Piketty and Zucman (2015) argue
that the elasticity must be higher than 1.5 Our contribution is the first
   4
     The only conditions under which the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti regime arises are those un-
der which capitalist asymptotically disappear. In practice, a government would finance
public capital by other taxes long before this particular case could arise, it is relevant for
understanding the behavior of the economy as a limiting case only.
   5
     In particular, Piketty and Saez (2014) argue that “it makes sense to assume that
σ tends to rise over the development process, as there are more diverse uses and forms
for capital and more possibilities to substitute capital for labor.” (p. 841). But this
argument is not fully persuasive, because advances in technology can result in dominating
technologies, leading to a lower elasticity of substitution (Atkinson and Stiglitz, 1969;
Korinek and Stiglitz, 2017). In any case, the discussion of the aggregate elasticity of
substitution entails delicate issues of capital aggregation (Stiglitz, 2015b), with much of

to analyze systematically how the success of capital taxes financing public
investment in terms of addressing inequality depends on σ. For that pur-
pose we calibrate our model to OECD economies and solve it numerically,
including the top 5 % of the population in the group of dynastic savers. We
find that the threshold elasticity σ1 is approximately 0.82, indicating that
both the Anti-Pasinetti and the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case are conceivable as
limiting cases. The simulation also indicates, however, that workers are still
better off in absolute terms for even lower elasticities as long as capital tax
rates are moderate.
    The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In the next section,
we set out the model. In Section 3, we analyze the steady-state properties
for a general production function and characterize wealth inequality. In Sec-
tion 4, we derive results with a CES production function in which public
capital is labor-enhancing. In Section 5, we consider an alternative specifica-
tion with capital-enhancing public capital. Section 6 presents our numerical
application. Section 7 concludes and outlines how the impact of automation
reinforces the policy implications of our results.


2     Model
We model an economy with a single consumption good in which the gov-
ernment can finance productivity-enhancing public investment by a capital
tax. There are two types of households in the population, “capitalists” and
“workers”. The workers are modeled as representative overlapping genera-
tion agents that live for two periods each. They provide labor in the first
period and save for their own retirement in the second period, but they
leave no bequests to future generations. The capitalists are modeled as a
representative infinitely-lived agent that saves dynastically. Their source of
income are interest payments on their capital holdings and, in some cases,
firms’ profits. Factor markets clear and on the capital market, the supply
consists of both agents’ capital holdings. We examine the distribution of
wealth, but since consumption is linear in wealth in our basic model for
both groups and utility only depends on consumption, results qualitatively
carry over to the distribution of consumption and utility.

Capitalists The capitalist owns a capital stock Ktc and maximizes in-
tertemporal utility given by

                                t=0

the increase in the value of capital associated not with changes in the amount of capital
but in relative prices.

with consumption Ctc and time preference rate ρc . Its budget constraint is
                         c
                        Kt+1 − Ktc = (1 − τ )rt Ktc − Ctc + Πt ,                            (2)

where rt is the before-tax interest rate. A capital income tax τ is imposed
on all capital.6 Firms’ profits Πt may be zero, depending on the production
structure. The initial capital stock
                                    is given  as K0c . The capitalist respects a
transversality condition: limt→∞ Ktc t−1         1

    Solving the maximization problem yields an Euler equation for this
household:                   c
                           Ct+1     1 + (1 − τ )rt+1

                            Ct           1 + ρc

Workers The worker lives for two periods, a “young” (y) and an “old”
(o) stage. It maximizes its lifetime utility, with utility from consumption in
the second period being discounted by the time preference rate ρw :
                                               1
                               ln(Cty ) +              o
                                                   ln(Ct+1 ).                               (4)
                                            1 + ρw
In the first period, the agent sells its fixed labor L to the producing firm,
which in turn pays a wage rate wt . Labor income can either be consumed
or saved for the old age:
                               wt L = St + Cty .                           (5)
In the second period the agent consumes its savings and the interest on
them:
                        o
                      Ct+1 = (1 + (1 − τ )rt+1 )St .                 (6)
    Solving the optimization problem subject to the budget constraints leads
to an Euler equation for this household:
                                  o
                                Ct+1    1 + (1 − τ )rt+1
                                    y =                  .                                  (7)
                                 Ct         1 + ρw
        From Equations (5-7) an explicit expression for saving can be derived:
                                               1
                                     St =          wt L.                                    (8)
                                            2 + ρw
    This implies a constant savings rate of 1/(2 + ρw ), as is standard in
discrete OLG models when the utility function is logarithmic.7
    6
     Slightly different results are obtained if the tax is imposed only on capitalists’ capital.
See Stiglitz (2015d).
   7
     Thus, standard Keynesian style models that begin with a constant savings rate can
easily be provided micro-foundations. Note however that modern behavioral economics
suggests that it may be misguided to demand such micro-foundations, see Stiglitz (2018b).
Note too that savings rates will depend on the real interest rate when the utility function
is not logarithmic, but the equilibrium can still be analyzed with techniques similar to
those presented here, see Stiglitz (2018a).
2   MODEL                                                                    7


Production Consider a production sector given by the neoclassical pro-
duction function F (Pt , Kt , L), with Pt public capital. Kt denotes the sum
of the individual capital stocks

                              Kt = Ktc + St−1 .                            (9)

Throughout we assume constant returns to scale in all three factors:
F (Pt , Kt , L) = FK K + FL L + FP P. This implies that constant returns in the
accumulable factors K and P are impossible and thus there is no endogenous
growth.

Government The sole function of the government in this model is the
provision of public capital. It finances its investments using the capital in-
come tax revenue, thus influencing the interest rate. Hence the government’s
activity is summarized as the change in the stock of public capital (with δP
denoting its depreciation):

                         Pt+1 = (1 − δP )Pt + τ rt Kt .                   (10)

This means that increased investment into public capital in one period will
yield increased production in the next period.

Return to public investment There are a number of ways to close the
model by specifying how the return to public investment is distributed to
the agents and whether it modifies returns to the other production factors,
with different economic interpretations (see also Section 5). For the basic
model, we focus on the case of public capital as investment into education,
enhancing the productivity of labor. For this case, assume that workers’
enhanced labor is a constant-returns-to-scale sub-production function J

                           J(Pt , L) = LJ(Pt /L, 1)                       (11)
    a function of the labor supply and education expenditures. Total pro-
duction is then given by F (K, J) and is constant-returns to scale in K and
J. With this specification, the functions F and J, in combination with the
parameters ρw and ρc determine the equilibrium—including the equilibrium
distribution of wealth. It is natural to define w as the wage per efficiency
unit of labor, J :

                                   ∂F (Kt , Jt )
                              wt =               .                   (12)
                                       ∂J

labor, so the budget constraint of workers becomes

   Profit maximization of the firm yields the standard rates of return to
capital (with δK denoting depreciation of private capital):

    Profits in Equation (2) are set to zero as a consequence. We employ this
version of the model in the following unless stated otherwise.


3     Results for general production functions
In this section, we determine the basic properties of the model for general
production functions, before turning to specific parametrizations in the later
sections. First, we discuss the difference between absolute improvements
for workers—including partial “burden-shifting” of the tax—and changes in
the distribution of wealth, for different uses of the tax revenue. Second, we
demonstrate the existence of an optimal tax rate for the purpose of redistri-
bution. Third, we derive the main result of this section: with an asymptot-
ically positive factor share of augmented labor (or elasticity of substitution
between capital and augmented labor asymptotically greater than 1), there
is always a capital tax rate sufficiently high that capitalists vanish, that
is a switch from a Pasinetti to an Anti-Pasinetti regime. Fourth, we char-
acterize the boundary between the Pasinetti and the Anti-Pasinetti regime.8

    With respect to the difference between absolute improvements for work-
ers and changes in the wealth distribution, we exclusively focus on cases
in which the government uses the capital-tax revenue for public investment.
Prior work established that this policy, under certain conditions, constitutes
a Pareto improvement, i.e. it makes all classes better off in absolute terms
(see Klenert et al. 2018, Mattauch et al. 2016 and Stiglitz 2017).9 If the
capital tax revenue would instead be used to finance lump-sum transfers to
the workers, the burden of the capital tax would be shifted to them. This
would make workers worse off than before in absolute terms, as shown by
   8
     Meade (1966) and Samuelson and Modigliani (1966) were the first to describe the
conditions under which an Anti-Pasinetti outcome can occur in a neoclassical framework—
however, they did not relate their finding to capital tax-financed public investment and
elasticities of substitution.
   9
     To clarify, we focus in this article only on comparisons of steady states: there are
steady states in which both workers and capitalists are worse off than in some other
steady state, but to make the transition from the inferior steady state to the better would
require some of those in the intervening generations to be worse off.

Stiglitz (2015d), Stiglitz (2016b) and Stiglitz (2018a). This result can also be
shown in our framework, but is not the focus of our article, see Appendix D.
Instead, we characterize relative changes in the wealth distribution induced
by different types of capital tax-financed public investments. Further we
focus on steady-state distributions, that is, long term outcomes. However,
see Klenert et al. (2018) for a related analysis of transitional dynamics.
    The model is solved for steady states for general production functions
F, J (which we assume in this section to be such that stable steady states
exists, see below). Steady-state values of variables are denoted by a tilde.
    If capitalist initial wealth is zero, then capitalists remain in such a steady
state with. The model becomes a variant of the standard overlapping gen-
erations model. Corresponding to any value of τ, there is a steady state
equilibrium given by the solution to
                                       1
                              K
                              e =          w(
                                           e K)
                                              e J(τ
                                                e K).
                                                    e                                (14)
                                    2 + ρw
    We focus, however, on the steady-state equilibria which emerge if Kc
initially is greater than zero. There are three possible patterns: a steady
state in which both classes exist; one in which only workers exist; and one in
which the entire economy collapses, with both wages and capitalists’ capital
go to zero.
    It follows from the capitalist’s Euler Equation (3), in any equilibrium
with a steady-state capitalist, that the steady-state interest rate re is given
by
                                         ρc
                                 re =          .                           (15)
                                      (1 − τ )
    This means that the steady-state interest rate is solely determined by
the capitalists’ time preference rate and if there is a steady state with cap-
italists, then there is full shifting of capital taxation (see Pasinetti (1962)
and Appendix D).10
    The share of workers’ wealth for a general production function can be
determined by dividing Equation (8) by total capital:

                                   Se      1 w eJe
                                      =           .                                  (16)
                                   Ke   2 + ρw Ke
   Workers’ saving propensity determines the distribution of capital be-
tween both classes. The above equation only holds, of course, if Se < K.
                                                                       e For
a wealth ratio of S/
                  e Ke = 1, only workers would exist (the Passinetti regime),
which would yield a standard discrete overlapping generations model with
  10
     It is no surprise that we obtain consequences similar to Pasinetti (1962), because
under our assumptions, savings rates are effectively fixed. More precisely, if profits are
zero, Equations (2), (6) and (7) imply that all consumption variables are linear in wealth
for the two groups, but with different factors. We have simply provided the obvious
micro-foundations.

public capital, see, for example, Heijdra (2009), [Ch. 17]. Much of our anal-
ysis concerns examining behavior towards this boundary.
    The steady-state level of public capital is given by:
                                            1
                                      Pe =    τ reK.
                                                  e                                    (17)
                                           δP

    Equations (15) and (17) determine the allocation of total private and
public capital in the economy. They thus define two equations in only two
variables and can be solved for K e and Pe, fixing the tax rate τ. By the Ex-
treme Value Theorem, a solution in K    e and Pe will always yield a maximum
(and minimum) value for S/K as a function of τ. This remains true as long
                             e  e
as τ ∈ [0 + , 1 − ] for  > 0 small, because of the continuity of the respec-
tive functions. The result establishes that a specific capital tax rate will be
optimal from the point of view of redistributing as large a share of wealth as
possible to workers. However, it does not determine whether the maximum
and minimum values of the wealth ratio are such that both classes actually
co-exist or whether solutions are unique. For a fixed tax rate τ, and no
restrictions on production functions, there may be multiple steady states,
there may exist a (unique) equilibrium with both classes, or there may be
only a single class equilibrium.11 There may be multiple equilibria in the
two-class case because Equations (15) and (17) determine a unique value of
k ≡ K/J, but this may not result in unique values for K and J for arbitrary
production functions.

    By contrast, it is possible to characterize the limiting behavior of the
model by making assumptions about the elasticity of substitution between
capital and (augmented) labor and the factor shares. Define factor shares ΩJ
and ΩK as usual, but recalling that labor is augmented by public investment
to yield the composite J:

                                 FJ J                  FK K
                            ΩJ =               ΩK =         .                          (18)
                                  Y                     Y
         From Equation (16) one obtains

                     Se           1 e         e K (τ ) ρc + δk
                                                              
                        (τ ) =        ΩJ (τ )/Ω                                        (19)
                     Ke        2 + ρw                   1−τ
(see also Stiglitz, 2015d, 2016b).
     It is immediate that since ρc /(1 − τ ) tends to infinity as τ → 1, if the
factor share accruing to enhanced labor is strictly positive as τ → 1, then
 S
 e (τ ) exceeds 1 (and in fact diverges). If for some tax rate both classes exist,
 e
K
then there will be a tax rate at which capitalists vanish, by the Intermediate
    11
     In such a one class equilibrium, there can be multiple steady-states for a single value
of τ, too, see Heijdra (2009) [Ch. 17].

Value Theorem. Further, f (k) = F (K, J)/J = F (K/J, 1), as usual and let
σ(k) be the elasticity of substitution between K and J defined via f . One
can then establish that more generally:

Proposition 1. Assume 0 < Se () < 1, i.e. for small taxes rates  > 0 both
                                    e
                                  K
classes coexist. Further assume limτ →1 k(τ ) = 0. If σ(0) > 1, with σ(0) the
limiting elasticity of substitution as τ → 1, then there always exists a capital
tax rate τlim such that capitalists vanish (Anti-Pasinetti case).
Proof. It is known that σ(0) > 1 implies limk→0 Ω
                                                e K (τ ) = 0 (see for instance
Barelli and de Abreu Pessôa, 2003). Thus Equation (19) diverges to infinity
as τ → 1. Therefore, the conclusion follows from the Intermediate Value
Theorem.

    Later, we examine specific production functions for which the condition is
satisfied. When σ(0) < 1 instead, the above argument does not work because
it does not lead to convergence of Equation (19) to a finite value less than
1. Further, the weaker premise limτ →1 K(τ ) = 0, might not suffice, because
in our setting it is then still possible that limτ →1 k(τ ) = K(τ )/J(τ ) > 0, so
that the first step in the proof does not necessarily follow.12

    Next we characterize the boundary of the regime in which both classes
co-exist for the case of public investment as education. Proposition 1 merely
states that a tax rate exists at which capitalists eventually vanish: the
number of switches between regimes cannot be concluded from it. Let
Φ(τ ) = ΩΩKJ (τ )
             (τ ) . At the boundary

                           1=        Φ(τ )         + δk .                     (20)
                              2 + ρw        1−τ
    Any value of τ for which the above equation is satisfied is a switch-line. If
  0
Φ (τ ) > 0 there is a unique solution in τ. But for there to be a definite number
of solutions requires wealth inequality to be a strictly concave function in
the tax rate, not merely Φ to be concave.13 More precisely, we can prove
Proposition 2, see Figure 1 for an illustration:
Proposition 2 (General characterization of Pasinetti-regime boundary).
Suppose 0 < Se () < 1, i.e. for small taxes rates  > 0 both classes coexist.

Suppose that Φ(τ ) is a monotone, continuous function on (0, 1).

        regime to the Anti-Pasinetti regime occurs.

    By the assumption 0 < K   e () < 1, we exclude the case of limτ →0 k(τ ) = +∞.

    13
    It implies the below condition on Φ, which holds as long as its “curvature” is not
too big and so long as the elasticity of substitution is enough below 1. This is because
a tax increase for a small tax would lead to a decrease in share of labor if elasticity of
substitution is less than unity.

       Then

          (a) if limτ →1 Se > 1, only one switch from the Pasinetti to the Anti-

              rates, or there may be a switch from the Pasinetti to the Anti-
              Pasinetti regime for some tax rate followed by a switch back for
              a higher tax rate (which can coincide).

Proof. Part 1 follows from monotonicity and the Intermediate Value Theo-
rem.
    For Part 2, the second-order differential inequality (Equation 21) on Φ(τ )
ensures that ∂ 2 Se /∂τ 2 < 0, i.e. wealth inequality is a strictly concave (and
                   e
                  K
continuous) function of the tax rate. If limτ →1 S/        e Ke > 1, the conclusion
follows again by the Intermediate Value Theorem and the strict concavity
implies there can be no more than one switch.
    If instead limτ →1 Se ≤ 1, note that wealth inequality has a unique maxi-

                        ∗ ) +δk ) = Φ(τ )( (1−τ ∗ )2 ). Suppose this maximum occurs

in the relevant range of (0, 1). If the value of this maximum is smaller than
1, no switch to an Anti-Pasinetti regime occurs. If the value is greater or
3        RESULTS FOR GENERAL PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS                            13


equal to 1, there is a switch for some tax rate and a switch back for a higher
tax rate, applying the Intermediate Value Theorem again.14 The reason is
that by definition of strict concavity of a function, it can take a single value
at most two times. If the maximum is not in the interval (0, 1) there will be
no switch to the Anti-Pasinetti regime.

     In Section 4 we prove that for the specific case of CES production func-
tions with labor-enhancing public capital, the cases (1) and (2b) of Propo-
sition 2 apply for the relevant part of the capital tax range. We also char-
acterize the limiting behavior more fully than is possible by Proposition
1.
     Proposition 1 and 2 include the case where increasing labor-enhancing
public capital (financed by the tax) increases the factor share of labor mono-
tonically. However, if the factor share is instead decreasing, then there is
the possibility that wealth is distributed more unequally with more public
investment. For instance, if the increase of labor productivity is low but
capitalists reduce their investment a lot in response to the tax, and if the
elasticity of substitution is small enough, then the adverse distributional
effect of capitalists saving less exceeds the positive benefit of public invest-
ment. So the policy of investing capital tax revenue into labor-enhancing
public investment cannot always be assumed to reduce inequality. In cases
in which public investment enhancing labor could harm workers in relative
terms, one may wonder whether the government could instead invest into
capital-enhancing public investment. The latter might raise the factor share
accruing to labor in those cases in which labor-enhancing public investment
lowers it. In Section 5 below we show that this is not generally the case.
The simplest representation of capital-enhancing public investment is in fact
entirely symmetrical, so that, in relative terms, it does not make a difference
which factor public investment augments (Subsection 5.1). Even when pub-
lic investment enters production as an entirely separate production factor
that yields rents (Subsection B.2) workers could still be harmed in relative
terms by a capital tax. However, we are able to show that for a decreas-
ing factor share of labor, workers are still better off in absolute terms, for
moderate capital tax rates (see Figure 4 below).
     An implication of Equation (15) is that as the tax rate increases, the
before tax return to capital has to increase, so that K/J has to decrease.
For general production functions there are two cases. Consider the factor
price frontier, the dual to the production function, which gives the maximum
interest rate corresponding to any wage. Either, there is no upper bound to
the interest rate compatible with a steady state, so that regardless of the
tax imposed, there is a positive wage. Or there is a maximum before-tax
interest rate. If there is a maximum before tax interest rate, then there is
    14
         There is a singular case where the maximum value is just unity.
4   LABOR-ENHANCING PUBLIC INVESTMENT                                                   14


a maximum tax rate at which Equation (15) can be satisfied. At tax rates
above that critical level, the Euler equation implies that capitalists converge
to zero. Note that at that maximum interest rate, the wage is zero, so that
workers’ capital also is zero.
    Further, for a marginal change in the tax rate, it is also possible to char-
acterise the effect of an increase in the tax rate on relative capital holdings in
terms of the elasticity of substitution σ(k) for general production functions,
in a two class equilibrium:

Proposition 3. sgn(d ln(S/K)/d ln τ ) = sgn(1 − ΩK /σ(k)). That is, wealth
inequality decreases if the elasticity is greater than 1, holding factor shares
constant.

Proof.

                sgn(d ln(S/K)/d ln τ ) = −sgn(d ln(S/K)/d ln k)
                    = sgn(1 − d ln w/d ln k) = sgn(1 − ΩK /σ(k))



    Hence, if the elasticity of substitution is greater than 1, wealth inequality
is always decreased, ceteris paribus. If instead the elasticity is less than one,
the effect of a marginal capital tax increase additionally depends on the
factor share of capital.
    It is worth noting that the properties of J do not enter at all in the
above analysis, though they are central to the analysis of the welfare effects
on workers themselves. The above analysis can only hold, of course, for
0 ≤ S/K ≤ 1, and so it is important to understand the domain over which
that is true, and what happens when it is not. To investigate this more
closely, we narrow our focus in the next section on constant elasticity of
substitution functions.


4     Labor-enhancing public investment
This section investigates the role of the elasticity of substitution between
capital and labor in assessing whether capital taxation leads to a reduction
in wealth inequality. In particular, public investment is assumed (as in the
previous section) to be labor-enhancing (as is education). We use the model
of Section 2, but parametrize the production function by a CES function
between capital and labor. We classify all possible long-term outcomes,
that is we analyze whether one or both classes exist.15
  15
     It is well-known that for CES functions, a steady state might not exist for all values
of the elasticity in a neoclassical growth model because for each value of the elasticity,
one of the Inada conditions is violated. In this section, existence would also depend on

Figure 2: Wealth inequality as a function of the capital tax rate for various
elasticities as an illustration of Proposition 4, 5 and Corollary 6. (Values
above 1 and below 0 are not economically meaningful, for model calibration
see Section 6).


    We proceed as follows: We first prove that for a given elasticity of sub-
stitution between capital and labor σ with σ ≥ 1, there exists a capital
tax rate τlim at which the economy switches from a Pasinetti to an Anti-
Pasinetti state so that capitalists disappear (Proposition 4). We then show
that, if σ < 1, there exists a capital tax rate τlim at which the economy either
switches from a Pasinetti to an Anti-Pasinetti or to an Anti-Anti-Pasinetti
state, in which the capital share of workers goes to zero (Proposition 5). Fur-
ther, there exists a threshold value σ1 < 1 such that for σ ≥ σ1 the switch
is to an Anti-Pasinetti state, while for σ ≤ σ1 , the switch is to an Anti-
Anti-Pasinetti state (Corollary 6). In all cases the relationship between the
elasticity of substitution and τlim is monotone. The results are illustrated
by Figure 2.
    Assume the production is given by the following function, in which public
the function J, so we assume it is such that a steady state exists for relevant ranges of the
Pasinetti regime. In Appendix C we show that there are plausible specifications of J for
which this is true. Further, whenever a unique steady state exists, the model converges
to it because it inherits the dynamics of a neoclassical growth model with public capital,
see Appendix C.

capital P is labor-enhancing:
                                                                1

    with 0 < α < 1, γ < 1, γ 6= 0.16 The elasticity of substitution between
capital and labor σ is given by σ = 1/(1 − γ). The relative capital intensity
at any given wage-interest-ratio is reflected by α. Throughout, we assume
that the function J(P, L) is such that a steady state in relevant ranges of
the Pasinetti regime exists (and we verify this below for J specified as Cobb-
Douglas).
    We derive in Appendix A.1 that


     Se               1      ρ
                                c

     Ke           α(2 + ρw ) 1 − τ        α 1−τ
Note that one can show by straightforward computation that this expression
is monotonically decreasing in α. This means that wealth inequality increases
with higher capital intensity, as is to be expected (capitalists derive all
their income from capital; workers only a fraction of their income). We
hence focus on substitution elasticities and so compare different values of
production parameters (different economies) on long-run outcomes.17
    We assume throughout this section that there is an economically mean-
ingful state in which both classes co-exist for a capital tax of zero (Pasinetti-
case).

Assumption 1. (a) For a capital tax of nearly zero both agents co-exist.
   This implies that 0 < S/
                         e K(,
                            e γ) < 1 for  > 0 small.

(b) δK > α.

   Both of these assumptions hold for the economically relevant range of
the parameters used in our model by a very large margin.18
   First, consider the case that γ > 0, that is, the substitution elasticity
between capital and labor is greater than 1.
  16
     To avoid a confusion in units, as K is measured in capital goods while J in equivalent
labor units, one should, strictly speaking, account these different goods in “aK” and “b,”
where a and b are such as to ensure equivalency of services provided, i.e. so that if K is
the only factor of production, Q/K = a, and similarly for J. We choose our units so that
a = b = 1.
  17
     Changing only one of the two parameters of a CES function, as we explore in this
section, changes the distribution of income at any given ratio of capital and (effective)
labor. The net effect on the equilibrium if we change both parameters simultaneously so
as to preserve the distribution of income in the initial situation would be different from
that when we perturb only one parameter.
  18
     For the content of Propositions 4 and 5, the weaker claim ρc + δK > α would suffice
for Part (b) of the assumption. See Section 6 for calibration of the model, which includes
employing time steps of 30 years.
4   LABOR-ENHANCING PUBLIC INVESTMENT                                          17


Proposition 4. Let production be specified as above and assume γ ≥ 0.

(a) For every γ, there exists a capital tax rate τlim , such that capitalists
    vanish, that is, the solution to Equation (23) entails S/   e Ke = 1 (Anti-
    Pasinetti case). For tax rates above τlim , only equilibria with solely work-
    ers exist.

(b) This relationship is monotone: the higher the value of γ, the lower the
    tax rate at which capitalists vanish.

Proof. It is straightforward to show that S/e K(τ
                                              e ; γ) is monotonically in-
creasing in τ and γ for τ, γ ∈ (0, 1), keeping the other parameters fixed.
Moreover, it can be established, using Equation (23) that

                                    Se
                               lim     (τ, γ) = ∞.
                               τ →1 Ke
   So as S/ e ; γ) is continuous in τ ∈ (0, 1), the proposition follows from
          e K(τ
the Intermediate Value Theorem.


   Now consider the case γ < 0, that is, the substitution elasticity between
capital and labor is smaller than 1.

Proposition 5. Let production be specified as above. Assume γ < 0 and
that assumption 1 still holds.

(a) For every γ, there exists a capital tax rate, such that either capital-
    ists vanish (Anti-Pasinetti case) or workers vanish (Anti-Anti-Pasinetti
    case).

(b) In both cases, the relationship is monotone: For the Anti-Pasinetti case,
    the higher the elasticity, the lower the tax rate at which capitalists vanish.
    For the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case, the lower the elasticity, the lower the
    tax rate at which workers vanish.

Proof. The idea of the proof is to realize that for γ < 0 with |γ| small, the
function S/
         e K(τ
            e ; γ) has a unique maximum that may or may not be greater
than 1 depending on parameter choices.
   To prove part (a), first note that

                                   Se
                              lim     (τ ; γ) = −∞.
                              τ →1 Ke
    This again follows from the algebra of limits, as
                                         γ      !
                          1 ρc            1−γ
                   lim     (       + δk )     − α = −α.
                  τ →1    α 1−τ
4   LABOR-ENHANCING PUBLIC INVESTMENT                                                   18


   By straightforward computation, it can be shown that S/
                                                        e K(τ
                                                           e ) has a
unique maximum in τ ∈ (0, 1) for
                                              1−γ
                                α(α(1 − γ))    γ    > δK .                            (24)

Else S/
      e K(τ
          e ) is monotonically decreasing in (0,1) (see Appendix A.2).
    First consider the case that a unique maximum exists. If the value of this
maximum is below 1 (or outside of the range (0,1)), the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti
case occurs, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, as S/  e K(τ
                                                         e ) is continuous
in τ ∈ (0, 1). If instead the value of this maximum is above 1 and it is in
the range (0, 1), the Anti-Pasinetti case occurs. However, if condition (24)
is not fulfilled, the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case occurs.
    To prove part (b), note that the proof of monotonicity of S/
                                                              e K(τ
                                                                 e ; γ) in γ
in the proof of Proposition 4 does not depend on γ being positive. γ/(1 − γ)
is still a monotonically increasing function for γ < 0, given Assumption
1.

   The following corollary characterizes exactly under which condition the
Anti- and the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case occur for γ < 0.
Corollary 6. Let production be specified as above and assume γ < 0. As-
sumption 1 is still given.
(a) There exists γ1 < 0, such that: If γ > γ1 , for every γ, there exists a
    capital tax rate, such that capitalists vanish (Anti-Pasinetti case). If
    γ < γ1 , for every γ, there exists a tax rate such that workers vanish
    (Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case).

(b) In both cases, the relationship is monotone: For the Anti-Pasinetti case,
    the higher the elasticity, the lower the tax rate extinguishing capitalists.
    For the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case, the lower the elasticity, the lower the
    tax that extinguishes workers.19
Proof. See Appendix A.3.

   The previous results imply that, given our specification of the production
function, for fixed τ, the workers’ wealth share increases in γ. This is a
consequence of the fact that, so long as there are capitalists, the interest rate
remains fixed by the capitalists’ time preference rate even if the elasticity
between capital and labor is changed. In our formulation, workers’ fixed
supply of labor is worth more the higher the elasticity, so that they save
more.20
   19
      As we noted earlier, however, there may (and in general will) exist an Anti-Pasinetti
equilibrium. By contrast, the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case is a limiting case: the only condi-
tions under which it arises are such that capitalists aymptocially disappear, too, because
there does not exist a steady state any more.
   20
      This is not a general property, but is a consequence of the specification of our CES

5     Robustness: Public investment that enhances
      capital or generates rents
In this section we analyze the robustness of the findings from Section 4. We
consider alternative ways in which public investment might act on the econ-
omy: in particular, public capital can be an imperfect substitute for private
capital, as in the case of state-owned companies. This can happen when
public investment augments the interest rate (Section 5.1). Alternatively
both labor- and capital-enhancing public investment can generate rents, im-
plying that firms make profits (Section 5.2). The final subsection sketches
a more general formulation with classes holding different capital goods and
distinct forms of public investment (Subsection 5.3).

5.1    Capital-enhancing public investment
As an alternative to labor-enhancing public investment such as education,
one can study capital-enhancing public investment. Core infrastructure in-
vestments may be plausibly represented as predominantly capital- , not
labor-enhancing. In this subsection, we consider a variant of our model, in-
troducing capital-enhancing public investment in a way entirely symmetric
to Section 4.21 For this case, assume that there is a constant-returns-to-scale
sub-production function H of both types of capital

                             H(Kt , Pt ) = Pt H(Kt /Pt , 1).                           (25)
Total production is then given by F (H, L) and is constant-returns to scale
in H and L. With this modification, one defines the wage as:

                                   ∂F (Ht , L)
                                    wt =       .                      (12a)
                                       ∂L
    Here we assume that public investment modifies the return to capital,
with capitalists appropriating the full return to H (just as workers appro-
priated the full return to education-augmented-labor) so that profit maxi-
production function (which is standard). Reducing the elasticity of substitution simply
means increasing the curvature. If this is done around the initial equilibrium point, the
marginal rate of substitution (and hence the wage) remains unchanged at the point. The
focus of the article is on understanding in which situations the policy proposal of capital
tax-financed public investment is effective. The effect of a given change in the before tax
return on capital on the capital-effective labor ratio depends, in turn, on the elasticity of
substitution.
  21
     Note that because we consider a public capital stock, not technological change and
our model converges to a steady state in which private and public capital are constant,
Uzawa’s theorem does not apply to our setting. “Factor-enhancing” public investment
has very different properties from standard “factor-enhancing” technological change in
growth theory.
5    ROBUSTNESS                                                             20


mization yields the following rate of return:

                                        ∂F (Ht , L)
                            rt + δK =               .                    (13a)
                                           ∂Ht
    Further, Equations (1) to (10) of the original model are assumed to hold,
but with K, K c and S replaced by H, H c and H S , that is H c is capitalists’
aggregate capital holding and H S is workers aggregate capital.
    Assuming the steady state exists, as above, for capital-enhancing public
investment, one can then conclude that

                 eS
                 H            1 e         e H (τ ) ρc + δk
                                                          
                    (τ ) =        ΩL (τ )/Ω                               (26)
                 He        2 + ρw                   1−τ

(with ΩL and ΩH the respective factor shares) and hence prove
                                 S
Proposition 7. Assume 0 < He () < 1, i.e. for small taxes rates τ > 0
                                g
                                  H
both classes coexist. If the factor share accruing to capital is non-increasing
as τ → 1, there always exists a capital tax rate τlim such that capitalists
vanish (Anti-Pasinetti case).

Proof. Equation (26) can be derived by analogy to the case of Equation
(19), so the result follows by the Intermediate Value Theorem.

   However, as mentioned in Section 3, this raises the question whether
labor-enhancing public investment decreasing the share of labor happens if
and only if capital-enhancing public investment increases the share of labor.
We prove next that this is not in general the case, by considering a specific
production function.
   Assume now again an explicit CES function between H and L in pro-
duction, with the same parameters as in Equation (23), but H replacing K
and L replacing J there. One finds that, entirely symmetrical to Equation
(23) and by the method given in Appendix A.1 that wealth inequality given
by HS /H ratio is given by:

                       H
                       fS    r + δK )(1 − α)
                            (e                  e γ.
                          =                  (L/H)                        (27)
                       He      α(2 + ρw )

   This can be transformed to an expression with parameters only, as in
Equation (23) and similarly to the method given in Appendix A.1:


    H
    fS    (1 − α)  ρc          1       1 ρc            γ     
       =                  + δk           ( (     + δk )) 1−γ − α . (28)
    He   α(2 + ρw ) 1 − τ        (1 − α) α 1 − τ

     So we have established:
5   ROBUSTNESS                                                             21


Proposition 8. For the case of public investment that augments a produc-
tion factor as given by Equations (11-13) or Equations (12a-13a) and (25),
it is irrelevant for distributional outcomes which factor is augmented.

Proof. The right-hand side of Equation (28) is identical to that of Equation
(23).

    Note the emphasis on distributional outcome in the proposition. In
absolute terms, it of course matters which production factor is augmented by
public investment. It is only through the set-up with two classes that there
is no difference in the distributional outcomes regardless of which factor
is enhanced. However, this variant of the model might not be convincing
if one objects to the idea that public capital adds to the stock of private
capital holdings. We next explore the alternative that public capital is a
fully separate production factor that yields rents.

5.2   Public investment that creates rents appropriated by
      firms
Consider a version of the model in which public investment generates a
return, which firms obtain as profits:

                                   ∂F (Pt , Kt , L)
                           Πt =                     Pt .               (29)
                                        ∂P
   In Equation (2) we assumed that capitalists appropriate profits, for ex-
ample as shareholders of the firms. Alternatively, one may think of the
government as appropriating the rent and redistributing the returns to the
capitalists. In this version, factor returns are given by

                                   ∂F (Kt , L, Pt )
                            wt =                    .                   (12b)
                                        ∂L
and
                                      ∂F (Kt , L, Pt )

    This formulation is plausible if the capitalist (who is also a shareholder
of the firm) does not optimize for the rents he may receive as the government
provides public investment. This would be so if there are many firms. If
we think of the rents on public capital being appropriated in proportion
to K, then an individual who invests more appropriates more of the public
capital, so to him, the observed return to capital is the marginal return to
private capital plus his increased share of the rents of public capital. For
this reason, we study the details of this approach in Appendix B only, but
note the following results here:
    Findings from Section 4 are robust up to a multiplicative constant rep-
resenting the productivity of public capital for the case of labor-enhancing

public investment that generates rents (Subsection B.1). We further show
that for capital-enhancing public investment that generates rents, the Anti-
Anti-Pasinetti case, workers disappearing, can still occur for poor substi-
tution possibilities between aggregate capital and labor when the different
forms of capital are highly substitutable (Subsection B.2). Finally, for the
special case of perfect substitutability between private and public capital,
the tax rate at which a switch from the Pasinetti to the Anti-Pasinetti regime
occurs is determined explicitly (Subsection B.3). Importantly, in a formu-
lation with rents obtained as profits, one can treat analytically the case in
which capitalists also receive labor income. We find that, by comparison to
a case in which only workers provide labor, they are relatively worse off, as
expected (Subsection B.1).

5.3   A more general formulation of public investment
There are two possible criticisms of the above analysis. The first is that it
ignores differences in the kinds of capital goods in which life-cycle savers and
capitalists save. The former have less wealth and are accordingly naturally
more risk averse. If there are costs associated with portfolio diversification
and obtaining information concerning the relative merits of different assets,
it is natural that (at any level of wealth holding) they are less diversified
and that they spend less on information acquisition. Data bear out that
there are large differences in compositions of assets and liabilities, which can
have important implications for the distributive consequences of different
policies (Franks et al., 2018; Stiglitz, 2016b). For instance, since equities
are disproportionately owned by the wealthy (capitalists, in our model),
monetary policies like quantitative easing which disproportionately benefits
equity owners contributed to an increase in wealth inequality (Galbraith,
2012; Stiglitz, 2010, 2015a; Turner, 2017).
     Secondly, public investment in physical capital can take on a number of
forms: it can increase or decrease workers wages, or increase or decrease the
returns to private investment in capital. In the simple specifications explored
so far, public capital is complementary to both labor and private capital, but
that is not true more generally. (In a constant returns to scale production
function with two factors, the two factors are necessarily complements, but
in a production function with three or more factors, all that one can say
is that each factor must be complementary with at least one other factor,
i.e. Fij > 0 for some j for every i.) Thus, we can formulate a more general
production function
                            Y = F (L, Kw , Kc , P1 , P2 )                   (30)
in which workers’ and capitalists’ capital may not be perfect substitutes for
each other, and P1 and P2 are different forms of public goods, with, say

                       FLP1 > 0, FLP2 < 0, FKw Kc < 0                      (31)
6        SIMULATIONS                                                                  23


and
                            FKc P1 < 0      and      FKc P2 > 0.                    (32)
A tax on the return to only (particularly) capitalists’ capital with the pro-
ceeds invested in P1 could (a) lead to an increase in wages and thereby Kw ;
but (b) leads to a decrease in capitalists’ capital, so that wealth inequality
would decrease. On the other hand, if the proceeds of the tax were invested
in P2 , and FKc P2 is large enough, then Kc might have to increase FKc P2 to
drive down the marginal return to private investment to the long-run equi-
librium value, while wages and therefore Kw actually decrease. In this case,
wealth inequality has increased. Government investment in research to cre-
ate human-replacing robots is an example of public investment decreasing
the return to labor, and government investment in roads may be an exam-
ple of public investment which increased the private returns to a particular
kind of private investment, railroads. In short, once one takes into account
the variety of forms of public investment, it is clear that simplistic models
suggesting that the incidence of a capital tax are adverse to the interests of
workers have to be re-examined.


6         Application: Quantitative implications of labor-
          enhancing public investment
In this section we calibrate the version of the model with labor-enhancing
public investment (Section 4) to quantify the theoretical properties and
more closely examine the possibility of coming close to the Pasinetti-regime
boundaries. We calculate a set of threshold values for the substitution elas-
ticity between capital and labor (σ = 1/(1 − γ)) and the capital tax rate
(τ ), as they completely determine which class benefits from increasing cap-
ital taxes to finance public investment. Exploring this space numerically
matters in particular since there is empirical disagreement about the value
of the substitution elasticity (Chirinko, 2008; Piketty and Saez, 2014; Rogn-
lie, 2014).
     The main results are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows the
wealth ratio changes with increasing capital taxes, for different elasticities.
Figure 3 shows all conceivable model outcomes and the prevailing regimes
in the form of a “phase diagram”. To the left of the gray line, capitalists
are better off in relative terms from an increase in capital taxes, to its right,
workers are relatively better off. Figure 4 translates this to absolute terms,
addressing the question when workers are actually better off in absolute
terms (see Mattauch et al. (2016) and Stiglitz (2018a) for analytical results).
Here we find that the higher the elasticity, the higher can be the tax rate
up to which workers are still better off in absolute terms.22

       The calibration of the model, which is summarized in Table 1, is justified
   as follows: The capital share of income α is set at 0.38, in accordance with
   observations that in OECD countries the labor share of income was dropping
   from 66.1 % to 61.7 % from 1990 to 2009 (OECD, 2012). The productivity
   of public capital β, is chosen at 0.2 in accordance with estimates that it is
   under-provided (Aschauer, 1989; Bom and Ligthart, 2014; Gramlich, 1994).
   Labor is fixed; however, since we only display results about the distribution
   of wealth, its value is irrelevant. As we focus on the case of labor-enhancing
   public investment as specified in Section 4, we parametrize the general sub-
   function J(L, P ) assumed in that section. We use Jt = Ptβ L(1−β) , with
   0 < β < 1, and α + β < 1, so that there is no long-run or explosive growth.
   Time is measured in steps of 30 years because workers are assumed to live
   for two periods; therefore we choose corresponding values for time preference
   and depreciation rates.
       The wealth distribution for the OECD is not known (Alvaredo et al.,
   2018). Therefore, we calibrate the model to the U.S. wealth distribution
   (Wolff, 2010) and check robustness below. In 2007, 62 % of net worth
   were held by the top 5 % of the population and almost 38 % of net worth
6   SIMULATIONS                                                              26


by the remaining 95 %. We thus set the time preference rates ρc and ρw
such that for a capital tax of 21 %, (the average capital tax rate in OECD
countries between the years 1970 and 2000, Carey and Rabesona, 2002)
and an elasticity of substitution between capital and labor of 1, this wealth
distribution results. In accordance with evidence that richer households are
more patient (Lawrance, 1991; Green et al., 1996), time preference rates of
capitalists are chosen significantly lower than that of workers.

    Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the threshold value of the
elasticity σ1 . For elasticities greater than this value, high tax rates lead to
an Anti-Pasinetti regime (capitalists disappearing). The threshold is given
by setting Equation (A.17) to 1 and thus depends only on the parameters ρw
and α. Table 2 shows that the threshold is hardly dependent on economically
plausible values for the capital share and workers’ time preference rate. The
reason is that the peaks of the curves S/e K(τ
                                            e ) are very steep as they approach
τ = 1 and lead to Anti-Pasinetti outcomes.

7         Conclusion
This article examines whether taxing capital at higher rates in order to
finance underfunded public capital helps to mitigate wealth inequality. Im-
portantly, we consider disparities in saving behavior in a novel way. Wealth
inequality continues to rise in rich countries, which is at least partially due to
heterogeneous saving behavior across the wealth distribution. Rich individ-
uals have lower time preference rates, obtain a greater share of their income
from capital and save for posterity, not for retirement, when compared to
the rest of society. Our study develops the simplest possible framework rep-
resenting these disparities by combining a standard life-cycle saving working
class with dynastically saving top earners.23
     We prove that the success of the proposed policy in reducing wealth
inequality depends on the substitutability of capital and labor. When these
factors are highly substitutable, there exists a positive capital tax rate at
which dynastic savers disappear in the limit. Life-cycle savers will therefore
always obtain a higher share of aggregate capital in this scenario and wealth
inequality will be reduced. For low values of the elasticity of substitution
between capital and labor, there exists a positive capital tax rate at which
life-cycle savers disappear. However, this is a boundary case with little
practical relevance, as our numerical results indicate.
     Our study thus confirms that capital tax-financed public investment—
the major policy recommendation resulting from Piketty (2014)—reduces
inequality in wealth in the long term, if capital and labor are close substi-
tutes. Conversely, our results can be seen as a note of caution against this
policy recommendation if capital and labor tend to be complements. While
empirically there is disagreement about the value of the substitution elas-
ticity (Chirinko, 2008; Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014; Piketty and Saez,
2014; Knoblach et al., 2016), we find that for standard parameter values the
critical threshold between the different limiting cases is around 0.82. This
indicates that both cases are conceivable. Future research needs to clarify
the value of the elasticity in different macroeconomic settings but, nonethe-
less, we demonstrate numerically that even for lower elasticities, wealth in-
equality decreases and the middle class is better off in absolute terms, if
capital taxes are only moderately high. Further research could also examine
welfare-optimal policies, not merely Pareto-improvements or inequality, if
welfare weights were assigned to the different groups in the wealth distribu-
    23
     Franks et al. (2018) use a model with a more fine-grained heterogeneity structure, in
which there are several intermediate classes that display a mixture between bequest and
life-cycle motivated saving in order to compare the distributional incidence of different
wealth-based taxes. Their analysis complements this study in indicating that it is more
effective to tax certain components of aggregate wealth, namely land rents or bequests
than aggregate capital. This is a feature from which the present analysis abstracts, as
does most of the literature on capital taxation.
7        CONCLUSION                                                                        28


tion. Yet this is an open question in the literature on class models (but see
Calvo and Obstfeld, 1988).
    Our results can be linked to recent economic studies of ever more intelli-
gent machines (Autor, 2015; Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017, 2018b; Guerreiro
et al., 2017; Korinek and Stiglitz, 2017)—given the critical dependence of
our findings on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Ad-
vances in automation amplify concerns about growing wealth inequality due
to the decreased importance of labor as a production factor and the concen-
tration of capital in the hands of a relatively small share of the population
(Autor, 2015; Piketty and Saez, 2014). Yet, the implications of the develop-
ment of intelligent machines for wealth inequality are presently unclear.
    At least three different approaches to the macroeconomics of automation
are generally explored: First, if machines become more intelligent this could
be represented as technological progress which enhances capital (Acemoglu
and Restrepo, 2018a).24 Second, intelligent machines may be more usefully
represented as a different form of capital that becomes a perfect substitute
for labor over time (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2018a). Third, one may think
of automation as a rise in the capital intensity of the economy as well as an
enhanced substitutability between capital and labor.
    In this last case, the results of this study can be interpreted as being
about increasing automation. Capital (or robot) taxation would be a useful
means for reducing wealth inequality if automation implies a high substi-
tutability between capital and labor.25 If the development of intelligent
machines raises the elasticity close to or above 1, our contribution shows
that capital-tax financed public investment emerges as the adequate recipe
to keep wealth inequality in check and labor income sufficiently high.

     This case is related to a large body of literature on factor-biased technological change,
which has elaborated on the role of innovation possibility curves, implying that there is
a trade-off between labor- and capital-enhancing technological progress (Kennedy, 1964;
Samuelson, 1965; Acemoglu, 2010; Stiglitz, 2006, 2014). This literature, however, has to
date not been linked to analyses of wealth inequality by class models.
  25
     The Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case, by contrast, seems relevant for understanding dystopian
visions about intelligent machines. In a world with very little substitution possibilities
between increasingly intelligent machines and workers, taxing machines and financing
labor-enhancing investment would suppress wages and thus decrease the workers’ share of
wealth.

A.1       Derivation of S/
                        e Ke
In this section we derive an explicit formula for the capital share of the
workers S/
         e Ke (Equation 23).
   We divide the expression for workers’ saving (Equation 8) by total capital
and then insert the firm’s first-order conditions (Equations 13 and 12):

Here we used that
                                 ∂F (Kt , Jt )
                                   wt =        .                  (A.2)
                                     ∂J
  To find an explicit solution for expression (A.1), solve the model for
K/J.
e e For this purpose, let k = K/J, and let y = Y /J. Then
                                                 1
                       y = α(k)γ + (1 − α)1γ γ .                  (A.3)
    From standard growth theory, we know that for any constant-returns-
to-scale function
    rt + δk = YeK = ye0 (k),
    so that
                                              ρc
                                 ye0 (k) =       + δk .                             (A.4)
                                             1−τ
       To solve this, use that
                                                            1−γ
                        ye0 (e     k γ−1 αe
                             k) = αe      k γ + (1 − α)       γ
                                                                   .                (A.5)
       Substituting this into Equation (A.4) gives

        1 ρc             γ
          (                    k −γ (αe
                  + δk ) 1−γ = e      k γ + (1 − α)) = α + (1 − α)e k −γ .   (A.6)
        α 1−τ
       This is an equation that can be solved for ek,26 as it is equivalent to
  26
    Evidently solutions to Equation (A.7) could be complex if the term inside the ex-
ponent is negative. This reflects that outside of the Pasinetti regime, the model would
not converge to a steady state given by the above equations as one class disappears. For
further economic analysis, only the term’s appearance in Equation (A.8) is used, which
has an exponent equal to one. For σ > 1, our parametrized version of F (J, K) thus fulfills
the condition limτ →1 K/J = 0 assumed in Proposition 1.

We determine the sign and zero of the derivative of S/   e K(τ
                                                           e ). For this purpose,
let x(τ ) = (ρc /(1 − τ ) + δK ), and note that x (τ ) = ρc (1 − τ )−2 .
                                                  0

    Then:

    We now compute the zero of the derivative by setting the second term
of the product to 0:

                       α(1 − γ) α (1 − τ )
     This is equivalent to
                        1    ρc                        1−γ
                       ( (         + δK )) = (α(1 − γ)) γ                     (A.12)

    Further, replacing the equalities by inequalities, one can determine the
sign of the derivative. This is, in general, dependent on the value of all

relevant parameters. However, for non-restrictive parameter conditions, its
sign can be determined for the economically relevant cases as follows.
    Consider the above four equations as inequalities: First, note that for
values γ < 0 the direction of the inequality changes from Equation (A.11) to
(A.12). Second, noting that τ ∈ (0, 1), there is also a change in the direction
of the inequality from Equation (A.13) to (A.14) if
                                           1−γ
                             α(α(1 − γ))    γ    > δK .                 (A.15)

For |γ| small, it can be verified that this inequality holds for γ < 0, but not
for γ > 0, for a wide parameter range for α and δk around their standard
values of 0.38 and 0.7, respectively. For part of this parameter range, it also
holds for large values of |γ|. Taken together, this means that the derivative
is positive for τ < τz and negative for τ > τz . Thus τz is a local maximum.
The only economically relevant case that differs is for γ < 0 and |γ| large
(γ < −0.95 for the standard parametrization): in this case τz is a local
minimum. However, for this case, τz > 1 and thus S/      e Ke is decreasing on
τ ∈ (0, 1).
    Further, it can be verified, by inserting τz into the function, that the
value of the maximum is given by

A.3     Proof of Corollary 6
It is established in Appendix A.2 that S/
                                       e K(τ
                                          e ) has a unique maximum if
            1−γ
α(α(1 − γ)) γ > δK . (If this condition is not fulfilled, which is the case
for |γ| large, S/
               e K(τ
                  e ) has a minimum. The minimum, however, occurs for
τ > 1, and S/K(τ ) can be shown to be decreasing within τ ∈ (0, 1). See
              e e
Appendix A.2 for details.) The value of this maximum is given by

                     Se              αγ              1−γ

                     Ke           (2 + ρw )
Consider this value as a function of γ :

                                  (2 + ρw )
    The corollary is shown by proving the following properties, which are
derived in Appendix A.2:
    1. f (γ) has a unique minimum with respect to γ at γ = ln(α). It is
       monotonically increasing with respect to γ for γ > ln(α).

    2. limγ→0+ f (γ) = +∞.
A        DERIVATIONS                                                                   37


         Assumption 1 implies that f (ln(α)) < 1 because one can deduce that
                                       1−γ
there exists a γ with α(α(1 − γ)) γ > δK . such that τz = 0.27
    The corollary is then deduced from the two properties in the follow-
ing way: by the Intermediate Value Theorem, a value γ1 exists, such that
f (γ1 ) = 1, since f (γ) is continuous. This implies that for γ < γ1 , f (γ1 ) < 1
and hence the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case occurs. If γ > γ1 , then f (γ1 ) > 1
and the economy is in an Anti-Pasinetti state.
    Finally, note that Part (b) would not follow if it were the case that
                                                       1−γcrit
ln(α) > γcrit with γcrit given by α(α(1 − γcrit )) γcrit = δK . In fact, it would
violate the monotonicity of S/ e K(τ
                                  e ) throughout. Below we show why this
cannot occur.
    We now complete the proof of Part (a) of Corollary 6 by showing the
two properties that

     1. f (γ) has a unique minimum with respect to γ at γ = ln(α). It is
        monotonically increasing with respect to γ for γ > ln(α).

     2. limγ→0+ f (γ) = +∞.

Regarding the first property, note that f (γ) can be rewritten as
                                               1         1−γ 
                       f (γ) = −γα1/γ                 1−γ γ .                     (A.19)
                                            (2 + ρw )
                                                    1−γ
Let g(γ) = −γα1/γ and h(γ) = 1/(2+ρw ) (1−γ) γ . h(γ) is monotonically
increasing for all γ > 0, as is obtained from the fact that the function xx is
monotonically increasing. Further, it can be calculated that
                                                
                            dg      1/γ   1
                                 =α         ln(α) .                    (A.20)
                            dγ            γ

This derivative equals zero for γ = ln(α) and is positive for γ > ln(α)
and negative for γ < ln(α). Since f (γ) is the product of function g, which
has a minimum at γ = ln(α) and the monotonically increasing function h,
it also has a minimum at γ = ln(α). From this also follows that f (γ) is
monotonically increasing for γ > ln(α).
    Regarding the second property, factor f (γ) into
                                               1              1
                  f (γ) = − γα1/γ ·

                                        (1 − γ)(2 + ρw )
Taking limits with respect to γ → 0 from below, the second factor of
this product tends to 1/(2 + ρw ). Note the third factor is equivalent to
    27                                    α ln(α)              1−ln(α)
     Condition f (ln(α)) < 1 is true if − (2+ρ w)
                                                  α(1 − ln(α)) ln(α) < 1, a condition that
is satisfied by our standard parametrization (see Section 6) by a large margin.
B   PUBLIC INVESTMENT GENERATING RENTS                                     38


exp(1/x ln(1 − x)). Applying L’Hôpital’s rule to its exponent yields that
this factor tends to e−1 .
    It remains to consider the first term, −γα1/γ . Substituting γ = −1/y and
applying L’Hôpital’s rule to (1/α)y /y as y → +∞ shows that this term tends
to +∞. This establishes the behavior at γ = 0 from below and completes
the proof of Part (a).
    We finally explain that given Assumption 1 it is always the case that
ln(α) < γcrit as mentioned in the proof of Part (b) of Corollary 6. Recall
that γcrit is given by
                                            1−γcrit
                         α(α(1 − γcrit ))    γcrit
                                                      = δK .            (A.22)

    Suppose for contradiction that ln(α) > γcrit . Then by definition
                                            1−ln(α)
                         α(α(1 − ln(α)))     ln(α)    > δK .            (A.23)
    Rearranging gives:
                                   1
                      (1 − ln(α)) ln(α) > δK (1 − ln(α)).               (A.24)

    Noting that for 0 < α < 1, the right-hand side is bigger than δK and the
left-hand side is smaller than α, one establishes a contradiction to Assump-
tion 1 (b) in Section 4 of the main text.


B     Labor- and capital-enhancing public investment
      generating rents
B.1    Labor-enhancing public investment with rents
We first consider the case in which public capital is labor-enhancing in the
sense of Equation (11). From Equation (16), one immediately obtains a
modified expression with factor shares ΩJ , ΩK :

               Se           1 ∂ Je e       e K (τ ) ρc + δk .
                                                          
                  (τ ) =           ΩJ (τ )/Ω                             (B.1)
               Ke        2 + ρw ∂L                   1−τ
In comparison with Equation (19), the marginal product of the composite
factor with respect to labor enters as an additional multiplicative term.
    Assume an explicit parametrization for J :

                               Jt = Ptβ L(1−β) ,                         (B.2)
with α + β < 1, to exclude the case of long-run or explosive growth.
    Then ∂J/∂L = (1 − β). For a parametrized CES function as in Section
4, one thus finds that all results in Section 4 hold, but are modified by the
multiplicative constant (1 − β).
B   PUBLIC INVESTMENT GENERATING RENTS                                     39


    In this formulation, one can also characterize a regime in which capital-
ists also work. Assume total labor is divided between workers’ labor Lc and
capitalists’ labor Lw . Then

                        S/
                        e Ke = 1/(2 + ρw )(wL
                                           e w )/K,
                                                 e                       (B.3)

so by comparison to a case in which only workers provide labor, they are
relatively worse off, as expected. However, by analogy to Proposition 1, one
can still show that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor
determines whether there exists a tax rate at which capitalists disappear. So
the results of this manuscript do not change qualitatively when it is assumed
that capitalists also provide labor.

B.2    Capital-enhancing public investment with rents
Here we treat the case in which capital-enhancing public investment gener-
ates a rent, instead of augmenting the marginal product of private capital.
Firms generate profits and we assume again that these are appropriated
by the capitalists, so that households hold stocks of private capital, not
augmented capital.
    For a general production function with capital-enhancing public invest-
ment in the sense of Equation (25), one obtains Equation (26) again. Next,
we analyze when the Anti-Pasinetti and Anti-Anti-Pasinetti may occur de-
pending on substitution possibilities.
    Therefore, in this subsection we analyze a production function of the
nested CES type (instead of a single CES function and an unspecified sub-
function, as with labor-enhancing public capital in Section 4). Assuming a
general subfunction H will not help in this case because the interest rate is
now given by ∂F/∂K. Let production thus be given by:
                                                           (1/µ)
                  Yt = Ft (Ht , L) = (θHtµ + (1 − θ)Lµ )                 (B.4)
   Public and private capital G and K are combined into generic capital
Ht by means of a CES function:
                                                       (1/η)
                    Ht (Kt , Pt ) = (ζKtη + (1 − ζ)Ptη )       ,         (B.5)
with 0 < ζ < 1 being the share parameter of private capital and s = 1/(1−η)
being the elasticity of substitution between private and public capital with
−∞ < η ≤ 1.
   The ratio for wealth inequality in the steady state is then given by:

Using Equation B.8 for the denominator on the left-hand side and solving
for h, similar as in Appendix A.1, yields Equation (B.7).
    In the derivations, it is additionally used that from Equation (10) in the
steady state it follows that

    We next examine whether the Anti-Pasinetti and Anti-Anti-Pasinetti
regimes still can occur.

Proposition 9. Let η > 0. For capital-enhancing public investment that
does not augment factor prices, with the explicit production structure given
by Equations (B.4-B.5) the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case can occur for µ < 0.
For µ > 0, only the Anti-Pasinetti regime can occur.

    The limiting behavior as τ → 1 of wealth inequality is now a more com-
plicated combination in the space of the two elasticity parameters. We limit
the treatment here to a partial result with high substitution possibilities
between the two forms of capital. Proposition 9 is illustrated by Figure 5.

Proof. Let η > 0. Taking limits as τ → 1 in Equation (B.6) yields terms
                                                                         L µ

and given by Equation (B.7). It can be shown, by applying L’Hôpital’s rule,

    Setting µ = 0 in Equation (B.6), one finds the steady-state wealth dis-
tribution for the special case in which the upper level of the CES-nest is
Cobb-Douglas:

                Ke      αζ(2 + ρ w )                 δ P

    From this expression, one can readily deduce the following special case:

Proposition 10. With a nested CES production structure as assumed in
Equations (B.4) and (B.5) and µ = 0

    1. the Anti-Anti-Pasinetti case cannot occur.

    2. for every 1 ≥ η > 0 there exists a capital tax rate τlim from which on
       the economy switches from a Pasinetti to an Anti-Pasinetti state.

    In proving this proposition, we assume that Assumption 1 still holds,
i.e. that 0 < S/
               e K()
                  e   < 1 for  small, which is the case for the meaningful
parameter range and the second part is only meaningful if steady states exist
(see discussion in Footnote 15).

Proof. Part 1 can be inferred directly from Equation (B.6): since re, δK , δP ,
α, ζ, ρw are greater than zero, and 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1, the expression for S/  e K e is
always strictly positive and has a strictly positive limit.
    For Part 2, the idea of the proof is to show that S/
                                                      e K(τ
                                                         e ) is monotonically
increasing in τ , starting from a value lower than one and converging to
infinity for τ → 1. The proof proceeds in two steps:

    1. we show that limτ →1 S/ e ) = ∞.
                            e K(τ

    2. we show that S/ e ) is monotonically increasing in 0 ≤ τ < 1.
                    e K(τ

    Regarding the first step, we insert the explicit expression for re = ρc /(1 −
τ ) and expand the products in Equation (B.6). This yields the following
expression:

which implies that limτ →1 S/   e ) = ∞.

     Regarding the second step, it remains to show that S/ e K(τ

ically increasing for all τ ∈ (0, 1).
     Since we only consider η > 0, that is, the case of elasticities between
public and private capital greater than or equal to one, this is straightforward
to show: S/e K(τ
              e ) is the sum of the monotonically increasing functions 1/(1−
τ ), τ /(1 − τ )(1+η) and (τ /(1 − τ ))η , multiplied by positive constants. All
      η

these functions are monotonically increasing for η > 0. This implies that
the function S/e K(τ
                  e ) is monotonically increasing.
     Since we assume that 0 < S/   e K(0,
                                      e γ) < 1 and we showed that S/     e K(τ
                                                                            e )
is monotonically increasing in τ and limτ →1 S/      e ) = ∞, it follows from
                                                  e K(τ
the Intermediate Value Theorem that for a given 0 < η < 1, there exists a
τlim ∈ (0, 1), with S/
                    e K(τ
                       e lim ) = 1. For this τlim the Pasinetti regime changes
into an Anti-Pasinetti regime.


    Note that the case η < 0, that is substitution elasticity s < 1, is not
treated in Propositions 9 and 10. The reason is that one can show that for
small tax rates and µ = 0, capitalists vanish because the limit of S/K tends
to infinity as the tax rate approaches 0. This is not a surprising finding:
The assumption that private and public capital are highly complementary
implies that, for low taxes, the value of private capital is strongly diminished
and capitalists’ income is decreased. However, as this setting only considers
good substitutability between capital and labor, this increases wages and
explains how for low tax rates the Anti-Pasinetti case can reappear.

B.3     The case of perfect substitutability between private and
        public capital
Finally consider the special case of Proposition 10 of a perfect elasticity of
substitution between public and private capital, for which the value of the
Anti-Pasinetti tax rate can be calculated explicitly. Set ζ = 0.5 and η = 1
in Equation (B.13) and assume δK = δP = δ.

Proposition 11. For the case of a perfect elasticity of substitution between
public and private capital, there exists a capital tax rate τlim at which the
Pasinetti regime changes to the Anti-Pasinetti regime. For equal deprecia-

    Set δ = δk = δP , to obtain the expression in Proposition 11.


    Equation (B.14) permits to study the dependency of the critical tax rate
on parameters. For example, one finds that it increases monotonically in the
pure time preference rate of the capitalists, while it decreases monotonically
in the workers’ time preference rate (details available upon request).28
  28
     For the standard parametrization (see Section 6) the economically meaningful tax rate
at which the economy switches from a Pasinetti to an Anti-Pasinetti state is 54 %. The
sensitivity to changes in the capitalists’ time preference rate is much stronger than the
sensitivity to changes in the workers’ time preference rate.
C   CONVERGENCE TO STEADY STATE                                            45


C     Convergence to steady state
For the version of the model used in Section 4, it can be shown that a (unique
non-trivial) steady state exists whenever

                         ∂F             ρc
                            (K, J) =          + δk .                    (C.1)
                         ∂K          (1 − τ )

It is well-known that the CES function does not fulfill this condition for
all values of the elasticity. Here we use the parametrized version of our
model from Section 6 to verify that a steady state exists for almost the
entire range of the Pasinetti regime. Let again J(P, L) = Ptβ L(1−β) . Figure
6 shows that for various values of β around its empirically plausible value
of 0.2, the steady state to which the model converges exists for almost the
entire Pasinetti range. Here we additionally simulated the parametrized
version of Equation C.1. We checked that this finding holds for extensive
variation of the further parameters (details available upon request).
    Note that the steady state is saddle-point stable whenever it exists. This
is because the dynamical system given by Equations (2), (3), (9) and (10)
inherits the dynamics of the neoclassical growth model with public captial
(Heijdra, 2009). To see this, note that Equation (9) only adds to the stan-
dard dynamics that in Equations (2) and (3) the interest rate is lower than
if K c was the only private capital input. This implies that there are no
qualitative differences in the dynamics, only the steady-state value of K c
is smaller than the Keynes-Ramsey level of capital K (further details upon
request).

D   BURDEN SHIFTING IN TWO CLASS MODELS                                     47


D     Burden shifting in two class models
In this manuscript we focus on cases in which the government uses the
capital tax revenue for public investment, since this policy, under certain
conditions, constitutes a Pareto improvement. If the capital tax revenue
was instead used to finance lump-sum transfers to the workers, the burden
of the capital tax would be fully shifted to the workers (Stiglitz, 2016b). A
capital tax in a two-class model hence only redistributes without making
one class worse off if its proceeds are invested in public capital. In some
more detail, in prior work we have already established the following:

    • In a model with dynastically saving capitalists and life-cycle saving
      workers and tax revenue spent as transfers to workers, the burden of
      the capital tax is fully shifted to workers (Stiglitz, 2015d, 2017).

    • If in such a model the tax is instead a tax on capitalists return to
      capital only, i.e. it is an inheritance tax, and tax revenue is spent as
      transfers to workers, workers can benefit in absolute terms (Stiglitz,
      2015d).

    • If in such a model the capital tax on the return to capitalists only is
      invested in public capital, workers benefit in absolute terms (Stiglitz,
      2017). Mattauch et al. (2016) proves this is the case even if the tax
      on capital is also levied on workers’ returns, but only for specific pro-
      duction functions.

These results mostly hold for small tax rates only and they do not consider
that the capitalists might also benefit from public investment. Therefore, it
is still unclear – and the rationale for this manuscript – how wealth inequal-
ity evolves for all tax rates (up to the boundary) with public investment. It
was also not discussed in relative terms in most of these studies. Zampar-
elli (2017) shows the related result that in a two-agent Solow model with
endogenous growth dynamics, a tax on capital income benefits workers in
relative terms even without public investment.
     In this Appendix, we translate the formal arguments on burden shifting
that lead to the results just highlighted to the model used in this manuscript
(with endogenous savings). We briefly sketch the proof of full burden shifting
under a capital tax recycled as a lump-sum transfer and then outline why
it is not conclusive for public investment.

Proposition 12. If the capital tax revenue is redistributed lump-sum to the
workers, the burden of the capital tax is shifted to the workers.

    In the following proof we work with per capita variables only. Let kt =
Kt /L, f (kt ) = F (Kt , L)/L etc. as usual.

Proof. If the capital tax revenue were redistributed to the workers through
a lump-sum transfer λt , the workers young-period budget equation would
be given by:
                              wt + λt = st + cyt .                    (D.1)
     The lump-sum transfer would be given by

                                         λt = τ rt kt .                                   (D.2)

     The workers’ per capita saving would be given by
                                            1
                                  st =          (wt + λt ).                               (D.3)
                                         2 + ρw

    In the following we show that (∂s̃)/(∂τ ) < 0. We use Equation (D.2)
and the fact that without public investment and in per capita variables
wt = f (kt ) − fk (kt )kt . We use fk (k) as a shorthand for the first derivative
of f (k) with respect to k. Also, we only consider the change in steady-state
values, so the steady-state interest rate is still determined by Equation (15).

Applying the Implicit Function Theorem to Equation (15) yields: ρc /(1 −
τ )2 1/fkk (k̃) = ∂ k̃/∂τ . Hence, Equation (D.4) becomes:

    ∂s̃      1       ρc k̃         ρc τ (fk (k̃) − δk )                         
        =        −           +                           + (f k ( k̃) − δ k ) k̃

                                                                                   (D.5)

        =                            < 0,      since      fkk (k̃) < 0.
          2 + ρw (1 − τ )3 fkk (k̃)

The last equality follows because the first and third summand are equal,
applying several times Equations (13) and (15).


    The last expression in this derivation is analogous to Equation (1.11) in
(Stiglitz, 2015d).
D   BURDEN SHIFTING IN TWO CLASS MODELS                                                   49


    Furthermore, note that if the capital tax revenue is invested in public
capital, it is generally unclear if full burden shifting will occur, since the sign
of (∂ S̃)/(∂τ ) is ambiguous.29 A non-technical way of thinking about this
case would be to argue that public investment P follows a “Laffer curve”.
Therefore sign in Equation (D.7) below will be ambiguous. If the effect of
a tax increase on augmented labor-income is very high, as can be expected
for low tax rates, workers likely benefit from public investment in absolute
terms. This corroborates the messages of Figure 4 in the main part.
    To see this formally, note that for the case of labor-enhancing public
investment, the change in workers’ savings in the intensive form as in the
proof of Proposition 12 is no longer a meaningful indicator of the distribu-
tional impact of the policy. We hence have to look at the change in workers’
aggregate savings (∂ S̃)/(∂τ ).
                                              1
    Aggregate savings are given by St = 2+ρ     w
                                                  Jt wt . So the change in workers’
aggregate savings induced by capital tax-financed public investment in the
steady state is given by:

The second summand within the brackets
                                       is unambiguously negative, but

the first summand is positive in case ∂∂τJ is, in which case the sign may or
