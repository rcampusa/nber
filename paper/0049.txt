           An essential feature of schooling is not only that it occurs
    in a different site than most on—the—job training but also that
    it is more intensive. That is, a smaller proportion of gross
    potential earnings is sacrificed in on-the—job training than in
    schooling (see Mincer, 1974). In estimating human capital earnings
    functions it has generally been assumed that during schooling
    100% of gross potential earnings are invested in all years,
    while in on—the—job training this percentage is smaller and is a
    declining function of age. This assumption has been quite
    useful since it allows the identification of an estimate of the
    rate of return on schooling from a regression of earnings on
    years of schooling.
         This paper argues that the percentage of gross earnings
    invested may fall below 100% well before schooling is ended,
    that this percentage is likely to be correlated with years of
    schooling, and thus this procedure yields only a biased estimate
    of the rate of return to schooling.
         The rate of return is a central parameter in human capital
    analysis. The level of the rate of return is an index of the
    profitability of human capital investments (Becker, 1964), the
    relationship between the rate of return and the amount invested
    may indicate under certain conditions whether the educational
    process is "egalitarian" or "elitist" (Becker, 1967, p. 20).
           The internal rate of return is that discount rate which
    equates the present value of returns from an investment to the
    present value of its costs. The principle of comparing the
    discounted value Of a lifetime stream of net income with and
    without a marginal investment is simply stated but not so simply
    implemented.
           Since lifetime histories of incomes of a given individual
    have only recently become available, cross—section data on people
    of various ages have been used to approximate lifetime earnings
    of   an individual. To reduce sources of income variation other than
.   the schooling differential being studied such estimates were
                                   —2—
usually limited to a given sex, race, urban—rural and nativity
status (Becker, 1964, p. 79 and Hanoch).   Adjustments have been
made for the fact that business cycles have a greater effect on
cross—sectjonal than cohort earnings (Becker, 1964, p. 73), for
the sampling bias due to differential mortality experience, and
for the difference in before—tax and after—tax returns.
     In spite of these careful adjustments and controls there are
factors which cannot be controlled for which may bias the rate of
return calculations. Becker pointed out in his pathbreaking
work, Human Capital, that two of these factors are the correlation
between ability and education and the correlation between educa-
tion and other human capital. If those who invest more in
themselves are inherently more able, their earnings stream
without the investment is not adequately gauged by the earnings of
the person with a lower investment (and less ability). That is,
some of the return imputed to human capital investments is
actually a return to ability, and would have been received even
without the investment. Estimates of bias to the schooling
coefficient due to the omission of an ability measure, calculated
by Griliches and Mason (1972), Hause (1972) and Taubman and Wales
(1972) range from 3%     to 25%. Becker also pointed out that his
estimates of the rate    of return to schooling might be seriously
biased if the rate of    return to other investments differed from
the rate of return on    schooling and if these investments were
correlated.
     A less laborious method of estimating rates of return from
cross—section data by regressions was proposed by Becker and
Chiswick (1966). This method also made possible simple controls
for factors such as ability and other human capital investments.
Becker and Chiswick reformulated the analysis in a way that
allowed the rate of return to be estimated as a parameter in a
regression where earnings was the dependent variable and the
investment period was the independent variable. They let             be
the per cent of potential earnings that individual i invests
in year j   (0 <   K..   <   1).   Then, abstracting from depreciation,
                                  —3—
gross earnings in year t can be expressed as a function of
the initial stock of human capital, E the series of K1 and
the rate of return on these investments:


        Et E0 jl (1 + x r1)                               (1)


But since K. < 1 and r.. is small, this can be written:

        in Et =    in    +
                                   r1                     (2)
                             jl
        Now, assume either that all available time is invested in
schooling during the "schooling years," so that the costs are
the wages foregone or, alternatively, that part—time earnings
exactly offset direct schooling costs. Then K1 = 1 for all
and j. Assuming also that r is constant over individuals
and years of schooling, and that there is no post school invest-
ment,
        in Ejt =   in E0 + rs,                            (3)


where s 1S the number of investment years where K1 = 1.
     This formulation appears to allow the estimation of the
rate of return to schooling investments from the relationship
of a simple function of earnings and years of schooling. A
further advantage of this procedure is that it allows one to hold
constant in the estimating equation other forms of capital
accumulation, such as ability or post—school investment. The
literature which has grown up in these two areas has indeed
relied heavily on the semi-log functional form derived by Becker
and Chiswick.1
        Yet great care should be exercised in interpreting the
coefficient on years of schooling as a rate of return, because of
the difficulty in measuring K.  Biases resulting from a mis-
specified K, may as serious as those from omitting the ability variable.

1See, for example, Griliches and Mason (1972), John Hause (1972)
and Mincer (1974).

I.   Rates of Return, Intensity and Years of Schooling

     It is easy to show that even if     =   1   on average, unless
Kt is independent of 5, this procedure will lead to biased
estimates of r.2 Let    be the average percentage of gross
earnings invested in schooling and ht be the deviation from
this average for the ith individual in the tth investment year.

     Kit =   i+h.t
     t:i Kit =.   sk +     h.
        h.
Let h = ____ = the   average yearly deviation in per cent of

gross earnings invested per school year, for the ith individual's
schooling career. Then equation (3) can be rewritten:

     log Et = log E01 + rS.K + pS1h.

Now it is clear that if $h. and Si are correlated, even a
                                                                      .
knowledge of the average percentage invested (K) will not in
general allow one to identify r from a regression of log
earnings on years of schooling. One condition which allows
the identification of the rate of return from a regression of
income on years of schooling is a lack of variance in
                                                         Kit,
i.e., ht = 0 for all i and t and         =   r   for all i and j.3


2Chiswick (1974, pp. 2-13a) notes that some of the variance in
income may be due to the covariance of rK and S.
3B. Friedman has pointed out to me that a derivation of equa-
tion (3) by Mincer (1974, see pp. 9—11)       is not dependent
upon the assumption of the independence of h and S. However,
the Mincer proof requires that all individuals have identical
present values of earnings.



                                                                      .

     It has been amply demonstrated in the human capital litera-
ture that there is a relationship between earnings and years of
schooling. What interpretation can this relation be given?
It is neither the market rental on human capital, which plays an
important role in much of the theoretical analysis (e.g., Ben
Porath), nor is it a rate of return on investment costs since
years of schooling accurately reflect neither human capital
stocks nor investment costs. To clarify these issues, consider
two alternative ways of decomposing earnings of individual i
in year t, E. The approaches are the market rental and
rate of return calculations. In the market rental analysis
earnings are the scalar product of a vector H, of quantities of
various kinds of human capital possessed by an individual i
at time t, and the vector of markets rents, W, available on
these various kinds of capital.


     Et =
              jl                                       (4)



A perfectly competitive market for human capital services is
assumed and W does not vary across individuals.
     An alternative approach is to consider the relationship
between earnings and the cost of producing the stock of capital
which is rented in the market. Assume a production process
whereby a vector of inputs, I is transformed into a vector of
human capital outputs, H. The production process is characterized
by the matrix A which defines the linear transformation of input
vector I into the vector of human capital outputs H. The costs
per unit of input is given in the vector C.

          =   A

     E.t =                                             (6)
              k=l rtk Cik 'ik
                              —6—
rk is the rate of return over cost for each kind of capital
possessed by individual i.    Assume constant returns to scale       •
for all types of capital investnients so that marginal returns
equal average returns and assume also that returns are constant
over time. Since an optimizing individual would equate returns
on various types of capital at the margin, we can write
earnings as the product of a constant rate of return on the
various investments:

     Et =     1   kl Cjk I                              (7)


Thus r. can be defined as the individual's rate of return over
cost for his human capital investments:



     r =     N
                    H                                   (8)

            kl Cik 'ik

     The problem in estimating equation (3) above is that            •
years of schooling correspond most closely to a quantity of
inputs I, whereas     the rate of return calculation requires
the denominator of equation (8) of which I is only one part.
Years of schooling is equally inappropriate for estimating the
market rental of human capital, W, (as in Johnson, p. 551) since
the transformation of inputs into human capital outputs
described by(5) is ignored.
      Theory does not give a unique prediction of the relationship
 between years of schooling and intensity of investments per year.
 It is easy to show (see Ben Porath (1970)) that the proportion of




                                                                     .
                            —7—
resources (time and goods) that an individual allocates to
investnent decreases with time, after he passes the point where
the size of human capital stocks is so low as to act as a binding
constraint, forcing the use of less than optimal factor conthina-
tions.
     If individuals faced identical marginal productivity and
supply of funds schedules and they chose schooling attainment
randomly, we would then expect a negative correlation between
intensiveness and extensiveness of schooling investment. However,
individuals are not identical, and it seems likely that some of
the factors which affect the years of schooling, affect the
intensity of schooling in the same direction, leading to a posi-
tive correlation between the two.' First consider the supply
curve of funds which relates the cost of financing the investment
to the intensity of the investment process in a given year of
schooling.
     The supply curve drawn in Figure 1 as S reflects the
increasing cost per unit of financing increasing intensity of
investment per year of schooling. As Gary Becker has pointed
out (1967, p. 9) the funds "available to any person from
the cheaper sources are usually rationed since the total demand
for funds tends to exceed their supply."   Thus as increasing
amounts of funds are required within a given year, students
shift from gifts from relatives and grants from government or
schools (which usually are subject to a maximum amount per
school year), tosubsidized loans from government or universities
(also subject to a maximum aniount per year). Finally they may
turn to loans at commercial interest rates or to reduced
consumption.
'Several recent papers have taken the length of the period of
specialization as endogenous (Haley, Lillard, Wallance and Ihnen),
but most have taken the specialization period as coincident with
years of schooling. Haley is an exception. Haley considers the
case where the only input to investment is time, and he shows that
quantity and the proportion (K) of human capital stocks allocated
to producinq more human capital declines strictly monotonically,
after the period of specialization when K = 1 (p. 934).

                           Figure 1
     The interest rate required to finance schooling will
not only be a function of the intensity of schooling, but also
of the total number of years of schooling. Thus we can
conceive of a family of supply curves corresponding to years
of schooling as in Figure 1.
     For several reasons it is likely that the supply curve
of funds for early years of schooling lies below that for
later years. First, since K is defined as the proportion of
potential gross earnings invested, the dollar outlay corre-
sponding to any given value of K, rises with schooling,
which increases earnings. If the supply of funds is not com-
pletely elastic, the interest required to finance a given K
rises with previous schooling level. Secondly, since the
total amount invested is rising with S, the interest rate
should too.
     On the other hand, factors such as the greater availability
of fellowships for graduate students than undergraduates may
cause a reversal in the ordering of the supply curves at some
point.




                                                                          .
                            —9—
     Next consider the relationship between the return and
the intensity of investment of a marginal year of schooling.
This will determine the demand for schooling intensity for
one additional year. If employers looked only at years of
schooling then the return would be the same for all levels of
intensity as in curve AA in Figure 2. But assume that greater
time inputs are productive in producing human capital and that
this increase in human capital is rewarded in the market. The
observed marginal rate of return schedule for a year of schooling
will be greater for greater intensity of the investment.
     The number of units of capital produced by a person per
school year, h, is a function of time and goods inputs, as well
as ability.

                          Figure 2

Although additional resources invested imply
additions to the stock of human capital, because of the strict
limit on the amount of time available to an individual,
diminishing returns to producing additional capital will
eventually set in.
     Thus we can consider a family of demand curves for
different intensities of schooling which relate years of
schooling to marginal rates of return, as in Figure 3


5This is the interpretation one can give to a rental rate on
years of schooling, as in Johnson.

                          Figure 3

The supply of funds curves of Figure 1 can be aggregated for
given intensities of investment to form the family of supply
curves relating cost of funds to years of schooling. Then
those with intensity of investment I would get S years of
schooling and a rate of return (or borrowing cost) of r1, while
schooling intensity i would be associated with S and r.
                                                                     .
Now it is clearfrom Figure 3 that either positive or negative
correlation between S and J. is possible.


     Greater ability may be said to increase the marginal
productivity of any year of schooling at any given intensity.
Thus if all students faced the same supply curve of funds,
for an additional year of investment, we would expect more
able students to invest more intensively in a given year,




                                                                     .
                            — 11 —

as well as more extensively.6 On the supply side, too, more able
students may be able to invest more per year as well as more
years. More able students are more likely to obtain grants or low-
cost loans from their universities or from the government, and
students who score high on I.Q. tests, which measure the ability
to succeed in schoo], come from higher income families, on average,
than those who score poorly. To the extent that scholarships
free a student from working or subsidize tuition they may increase
the intensity of his investment in terms of time or goods, while
at the same time decreasing his expenditure on schooling.
     It is important to note that K need not equal unity during
schooling years. Taking account of other uses of time, such as
leisure, would lower the estimates of K even further.
Psychologists show that even during the time that students are
ostensibly learning, they may be diverting a considerable
proportion of their resources to non—investment uses. (See, for
example, Anderson.) These studies, using both experimental and
naturalistic classroom situations find that the percentage of
"time on task" (K) is positively related to the amount learned
(human capital developed).
     The direction of the bias in rate of return estimates made
by equations of the form of equation (3) is an empirical question
since there is no clear prediction about the sign of the correla-
tion between years of schooling and intensity. Bodies of data with
cost of schooling and information on earnings are rare, which is
one reason for the widespread use of equation (3) as an estimating
function. However, one body of data has been uncovered which
can provide an illustration of some of the points raised above.
This body of data referred to here as the Terman data, is
described in Part 1 of the following section. In the remainder of
the section the Terman data is used to estimate earnings functions
from cost data.

6This is true if ability has a nonneutral effect in increasing
the productivity of time in investment more than in other
endeavors. Haley suggests that ability might be negatively
correlated with intensity if it primarily affected initial stocks
of human capital, and therefore more able students could stop
specializing sooner.

II.   Earnings Functions Based on Cost of Investment
      A. The Terman Sample

     The Terman sample consists of persons whose measured I.Q.
fell within the top one per cent of the I.Q. distribution
when they were tested as children in 1921—22. This sample
of 1,528 persons with I.Q.'s of 135 and above was originally
selected from the population of California school children
by Lewis M. Terinan, a Stanford University psychologist.
Data on the earnings and schooling of these high ability
individuals was updated by resurveys in 1929, 1940, 1950,
and 1960.
     In the 1940 questionnaire the Terman sample members were
asked to supply the name of the college they attended, the
amount of scholarships and assistantships they had received and
their total earnings as undergraduates. We developed a
tuition series for six different colleges named for the years
1921 to 1940. Of the individuals who reported cost data
95 per cent attended the six colleges for which tuition data
were obtained. Cost data was supplied by 85 per cent of the
sample members who attended college. Using data on age at
high school graduation and age at receipt of B.A., we developed
an estimate for each individual of the direct costs of his
undergraduate schooling. Net indirect costs were estimated by
using the data on scholarships, assistantships and earnings.
Opportunity costs were estimated to be $1092 per year in
1927 dollars. This figure was arrived at by using data from
Terman (III, pp. 137-138) which showed that average weekly
compensation for full-time jobs in 1927 was $21 for male
college students in the Terman sample and $22 for men in the

exceeded this estimate of opportunity costs, actual earnings
were used as the measure of full—time earnings capacity. All
figures were put in constant (1947) dollars, the total cost
of schooling was calculated as:

Total Cost =    Tuition   + Opportunity Cost —   Total   Scholarships
            —   Total   Assistantships —   Earnings.
Then K =      Total Cost
           Opportunity Cost
Table 1 presents mean values for the entire sample of the cost
components of undergraduate schooling as well as for K. For the
entire sample with complete cost data K = .75. Table 1 indicates
that the per cent of potential earnings per year invested in
schooling increased with final schooling level attained.8 For
persons with less than a B.A. in 1940, the annual per cent of gross
earnings potential invested in schooling, K = .55, for those with a
B.A. in 1940, who had not increased their schooling level by 1950,
K = .84, while those who earned advanced degrees after 1940
invested 101 per cent of gross annual earnings in their under-
graduate schooling.' Thus, only the group who went on to graduate
studies spent 100% of gross potential earnings in investment during
their undergraduate years. Unfortunately, because graduate and
undergraduate scholarships and assistantships awarded up to 1940
were not segregated in the data, it is not possible to calculate K
for persons with graduate training before 1940. Table 1 also
suggests that those who completed a higher level of schooling
diverted less of their available time to the labor market during
their schooling years. They earned less income, indicating either
that they spent less time in. the labor market or that they had lower

8The anomalous result that those who did not complete their
schooling until after 1940 had greater annual investments in
undergraduate training than those who already had some graduate
work by 1940, may be due to a cohort effect, since the former
group is likely to be younger and have started to school in
slightly better times.
       estimates    are similar to those computed by Wachtel.

wages.   If the drop outs faced higher wages, this alone could
explain their lower level of completed schooling. The sample were
all of high ability, but those with high earnings potential as
undergraduates would have found schooling a relatively unprofitable
investment, due to their greater opportunity costs. However, it is
likely that high opportunity costs drawing students out of school
does not explain the situation entirely. Since students who com-
pleted more years of schooling invested more money per year in
tuition, it is likely that they invested more time as well.

     B. Earnings as a Function of Years and Cost
        of Schooling
     For the subsample of individuals on whom cost data are avail-
able, we first estimate the relationship between earnings and years
of schooling, in order to have a baseline with which to compare
earnings functions based on costs.10 The methodology is to combine
income data from the three dates for all males on whom we had
cost and income data to estimate a lifetime earning function. For
this group each additional year of college increases wages by
6.9 per cent, while each year of graduate schooling (obtained
after 1940) increases income by 4.7 per cent. (See Col. 1, Table 2.)
     If we were to assume that years and intensity of schooling
were uncorrelated, we could derive an estimate of the rate of
return to schooling by dividing the schooling coefficient in equa-
tion (1) by .75, the average value of K.'' That estimate of the
rate of return is 9.2 per cent. However, since we know years of
schooling and K are positively correlated, this is an over-
estimate, as shown above.


'0A subsample of 306 individuals who had no more than 16 years
of schooling in 1940 was used.   Some had obtained graduate
schooling by 1950 and 1960.
''This kind of reasoning has been applied, for example, by
Salmon, The Definition and Impact of College Quality, NBER
Working Paper #7, pp. 28—29. Chiswick (1972, pp. 3—15) applies
a similar procedure.

     The availability of cost data allows a direct estimate
of r. In column 2 of Table 2, the results of regressing
              S
earnings on      KLj.
                      are presented. The estimated rate of
                   J
             j=l
return of 6.5 per cent, is surprisingly close to the estimate
derived from equation (1) with the assumption that K = 1.
This occurs because of two offsetting biases. The coefficient
on years of schooling in equation (1) is biased downward
because no account is taken of the fact that K < 1., while
ignoring the positive correlation between K and S imparts
an upward bias to the coefficient. Note also that the estimated
rate of return on graduate schooling also rises in magnitude
and significance, since those who invested more in their
undergraduate schooling were more likely to obtain graduate
schooling. Without accounting for the greater K of these people
the rate of return to college was biased upward, and consequently,
the rate of return to graduate schooling was biased downward.
     Since a B.A. is a prerequisite to most graduate programs,
this suggests that more intensive undergraduate work may
provide its return by allowing entrance to a graduate program.
The coefficients in Regression #2 should not be taken to mean
that the rate of return to graduate school is twice as great as
the rate of return to undergraduate schooling, for reasoning as
we did above, the coefficient on years of graduate school cannot
be interpreted as a rate of return. And, if the intensity and
years of graduate schooling are positively correlated, the
coefficient of equation (2) is an overestimate of the rate of
return.
     Since data are available, it seems worthwhile to determine
the relationship between earnings and the various components
of average K——tuition, fellowships, foregone earnings, etc.

We can also allow different contributions from different
components of K,'2 as in Regression #3.
     The hypotheses about the signs of these variables depend
on their effects on the amount of human capital acquired per
school year. Because it is assumed that greater yearly tuition
will correspond to greater school inputs per academic year,
the partial effect of tuition is expected to be positive.'3
The per cent of opportunity cost covered by earnings is a proxy
f or the amount of time allocated to non—academic uses per school
year. Thus undergraduate earnings should be negatively related
to human capital acquired, and thus to future income. However,
undergraduate earnings may be a measure of market ability, and
therefore positively related to future earnings. Assistantships
usually require working in the university, and therefore
allocating time away from studies, and are expected to be
negatively related to future earnings. However, since the most
able students are the recipients of assistantships, the
coefficient in the regression may be biased toward zero.

'2This approach has also been taken by Wachtel (1973, p. 5a).
'31f tuition is related positively to parental wealth, and not at
 all to the quantity of school inputs purchased, its expected
 sign would still be positive. In this context, the two hypotheses
 cannot be differentiated.
                            — 18 —

Scholarships holders, like recipients of assistantships, should
be an exceptionally able group.   However, since scholarships do
not usually require taking a unIversity job, their net effect on
later earnings should be positive.
     In column 3 of Table 2 we see that although all the com-
ponents of schooling intensity have the expected signs only
years and tuition intensity have significant effects on later
earnings.   Although scholarship holders had higher earnings
than assistantship holders, or those with jobs, these differences
are not significant. We can infer, at least for the very able,
that a little hard work never hurt anybody (in terms of future
earnings) Column 4 presents the significant variables only,
and indicates that the inàrease in earnings from an additional
year of schooling at the average tuition intensity (.15) is
about 3.7 per cent. Further, there is evidence here for
decreasing marginal productivity of schooling within a given
year, because increasing school years by 1/10 of a year, while
maintaining total tuition expenditures will increase annual
earnings by 0.3 per cent, while increasing tuition expenditures
by the opportunity cost of 1/10 of a year of schooling, while
keeping school years constant will add only 0.2 per cent to
annual earnings.

III.   Ability, Intensity and Earnings

     Ability is a major factor shifting the marginal produc-
tivity and marginal cost curves for intensity and years of
schooling. To see how high ability affects the market rental
on equivalent years of schooling, earnings of the high ability
males from the Terman sample are compared with earnings of
males reported in the U.S. Census in this section,.

       Ratios of mean income earned by Terman sample members
and by males reporting income in the 1940, 1950, and 1960
Census are reported in Table 3. The data for the Terman
sample were collected from questionnaires administered in 1940,
1950, and 1960 and the data for the three years are defined
as follows:

1940: Monthly wage and salary income, times 12, for
       sample members who were employed full time;
1950: Annual employment income in 1949 for sample
       members employed full time;
1960: Annual employment income in 1959 for sample
       members employed full time.

     The income data are presented in Appendix Table A, along
with Census data for comparison.   Ratios of the incomes of
Terman subjects to incomes of Census respondents are presented
in Table 3.
       In all Census years for all education and age groups, average
incomes of the Terman sample exceeded the mean incomes of the
population at large. Where comparisons are possible of similar
age—education groups in 1940, 1950, and 1960, no marked trends
are discernible. That is, the ratio by which Terman incomes
exceed   Census incomes for individuals of a given age and
education does not rise or fall in a systematic way between
1940 and 1960.


                                                                       .

     However, if a given cohort is followed through the three
Census years, the percentage by which their income exceeds
Census income shows a pronounced downward trend. (There are
decreases in 16 or 18 cases.) The null hypothesis that there
is no trend in the ratios (i.e., the probability of decrease
= .5) can be rejected at the .001 level of significance.
Unusually high ratios in 1940 may be due to a sampling bias in
the 1940 Census, since earnings were reported only for persons
with no more than $50 of other income. Because of this
restriction many persons with high earnings may have been
excluded, leading to a downward bias in the earnings data
reported by the Census. However, since the comparisons in 1940
cover primarily the early years of the life-cycle, the Census
sample may not be overly biased. Earnings of the Terman
sample may also have been overestimated due to the assumption
that sample members worked a full year. However, the trend in
income ratios over time is not solely an artifact created by
data deficiencies, since the ratios of Terman to Census incomes
also falls between 1950 and 1960. Furthermore, there is a
decrease in the ratio with age within education groups in a
given year in 18 of 22 cases.  (The probability of obtaining
this result when p = .5 is .002.)

     The finding that both over tiite and within a given year,
relative earnings of high ability males fall with age is
surprising and contrasts with the findings for relative earnings
over the life cycle for persons who differ in the amounts they
possess of another kind of human capital—-years of schooling.
Mincer finds (1973, p. 70)       that relative wages of the more
schooled increase with age, although experience—income profiles
are nearly parallel for log of weekly earnings and tend to
converge for log of annual earnings. Using equation (2)to
compare earnings of groups m and n with different initial
endowments of ability, E0, but the same number of years of
schooling, we can write:


     in (--)      = (In   E0 -    in E0)                          (5)
             nj

     +   r        (Ktm-Kt) +     rt          tmtm     —
                                                           (Ktn6tn)
                                      t=L1

     +ln(1Kjm)_ln(l_Kjn).
Schooling investments, which occur until time 5, have been
separated from post—school investments. Net post—school invest-
ments (over depreciation) earn a return of r, while the return
on schooling investments is r5.
     Since the difference between the initial endowments the
schooling investments of the two groups remain constant over time,
the only source of variation in their relative incomes over the
life cycle is in the term, (Kt— )            reflecting   post—school
investments and depreciation.
     In this model post—school investments are financed by lower
net (observed) earnings. Thus the less steeply rising earnings
profile of the Terman group implies that vis a vis the Census
group either their post—school investments are a smaller propor-
tion of gross potential earnings (although the value of these
investments may be greater than those of the Census group) or that
the depreciation on their human capital is greater.

     Mincer concludes (1973, Chapter 2) that persons with more
human capital in the form of years of schooling, also have
greater money expenditures for post—school investments. But he
finds a zero or negative correlation between time spent in
schooling and in, post—school investments. The Census and Terman
earnings profiles converge even more rapidly than those of
various schooling groups. There are three possible explanations
of this convergence:

     1. Percentage of gross earnings invested in post—
         school investment is lower for the Terman group.
         It must be recalled that the Terman group, which
         was selected because of its high I.Q. scores is
         being compared with a group with equivalent years
         of schooling.   The one thing I.Q. scores predict
         best is ability to succeed (i.e., acquire human
         capital) in school. Thus the "ability"
         criterion may be defined in such a way is to have
         a nonneutral effect on productivity in producing
         human capital in school and on the job. High.
         I.Q. persons may invest more intensively during
         schoolyears, because they are relatively
        efficient at acquiring capital through schooling,
        while others invest more intensively on—the-job.
     2. A more rapid rate of depreciation among the very
         able is another possible source of their slower
         rate of increase in net earnings. The pattern
         of decline of human capital for various levels
        of ability is not immediately known. However, not
        all the differential in earnings between average
         and high ability people is attributable to ability.


'Mincer and Polachek find that more educated females' human
capital depreciates at a higher rate when the woman is out of
the labor force.

                                                                   .

         The Terxnan sample members, had family characteristics
         which are known to be associated with higher earnings.
         For example, they had parents with nearly four more
         years of schooling than the average of their cohort
         and higher family income. These background variables
         may affect initial earnings to a greater extent than
         later earnings. In the Terman sample (Leibowitz,
         1974) the positive impact of family income on earnings
         decreases over time. Thus the shrinking differential
         between high and average ability persons may be due to
         the falling value of family contacts.
     3. Although men with the same numbers of years of
         schooling and continuous labor force experience should
         have the same number of years of labor force experience,
         this may not be the case in this sample. Because
         Terman sample members showed high I.Q. 's while still
         in grade school, many were accelerated in their
         schooling. Nearly half (49.3%) of the sample graduated
         from high school before age 17 and the mean age at
         college graduation was 21.5,15 whereas the mean age for
         all college graduates was calculated as 24 by Hanoch.

     Because of the greater intensity of their early schooling,
Terman sample members have approximately two more years of
market experience for any given schooling level.   This would
mean that the earnings function of Terman subjects diagrammed
in Figure 4 should be shifted to the left to compare with
persons of equivalent experience from the Census. When incomes
are again computed, we see that the ratios decline less steeply
over time and with age. (See Panel 2, Table 3.)   (Unfortunately,
the shift caused some of the cells to have too few observations


15Terman, Vol. IV, pp. 264-69. This was also the modal and
median value (my calculation).
                            — 25 —

to be reliable.) Using "experience adjusted" comparisons, the         S
proportion of declines from one Census year to the next remains
significantly different from .5 at the one per cent level, but
the fraction of declines within age groups is only significantly
different from one half at the 22 per cent level.
     Before correcting for their accelerated schooling, the high
ability sample earned from 10 per cent to 280 per cent more than
persons with average ability and the same age and sbhooling.
Much of the difference on lifetime earning patterns disappears
when the data are adjusted to account for the greater intensity
of early schooling of the high ability sample. The much
greater earnings of high ability males shown in this sample for
given schooling levels contrasts with rather modest effect of
ability on earnings found by Griliches, Hause, and Taubman. Given
the very high I.Q. level in the Terman sample, this may imply a
strongly nonlinear effect of ability on earnings.16
     Some of the differential between earnings of the high ability
sample and those of average ability may be due to correlation of
ability, with other factors such as higher quality of schooling or
higher family incomes. It is not possible to test these alterna-
tives given the lack of a detailed longitudinal data for persons of
average ability comparable to the Terman study.
     However, one of the causes of differences in the rates of
change of income does appear to be related to different ages of
labor force entry in the two samples, caused by accelerated
schooling of the more able. 'fliereas comparisons of earnings among
individuals with differing amounts of schooling should properly
be adjusted for years of market experience,17 comparisons among
individuals differing in ability should not. One of the major
routes for collecting the return to high ability would appear to be
early entry to the labor force, since earnings jn the early years
of the life cycle have a substantial weight in the calculation

''This implication was suggested to me by Gary Becker.

of   present value of income streams.

IV. Suirunary

      The purpose of the present paper has been to argue that
years spent in school do not adequately characterize the
inputs or the outputs of the process of investing in human
capital. In particular, we have demonstrated that the rate
of return on schooling investments cannot be identified from
the linear regression of log incomes on years of schooling,
even given the knowledge of the average ratio of expenditures
to full-time earnings. Empirically, we have shown that this
ratio, K, is positively related to years of schooling, and
that consequently rates of return which do not account for
this correlation are biased upward. Lastly we have shown that
greater intensity of schooling investments may allow high
ability students to enter the labor force earlier than their
peers of average ability, and that the consequent increase
in discounted value of lifetime earnings may be a major way
of collecting the returns to high ability.
