We present the results of a novel early childhood intervention in which disadvantaged 3-4-year-
old children were randomized to receive a new preschool and parent education program focused
on cognitive and non-cognitive skills (CogX) or to a control group that did not receive preschool
education. In addition to a typical academic year (9 month) program, we also evaluated a
shortened summer version of the program (2 months) in which children were treated immediately
prior to the start of Kindergarten. Both programs, including the shortened version, significantly
improved cognitive test scores by about one quarter of a standard deviation relative to the control
group at the end of the year. The shortened version of the program was equally as effective as the
academic- year program because most of the gains in the academic-year program occurred within
the first few months.

1. Introduction

       Early life conditions have profound effects later in life. Intervening in early childhood may

thus be an important way to reduce economic disparities between high- and low-income children

and reduce the academic achievement gap. Despite a growing literature on the early determinants

of human capital development, little is known about the most cost-effective ways to intervene

(Currie and Almond, 2011). Since the majority of children in the U.S. and other high-income

nations spend a large part of their time in care outside the home (Blau and Currie, 2006), one point

of intervention is to target children directly through high-quality preschool programs. Parental

inputs also play a major role in intergenerational inequality (Becker and Tomes, 1979); therefore,

a second and potentially very important point of intervention is to target parents through parenting

interventions (see, e.g., List, Samek, and Suskind, 2018).

       Research has also called for interventions that focus on both cognitive and non-cognitive

(or executive function) skills. Cognitive skills – as measured by academic achievement in reading,

writing, and math – are important for Kindergarten readiness and future success in school. Non-

cognitive skills – which involve motivation, perseverance, and self-control – are also thought to

affect all aspects of academic achievement and future labor market outcomes (Heckman, Stixrud,

and Urzua, 2006; Cunha and Heckman, 2008). Yet, the majority of studies investigating the impact

of preschool have focused on cognitive skills. And the existing literature on non-cognitive skills

mostly highlights the correlation between non-cognitive skills and life outcomes, but there is little

evidence that non-cognitive skills can be affected through interventions (Fryer, Levitt, and List,

2015 is one counterexample).

       Our contribution in this study is the development and evaluation of Cog-X, a novel early

childhood preschool and parenting intervention that we created to focus on enhancement of




                                                 2
cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Underlying Cog-X is a rigorous curriculum that focuses on

math, literacy, self-regulation, and socio-emotional learning. Cog-X integrates reading, math,

social studies, science, and socio-emotional activities throughout the day. It also puts a strong

emphasis on parental involvement, primarily through bi-weekly Parent Empowerment workshops.

During Parent Empowerment, parents attend a group parent class to learn from their own child’s

teacher how to scaffold the child’s learning through activities in the home.

        We evaluated Cog-X as part of a larger set of interventions called the Chicago Heights

Early Childhood Center (CHECC). We randomized nearly 600 3-4-year-old children in Chicago

Heights, Illinois and the surrounding area to an academic-year (9 month) Cog-X program (which

we call Preschool), a shortened summer (2 months) version of the Cog-X program (which we call

Kinderprep), or to a control group that did not receive any intervention from us. The program was

implemented in a school district with a high poverty rate. This was also a high-minority school

district.

        The programs significantly improved cognitive test scores by about one quarter of a

standard deviation relative to the control group at the end of the year. Most of the gains in the

academic-year program were concentrated among children who started out with below median test

scores. In addition, the gains largely occurred within the first 4 months, and the shortened version

of the program was equally as effective as the academic-year program. We also observed small

and insignificant gains in non-cognitive skills. The difficulty in moving non-cognitive skills

highlights an important methodological point: if non-cognitive skills are difficult to move, then

discussions of the importance of non-cognitive skills on life outcomes may not be as actionable

for improving outcomes.

        The remainder of our paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a background.




                                                 3
Section 3 describes the Cog-X program and data collected. Section 4 summarizes the results.

Section 5 discusses several robustness tests of the main results. Section 6 provides a discussion

and concludes.



2. Background

        There is a well-documented gap in academic achievement between low-income, minority

students and their higher-income counterparts. List, Pernadaut, and Suskind (2020) provide

several cuts of data that lend insights into the underpinnings for such outcome disparities. Their

analysis shows that the cycle starts with parental beliefs in that there are key differences in parental

beliefs across SES families. For example, low-SES parents largely believe their children;s

trajectory is immutable, whereas high-SES parents believe their investments matter for their

children’s outcomes. List, Pernadaut, and Suskind (2020) show that the belief disparities map onto

parental inputs and ultimately child outcomes. This reasoning suggests that interventions in the

early years involving both parents and children may be the key to long-term success. For instance,

Kindergarten readiness is an important predictor of long-term academic success (Duncan et al.,

2007). Our work joins an important academic and policy debate about the best ways to intervene

at this critical age using both parental and child interventions.

        Our basic framework assumes the following education production function: A=f(S,P,C),

where A represents academic achievement, S is schooling inputs, P is parental inputs, and C is a

variable representing the student’s ability and initial level of learning prior to entry into the

preschool. The Cog-X program directly affects A through increases in schooling inputs S and

parental inputs P through its focus on preschool and parent education. Education production is a

dynamic process such that early investments lead to increased productivity of later investments




                                                   4
through increases in child ability C. Therefore, early interventions are key for generating improved

educational outcomes. As noted by Currie and Almond (2011) as well as Heckman (2000),

characteristics measured before age 5 have a pronounced impact on long-term outcomes. However,

the shape of the education production function (i.e., when and for how long within the preschool

years to invest) is less clear.

         Our paper joins several landmark RCTs in early childhood education. The

Perry/HighScope Preschool Project1 and the Carolina Abecedarian Project2 in the 1960s-70s each

randomized ~100 children to either preschool with home visitation or a control group. These

studies found that children randomized to preschool significantly outperformed children in the

control group on school achievement tests and had significantly higher levels of educational

attainment (Schweinhart et al., 2005; Heckman et al., 2010; Campbell et al., 2002). These studies

were small and samples were relatively homogeneous (e.g., Perry and Abecedarian included 99

students, 98% of whom were black students from very disadvantaged backgrounds). By contrast,

our preschool program recruited an ethnically diverse population from Chicago Heights, Illinois

and surrounding areas.

         Most early education programs have been evaluated based on their short-term impact on

academic test scores.3 Yet researchers argue that much of the gains of early childhood education

appear in the form of improved non-cognitive skills later in life, which lead to improved related

outcomes such as lower incarceration rates and better health (Heckman, 2000). One key

  One exception is evaluations of Tools of the Mind, a curriculum aimed at improving executive functioning skills
(Bodrova and Leong, 2006). Tools of the Mind was found to reduce problem behaviors relative to an existing
curriculum in one small study (Barnett et al., 2008), yet another study across several school districts found no impact
of Tools of the Mind relative to an existing curriculum on executive functions – gains were similar in both groups
(Wilson and Farran, 2012). We are also in the process of evaluating the impact of Tools of the Mind with a separate
sample of children from our programs.




                                                          5
contribution of our work is to investigate whether we can evaluate short-term improvements in

non-cognitive skills using tests that we administer. Such an analysis would allow us to directly

link improvements in these skills to the potential of future, long-term improvements in related

outcomes.

        This project is also related to literature on improving parental investment in children. Fryer

et al. (2015) used a different sample of CHECC children to investigate parenting programs with

incentives.4 The authors found large and statistically significant positive impacts on cognitive and

non-cognitive test scores of Hispanics and whites, but no impact on Blacks. Additional

interventions that have included incentivizing parents include Opportunity NYC (Riccio et al.,

2013; Fryer, 2011) and Fryer, Devi, and Holden’s field experiment in Houston public schools

(Fryer, Devi, and Holden, 2012).

        Intervening on one dimension of the education production function (e.g., schooling, S) may

not have a straightforward effect on academic achievement A due to potential complementarities

between S and P. If S and P are strategic substitutes, for example, it is possible that increasing S

causes parents to decrease P. Therefore, programs that focus only on schooling inputs may cause

a reduction in parental investment, limiting the overall impact on child academic achievement. Of

course, the opposite may also be true – parents could increase their effort in response to an increase

in S. To reduce the probability that parents respond to our preschool intervention by reducing their

own effort, the Cog-X program intervenes on both S and P simultaneously. However, we cannot

credibly identify the separate impact of increasing S versus P due to this design choice.

        Finally, our research is related to a literature on student learning throughout the year. This

research finds that students, especially students from disadvantaged backgrounds, tend to lose


4
  The programs reported on in Fryer, Levitt, and List (2015) come from the same CHECC program but use a
different sample of children who attended different CHECC interventions in prior years.




                                                      6
knowledge and skills over the summer break (Downey, Von Hippel, and Broh, 2004; Cooper et

al., 1996).5 We were motivated by this research to design the Kinderprep program to occur during

the critical summer months where “summer loss” might commonly take place. We are also the

first to consider how learning proceeds throughout an academic year by considering the impact of

our program during both the mid-year (January) evaluation period and the end-year (May)

evaluation period.



3. Experimental Design and Implementation

3.1 Procedures

         Our experiments were conducted at the Chicago Heights Early Childhood Center (CHECC)

in 2012-2014. We founded CHECC in 2010 in Chicago Heights, Illinois in partnership with

Chicago Heights School District 170 (thereafter, SD170). Chicago Heights, IL is a low-income

suburb of Chicago, IL with a per capita income of just over $19,000 and a 29% poverty rate.6 The

Chicago Heights, IL population is 42% Black, 34% Hispanic, and 38% Caucasian. The high school

graduation rate in the area is 47%. This economic and demographic make-up is similar to urban

inner-city schools.7

         The implementation of CHECC included securing space for the programs and hiring staff

– we hired a preschool teacher and an assistant for each classroom for a total of 20 instructional




5
  There are few rigorous studies on variation in school calendars, and many programs have been evaluated using non-
experimental methods (e.g., Saam and Nowak, 2005; Larson, 2003; Gullo, 2000; Koopmans, 1991). Of the few studies
of school year duration that use experimental methods, many have not been able to utilize a comparable control group
(for a review of this literature, see Cooper et al., 2003; Aronson, Zimmerman, and Carlos, 1998; Patall et al., 2010).

staff members.8 To support recruiting efforts, we ran a local marketing campaign each year, which

included direct mailings, automated phone calls to families with children enrolled in the district,

and information booths at community events in and around the district. We also distributed

program information through district leadership staff in SD170 and surrounding districts and

encouraged administrative assistants at schools to collect and submit registration forms to us.

        All children ages 3-4.99 (as measured on September 1 of any year9) were eligible to sign

up for our program, regardless of socio-economic status. Children were eligible for the program if

they lived within SD170 or outside of it. The only children who were excluded were those who

had been identified by the district or by our staff as requiring special education, since we did not

have the capability to serve these students in our program.

        Parents registered their child(ren) for the program by completing a registration form,

signing a consent form, and participating in a pre-assessment in the summer prior to the start of

each academic year. The pre-assessment consisted of an hour-long battery of cognitive and non-

cognitive tests that each child completed one-on-one with an experimenter. While they waited,

parents completed a detailed survey about their child and household.

        We have an agreement with SD170 to continue tracking the academic progress of children

who ultimately attended SD170. Hence, as described later, we have follow-up data on a sub-sample

of children in Kindergarten through second grade on academic test scores, disciplinary referrals,

and assessments.

  All preschool teachers had at least a Bachelor’s degree and 04 EC teaching certification. Teaching assistants had a
paraprofessional certification. In Year 4, instructional staff decreased to 10 since the Preschool program was only
administered in one building.

  All children were required to start Kindergarten if they were at least 5 years old on September 1 of any year.

3.2 Experimental Design

       Households were randomized to one of two treatments or to a control group, as summarized

in Table 1. In the Preschool program, children were offered a half-day (morning) of instruction

with an optional free afternoon daycare. This amounts to 486 total hours of instruction during the

academic year. The Preschool used the Cog-X curriculum, which we developed with a focus on

math, literacy, self-regulation, and socio-emotional learning. Cog-X integrates reading, math,

social studies, science, and socio-emotional activities throughout the day. Appendix A provides

more detail on the curriculum.

                                          [Table 1 Here]

       Cog-X also puts a strong emphasis on parental involvement, primarily through bi-weekly

Parent Empowerment workshops. During Parent Empowerment, parents attend a group parent

class to learn from their own child’s teacher how to scaffold the child’s learning through activities

in the home. Parents whose children were randomized to the Preschool program received 21 parent

contact hours during the group classes.

       In the Kinderprep program, we used the same Cog-X curriculum, but children attended a

half-day (morning) instruction with no option for free daycare, which constitutes 115 hours of

instruction. Parents of children randomized to Kinderprep received 6-7 parent contact hours during

the group classes.

       Parents in Preschool and parents in Kinderprep received $50 for attendance at each session

($25 if they arrived late). Payment was made via debit cards that could be utilized at any merchant

where credit cards are accepted. Households randomized to the control group did not receive any

educational interventions from us, but did receive incentives for participating in assessments, as

described below.




                                                 9
       The randomization was conducted at two points in time each year. During the summer prior

to each year of our study, we randomized entrants to either Preschool, Kinderprep, or the control

group (we call this the “main” randomization). Since Kinderprep occurs nearly one year after the

initial randomization, we also conducted a second randomization in the spring (we call this the

“late” randomization). We allowed eligible households who missed the initial deadline to continue

registering for the program until the following spring, and then randomized entrants to either

Kinderprep or the control group.

       Our main randomization followed a blocked approach. In each randomization, we created

matched groupings of children based on gender, race (white, Hispanic, or Black), and age (within

½ year intervals). Then, we randomly assigned each child in the grouping to a treatment or control

group. This means that some children who registered were not placed into the randomization

(because a matched grouping could not be created for them). We constrain our analysis to the

matched groupings, but provide robustness checks using the full sample in Appendix B.

       Our main outcome measures are a battery of assessments administered at the beginning

(June/July), middle (January/February), and end of each academic year (May/June), as well as at

the end of the summer (August). Students who attended a school within SD170 in later years also

completed the assessments at the end of Kindergarten, 1st grade, and 2nd grade (April-May each

year). Each assessment was administered by a team of assessors who all held at least a Bachelor’s

degree, received training specific to the assessment, and were blind to the child’s treatment.

Children were assessed by either being brought to the school by their parents (who received an

incentive between $25 and $100 for attendance, depending on the assessment), or by being pulled

out of class if they were attending the school during that time. The assessment took about 1 hour.

       The assessments include cognitive and non-cognitive components and are summarized in




                                                10
Table 2. For the cognitive component, we used a series of nationally normed tests focused on

reading, writing, and mathematics and that can be administered to children as young as age 2,

including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) (Dunn et al., 1965) and the Woodcock-

Johnson III Test of Achievement (Woodcock et al., 2003). For the non-cognitive component, we

used a combination of tests of executive functions, including working memory, inhibitory control,

and attention shifting, developed by Blair and Willoughby (Blair and Willoughby, 2006a, 2006b,

2006c) and a questionnaire completed by the assessor focused on attention and emotion (Smith-

Donald et al., 2007). For our main analysis, we create a cognitive index made up of averaged

percentile scores on each cognitive construct and a non-cognitive index made up of averaged

percent correct scores (or points earned in the case of PPVT) on each non-cognitive construct

(equal weights) which are then converted to standard deviation units for our sample (see Appendix

A).

                                           [Table 2 Here]


       Our assessment data is complemented with Kindergarten readiness tests administered by

SD170 to all students in the district at the beginning of the Kindergarten year. These tests are a

useful robustness check since they involve all students in the district; hence, unlike our assessments

which sometimes rely on parental involvement, we do not have a selection problem. They are also

useful because they are administered independently by the district and test skills that the district

considers important for Kindergarten readiness, including math, literacy, and social-emotional

learning. However, these tests only include the sub-sample of children attending SD170 since we

did not have similar data-sharing agreements with other districts.

       A difficulty with experiments such as ours is keeping the control group engaged with

assessments and continuing in the study. We used a number of innovative strategies to encourage




                                                 11
control group participation. First, we referred to the control group as the “Family Group” rather

than the “control group” to increase the appeal of being in this group. Second, this group received

3 family parties for the family each year, including free food and small gifts for the children.10

Differential attrition between treatment and control groups is discussed further in Section 5.



4. Results

4.1 Summary of Sample

         621 children participated in the randomization and were matched across both years of the

experiment. Table 3 provides information about the number of children randomized to the

program, by treatment group.11

                                                 [Table 3 Here]

         The average age of children entering the study was 3.3 years old (s.d.=1.4). Children were

50% female, 44% Hispanic, 48% Black, and 9% white. The average combined cognitive ability

score was the 34.9 percentile (s.d.=23.6 percentiles), showing that many of these children were

performing below average for their age.

         Tables 4 and 5 provide balance checks for each analysis sample, including for each sample

that data is available, where the pre-assessment sample is equivalent to the randomization sample

(Appendix Tables B1 and B2 do the same for follow-up tests). There are two tables since the

correct comparison group for Kinderprep differs from that of Preschool. Kinderprep children are

restricted to the children who are at least 4 years old and will start Kindergarten in the following

   At the fall party, we hosted outdoor games and provided families with free ice cream. At the winter party, children
could get a photo with Santa Claus and received a small gift. At the spring party, we organized an Easter egg hunt and
the chance to get photographed with the Easter Bunny. None of the parties included an educational component.

   The full sample reported in Appendix B is 791 children, see Table B3.

year, while Preschool children could be either 3 or 4 years old to join the program. We report the

averages of individual deviations from the mean for each matched pair, and conduct t-tests to

compare these residuals. We find that we are balanced on the observables that we collected.

                                             [ TABLES 4, 5 Here ]

         As displayed in Table 6, 75% of the children assigned to Preschool attended at least one

day, and 66% of children assigned to Kinderprep attended at least one day. Conditional on

attending, children attended over 84% of instructional days. We were careful to exclude all

children assigned to the control group from participation in the treatments, and none attended

Preschool or Kinderprep. Our main analysis uses intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates, including all

children who were initially randomized to the programs, regardless of whether they eventually

attended them. Interested readers can convert our estimates to treatment-on-treated (ToT) by

dividing the relevant coefficient estimate by the attendance probability.

                                                    [ TABLE 6 Here]


4.2 Main Treatment Effects

         Table 7 provides ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates for intent-to-treat effects,

regressing treatment assignment on cognitive and non-cognitive scores, with controls for pre-

assessment cognitive and non-cognitive scores and demographic characteristics (race, gender, age

at test date, and home language), year of baseline tests, matched pair grouping, test form, number

of previous assessments, age dummy at randomization (3 or 4 years old, which determines year of

school entry), and year of randomization).12 We do this analysis separately for the mid-year


12
   Notice that one can also use Table 7 to estimate the local-average-treatment effect (LATE); that is, the average
effect of attending one of our programs (Angrist and Imbens, 1995). To estimate LATE, each treatment effect
coefficient should be divided by the attendance probability for that sub-group available in Table 6. A few assumptions
are needed to estimate LATE. These are, 1) treatment assignment is random, 2) being selected for treatment has a
monotonic impact on attending, and 3) being selected for treatment affects outcomes through its effect on attendance

assessment (January/February), the end of year assessment (May/June), and the end of summer

assessment (August). The comparison group for Preschool is the sub-set of control children in the

main randomization, while the comparison group for Kinderprep is the sub-set of control children

who would have been eligible for the summer program (i.e., were at least 4 years old on September

1 of the academic year following the program), including both main randomized and late

randomized children with a dummy to control for randomization period.

                                    [ TABLE 7 – Mean Effect Sizes]

        We find a large and significant impact of our programs on cognitive achievement. The

impact of Preschool on cognitive achievement is large and statistically significant – students

assigned to this program have a cognitive score that is 0.23𝜎 higher than the control group at the

end of the year (p-value<0.01). The impact of the Kinderprep on cognitive achievement is also

large and statistically significant -- students assigned to this program have a cognitive score that is

0.18𝜎 higher than the control group at the end of the summer (p-value<0.01).13

        Next, we investigate the shape of the education production function for the academic-year

program by comparing cognitive test scores obtained at mid-year to those obtained at the end of

the academic year. We see that most gains from Preschool occur within the first 4 months of the

program (p-value comparing mid-year and end-year scores = 0.78). This finding provides

additional support for the potential effectiveness of shorter programs like Kinderprep. At the end

of summer, scores in the Preschool group are somewhat below end of academic year scores, but

the difference is not statistically significant (p-value=0.65).

    The impact of our programs on non-cognitive skills is more limited and not statistically



(Angrist and Imbens, 1995).
13
   The robustness checks in Appendix B Tables B9-B11 confirm the large and significant impact on cognitive skills.
Evidence of the impact on non-cognitive skills is weak just as in the main data.




                                                       14
significant. The estimate for the impact on non-cognitive skills of being assigned to Preschool at

the end of the program is 0.08𝜎 (p-value=0.39), and of being assigned to Kinderprep at the end of

the program is 0.09𝜎 (p-value=0.32).

           We also investigate which skills were most improved by the programs. In Table 8, we split

the cognitive and non-cognitive scores into their sub-tests. We find that the program significantly

improved most cognitive skills (relative to the control group), including letter and word

identification (WJ Letter-Word), applied problems (WJ Applied Problems), and math (WJ

Quantitative Concepts). Receptive vocabulary and spelling were less affected.14 As for non-

cognitive skills, we find evidence that the Preschool program affected working memory (Operation

Span) but neither treatment affected inhibitory control (Spatial Conflict) or attention shifting

(Same Game). There was also no impact on our assessor-administered self-regulation score –

impulse control and emotion – as measured by the Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment (PSRA).

                [ TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE: MEAN EFFECT SIZES SUBSCORES ]

           Our results suggest that non-cognitive skills are much harder to move through preschool

education than cognitive skills. An alternative explanation is that our tests do not measure this

construct very well. However, Fryer et al. (2015) used similar tests in their analysis and found a

strong positive impact of incentivized parenting programs on non-cognitive skills, suggesting that

the tests do measure a skill that is measurable and can be moved. If parenting is an important input

to non-cognitive skills, we may have expected to find effects as well. However, our parenting

programs are much less intensive than the parenting programs discussed in Fryer, Levitt, and List

(2015), which may have contributed to our limited effects.




14
     The same result is observed in the robustness checks, see Appendix B, Table B5.




                                                          15
4.3 Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

       An open question in the academic production function is how child skills C affect the

production process. Particularly, we were interested to know whether there were heterogeneous

treatment effects when comparing higher or lower cognitive and non-cognitive ability children.

Tables 9 and 10 report on the impact of the Preschool and Kinderprep, grouping students by pre-

treatment cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

       In Table 9, we observe that the greatest improvement in cognitive skills is concentrated

among students who start out with below median cognitive test scores. Moreover, it does not matter

whether the students also show low or high non-cognitive test scores. These children improve by

0.50𝜎 (p-value<0.01) relative to children who were above median who do not improve (-0.01𝜎,

p-value=0.96). Among Kinderprep children in Table 10, we also find large improvements on

cognitive scores from children who start below the median on cognitive test scores (0.27𝜎, p-

value<0.02) and insignificant improvement among kids who start above the median on cognitive

skills (0.12𝜎, p-value=0.19).

       The same result is observed in Appendix B Tables B6 and B7, which shows that in the

overall sample, children with the lowest cognitive test scores improve the most. Preschool children

improve by 0.44𝜎 (p-value<0.01) while children above the median in cognitive test scores improve

by 0.08𝜎 (p-value=0.40). The corresponding values for Kinderprep are 0.27𝜎 (p-value=0.01) and

0.14𝜎 (p-value=0.12), which are lower in magnitude but similar in relative size.

               [ TABLES 9 & 10 - Mean Effects Score Subgroups about here ]




                                                16
5. Robustness Checks

         In this section, we explore the robustness of these results under potential threats to the

interpretation of the data.



5.1 Attrition

         A first concern is that our estimates might be biased based on the sample of students who

complete the battery of tests described above at each point in the school year, either during

treatment or while enrolled in SD170 during follow-up years. If treatment affects selection into

this sample, our results may be biased. Table 9, 10, and 11 account for this selective attrition by

estimating inverse probability weighted (IPW) treatment effects. IPWs are estimated from a linear

probability model of a binary variable indicating whether the cognitive/non- cognitive index score

is available for the post-treatment wave regressed on the baseline measure, a dummy variable

indicating whether the baseline measure is present or not, gender, race, and age at assessment.

These are calculated separately for Preschool and Kinderprep treatment arms. The results remain

largely robust upon weighing the coefficients by IPWs across the overall mean effect (Table 9)

and within Preschool and Kinderprep pre-score subgroups (Table 10 and Table 11).



5.2 Small Sample Estimation

         Given our relatively small sample size, it is possible that the data violates the assumption

that the estimated treatment effects are normally distributed, which could affect inference. To

account for this, we conduct a non-parametric permutation test and calculate exact p-values (Fisher

1960).

         The sample is re-randomized 10,000 times within matched blocks (i.e. identical to the




                                                  17
original randomization). We re-calculate the main results using these new, synthetic treatment

assignments and record the new treatment effects. The exact p-value is the proportion of simulated

treatment effects that are larger than the actual observed treatment effect (in absolute value).

         Figure B1 in Appendix B plots the actual observed treatment effect against the distribution

of simulated treatment effects for various outcomes. All results that are statistically significant in

the main analysis remain significant.



5.3 Multiple Hypothesis Testing

         We test two different treatments along two (sometimes more) outcome measures; therefore,

it is necessary to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) (List, Shaikh, and Xu, 2019). In

Table 7, we have two treatments and two outcome variables, which gives us a Bonferroni adjusted

p-value threshold of 0.05/4=0.0125. Our results on the impact of programs on cognitive scores

continue to hold for Preschool at the end of the year and for Kinderprep at the end of the summer.

We conclude that our main results are robust to MHT.

         In Tables 9 and 10, we consider whether the programs are more effective for children who

start with higher/lower abilities (4 subgroups and 2 outcome variables in each table, for a

Bonferroni adjusted threshold of 0.05/8=0.00625). Our finding that Preschool children starting at

below median scores significantly improve (Table 9) continues to hold up to MHT. The result does

not hold up for Kinderprep (Table 10), potentially due to the smaller sample size. Results in Tables

8 and 10 are less robust to MHT.15


15
  In Table 8, we consider the impact of the programs on different sub-scores. With 8 sub-tests, our Bonferroni adjusted
p-value threshold is 0.05/16=0.0038. Results that still hold for Kinderprep are the significant impact on Letter-Word
and Quantitative Concepts. Results that still hold for Preschool are Spelling at the end of the summer and Quantitative
Concepts at the end of the year. In Table 10, if we control for testing in each year as a separate hypothesis, results do
not hold; but if we control for 4 hypotheses as in Table 7, results continue to hold.




                                                           18
6. Conclusion

        Providing children with the best opportunities to reach their potentials remains one of the

most important educational problems today. In this study, we introduce a novel preschool and

parenting intervention – Cog-X – that has a large and significant impact on the cognitive skills of

children enrolled. This provides a clear policy implication, since the children we studied are low-

income and started out with lower cognitive achievement scores relative to the nation. We also

explored the impact of our program on non-cognitive skills, finding that non-cognitive skills are

much more challenging to affect. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we traced out the shape

of the education production function, finding that most gains occur in the first 4 months (with large

gains in even 2 months, as evidenced by the Kinderprep program). Our finding about when gains

occur is highly relevant for policy-makers, since we show that a significantly cheaper, shorter

summer program can rival an academic-year program in the short-term.

       The finding that non-cognitive skills are difficult to move through schooling alone is

important given that a large literature is devoted to studying the correlates between non-cognitive

skills and life outcomes. The related work of Fryer, Levitt, and List (2015), which did show an

impact of parenting programs on non-cognitive skills, points to the possibility that inputs outside

of schooling (i.e., parents) are highly important for this skill.

       Our programs were most effective for those children who needed it most: those below the

median in cognitive skills improved substantially, while those above the median did not

significantly improve. In future work, we will continue follow-up with these children to understand

the progression of treatment effects as the children age into middle childhood, adolescence, and

beyond.




                                                   19
       A limitation of this work is that we have thus far evaluated the impact of the programs in

the short-term. The next step is to collect additional data on the CHECC children going forward

so that the effects in the medium term can be evaluated. Many related programs document

substantial fade-out in the years following the program (Almond et al., 2018). Despite this fade-

out, programs such as Perry Preschool and Abecedarian have shown substantial lasting impact into

adulthood (Schweinhart et al., 2005). Hence, understanding the trajectories of CHECC children

will be important going forward.

                           Most children were randomized in the main randomization each
                           summer. However, a small group of children were randomized in
                           the following spring either to control or Kinderprep. The sample
                           includes every child who appears in Table 7: Mean Effect Sizes.

      This table reports summary statistics and balance tests. Each panel is restricted to children who took the corresponding assessment. Each row reports the coefficient from a regression
      of the listed variable on treatment and matched pair controls. Late randomized children are treated as a single matched pair. The p-value columns report the p-value from the treatment
      coefficient. The observation rows provides the number of children in each panel who were used in any of the above regressions. The p-value for a ttest on the residuals from a regression
      of the non-cognitive index on a second degree age polynomial and matched pair controls is 0.693.

      This table reports summary statistics and balance tests. Each panel is restricted to children who took the corresponding assessment. Each row reports the coefficient from a regression
      of the listed variable on treatment and matched pair controls. Late randomized children are treated as a single matched pair. The p-value columns report the p-value from the treatment
      coefficient. The observation rows provides the number of children in each panel who were used in any of the above regressions. The p-value for a ttest on the residuals from a regression
      of the non-cognitive index on a second degree age polynomial and matched pair controls is 0.548.

  This table reports ITT coefficient estimates of treatment effects on cognitive
  and non-cognitive index scores. The cognitive and non-cognitive indexes are
  calculated as the mean of the standardized values of each of the subtests. All
  regressions control for cognitive baseline scores, non-cognitive baseline scores,
  gender, race, home language, age at test date, matched pair grouping, test form,
  number of previous assessments, year of randomization, an indicator for aged
  above or below 4 at randomization, mother age at child birth, birthweight, and
  an indicator if the pretest is from a previous year. Kinderprep regressions also
  include a dummy for late randomization. The row Preschool v. Kinderprep
  reports the p-value of a chi quared test of the equality of coefficients reported
  at summerloss.Asterisks indicate significance at the 10/5/1 percent levels.

                      Appendix A: Description of Programs & Assessments

A.1: Cog-X

Goals of Cog-X
Cog-X not only prepares preschool students for kindergarten—it aims to provide students the skills
necessary to succeed in all grades. By the time students enter kindergarten, they should:

    •   Display academic curiosity through oral and written language.
    •   Exhibit self-regulation, as well as empathy toward others.
    •   Have a foundation of academic skills, including letter and number recognition, the ability to
        respond to texts, and basic mathematical concepts.

Early childhood professionals developed the Cog-X curriculum in alignment with the Illinois State Board
of Education Kindergarten Standards and the Common Core Kindergarten State Standards.

Inclusion of content to be taught with intentionality and integration
 Cog-X integrates reading, math, social studies, science, and socio-emotional activities throughout the day,
and is divided into four major thematic units that motivate classroom work: My Family, My Community,
and My World; The Scientific Method; The Past and Present; and The Natural World. Cog-X puts a strong
emphasis on parental involvement. In addition to the half-day curriculum, teachers lead biweekly Parent
Empowerment workshops.

Provision for child initiation and engagement
The five domains of early childhood development: language, academic skills, social, emotional, and
physical are all fully developed and thoroughly integrated into the daily schedule of the Cog-X curriculum.
The Cog-X curriculum focuses on both the child’s academic learning and social-emotional growth. The
following curricular components support the domains of learning:

    •   Critical Conversations: provides students the opportunity to explore and discuss social-emotional
        topics relating to the thematic units. Also supports the students development of self-regulation and
        critical thinking skills
    •   Morning Infrastructure Meetings: incorporates and develops a variety of learning opportunities
        including a daily greeting, daily calendar activities, shared writing, singing, dancing and thematic
        read-alouds.
    •   Blueprints/Fundamental Play: Student directed with opportunities for community building, written
        expression, peer conversations, sensory exploration, self-expression, role-playing and theme
        development.
    •   Daily Debriefs: provides teachers with the opportunity to conference individually with students
        during Fundamental Play. Allows both teacher and student to be reflective on their learning.
    •   Math Small Groups: provides direct instruction, collaborative and independent activities to
        encourage and engage students to think as a mathematician.
    •   Literacy and Language Small Groups: provides focused reading experiences with thematic books
        and also direct instruction, collaborative and independent activities to encourage vocabulary, pre-
        reading and pre-writing skills.

Provision for parent involvement, through meaningful communication with families
The Cog-X curriculum puts a strong emphasis on parental involvement. In additional to the preschool
curriculum, teaching teams and administrators lead bimonthly Parent Empowerment workshops that




                                                    33
instruct and reinforce the academic and social-emotional learning goals. Each session, parents learn how to
extend the current lessons from school to the home. The structure of the workshops invites parents into the
classroom and gives them the tools necessary to be their child’s first teacher. It also gives them a welcoming
school environment to ask questions and collaborate with other parents in their child’s class. In addition to
the Parent Empowerment program, the preschool teaching teams plan Family Theme Activities days that
invite parents into the classroom to work with their students on literacy and math activity that relate to the
current theme.

Alignment with an authentic assessment tool that is ongoing and comprehensive
The Cog-X curriculum provides teachers with many long term and daily assessment tools to help focus the
instruction in the classroom to support the five domains of learning. In implementing the Cog-X curriculum
all attending students are assessed with standard preschool screening tools, including the DIAL 3, Pre-IPT
and TOPEL (Test of Preschool Early Literacy). Assessments are designed to provide timely feedback to
teachers, administrators, students and parents. The curriculum has weekly skills based literacy and math
assessments that are completed through teacher observation and small group opportunities. There is also a
unit assessment that is completed by the teacher individually with each student at the end of a theme to
determine the student’s competency. The blueprint created by the student is included each day as part of
the Fundamental Play block and serves as an on-going assessment tool for the teacher in regards to the
student’s development in the following areas: pre-writing, fine motor, language, social-emotional and peer
relationships. Blueprints are added to the yearlong portfolio of the student’s work. Additionally, the
curriculum supports the creation of Professional Learning Communities (PLC) with teaching teams to
present, discuss and plan for on-going student assessment and instruction. The PLC framework allows for
teaching teams to plan re-teaching and enrichment instruction based on student assessments.

Consideration of the child’s linguistic and cultural background
According to the 2013 State Report Card, 23 % of students in the Chicago Heights School District 170 have
limited English proficiencies. The intent of the Cog-X curriculum is to support both the bilingual student
and their family in the school environment. From the classroom level, many of the teachers have their ESL
certification as required by the state of Illinois for the 2014- 2015 school year; remaining teachers are
currently attending programs to receive certification. Bilingual assistants support students throughout the
instructional day in all areas of the curriculum. To support best practices in bilingual early childhood
education, vocabulary and songs are taught in multiple languages. To support the bilingual families, all
school-wide and classroom communication is translated into multiple languages. To support attendance and
participation in the Parent Empowerment Workshop, bilingual classes are offered. This gives all families
the opportunity to participate in a school community at their comfort level.

Consideration of the range of experience and qualifications of early childhood teachers
All of the Cog-X preschool teachers have the required Type 04 Early Childhood Education Certification.
The Cog-X curriculum was written with the classroom preschool teacher in mind and recognizes that they
are creating and promoting the first school experience for most of their young students. Additionally, the
curriculum developers and program administrators have provided staff development through a peer-
coaching model, theme collaboration, peer-to-peer focus walks, professional learning communities and
mentoring.

Consideration of a wide range of children’s abilities, including those of children with IEPs.
The Cog-X curriculum was created with the intent to provide developmentally appropriate instruction to
all preschool students. To meet the academic and social-emotional needs of all students, classrooms are
blended by age group and student ability. A DIAL 3 screening is held at the start of the school year to
provide a baseline as to where a child will be starting school at from an academic and social level. In
partnership with the school district, we work with the Early Childhood Special Education Support Services




                                                     34
staff to assist with identifying, supporting and monitoring students that may need additional classroom
supports in place. We are able to provide those services at the classroom level with no disruption to the
student’s school routine.

A.2 Assessments

Assessments were always carried out in the order listed below, by assessors that we hired and trained. All
assessors held at least a Bachelor’s degree and had experience with children. Assessors were always
supervised by a head assessor or project manager for CHECC and were blind to the child’s treatment
assignment.

Main Battery of Assessments

The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (Receptive Vocabulary, 5-10 minutes)
An untimed test of verbal ability and receptive vocabulary, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III (PPVT-
III) is a norm-referenced standardized assessment that can be used with subjects ages 2-90+. While the test
is said to take 10-15 minutes for adult subjects, early childhood experts estimate that the test takes 5-10
minutes to complete for that population. The PPVT-III is available in both English and Spanish. The PPVT
includes an A and B form, and A and B were alternated in each testing period to reduce potential for
learning.




                                                       37
Woodcock Johnson III Tests of Achievement (Cognitive achievement, 5-10 minutes per test)
This norm-referenced assessment allows researchers to track subjects from ages 2 to 85+ and contain most
of the key outcomes highlighted by the experts with whom we have spoken. Of the 22 tests that compose
the WJ-III ACH, there are four specific tests that are applicable for a preschool population that we used.
The WJ includes an A and B form, and A and B were alternated in each testing period to reduce potential
for learning.

* Letter Word Identification: Measures the subject’s ability to identify letters and words.
* Spelling: Measures the subject’s ability to write orally presented words correctly.
* Applied Problems: Measures the subject’s ability to analyze and solve math problems.
* Quantitative Concepts: Measures the subject’s knowledge of mathematical concepts, symbols, and
vocabulary.

All WJ-III ACH tests are available in both English and Spanish.

Non-cognitive assessments (attention shifting, working memory, inhibitory control, 15 minutes)
These tests are used to understand levels of executive function among young children. In the first task,
which tests attention, children are asked to identify the direction arrows are pointing over a series of
different examples. In the second task, which tests working memory, children are asked to remember the
colors and animals pictured on the previous page over a series of different examples. In the third task, which
tests attention shifting, children are asked to identify which aspects of 2-3 objects are similar based on color,
shape or size. These tests were developed by Professor Clancy Blair at NYU (see Blair and Willoughby,
2006a, b, c).

Preschool Self Regulation Assessment - Assessor Report (Self Regulation, 10 minutes)
Designed to assess self-regulation in emotional, attentional, and behavioral domains. The Assessor report
is a global report of children's behavior during a series of tasks. In our assessment, the assessor reports on
subject behavior during the assessment battery.

Kindergarten Readiness Assessments

Kindergarten Achievement Test (KGAT) (Kindergarten readiness -- cognitive, 20 minutes)
Administered by the school district. This test requires preschoolers to compete a series of tasks related to
math (simple counting and addition), literacy (rhyming, recognition of sounds and letters), and social-
emotional learning (following directions, getting along with others).

Head, Knees, Toes & Shoulders (HKTS) (Kindergarten readiness – non-cognitive)
This test asks children to do the opposite of what the instructor asks of them. For example, if the instructor
says to “Touch your toes,” children should touch their head. It evaluates students on if they touch the right
body part and how quickly they arrive at the correct answer.

Follow-up assessments

Cognitive: The cognitive assessments continued to be administered throughout the follow-up assessment
since they are suitable through age 85.

Non-Cognitive: Since Blair and Willoughby tests are designed for preschool, we created new tests.
Children in kindergarten through second grade were given three tests, measuring the same non-cognitive
skills as previously, including inhibitory control, working memory and attention shifting. We increased the
difficulty of the Blair and Willoughby inhibitory control and working memory tests by adding more items.




                                                       38
For the attention shifting test, we created a variant of the Wisconsin Card Sort for our age group. The
children are given a set of cards with multiple colored shapes and tasked to sort them based on color, shape,
or number of objects on the card.

Notes: These figures plot the distribution of simulated treatment coefficients obtained by conducting OLS regressions on 10000 re-
randomized samples. The black vertical line indicates the true observed beta coefficient Re-randomization is done analogously to the
original assignment, within matched blocks, 10000 times. The main specifications are re-run using this simulated treatment assignment
and the simulated betas are stored. The exact two-sided p-value is the number of simulated betas that are greater than the observed
beta in absolute value.

      This table reports summary statistics and balance tests. Each panel is restricted to children who took the corresponding assessment. The control and preschool columns report means as
      well as standard errors in parentheses. The p-value columns report the p-value from a two sided t-test between control and preschool. The F-test p-value row reports the p-value from a

      This table reports summary statistics and balance tests. Each panel is restricted to children who took the corresponding assessment. The control and kinderprep columns report means
      as well as standard errors in parentheses. The p-value columns report the p-value from a two sided t-test between control and kinderprep. The F-test p-value row reports the p-value
      from a joint F-test that all differences between means are equal to zero. The observations column provides the number of children in each panel who have scores for either the cognitive
      or the non-cognitive assessment. The p-value for a ttest on the residuals from a regression of the non-cognitive index on a second degree age polynomial is 0.516.

 Most children were randomized in the main randomization each
 summer. However, a small group of children were randomized in
 the following spring either to control or Kinderprep. The sample
 includes every child who appears in Table B4: Mean Effect Sizes.

  This table reports ITT coefficient estimates of treatment effects on cognitive
  and non-cognitive index scores. The cognitive and non-cognitive indexes are
  calculated as the mean of the standardized values of each of the subtests. All
  regressions control for cognitive baseline scores, non-cognitive baseline scores,
  gender, race, home language, age at test date, test form, number of previous
  assessments, year of randomization, an indicator for aged above or below 4 at
  randomization, mother age at child birth, birthweight, and an indicator if the
  pretest is from a previous year. Kinderprep regressions also include a dummy
  for late randomization. The row Preschool v. Kinderprep reports the p-value of
  a chi quared test of the equality of coefficients reported at summerloss.Asterisks
  indicate significance at the 10/5/1 percent levels.

  This table reports ITT coefficient estimates of treatment effects on test scores. All regressions
  control for cognitive baseline scores, non-cognitive baseline scores, gender, race, home language,
  age at test date, test form, number of previous assessments, year of randomization, an indicator for
  aged above or below 4 at randomization, mother age at child birth, birthweight, and an indicator
  if the pretest is from a previous year. Kinderprep regressions also include a dummy for late
  randomization. Asterisks indicate significance at the 10/5/1 percent levels.

  This table reports ITT coefficient estimates of treatment effects on cognitive and
  non-cognitive index scores weighted by inverse probability weights. IPW weights
  are estimated from a linear probability model of a binary variable indicating
  whether the measure is available for the post-treatment wave regressed on the
  baseline measure, a dummy variable indicating whether the baseline measure is
  present, gender, race and age at assessment. The cognitive and non-cognitive
  indexes are calculated as the mean of the standardized values of each of the
  subtests. All regressions control for cognitive baseline scores, non-cognitive
  baseline scores, gender, race, home language, age at test date, matched pair
  grouping, test form, number of previous assessments, year of randomization, an
  indicator for aged above or below 4 at randomization, mother age at child birth,
  birthweight, and an indicator if the pretest is from a previous year. Kinderprep
  regressions also include a dummy for late randomization. The row Preschool v.
  Kinderprep reports the p-value of a chi quared test of the equality of coefficients
  reported at summerloss.Asterisks indicate significance at the 10/5/1 percent
  levels.
