                                 Abstract

     This   paper compares alternative liability rules for allo-

cating losses from defective products when consumers under-
estimate these losses and producers may have some market power.
If producers do not have any market power, the rule of strict
liability 'leads to both the first-best accident probability and

industry output. If producers do have some market power, strict
liability still leads to the first-best accident probability,

but there will now be too little output of the industry. It
is shown that if market power is sufficiently large, a negli-

gence rule is preferable. Under this rule, firms can still be
induced to choose the first-best accident probability, but now
the remaining damages are borne by consumers. Since consumers

underestimate these damages, they buy more than under strict
liability. However, there is a limit to how much the negligence
rule can encourage extra consumption. It is shown that if
market power is sufficiently large, the rule of no liability may

then be preferred to the negligence rule. Without any liability
imposed, producers will not choose the first-best accident

probability. However, this may be more than compensated for

by the increased output of the industry.

1.   Introduction

     It is widely recognized that consumers often misperceive the

risks from product failures and that, in many markets, producers
have some market power. Examples of markets in which both mis-

perceptions and market power occur might include those for

pharmaceuticals and other patented products, automobiles, tires,

farm machinery and aircraft.

     The implications of consumer misperceptions for the optimal

choice of a product liability rule in a competitive market are
considered by Spence (1977) and Shavell (1980, pp. 14-16) , among

others. They show that the rule of strict liability--in which
the producer is liable for all product failures regardless of
his care--is preferable both to the rule of negligence--in which
the producer pays damages only if he does not meet some standard

of care--and to the rule of no liability. The implications of
market power for the choice of a liability rule when consumers
have perfect information are discussed by Hamada (1976) and

Epple and Raviv (1978, pp. 83-87) .1   They demonstrate that,
in both competitive and monopolistic markets, strict liability,
negligence, and no liability are all equally desirable. The
results of these analyses might seem to suggest that when
consumer misperceptions and market power occur simultaneously,'

strict liability is the preferred remedy--it does best when con-
sumer misperceptions are the only problem and it does equally

well when market power is the only problem. We will show that
if consumers underestimate product risks, although strict lia-

bility is the best rule when market power is "low," negligence

will be preferred when market power is higher, and no liability
                             —2—

may be superior when market power is higher yet.
     The central idea developed in this paper follows from the

observation that shifting liability from producers to consumers
causes the demand curve to shift down by consumers' perceived
expected losses and producers' costs to fall by the actual
expected losses. Therefore, if consumers underestimate the

expected losses, costs will fall by more than demand, causing
output to increase. Thus, when producers have market power,

it may be desirable to take advantage of consumers' misperceptions
by shifting liability to them in order to offset the producers'

tendency to restrict output.' Of course, this shift may have
an undesirable effect on the producers' choice of the accident
probability, which must also be taken into account.

    This paper considers two ways of shifting liability from
producers to consumer5. Under the rule of negligence, assuming
the standard of care corresponds to the first—best accident
probability, producers will meet it and therefore they will not

be liable for the accidents that still occur. Because of
consumer misperceptions, this will lead to a larger output
than under strict liability. Under the rule of no liability,
producers will have an incentive to choose a higher accident

probability than the first—best one because of consumer misper-

ceptions and, for reasons to be explained, they will produce an

even larger output than under negligence.
     The circumstances under which each of the remedies may be

preferred can now be described. Suppose consumers underestimate

the accident probability and producers have no market power.
                                —3—

Then the rule of strict liability leads to the first-best out-
come. By forcing producers to internalize all accident costs,

this rule leads them to choose the correct accident probability;
it also leads them to raise their prices to reflect the cost of

achieving this probability and the cost of bearing the remaining
damages, so that the appropriate output is demanded.
The rule of negligence is less desirable because it leads to a
larger output. And the rule of no liability is worse because it
leads to an even larger output and it results in
an excessive accident probability.

        Now suppose market power increases, say due to an oligopoly
situation. Strict liability will still lead to the first—best
accident probability, but the positive degree of market power
will now result in too little output of the industry. A negli-
gence rule might be preferable because it increases industry

output without distorting the accident probability. In fact,
it will be shown that if market power is sufficiently large, the

negligence rule will be preferable to the strict liability

rule.

        Finally, suppose market power increases even further, possi-
bly to the level under monopoly. Then, in order to offset the

greater effects of market power, it may be desirable to use

the rule of no liability because it generates larger output

even though it leads to an excessive accident probability.

An example will be provided in which, if market power is suffi-
ciently large, the no liability rule will be preferable to the

others. However, in a different example, no liability will be
shown to be inferior to the other remedies regardless of the

degree of market power.
                               —4—

    The preceding discussion has assumed that consumers

underestimate product risks.     Alternatively, they may over-

estimate these risks. The same kind of reasoning leads to the
conclusion that strict liability is always preferred in this
case. The only reason to consider negligence or no liability
is to correct the problem of inadequate output due to market
power. But if consumers overestimate product risks, this
problem will be exacerbated to the extent that damages are

borne by consumers. Strict liability is thus the preferred

remedy regardless of the degree of market power.
     Section 2 presents the model, which is then used in sec-

tion 3 to derive the accident probabilities and industry out-
puts under the three rules. Section 4 focuses on the welfare

comparison between strict liability and negligence, while
section 5 focuses on the welfare effects of no liability.

Section 6 presents a numerical example which suggests that the

welfare loss from using the wrong remedy may be significant.
Section 7 discusses the results when consumers overestimate

the accident probability. Finally, section 8 considers
several extensions and interpretations of the analysis.

2.      The Model
        Consumers are identical and risk neutral. Their aggregate

inverse demand for a perfectly safe good is assumed to take
         3/
the form:—


(2.1)             p =   a — q.

        If the good is not perfectly safe, let a be the true

probability of a product accident (or product failure), and

let (l-A)a be each consumer's perception of a, where
o <    A <   1.     Since A >    0, consumers underestimate the true
accident probability. Larger values of A correspond to lower
estimates. Thus, A may be interpreted as a measure of the

extent of the misperceptions. Notice also that consumers'
perceptions are "unresponsive" in the sense that a change in

the true accident probability induces a smaller change in the
                                          4/
perceived accident probability.—
        Let 9 be the dollar loss to the consumer in the event

 that one unit of the product fails. This loss includes the

 cost of repair and any damages resulting from
 the failure. Assuming that               is the same for each unit of

 the good consumed,              the aggregate inverse demand for the

 product when the perceived probability of failure is (l-A)a

 is:


 (2.2)            p = a —        — (l—A)a2.

         It   is assumed that there are n identical firms, each with

  constant marginal costs c(a), where c is strictly decreasing
                                     —6—

and strictly convex, i.e., c' < 0 and c" >           0.    Let m =   1/n be
a rneasureof market power, ranging from 0 (the limiting conipeti—
tive case as the number of firms goes to infinity) to 1 (the

monopoly case)

        Social welfare W is assumed to equal the benefit to con-

sumersof industry output net of production costs:

                        q
(2.3)       W(q,a) =    f   (c—13x—a2)dx —   c(a)q
                        0

                    =   [o—q—a2—c(a)]q.

The first-best industry output and accident probability

are       determined by maximizing (2.3), which will be assumed

to have a unique interior maximum, (q*, a*) .             The first—order

conditions with respect to q and a are:


(2.4)        ci_q*_a*2 =    c(a*),
(2.5)        _cI(a*) = 2.


The first condition states that, given the optimal accident
probability, industry output should be expanded until the
marginal value to consumers of the last unit, c-13q—a2, equals

the cost of producing that unit, c(a). The second condition
states that the probability of a product accident
should be reduced until the marginal benefit of the reduction

in the form of lower expected accident losses, 2, equals the

marginal cost of the reduction in the form of higher produc-

tion costs, _ct (a) .

        It will be useful to provide another interpretation of
the optimal probability a*. First note that the sum of pro-

duction cost and expected accident loss, c(a) +             a2, can be
                             —7—

thought of as the full cost of the good.   Thus, choosing an

accident probability that maximizes social welfare is equivalent

to choosing an accident probability that minimizes the full

cost.

 3. Accident Probabilities and Industry Outputs

        The equilibrium accident probabilities and industry outputs
 under each of the liability rules will be calculated in the

 following way. The inverse demand curve and the marginal cost
of each firm will first be described. These relationships
will then be used to determine each firm's profit as a func-
tion of its and other firms' accident probabilities and output
decisions. Equilibrium in the market is defined to be a set
of output and accident probability choices for each firm such
thateach firm is maximizing its profits taking the other firms'

choices as given.1
        Strict liability. Under the rule of strict liability,
whenever a product failure causes a loss of       dollars to a
consumer, the producer must pay that consumer      dollars.

Thus, since consumers are fully compensated for their losses,

they treat the good as if it were perfectly safe, regardless

of their misperceptions. Letting q. be the quantity chosen
by firm j, the aggregate inverse demand is then

                              n
(3.1)       p = a —           L q.
                             j=l
Each producer's marginal costs now include the expected lia-

bility payment:

(3.2)       c(a) +       a.
Thus, firm i's profits are:


(3.3)       rr. =
             1      [p   —    c(a.)
                                 1
                                      —
                                          a.]q.
                                           1  1
                                             —9—

Substituting (3.1) into (3.3) yields:


(34)           = [ct —
                              (q +Eq)
                                  11
                                                   — c(a)   —


Then firm i, taking all other firms' choices as given, chooses
its output, q1, and its accident probability, a1, to maximize
its profits. This leads to the following first-order conditions:
               a —    q. — c(a.) — a.2
                                     J        1       1
                              J 1        -
(3.5)       q =

(3.6)               —    c'   (a.) = 2.


        An analogous set of first—order conditions applies to every

other firm in the industry, resulting in 2n equations that
must be satisfied in equilibrium. The conditions correspond-
ing to (3.6) imply that each firm chooses its accident proba-

bility to minimize its marginal costs (3.2). Since, under
strict liability, the firm's marginal costs are the "full
costs" of the good, each firm chooses the first-best accident

probability:

 (3.7)       a = a*.

Now substituting a* for a into the conditions corresponding
to (3.5) yields n equations in n unknowns. By straightforward
manipulation, it cart be shown that each firm chooses the

same output:"

                          1      ra — c(a*)
                                        -
                                                   — a*2,
 (3.8)       qj =       (l+n)    L


 Since there are n firms, industry output under strict liability
 is:
                                        —10—


(3 9)           =     n            —   c(a*) — a*i
                    (l+n) L

        It will be useful to compare industry output under strict
liability to the first—best level of output. Rewriting (2.4),


(3 10)       q* =
                  a   —   c(a*)        a*2


Thus,


(3.11)                       q*.
                    (l+n)

At one extreme--the monopoly case-—industry output is half of
the first—best output. As the number of firms increases,

industry output increases. In the limiting competitive
case, industry output equals the first-best level.
        Thus, the problem under strict liability is not with the

safety levels chosen by firms, but with the restriction of

output due to market power.
        Negligence. Under the negligence rule, firms have to pay
damages only if they do not meet some standard of care. This
standard corresponds in the present context to a particular

accident probability. A frequently cited legal principle
for determining the standard of care is the "Learned Hand rule,"

which can be interpreted as requiring that the standard
be set so as to minimize the sum of the cost of taking care
and expected accident losses.'1 In accordance with this
principle, it will be assumed that the standard of care is set

equal to the accident probability that minimizes the full

cost of the good--the first-best accident probability, a*.
                                   —11—


     The inverse demand curve under negligence can be deter-
mined as follows. If firm i chooses its accident probability a1

at or below a*, then consumers bear their own losses and the

price they are willing to pay for firm i's product will
reflect this. If a. is above a*, firm j is liable for consumers'
                    1
losses, so consumers will treat the good as if

it were perfectly safe. Thus, the demand faced by firm i is:
                          n
                                   —       (l—A)a.9.,
(3.12)             a —        q.                 1
                                                        a. < a*,
                                                         1
              =
                          j=l
                          n
                                                        a.
                                                         1
                                                           >a*.
                          j=l
Similarly, firm i's marginal costs, including possible liability

payments, are:

                                   a. < a*,
          c(a.),
             1                         1=
(3.13)
          c(a.) + a.9.,             a. > a*.
                                       1
             1     1


Thus, firm i's profits are:


                   [a— (q. + q) — c(a.)                  —                a < a*
                                                             (1—A)a9]q,
                                   J1
(3.14)    ii. =

                                                         —                a. > a*.
                   [a—   (q + q) — c(a)                      a.2]q,
                             J



     It can be shown that all firms will choose to just meet

the standard of care a*.V After substituting a* for a in
 (3.14), equilibrium industry output can be derived as under

strict liability. The end result is that:
                                         —12—


(3.15)       aN =     a*,

and


(3 16)            = _____     ía — c(a*)        —   (1_A)a*9
                      (l+n) L

      Under both negligence and strict liability, firms choose
the first-best accident probability. Thus, the only effect of
moving from strict liability to negligence is to shift the

resulting expected accident losses from producers to consumers.
The consequence of this can be seen by comparing (3.16) to

(3.9), the corresponding condition for industry output under
strict liability; the only difference is that under negligence

consumers'            perceived expected losses, (l_A)a*2, are sub-
stituted for the actual expected losses, a*S. Since consumers

underestimate accident losses, they buy more under negligence
than under strict liability:


(3.17)            >



      No liability. Under the rule of no liability, since

consumers bear all product losses, the demand faced by firm i

is:


                             n
             p = a—                  —
(3.18)
                            j=l
                               q         (1—A)a1,


and firmi's marginal costs are c(a) .

      By a derivation similar to that under strict liability
and negligence, it is straightforward to show that the acci-
                                  —13—


dent probability chosenby each firm under no liability satisfies


(3.19)      —c' (a0) = (l—A)9..


In other words, firms provide safety until the marginal cost

of increased safety equals the perceived marginal benefit of
increased safety. Equivalently, firms choose the accident

probability a0 to minimize the perceived full cost,

c(a) + (l—X)a9.       This is not surprising since, under no
liability, consumers' demand for the good is based on their

perceived accident losses.
     Because the accident probability under no liability mini-
mizes perceived full cost and the first—best accident proba-

bility minimizes actual full cost, the two probabilities
are in general different. In fact, since c" > 0, a compari-
son of (3.19) and (2.5) shows that:


(3.20)       a0 >   a*.
This result can be explained as follows. Suppose under no lia-
bility firms chose the first-best accident probability. By
definition, a small increase in the probability would lower pro-

duction costs by an amount just equal to the increase in actual
expected accident losses. However, since consumers' perceptions

 are assumed to be unresponsive to changes in the true accident
 probability, consumers perceive a smaller increase in expected

 accident losses. Thus, it is profitable for firms to raise the

 probability.
         Industry output under no liability can be derived in a

 manner similar to the previous cases:
                                            —14—

                                                    —
                                   c'i. —
                                            c(a0)       (l—X)a0
(3.21)       q0 =    (l±n)     [

A comparison of (3.21) to (3.16), the corresponding result under
negligence, shows that different industry outputs under no

liability and negligence arise solely because different            acci-

dent probabilities are chosen. Since a0 minimizes

c(a) +    (1-X)a2, industry output under no liability exceeds
that under negligence:


(3.22)       q0 >

This can be explained in the following way. Under both
negligence and no liability, consumers bear their own losses.

Under no liability, firms have an incentive to choose the

accident probability which minimizes the perceived full cost

of the good-—the production cost plus perceived expected acci-
dent losses. Under negligence, however, firms are induced by
 the standard of care to choose the first-best accident probability,

which results in a higher perceived full cost Thus, consumers
 buy less under the negligence rule.

        The results of this section can be summarized as follows:


 (3.23)       a0 >   a*   =
                              a    =
                                       aN

 (3.24)       q0          > q5     ,


  and
 (3.25)       q* >


where the equality in (3.25) occurs only when market power is
 zero. Under strict liability, the accident probability is the
                            —15—


first-best one despite consumer misperceptions because firms
are forced to pay for all of their damages; industry output is
below the first-best level when there is market power. Under
negligence, firms meet the standard of care corresponding to
the first—best accident probability, so consumers bear their own

losses. Since consumers underestimate the expected losses,
they view the full cost of the good as less than under strict

liability and consequently buy more. Under no liability, firms
have an incentive to increase the accident probability above
the first—best level because consumers also underestimate the
increase in expected losses. Since consumers then view the

full cost of the good as less than under negligence, they buy

even more.

4.    Welfare Analysis I
       noted in the introduction, previous authors have
      As
analyzed product liability remedies when, alternatively,
producers have no market power or consumers are       perfectly

informed. It      will be useful to reproduce versions of their
results    within our model before considering the more gen-

eral case when both market power and misperceptions occur.
         Proposition 1: When there are consumer misperceptions

but no market power, strict liability is the preferred remedy
and leads to the first-best accident probability and industry

output.
         Proof:   It   is easy to see from section 3 that the limiting

values of the accident probabilities and industry outputs as

n goes to infinity have the following relationships:


 (4.1)        aO>a*aSaN,
and


 (4.2)        q>q>q=q*.
                                                       Q.E.D.

         To understand this result, recall from section 3 that the

only possible problem with strict liability is that industry
output might be too low because of market power.         But when

 there is no market power, industry output equals the first—
 best output. However, under negligence and no liability,
 larger output levels are generated by consumer misper-

 ceptions, as is an excessive accident probability under no

 liability.
                                 —17--



        Proposition 2: When there is market power but no consumer
misperceptions, all three remedies are equally desirable and

lead to the first-best accident probability but to too little

industry output.
        Proof:   It is straightforward to show from section 3

that when A = 0 the accident probabilities and industry outputs

have the following relationships:


(4.3)        aO=aN=aS=a*,
and


(4.4)        q*>qQqq
where the first equality in (4.4) occursonly whenmarketpower is zero.
                                                          Q.E .D.

        The explanation   of this result is as follows. Because

there are no consumer misperceptions, the incentive for firms
to choose too large an accident probability under no liability
disappears. Thus, all three remedies lead to the first-best

accident probability. Given the same accident probabilities
and no misperceptions, the full cost of the good is viewed

as the same under all three remedies. Thus, industry output
is the same. When there is market power, this output is less

than the first-best output.
        For reasons mentioned in the introduction, it does not

follow from the preceding propositions that strict liability
is the preferred remedy when both market power and consumer

misperceptions occur together. In general, any of the three
remedies might be the preferred one. The combinations of
                            —18—

market power and misperceptions for which each of the remedies

is preferable are characterized in Propositions 3 and 4 below.

     The results of these propositions are summarized in
Figure 1. Recall that the measure of market power, m, is
the reciprocal of the number of firms, 1/n. As drawn, the line
separating the strict liability and negligence areas intersects

the right—hand boundary. Therefore, for any degree of consumer
misperceptions, negligence is preferable to strict liability

if market power is high enough. However, depending on the
parameters of the problem, the separation line may intersect
the upper boundary. Then, of course, for some levels of con-
sumer misperceptions, strict liability is preferred at all
levels of market power. The line in Figure 1 labelled the

"optimal negligence line'L_defined below——also may intersect

the right-hand boundary or the upper boundary.
     Proposition 3: Given positive consumer misperceptions,
X > 0, there exists a positive level of market power, m > 0,

below which strict liability is preferred to negligence and

above which negligence is preferred to strict liability. This
level of market power increases linearly with misperceptions
(unless it has reached the maximum value of one)

     Proof:   To determine social welfare under strict liability,

W, substitute the accident probability (3.7) and industry
output (3.9) underthis remedy into the social welfare func-

tion (2.3). Socialwelfare under negligence, WNI isdeter-
mined similarly. It is then straightforward to show that:

                                                    Q.E.D.

        To understand this result, first recall that strict lia-

bility and negligence lead tothesame accident probabilities.
Therefore, the only basis for preferring one or the other is

differences in industry output. Because of consumer misper-

ceptions, output under negligence exceeds that under strict
liability. When market power is zero, strict liability leads

to the first-best output and thus negligence leads to excessive
output. However, if market power is sufficiently high and
output under strict liability therefore falls enough, the

larger output under negligence will be desirable. Since
greater misperceptions lead to a greater increase in output
under negligence relative to strict liability, greater market

power is then required before negligence is preferable.
        Before continuing, it will be useful to define what is

referred to in Figure 1 as the optimal negligence line.          This

line determines, for each level of consumer misperceptions,

the level of market power at which social welfare under the
negligence rule is highest. When market power is zero, recall

that output under negligence exceeds the first-best level.
As market power increases, output under negligence decreases.
At some level of market power, it may equal the first-best
output. If so, this level of market power is on the optimal
negligence line. If output under negligence has not yet
 fallen to the first-best level when market power is one, then

 this level of market power is on the optimal negligence line.
         It is straightforward to show that the optimal negligence
                                —20—


line is above the line separating the strict liability and
negligence areas--in fact, it has twice the slope.--'1 The

reason why it is above the line separating strict liability
and negligence is as follows. When market power is zero,

strict liability output equals the first-best output and
negligence output exceeds the first-best output.      As market

power increases, output levels under both remedies decrease
and the advantage of strict liability over negligence therefore
decreases. When the level of market power reaches the level

defined by the optimal negligence line, negligence output is
first—best and strict liability output is too small. Thus,
the switch from strict liability to negligence must have
occurred at a lower level of market power.
         Proposition 4: Given positive consumer misperceptions,
there exists a positive level of market power at and below
which negligence is preferred to no liability and above which

either no liability or negligence may be preferred.      This level

of market power is defined by the optimal negligence line.
         Proof: For a given A > 0, suppose m is less than or equal

to the level of market power defined by the optimal negligence

line. Therefore,         > q*. It is always true that q0 >

Thus, since 2W/q2 = — <         0,


 (4.6)        W(q aN) > W(q0, aN).

Recall that a0 > a =      a*.   Note that a* maximizes W(q,a) for

 any q. Thus, since 2W/a2 =          -c"(a)q   < 0,



 (4.7)        W(q0la) > W(q0,a0).
                                —21—



It follows from (4.6) and (4.7) that W1 > W0.     Since this holds

on the optimal negligence line, by continuity it also holds
for values of m just above the line. An example in which
   >        for some values of m above the optimal negligence
       WN
line is provided in section 5 below.
                                                         Q.E.D.

       This result should not be surprising. When market power

is below the level corresponding to the optimal negligence
line, negligence output exceeds the first-best output.      Under

no liability, output is even larger. Since the accident proba-
bility under no liability exceeds the probability under
negligence--which equals the first-best probability--no lia-

bility is worse than negligence on both accounts.      When market

power is above the optimal negligence line, negligence output
is below the first-best output, so that the increased output

under no liability may make it the preferred remedy.
       The results of Propositions 3 and 4 together provide a

more complete ranking of the remedies for various combinations

of consumer misperceptions and market power. Below the line
separating strict liability and negligence defined by Propo-

sition 3, strict liability dominates both other remedies—-it

dominates negligence by Proposition 3, and negligence dominates

no liability by Proposition 4. Above this line but below the
optimal negligence line, negligence is the preferred remedy--it
 dominates strict liability by Proposition 3 and it dominates

no liability by Proposition 4. Above the optimal negligence line,

either negligence or no liability may be the preferred remedy--

strict liability is inferior to negligence by Proposition 3.
                                 —22--


5.   Welfare Analysis II
     Without more specific assumptions, nothing further can
be stated about the choice between negligence and no liability

above the optimal negligence line. By providing two examples,
this section first shows that there may be a region in which no

liability is the preferred remedy, and then shows that no

liability may never be the preferred remedy.
     The intuition that motivates these examples is as follows.

Both remedies determine social welfare through their effects

on the accident probability and industry output. With respect
to the accident probability, negligence is preferable since
it leads to the first-best outcome. With respect to output,
no liability may be preferable since, above the optimal negli-

gence line, output under negligence is less than the first-
best level and output under no liability is greater than under

negligence.      In the two examples considered in this sec-

 tion only industry output or only the accident probability
affects social welfare. When only industry output matters,
no liability may be preferred; when only the accident proba-

bility matters, negligence is preferred.
         In the first example, it will be assumed that the acci-

dent probability does not directly affect social welfare.
This means that the full cost of the good is constant, i.e., it

does not vary with the accident probability:


 (5.1)        c(a) + a2 =   k,

where k is some positive constant. Obviously, in this example,

 all accident probabilities are equally desirable.
                                       —23—

          Under the negligence rule, let a <        1    be an arbitrarily

chosen accident probability used as the standard of care.

It is easily shown that firms will choose to just meet this
standard:11/
          —


(5.2)          aN =   a.

Thus, industry output under negligence is:


(5   3)           =
                       l+n [
                                ci— c(a)   —
                                               (l—X)a2]
                                                         J
                                                                 =   n
                                                                     l+nL
                                                                         [     — k + Xa2



          Under the no liability rule,         the accident probability

selected by firms minimizes perceived full costs:


(5.4)          c(a) +      (l—X)a   = k — Aa2.


Since perceived full costs decline with a,


(5.5)          a0 = 1.

Thus, industry output under no liability is:

                                — c(a)     —
                                               (l—A)a0       1   =
                                                                               —k ÷
(5.6)          q0 =
                                                             ]             L

          Given the accident probabilities and industry outputs
under negligence and no liability, social welfare for each

remedy can be determined by (2.3). A comparison of these
values leads to the conclusion that:


(5.7)          Wa WN as m            [] x,
where, recall, m = 1/n.             Note in particular           that if    consumer

misperceptions are sufficiently small, there are levels of
market power such that no liability is the preferred remedy.
                                  —24—

        Figure 2 illustrates this result, as well as the results

of section 4 in the context of this example."
        The simplifying assumption in the preceding example was

that full costs were constant. This was inessential; by
continuity, a region inwhich no liability is preferred will
still exist if there is a unique minimum to full costs as
long as full costs are "close" to being constant. The negli-
gence standard a would then be assumed to be the accident

probability that minimizes full costs.--'
        In the second example--which will show that no liability

may never be the preferred remedy——it will be assumed that

the demand curve is perfectly inelastic and given by:

                          —
(5.8)        p =              —
                   0,   q>q,

where      is some positive output and p is some positive price
exceeding full cost at the first-best accident probability.
        Under the negligence rule with the standard of care

corresponding to the first-best accident probability, firms

will choose this probability, a*, and industry output will
be q for any level of market power.-" Under no liability,
firms will choose an accident probability, a0, greater than

a* because of consumer misperceptions, and industry output

will be q regardless of market power)' Since industry
output is the same under both remedies but the accident

probability is first-best only under negligence, negligence

is preferred to no liability for all positive levels of
consumer misperceptions and any level of market power.

6.      A Numerical Example
        This section presents a numerical example which illus-

trates the results of the previous two sections and shows that

the various product liability remedies may result in substantially
different levels of social welfare. For this example, let

the demand for a perfectly safe good be


(6.1)        p = 250 — .OOlq,


let the loss from a product accident be


 (6.2)       P. =   500,

and let the cost of production be


 (6.3)       c(a) = 10 — SOlog(a).
         The first-best accident probability and industry

 output are then .1 and 124,850. This leads to a production

cost of 125.15, an expected accident cost of 50, and therefore

a full cost of 175.15. At the first-best output, the elasticity

of demand is -2.34.
         Table 1 summarizes the welfare results for this example.

For combinations of consumer misperceptions and market

power below the heavy line, strict liability is the preferred
 remedy. For combinations above it, negligence is preferred.
 In this example, no liability is never the preferred remedy.

 Each box in the table presents the percentage loss in welfare
 from using the next most preferred remedy and the least pre-
 ferred remedy, where S, N, and 0 stand for strict liability,

                                 consumer misperceptions

            Note: Below the dark line, strict liability is the
                   preferred remedy; above it, negligence is
                     preferred.

    When there are no consumer misperceptions, recall from

Proposition 2 that the three remedies are equally desirable.
It. is thereforenot surprising to see in Table 1 that when

misperceptions are low, the welfare loss from using the wrong

remedy is small. For example, when A =     .1,   the loss never

exceeds 4 percent. When misperceptions are large, the welfare

loss from using the wrong remedy is substantial. For example,
when A =   1.0,   the loss from using even the next-best remedy
may be as high as 45 percent. Over a broad range

of intermediate levels of misperceptions, the welfare loss

from using the second—most preferred remedy ranges from

5 to 15 percent. For example, when A = .5 and m =       .5,   there

is a 10 percent loss from using strict liability rather than

negligence.

7.      Overestimates of the Accident Probability

        The model of this paper can easily be used to analyze

product liability rules when consumers overestimate the proba-
bility of an accident. In this case,-'

(7.1)
             a0>a*               a5   aN,

and

(7.2)        q* >   q   >
                            q0
                                  >




where the equality in (7.2) occurs only when market power is zero.
        Under strict liability, the accident probability is first-

best and industry output is too low to the extent that there

is market power for reasons already discussed. Under negli-
gence, the accident probability is also the first-best one

for reasons already discussed. However, because consumers
now overestimate the expected losses that remain, the output
of the industry is less than under strict liability. Under
no liability, the accident probability exceeds the first-best
level for reasons already discussed)1-" Output is less than
under strict liability for essentially the same reason as

under negligence——consumers view the full cost of the good

as higher than it actually is and therefore buy less. Output
is greater under no liability than under negligence because

only under the former rule do firms minimize the perceived

full cost of the good.

        Thus, when consumers overestimate the accident probability,

strict liability is the preferred rule regardless of the degree

of consumer misperceptions and market power. Strict liability
                             —28—

leads to the first-best accident probability, but to too
little output whenever there is any market power. Both negli-

gence and no liability worsen the problem of restricted output,
and no liability also leads to an excessive accident probability.

     Note, however, that when consumers overestimate the
accident probability, it may not be necessary to impose strict

liability on producers. Presumably producers would voluntarily
assume full liability through product warranties since con-
sumers would be willing to pay more than the actual cost of

providing the warranty.-'

8.   Concluding Remarks
     This section discusses several extensions and interpre-

tations of the analysis:

     (1)   If consumers are risk averse and do not have insur-

ance for product accidents, the effects of product liability
rules on risk bearing must also be taken into account. Assum-
ing that firms are risk neutral (or less risk averse than con-

sumers), then strict liability is preferable to both negligence

and no liability in this regard. Thus, strict liability
will be the preferred remedy for a wider range of consumer
misperceptions and market power than in the risk neutral case.

     (2) It was implicitly assumed in the model that the
consumer could not affect the probability of a product acci-
dent. Allowing for this possibility does not change the com-

parison between strict liability and negligence provided that
a defense of contributory negligence is included with both

rules and consumers meet the corresponding standard of care in
order to avoid being contributorily negligent. In other words, if
consumers choose the same level of care under strict liability
and negligence, the comparison of these rules is unaffected.

It is not clear whether the rule of no liability will become

more or less desirable relative to the other rules when con-

sumers can affect the accident probability.

     (3)   The results of the paper can be applied directly

to situations in which the victim of the product accident is
a third party rather than a consumer of the product. It is
                              —30—




easy   to see that this situation is equivalent to the case in

which the consumer is the victim and completely underestimates

the accident probability.
       Recall that, as consumer misperceptions increase, strict

liability becomes the preferred remedy over a wider range of

market power (see Figure 1). Thus, strict liability is more
likely to be the preferred remedy in situations in which the

victim is a third party.

       (4)   The analysis of this paper also canbe applied to

situations in which employees are exposed to workplace acci-
dents and the supply of labor is competitive. Under this
interpretation, employees are substituted for consumers and

the employees' wage rate is substituted for the price paid

by consumers. Lower wages correspond to higher prices.
       If firms have market power in the labor market, then the

results of the paper apply immediately. For example, if
firms are strictly liable to employees for workplace acci-
dents, then firms will choose the first-best level of workplace
safety but will purchase less than the first-best amount of

labor. However, if firms are liable only if negligent and
employees underestimate the accident probability, firms
will still choose the correct level of safety but will now

purchase more labor, which could be welfare—improving.

       If firms have market power in the product market, then
results analogous to those in the paper occur. For example,

it may be preferable to use negligence rather than strict lia-
bility to control workplace accidents in order to reduce the

price   of labor and thus increase output in the product market.
                            —31—

     (5)   The social welfare function used in this paper did

not take into account the distribution of total welfare between
producers and consumers. It is straightforward to show that
when consumers underestimate the accident probability, producers'
profits rise as the product liability rule is changed from

strict liability to negligence, and from negligence to no

liability, and that consumers' surpluses fall with these
changes. Thus, if distributional considerations are thought
to be important, the conclusions of this paper might have
to be modified.

was supported by the National Science Foundation through a

grant (SOC 78—20159) to the NBER. Helpful comments were pro--
vided by Carl Shapiro, Steven Shavell and participants in semi-

nars at the Federal Trade Commission, Harvard University, the

1)   The results of Epple and Raviv (1978, pp. 83-87) that
are relevant to the present discussion are the ones when
consumers cn purchase actuarially fair insurance (or are

risk neutral).     Although Hamada (1976) and Epple and Raviv

(1978) also consider consumer misperceptions, they do not

analyze the effects of misperceptions and market power simul-

taneous ly.


2)   To our knowledge, the general idea that it might be
desirable not to place the full costs of accidents on monopo-

lized industries was first suggested by Calabresi (1961,

pp. 507—14) .    For a related discussion, see Shapiro (1982).

3)   The qualitative results of the model remain true for

any downward—sloping demand curve.


4)   The basic results of the paper--those in sections 3 and

4--hold for any perception function y(a) characterized by

underestimation, y(a) <    a, and unresponsiveness, 0   y'(a) < 1.
                                      —33—

(For the propositions in section 4, the measure of misperceptions

would then be A = (a* -        y(a*))/a*,     where a* is defined by

 (2.5) below.) It is only when analytical

examples are constructed in section 5 and when the numerical

example is computed in section 6 that the assumption that

y(a) = (1—A)a is useful. For consistency, this form is

maintained throughout the paper.


5)   This assumption implies that, given a level of consumer
misperceptions, the level of market power does not affect

the firm's choice of the accident probability; see section 3.

In general, market power might affect the choice of the proba-

bilityforreasons discussed, for example, by Spence (1975,

pp. 417—22)


6)   It will be seen below that under this definition of

equilibrium, industry output increases from the monopoly
level to the competitive level as the number of firms increases.

Any equilibrium concept with this property would generate
the results of this paper.


7)   The n equations in n unknowns (q1                          ,
                                                                     q)   can be

rewritten as
                         n
                             q.   —   c(a*)   —   a*5
          q1 =
                 ci. —

                         j=1                            ,   i       =   1,...,n.

Since the right-hand-sides of each equation are identical,
qmust be the same for all i in any solution. Let q1 be

this common value., Substituting q for each firm's quantity
in the n equations above yields (3.8).

9)      From (3.14), firm i maximizes its profits for any

             q)     by choosing a to minimize

                    c(a.) + (1—A)a.2,
                                 1
                                                     a.
                                                      1        a*,
                       1


                    c(a.)
                       1
                            +   a.2,,
                                 1
                                                     a. >
                                                      1
                                                               a*.

In   other words, firm i minimizes the sum of production costs
and "relevant" expected accident losses, where the relevant

losses are the consumers' perceived losses when they bear
their own losses and the actual losses when firm i bears the
losses. This sum has its minimum at a* for the following
reasons. It is decreasing up to and including a* because,
as shown in the discussion of no liability later in this
section, the minimum of c(a) +              (1-A)a9 occurs at a higher
probability than a*. It is rising beyond a* because the

minimum of c(a) +           a occurs at a*. Since c(a*) +                 (l_A)a*9,   <


c(a*)    +   a*9,   the result follows.


10) Industry output under negligence,                            is   given by (3.16)

as a function of consumer misperceptions, A, and market power,

m (by substituting 1/rn for n). The optimal negligence line
is determined by setting q equal to q* and solving for m
as a function of A:

                            r        a*2                  A.
                                 — c(a*)   — a*9.)




11)     The argument is virtually identical to that discussed

in note 9 above.
                                     —35—


12) In this example, the optimal negligence line is:

                        r   a9       I A.
                                     1
                   m=   I
                            —k       j


Since a < 1, this line is flatter than the line separating
the no liability and negligence regions defined in (5.7).
The line separating the negligence and strict liability
regions has half the slope of the optimal negligence line.

13) For example, let a be any accident probability between
zero and one. Assume that full cost at a is k —              E for
some C   > 0,   that full cost at probabilities of zero and one

is k, and that full cost at other probabilities is determined

by joining these three points with two straight lines. Then
for any combination of A and m such that                >    in   the

example in the text, it is easy to see, that this welfare

ranking is preserved for sufficiently small .


14)   Industry output will be q in equilibrium for the follow-

ing reasons. Consider the output decision of an arbitrarily
selected firm. It views the aggregate output of the other

firms, , as fixed. If            <       q, this firm can increase its
profits by expanding its output until industry output equals

q. If      >    q, this firm will produce nothing since the
price would be zero if it produced any positive quantity.
Other firms will make the same decision until industry

output falls to q.

15) Industry output will be q for the reasons discussed in

the previous footnote.

16) These results follow from the analysis in section 3
with a perception function y(a), substituted for (l-A)a,

having the properties of overestimation, i(a) >   a, and unrespon-
siveness, 0    ',''   (a)   <   1.

17) Recall that this follows from the unresponsiveness of

perceptions.

18) For a discussion of voluntary product warranties which
complements the present analysis, see Courville and Hausman

(1979). In their model, when consumers overestimate the

accident probability, warranty coverage is complete and
producers provide the optimal level of reliability. When
consumers underestimate the accident probability, warranty
coverage is incomplete and the level of reliability is not

optimal. They show that these results do not depend on

whether the product market is competitive or monopolistic.
