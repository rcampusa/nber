  Labor Market Competition Among Youths, White Women and Others


                             ABSTRACT


     This paper examines labor market effects of increased labor force

participation Of youths and women.      Using 1969 cross-section data for

manufacturing, substitution elasticities for pairs of inputs from age-

race-sex aggregates of labor and c?pital are estimated.      Findings include

strong substitution between youths and white females, and complementarity

between many of the remaining inputs.      Then, allowing either rigid or

flexible youth wages, a ten percent increase in white female participation

is simulated.   Findings are respectively:     either a large decrease in

youth employment and   mode~ate   wage decreases of other labor, or moderate

decreases in wages of youths and white women.

                                 I.     Introduction


       The two most important phenomena in the labor market in the past

fifteen years have been the influx of large numbers of young workers and the

growth in participation of adult women.        The former is the result of the baby

boom of the 1950s; the latter stems from changes in attitudes, reductions in

discrimination, and lowered prices of substitutes for women's time at home.

Each phenomenon alone could have a substantial impact on the labor market.

In conjunction, their effects are compounded, with each group possibly

affecting the employment opportunities facing the other.

       A number of observers have argued that the youth unemployment problem

of the 1970s has been exacerbated by competition for jobs from the growing

number of adult women workers.        One has noted that, "The job prospects of

these youth are adversely affected, if indirectly, by the large supply of
                                                                 II
women still interested in joining the labor force.                    Another has

point~d   out that even in the 1980s "Competition for jobs will be intense and

the three major groups of competitors will consist of young white males,

young black males, and women of all working ages ••                   Yet another has

stated, "The growth in labor force participation by adult women probably

diminished the recovery's impact on the unemployment rates of all groups--

especially those of teenagers and non-white women."l           Implicit in all these

remarks are two statements about how labor markets work:              (1) Youth and adult

women are close substitutes in production, so that an influx of the latter

shifts the demand curve for youth sharply to the left; and (2) Wage rates of

youth are downward rigid, so that this shift is reflected in increased

unemployment rather than reduced wage rates.           Because some research, e.g.,

                                           1
                                          2

Freeman and Medoff (1978), finds indirect evidence that contradicts this view,

in this study we examine the direct evidence on the extent to which women

and youth are in fact substitutes in production.      The latter issue is ignored,

though some recent evidence suggests it may not be so important a problem as
                                  2
many observers seem to think.

         While there have been numerous studies of substitution among workers

of different groups, very few· of these have considered substitution between

age groups, and none has examined substitution among women and youth (see
                              3
Hamermesh and Grant, 1979).       Only Freeman (1979) includes women workers as a

separate category, and, because men ages 20 through 34 are aggregated, his

estimates tell us little about the issue of substitution between women and

youth.

         To fill this gap in our knowledge and provide some substantive basis

for accepting or rejecting the contentions cited above, we estimate substitu-

tion possibilities among a set of age-race-sex groups in the labor force.

The estimates are based on cross-section data from SMSAs in 1969, and they

allow us to consider how substitutable adult women are for young women or

young men.    The estimates are used, along with assumptions about the extent

of wage rigidity and elasticities of labor supply, to simulate the direct

and indirect effects of the growth of the female labor force on job

opportunities for youth, assuming rigid wages for young workers, and on the

wage rates of adult males, assuming these wages are flexible.


                   II.   Estimating Equations, Methods and Data


         Our estimates are based upon the trans10g approximation to a production

surface (see Christensen et. al., 1973).      We estimate the production function

using output shares, implicitly assuming that the production function is
                                                                                3

characterized by constant returns to scale, and firms are price-takers in

factor markets.                   The production function is used instead of the cost function

because, at least for older workers, factor quantities are more properly

viewed as exogenous than are factor prices.                                                   (See Hamermesh and Grant, 1979,

for a discussion of exogeneity assumptions appropriate for estimating

production models defined over labor-force subaggregates.)

          Let the N-factor production function, Q =F(X1""'~)' be approximated

by the trans10g form:

                                                                    1

N factor share equations for estimating the production technology are derived

from the N output elasticity equations:

While most work analyzing production relations has focused on partial

elasticities of substitution and price elasticities (see Allen, 1938), those

concepts are inappropriate if we are interested in considering the effects of

exogenous changes in factor quantities on factor prices.                                                            We therefore

concentrate on the Hicks partial elasticities of complementarity, defined as

They measure the ceteris paribus effect on relative factor prices of changes

supply is exogenous. Obversely, in the more commonly used cost-function

tableau, one must assume all input prices are exogenous.                      Since wage flexibility

seems, as noted above, to be a pervasive characteristic of the U.S. labor

market, and since the evidence suggests labor supply is quite inelastic for

most groups of workers, we can be fairly confident that the use of the produc-

tion function approach is more appropriate than would be the estimation of a

estimated production technologies, a general equilibrium approach that

specified supply relationships as part of the model would improve the results

(at the cost of substantial complexity).

Samples of Basic Records From the 1970 Census.                  Capital and output data are

gathered from issues of the Census of Manufactures and the Annual Survey

of Manufactures.            The County Group Public Use Samples identify all SMSAs over

250,000 in population in 1970.              The production model is estimated over the

67 SMSAs for which all the data could be constructed for the factor inputs

share equations (2) is then estimated using the iterative Zellner method,

a maximum-likelihood technique, over the cross-section data for manufacturing

in 1969.      In addition to being the first to examine substitution between

youth and adult women, our estimates are among the few that use cross-section

data to estimate parameters from flexible functional forms describing

production relations.


    III.     Estimates of Elasticities of Complementarity and of Factor Prices


           Before discussing the elasticity estimates based on the parameters

estimated in the cross section for manufacturing in 1969, it is worthwhile

considering whether the complete model in (2) is needed to describe production

relations among the five factors, or whether instead some types of separability

can be imposed.           Most interesting would be if we found that the labor

subgroups are jointly separable from capital.                  Though time-series studies

using broad occupational categories (blue-collar and white-collar labor) do

not find this (see Berndt and Christensen, 1974; and Denny and Fuss, 1977),

it may be implied by cross-section data covering the small demographic

subgroups used in this study that are of major interest for labor-market
                                              6

policy.     If so, we can conclude that estimates of the potential impact of such

policies can be simulated without using capital stock data that are often

difficult to construct.

          Unfortunately, the imposition of various restrictions implied by weak

separability of various sets of inputs from the others is generally inconsis-

tent with the data.                                             ..

weak separability in six cases which implicitly test popular notions about

the extent to which various groups are similar.            The only pair of inputs for

which the hypothesis of a consistent aggregate is not rejected is youths and

adult white women.     Youths and adult blacks cannot be treated as an aggregate,

nor can adult blacks and adult white males.            White adult males are also not

separable from other demographic groups, nor are adult white women.                 Finally,

and corroborating the results of the several time-series studies that have

tested for separability of (blue- and white-collar) labor from capital, the

hypothesis that they are separable is decisively rejected.           This implies that

studies that do not include measures of the capital stock are likely

producing unreliable estimates of the parameters describing substitution

are the appropriate measures of variance to attach to these parameter

estimates (and to the 8        in Table 3).       Accordingly, the first number in

 the shares are stochastic and approximate (3a) by a Taylor series, we still

. find that the estimated C.. exceeds its standard error.         The casual empiricism
                           1.J
cited in Section I of this paper appears to have at least some foundation on

the demand side of the labor market.        We also find that older blacks and

adult white males are substitutes.       This result follows unsurprising1y from

the observation that older blacks in manufacturing are mainly adult men who

are likely to be close substitutes for adult white men.           All the other pairs

of labor categories are seen to be complements, though in no case is the

complementarity relationship very strong.

        Table 3 shows the elasticities of factor prices computed from the

average fitted factor shares and the partial elasticities of complementarity.

Since these follow from the results in Table 2, substantial additional comment

is not required.    It is worth noting, though, that the largest cross elasticity

between any labor pair is that between the substitutes Y and OFW.

        As the results in Tables 2 and 3 show, each labor group is complementary

with inputs of physical capital.       This finding is inconsistent with Freeman's

(1979) time-series results on adult women and adult men.           It parallels,

though, that for white-collar workers in the many time-series studies that use

an occupational classification, but may be inconsistent with their results that

    IV.       The Effect of an Exogenous Increase in White Female Participation


          In this section we examine the impact of a ten percent increase in the

number of white women in the labor force, using the five-factor production

The simulation is designed to gauge the effects of the tremendous increase in

female labor force participation that has occurred since the early 1960s.

Whether employment displacement occurred, or whether the effect has been to

reduce the relative wage rates of youth, depends on whether in fact relative

wage rates of youth are rigid.            In our simulation we calculate the impact of

the increase in adult white female employment under the two extreme assumptions
                                                                                            13

          Equations (8) and (9) allow us to use the estimates in Table 2 to

calculate the effect of an increase in adult white female employment on the

employment of youths and on the wage rates of workers in other demographic

groups, under the assumption that youths' wage rates are rigid.                                          Equation

(8) states simply that the effect on youth employment is larger and more

negative the greater is the extent of q-substitutability of white women and

youths, the larger is the share of white women in output, and the smaller is

the share of youths.           Equation (9) states that the effect on other factor

prices depends both on their partial elasticities of complementarity with

white women and on the degree to which they are q-complements or substitutes

with youths and that youths are q-substitutes with white women.                                        (The first

term in parentheses enters because P.* is assumed fixed.)                                    If all wages are
                                                               1

flexible, the calculations reduce to:

the factor-price elasticities listed in Table 3.
                                         13

       The simulated effects of a ten percent increase in the labor force of

adult white women are shown in column (1) of Table 4, under the assumption

that the wages of young workers are rigid.     As they show, the ease with which

our estimates in Table 2 imply employers can substitute white women for youths

gives rise to an unbelievably large decrease in the employment of youths in

this simulation.     Moreover, even though white women and adult blacks, and

white women and white men, are complements, the simulated effect of the

increase in the white female labor force is to decrease the wage rates of

adult blacks and white men.     These effects occur because the first term in

the numer·atar. in   (9) outweighs the second due to the relative ease with

which employers can substitute white women for youths.     The rise in adult

white female employment induces a direct increase in the wage rates of its

complements, adult blacks and white men, but this is more than offset by the

induced decline in their wages as employers substitute white women for youths.

       If one takes the view that wages of youth are not rigid in the long

run, the appropriate estimates of the effect of the increased female partici-

pation are those shown in column (2) of the Table.     These are moderate

decreases in the wage rates of white women and youths, and slight increases

in the wage rates of the other inputs.     These estimates are likely to be

closer approximations to reality under the flexible-wage assumption than are

those in column (1) under the fixed-wage assumption.     This is because the

translog estimates on which they are based are for a production function,

that implicitly assumes that factor quantities are all exogenous, and thus

implicitly is based on a model of flexible wages.

       Regardless of whether one believes that wages of young workers are

rigid or flexible, we have shown that, because youths and white women are

substitutes in production, the flow of white women into the labor market has

caused some displacement in the earnings of young workers.      Under the fixed-

wage assumption this displacement would have taken the form of reduced

employment; under the flexible-wage assumption, it would have manifested

itself as a r.eduction in wage rates, and thus a steeper cross-section age-

earnings profile than would have otherwise been observed.      Part, perhaps 10

percent, of the sharp relative decline in earnings of young workers that

occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s (see Freeman, 1979, and Welch, 1979) is

thus attributable to the increase in the adult female labor force.      The baby

boom of the 1950s is not the only reason for the relative decline in earnings

in the youth labor force.


                                 VI.   Conclusions


       Our estimates and those of Grant (1979) are the first that present

tests for the separability of labor from capital using a disaggregation of

the labor force based on a classification other than by occupation.       The

results are clear and somewhat depressing:       Studies that seek to estimate

the extent of substitution in production among demographic groups must include

measures of the capital stock.     Given the difficulties of constructing such

measures even for the economy as a whole over time, and the near impossibility

of building up a capital measure for nonmanufactvring industries in a cross

section, our ability to derive accurate estimates of substitution parameters

describing the demand ~or labor is limited.      Indeed, because of the inappropriate-

ness of assuming separability, even unbiased estimates of the own-price

demand elasticity for small groups cannot be produced using data on the

group alone.

       Our most important finding is the extent to which white women and

youths are substitutes in production.     we   have shown, at least in the
                                          16
                                      ~
cross-section data for 1969 that we have used, and assuming the production-

function approach is the more appropriate one for this disaggregation of the

work force, that market forces change the relative wages received by these

two groups of workers in a direction opposite that of the change in their

relative quantities.    We have also demonstrated that each type of labor in

our age-race-sex disaggregation is complementary with capital, a finding that

is partly consistent with the time-series results for blue-collar and white-

collar labor.   It is inconsistent with past results that are based on the

disaggregation of the labor force by age and that use the inappropriate (for

this disaggregation) cost-function specification.

       Our estimates of white female-youth substitution imply strongly that

the growth of the white female labor force has hurt the earnings prospects

of young workers.     Whether this effect has worked through a decrease in

employment or a reduction in wages cannot be determined here.     However, that

it has occurred is the logical conclusion from our finding that these two

groups are easily substituted in production, and the observation that there

has been a sharp increase in adult female labor force participation in the

past fifteen years.     Competition from adult women has very likely had a

negative impact on the labor market for youths.

Youth Unemployment," April 5, 1979, unpublished; Alice Yohalem, Hearings

before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, 95:2, June 7, 1978, p. 255;

and Alice Rivlin, Hearings before the House Budget Committee, February 21,

1978, p. 53.

       2Freeman (l979) and Welch (1979) show that there has been substantial

adjustment in relative wages of youths over the past fifteen years, and Morse

(1980) indicates thaL except for black males, teenage wage rates did adjust

well between 1960 and 1970.   However, Johnson (1980) presents arguments why

one might, in the face of this evidence, believe the youth labor market is

not entirely free of wage rigidity.    Consistent with this view, King (1979)

presents tentative evidence of some effect of increased female participation

on youth unemployment.

       3The studies looking at substitution by age are Anderson (1977), Freeman

(1979), Grant (1979), Johnson-Blakemore (1979), and Welch-Cunningham (1978).

       4Sato and Koizumi (1973) layout the relationships among the substitu-

tion and complementary elasticities.

       5For adult males, and increasingly too for adult females, the evidence

is fairly clear that supply elasticities are nearly zero (see Borjas and

Heckman, 1978).   For other groups this assumption is less tenable.

       6For a description of the construction of the data see Grant (1979).

       7Even this fairly fine disaggregation of the work force may involve

some inadmissable aggregations.         For example, aggregation of youths 14-19 and

20-24 may be incorrect.         Nonetheless, the broader categorization is all that

the data    sour~e   allows; in any event, finer disaggregations simply did not

give estimates of the . C.. that are consistent with
                            ~                   .

        Berndt (1980) demon.strates that' when labor-capital separability is

inappropriately implicitly assumed, the resulting        cross~price   elasticities of

demand for factors are overestimated and the own-price elasticities of demand

are underestimated.

       10Those studies, however, only show that blue-collar labor and capital

are p-substitutes, a result which follows automatically once           one finds that

white-collar labor and capital are p-complements.        Further, because most

previous studies, including Grant (1979) and Anderson (1977), present

elasticities of substitution, their finding that each labor type is a p-

substitute for capital is not necessarily in conflict with our finding on

their q-complementarity.

       llIn an attempt to extend our work beyond manufacturing we estimated

the capital stock in the entire private nonfarm economy in each SMSA by

prorating the manufacturing capital stock by the ratio of hours worked.           The

capital stock measure was entered into equations (l).         The results were

disappointing:       The significance of theestimatedy .. dropped sharply.       It
                                                         1J
would appear that data limitations make it impossible to derive useful cross-

section estimates of labor-labor substitution parameters outside manufacturing,

since, as we have shown for manufacturing, a capital measure must be included

where none is available.

            Between May 1967 and May 1979 the share of the labor force accounted

for by white women 25+ grew from .243 to .268, roughly a ten percent increase.

Data by age, race, sex and industry cannot be obtained for each year, but we

can note that, as a percent of full-time employees in manufacturing, women

increased from 23.9 to 25.7 percent between 1967 and 1977.     (Computed from

Current Population Reports, P-60, Nos. 60 and 118.)

       l3Though we wish to simulate employment effects, our estimates are

based on manhours of inputs.     Assuming, as is standard in the literature,

that the exogenous change produces no long-run change in the relative prices

of persons and hours, our estimates are appropriate for simulating the long-run

effect of the influx of women.

       14This discussion is modelled after that in Johnson (1980).
