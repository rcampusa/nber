We provide a comprehensive account of the dynamics of eurozone countries from 2000 to 2012. We
analyze private leverage, fiscal policy, labor costs and interest rates and we propose a strategy to separate
the impact of credit cycles, excessive government spending, and sudden stops. We then ask how eurozone
countries would have fared with different policies. We find that most countries could have stabilized
their employment if they had followed more conservative fiscal policies during the boom. Macro-prudential
policies and an early intervention by the central bank to prevent market segmentation would also have
significantly reduced the recession.

1    Introduction
      The lesson to be learned from the crisis is that a currency union needs ironclad budget
      discipline to avert a boom-and-bust cycle in the first place.   Hans Werner Sinn (2010)
      On the eve of the crisis (Spain) had low debt and a budget surplus. Unfortunately, it
      also had an enormous housing bubble, a bubble made possible in large part by huge loans
      from German banks to their Spanish counterparts. Paul Krugman (2012)
      The situation of Spain is reminiscent of the situation of emerging economies that have
      to borrow in a foreign currency...they can suddenly be confronted with a “sudden stop”
      when capital inflows suddenly stop leading to a liquidity crisis.   Paul de Grauwe (2012)
      Countries which lost competitiveness prior to the crisis experienced the lowest growth
      after the crisis.   Lorenzo Bini Smaghi (2013)

These quotes illustrate a persistent disagreement about the best way to interpret the eurozone crisis.
Some argue that the crisis stems from a lack of fiscal discipline, some emphasize excessive private
leverage, while others focus on sudden stops or competitiveness divergence due to fixed exchange
rates. Most observers understand that all these factors have played a role, but do not oﬀer a way
to quantify their respective importance. In this context it is diﬃcult to frame policy prescriptions
on macroeconomic policies and on reforms of the eurozone. Moreover, given the scale of the crisis,
understanding the dynamics of the eurozone is one of the major challenge for macroeconomics today.
In this context, we propose a quantitative model to understand the dynamics of countries within
the eurozone.
    The ultimate goal of this paper is to perform counterfactual experiments. For instance, we want
to understand what would have happened to a particular country if it had run a diﬀerent fiscal policy
during the boom years, or if the eurozone had been able to prevent sudden stops. Our contribution
is to propose a model and an identification strategy to answer these questions. Needless to say, this
is a diﬃcult task that requires several steps: (i) specify a model and collect the data; (ii) find an
identification strategy; (iii) run counterfactual experiments.
    We analyze the dynamics of private debt, fiscal policy, and funding costs in a collection of small
open economies within a monetary union. Each economy has an independent fiscal authority and
is populated by patient and impatient agents. Impatient agents borrow from patient agents at
home and abroad, and are subject to time-varying borrowing limits. Governments borrow, tax, and
spend. Funding costs are linked to private and public debt sustainability. Nominal wages adjust
slowly and changes in nominal expenditures aﬀect employment.

Business Cycle Accounting in the Eurozone Our first contribution is to perform a business
cycle accounting exercise for the eurozone. We show that the parsimonious model outlined above
does a fairly good job at replicating the dynamics of each country from 2000 to 2012. It is important
to emphasize that we focus on the dynamics of each country relative to the eurozone average. This


                                                   2
approach helps us identify the model by netting out some aspects of monetary policy and exchange
rate fluctuations. For instance, we seek to explain relative employment and inflation in Spain, but
not aggregate employment and inflation in the eurozone. We show that, given the relative paths of
private debt, government spending and interest rates from 2000 to 2012, the model predicts fairly
well the relative paths for GDP, employment, inflation, net exports, etc. All the driving variables
are directly observable and the model has very few degrees of freedom.
    It is clear, however, that this exercise cannot tell us what caused the recessions in diﬀerent
countries. Private debt, fiscal policy and funding costs are endogenous equilibrium objects, and we
want instead to identify “sudden stop” shocks, “private lending” shocks, and “discretionary” fiscal
choices. All these shocks aﬀect interest rates, debt dynamics, and via general equilibrium eﬀects
and policy responses, output and employment. We therefore need an identification strategy.

Identification Strategy           The strategy we propose is based on a combination of functional re-
strictions, instrumental variable regressions, and the use of a control group.
    We first specify the decision rule that pins down government spending as a function of the state
of the economy. We assume that the government seeks to stabilize employment near its natural
rate, cuts spending in response to an increase in borrowing costs, and is subject to a country-specific
spending bias. The first two components of the decision rule are the same in all countries. The
third component contains one parameter per country, which is the bias needed to reconcile actual
and predicted average spending during the boom. We estimate a small (essentially zero) “political
economy” bias in several countries, such as Germany and Portugal, and a large one in some other
countries, such as Greece for instance.
    We then model sudden stops as a common risk factor that increases after 2008, and we show that
it materializes in countries with high public and private debts, including implicit liabilities linked
to bank recapitalization costs. We use instrumental variables to estimate the impact of public and
private debts on the economy’s cost of funds, assuming that governments did not anticipate that a
crisis would come at the end of the boom.
    The last identification issue is the most diﬃcult. We need to ascertain how the sudden stop
aﬀects the dynamics of private debt. This is complicated because private deleveraging can happen
even without sudden stop and because we are not willing to impose the same restrictions regarding
functional forms and anticipations on private agents as we impose on governments. Our key idea
instead is to use the United States as a control group. The U.S. experience is both similar and
diﬀerent from the eurozone experience. A salient feature of the Great Recession in both monetary
unions is that regions that have experienced large swings in private borrowing have also experienced
large declines in employment and output. Figure (1) shows that the change in households’ debt-to-
income ratios during the boom (2003-2007) predicts the change in employment during the private
credit crunch (2007-2010).1 The important point for our purpose is that, until 2010, the American
   1
     The figure is for the largest US states and eurozone countries. State level household debt for the US comes from
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, see Midrigan and Philippon (2010). The mean changes are diﬀerent since
the private boom/bust cycle is a bit larger in the U.S., but this is not an issue for us since, as explained earlier, we


                                                           3
and European experiences look strikingly similar. In both cases, there is a significant dispersion
of leverage and employment, a very good fit, and (almost) the same slopes. This suggests similar
structural parameters governing the endogenous propagation mechanism.

    A significant diﬀerence between the two regions appears only after 2010 when the eurozone
experiences sudden stops, financial fragmentation, and sovereign debt crises coupled with the risk
of a breakup of the currency union.2 States within the U.S. do not experience sudden stops, but
they reduce their private leverage nonetheless. Our identification strategy is then to use actual
private debt dynamics across the U.S. to construct predicted debt series across eurozone countries.
We argue that these are the private debt dynamics that would prevail in the eurozone without
financial fragmentation. Importantly, these predicted debt series are far from constant and failure
to recognize this fact would lead to severe biases in the estimations of the true causes of the eurozone
crisis.

Structural Model and Counter-Factual Experiments Our structural model therefore fea-
tures endogenous private debt, fiscal policy and cost of funds. The exogenous driving forces are a
time varying risk of sudden stop (one time series), country specific political economy biases (one
number per country), and the predicted private debt series (one time series per country). We show
that this structural model fits the data well. Given the exogenous driving forces, the model predicts
fairly well the relative paths of GDP, employment, inflation, net exports, public debt and private

focus on dynamics relative to the average.
    2
      Sudden stops were frequent in the 19th and 20th centuries but we do not know of any other historical example
of a sudden stop inside a monetary union. See Accominotti and Eichengreen (2013).


                                                                                         4
debt from 2000 to 2012. This is a demanding exercise since we ask the model to predict the booms,
the turning points and the busts for all the series and all the countries.
   The critical advantage of the structural model – compared to the model that takes as given the
paths of private debt, government spending and spreads, as explained above – is that we can use
the structural model to perform counterfactual experiments. We perform four such experiments.
   We first ask how countries would have fared if they had followed more conservative fiscal policies
during the boom. To do so, we shut down the “political economy spending bias” of the structural
model. We find that such policies lead to lower spreads and less need for fiscal austerity during the
bust. Periphery countries partially stabilize their employment. This is especially true for Greece,
and to a lesser extent for Ireland and Spain. For Ireland, however, this more conservative policy
requires buying back the entire stock of public debt, which suggests that fiscal policy is unlikely to
be enough as a stabilization tool against a large credit boom.
   We then ask how these countries would have fared if they had conducted macro-prudential
policies to limit the increase in private debt. This policy stabilizes private demand and therefore
employment, and it reduces the need for bank recapitalization, leading to lower spreads and more
room for countercyclical fiscal policy, especially in Ireland. Our experiment also uncovers a new
interaction between macro-prudential and fiscal policies. A biased government substitutes public
debt for private debt in response to restrictive macro-prudential policy, thereby undoing some of
the macro-prudential benefits. This suggests a complementarity between fiscal rules and macro-
prudential rules.
   In a third counterfactual experiment, we assume that the European Central Bank’s OMT pro-
gram (and Mario Draghi’s “Whatever it takes” speech) is announced in 2008 rather than in 2012.
This reduces the risk of a breakup of the eurozone, prevents the increase in spreads, and allows
the four periphery countries to stabilize employment after 2010. Interestingly, the counter-factual
employment dynamics across the eurozone then look similar to the observed dynamics across the
United States.
   In our last counterfactual, we let countries engineer a 10% fiscal devaluation in 2009. This
generates a boom in exports, a shorter and milder recession, and a successful fiscal adjustment with
a lower public debt in 2012. Overall, our results are consistent with many policy makers’ beliefs
about the crisis, but we are the first to formalize and quantify them.

Literature review Our paper is most directly related to three lines of research: macro-economic
models with credit frictions, in particular that of Eggertsson and Krugman (2012); open-economy
models with interest rates shocks, as in Neumeyer and Perri (2005); and analyses of the eurozone
crisis such as Lane (2012) for instance.
   Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), Bernanke et al. (1999) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) consider
credit constraints that limit corporate investment, while we put more emphasis on household credit,
as Mian and Sufi (2012), Midrigan and Philippon (2010) and Eggertsson and Krugman (2012). This
diﬀerence matters mostly when we fit the model with cross-sectional data. A striking feature of


                                                  5
the data is the strong correlation between household leverage and employment at the micro-level.
Mian and Sufi (2012) show that diﬀerences in household debt overhang explains why unemployment
is higher in some counties than in others. These facts are not easily explained by a “local lending
channel” or by credit constraints that operate only at the firm level, presumably because business
lending is not very localized in the U.S.3
    The literature on sudden stops in emerging markets focuses on the rapid imposition of an
external credit constraint, and usually emphasizes Fisherian amplification when debts and in-
comes are denominated in diﬀerent currencies (see Christiano and Roldos 2004; Chari et al. 2005;
Mendoza and Smith 2006; Mendoza, 2010; Korinek and Mendoza 2013). The sudden stops them-
selves can be explained by multiple equilibria in international financial markets with transaction
costs, as in Martin and Rey (2006). By contrast, we focus on countries that belong to a monetary
union and our model integrates, for the first time to our knowledge, both domestic and external
debt dynamics. This is critical for understanding the eurozone crisis since, as we have explained,
private deleveraging would have created a recession even without an external credit constraint.
In Neumeyer and Perri (2005) interest rates shocks, either exogenous or induced by productivity
shocks, generate sudden stops and current account reversals because they induce a working capital
shortage. In our model, the increase in interest rates generates a demand shock through a fall in
private and public expenditures.
    Our business cycle accounting exercise is similar in spirit to the work of Chari et al. (2007) but
we emphasize diﬀerent shocks. While most of the sudden stop literature has emphasized credit
constraints, Gopinath (2004) and Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) have focused on TFP shocks. In
Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) a negative shock to trend growth leads to a fall in consumption and an
increase in the trade balance.4 TFP shocks are certainly important in emerging markets, but they do
not seem to explain the dynamics of euro area countries during the great recession. Countries hit by
sudden stops (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Portugal) do not experience the largest reversals in trend
TFP growth, and there is no correlation between changes in TFP growth and employment losses
during the recession (see figure (21) in Appendix B.1). In fact, the only country that shows signs of
TFP growth during the boom years is Greece, but the reliability of these numbers is questionable.
    Our paper is related to the literature on sovereign credit risk (see Eaton and Gersovitz 1982;
Arellano 2008; Mendoza and Yue 2012) but we do not actually model strategic default decisions.
We focus instead on how sovereign default risk aﬀects the real economy. Corsetti et al. (2013) model
   3
      Mian and Sufi (2010) find that the predictive power of household borrowing remains the same in counties dom-
inated by national banks. It is also well known that businesses entered the recession with historically strong balance
sheets and were able to draw on existing credit lines, as shown by Ivashina and Scharfstein (2008). On the other hand,
our model is perfectly consistent with firm level credit constraints in addition to household level credit constraints, as
discussed recently by Giroud and Mueller (2015). Our approach is also consistent with the lending constraints view
of Justiniano et al. (2014).
    4
      Gopinath (2004) proposes a model with a search friction to generate asymmetric responses to symmetric shocks.
A search friction in foreign investors’ entry decision into emerging markets creates an asymmetry in the adjustment
process of the economy: An increase in traded sector productivity raises GDP on impact, and it continues to grow
to a higher long-run level. On the other hand, a decline in traded sector productivity causes GDP to contract in the
short run by more than it does in the long-run. Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) do not study the response of the labor
market but it is well known that income eﬀects tend move consumption and hours in opposite directions.


                                                            6
such a “sovereign risk channel” through which sovereign default risk raises the private sector cost of
funds. A high cost of funds forces the government to cut spending and our model is qualitatively
and quantitatively consistent with the recent research on fiscal multipliers at the regional level (see
Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014; Farhi and Werning 2013).
    The papers by Lane (2012) and Shambaugh (2012) provide a thorough description of the
four dimensions of the eurozone crisis: public debt, private debt, sudden stop and competitive-
ness. The specific role of the boom/bust cycle in capital flows is analyzed by Lane (2013) while
Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) show that domestic credit expansion is the most robust predictor of
financial crises. Battistini et al. (2014) argue that the perceived risk of a eurozone breakup is a key
driver of financial fragmentation during the crisis. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2012) emphasize the
role of downward wage rigidity. Some papers also compare and describe the specific circumstances
of individual countries. Fernández Villaverde et al. (2013) argue that loose financing conditions and
capital inflows following the creation of the euro relaxed the pressure for reforms in the four periph-
ery countries. Reis (2013) argues that capital misallocation explains the low growth of Portugal
between 2000 and 2007. Whelan (2014) stresses the role of cheap credit and lax banking regulation
in Ireland, and Cunat and Guadalupe (2009) analyzes the lending behavior of the Spanish Cajas in
the run up to the crisis. While our model cannot do justice to the specificities of every single coun-
try, it nonetheless gives an interpretation of the crisis that is consistent with the views expressed in
these various papers.

    The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the model and in
section 3 we analyze its dynamic properties. Section 4 compares the predictions of the reduced form
model to the data. In Section 5 we estimate the structural relations between private leverage, fiscal
policy and sudden stops. The structural model is used to conduct our counterfactual experiments
in section 6. Section 7 concludes. There are also several Appendices presenting the data sources,
the various adjustments that need to be made to the raw data, the details of the model, and the
simulations.


2    Model
We model a currency union with several regions. We follow Gali and Monacelli (2008) and study
a small open economy that trades with other regions. Each region j produces a tradable domestic
good and is populated by households who consume the domestic good and a basket of foreign
goods. Following Mankiw (2000) and more recently Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), we assume
that households are heterogenous in their degree of time preference. More precisely, in region j,
there is a fraction χj of impatient households, and 1 − χj of patient ones. Patient households
(indexed by i = s for savers) have a higher discount factor than borrowers (indexed by i = b for
borrowers): β ≡ βs > βb . Saving and borrowing are measured in units of the common currency
(euros).

                                                                                  f

                        ui,j,t = αj log                    + (1 − αj ) log                    − ν (Ni,j,t)

With these preferences, households of region j spend a fraction αj of their income on home goods,
and 1 − αj on foreign goods. The parameter αj measures how closed the economy is, because of
home bias in preferences or trade costs. The demand functions are then:

where Fj,t is foreign demand and Gj,t are nominal government expenditures. Note that we assume
that the government spends only on domestic goods. Define nominal gross domestic product as

                                                       Yj,t ≡ Wj,t Nj,t,

and total private expenditures as

                                          Xj,t ≡ χj Xb,j,t + (1 − χj )Xs,j,t .




                                                                 8
It is useful to write the market clearing condition in nominal terms (in euros) as follows:

                                      Yjt = αj Xj,t + Fj,t + Gj,t .                                 (2)

2.2   Inter-temporal budget constraints
Let Bj,t be the face value of the debt issued in period t − 1 by impatient households and due in
period t. Each household supplies labor at the prevailing wage and receives wage income net of
taxes (1 − τj,t) Wj,tNj,t . They also receive transfers from the government Zj,t . It will be convenient
to define disposable income (after tax and transfers but before interest payments) as

                                      Ỹj,t ≡ (1 − τj,t) Yj,t + Zj,t .

The budget constraint of impatient households in countryj is then

                                     Bj,t+1
                                              + Ỹj,t = Xb,j,t + Bj,t ,                             (3)
                                     1 + rj,t
where rj,t is the nominal cost of funds between t and t + 1. Notice that the budget constraint
is written without the possibility of default by the borrower. In such a case, and without taking
into account issues of market liquidity, the cost of fund is the same as the interest rate. When we
discuss the model, we therefore refer to rj,t as the interest rate. But when we turn to the data, it
is obviously critical to remember that rj,t is really meant to capture the cost of funds. We assume
that interest rates are time-varying and potentially country-specific. Borrowing is subject to the
                 h :
exogenous limit Bj,t
                                                         h
                                                 Bj,t ≤ Bj,t .                                      (4)

The savers’ budget constraint is:

                                                                    Sj,t+1
                                     Sj,t + Ỹj,t = Xs,j,t +                ,                       (5)
                                                                   1 + rj,t

so their Euler equation is                             #                 $
                                            1              β (1 + rj,t )
                                                = Et                       .                        (6)

Note that financial markets clear in two ways in our model. Given that impatient agents are
quantity constrained, interest rates do not aﬀect their borrowing. For the patient agents, their
saving is determined by the interest rate through the Euler equation.
   The government budget constraint is:
                                  g
                                 Bj,t+1                                g
                                            + τj,tYjt = Gj,t + Zj,t + Bj,t ,                        (7)
                                 1 + rj,t
       g
where Bj,t is public debt issued by government j at time t − 1.

2.3      Exports and foreign assets
Nominal exports are Fj,t and nominal imports are (1 − αj ) Xj,t since the government does not buy
imported goods while private agents spend a fraction 1 − αj on foreign goods. So net exports are:

                                              Ej,t = Fj,t − (1 − αj ) Xj,t .                                            (8)

The net foreign asset position of the country at the end of period t, measured in market value, is:

                                                                    h        g

                                 Aj,t   ≡ (1 − χj )          − χj         −         .                                   (9)

Adding up the budget constraints, we have the spending equation
                                                                                                   g

                                                  h                             Sj,t+1                       g
        Xj,t + Gj,t = Yj,t + χj                − Bj,t       − (1 − χj )                 − Sj,t +          − Bj,t      (10)

Total spending (public and private) equals total income (nominal GDP) plus total net borrowing.
If we combine with the market clearing condition (2), we get the current account condition

                                   CAj,t ≡ Aj,t − Aj,t−1 = Ej,t + rj,t−1 Aj,t−1 ,

It will often be convenient to rewrite (10) with disposable income as

ployment (real output) is given by Nj,t =              Wj,t .   We assume that wages are sticky and we ration the
labor market uniformly across households. This assumption simplifies the analysis because we do
not need to keep track separately of the labor income of patient and impatient households within a
country. Not much changes if we relax this assumption, except that we lose some tractability.5 We




    5
     In response to a negative shock, impatient households would try to work more. The prediction that hours
increase more for credit constrained households appears to be counter-factual however. One can fix this by assuming
a low elasticity of labor supply, which essentially boils down to assuming that hours worked are rationed uniformly in
response to slack in the labor market. Assuming that the elasticity of labor supply is small (near zero) also means that
the natural rate does not depend on fiscal policy. In an extension we study the case where the natural rate is defined
                                                                                wj
by the labor supply condition in the pseudo-steady state ν ′ (n⋆i ) = (1 − τj ) xi,j . We can then ration the labor market
                                           n⋆ (τ )
relative to their natural rate: ni,j,t = ! in⋆ (τ ) nj,t where n⋆i (τ ) is the natural rate for household i in country. This
                                          i i
ensures consistency and convergence to the correct long run equilibrium. Steady state changes in the natural rate are
quantitatively small, however, so the dynamics that we study are virtually unchanged. See Midrigan and Philippon
(2010) for a discussion.


                                                                10

where N̄j is the natural rate of employment. There are several points to discuss about this speci-
fication. We assume that the natural rate N̄j is constant within country. This assumption will be
rejected for Germany following the Hartz labor market reforms of 2003-2005 and our model will
under-predict relative employment in Germany. Since our focus is on the crisis-hit countries we do
not view this as an important problem. Another important assumption is that κ is the same in all
regions (i.e., we write κ and not κj ). This assumption is motivated by existing research, notably
Montoya and Dohring (2011) who find fairly similar Phillips curve coeﬃcients across eurozone coun-
tries.6 The same authors also find that the coeﬃcients on inflation expectations are small relative to
the backward-looking terms, which is why we omit the forward looking component for simplicity.7

2.5    Discussion of the main modeling assumptions
We have left out of the model all items that do not seem strictly necessary to identify the sources
of the Great Recession across eurozone countries.8 The first version of the model had an explicit
housing sector, but we decided to remove it to simplify the paper. Given the importance of housing
in explaining the rise in household debt in Spain and Ireland, this choice deserves an explicit
discussion. Obviously, we are not arguing that housing does not matter. It does, but the right
question is exactly how, and more precisely, whether it matters independently of debt. In the class
of models that we are considering, it turns out that housing matters (essentially) through debt.
The reason can be understood from the work of Midrigan and Philippon (2010), where the debt
constraint (4) is derived from a standard collateral constraint: Bj,t ≤ ηQj,t Hj,t, where Qj,t and Hj,t
are the price and quantity of housing, and η is a parameter (which can be time varying if needed
but this is immaterial for our discussion). If the supply of housing is fixed at the island level and
Hj,t = H̄j is an equilibrium condition, then the dynamics of this economy are exactly the same
                                                                           h = ηQ H̄ . It
as the dynamics of an economy without housing where we exogenously impose Bj,t   j,t j

   6
       Montoya and Dohring (2011) find that the “estimates for the Member States are fairly well in line with the
estimates for the euro area aggregate.” For the main coeﬃcient of interest, only two countries have estimates above
or below one standard deviation of the euro area estimate. Importantly, there is no geographical pattern in the
distribution of the coeﬃcients, which we interpret as saying that the diﬀerences are probably just noise.
     7
       This is not a strong assumption. As explained in the introduction, we focus on relative dynamics, i.e. the
dynamics of a country relative to the eurozone average. For nominal wages, we write Wj,t = Wt∗ wj,t , where Wt∗ is
a wage index for the eurozone, and wj,t is the country specific deviation from the average. We can assume that Wt∗
follows a standard Neo-Keynesian Phillips curve, as in Chapter 6 of Gali (2008). We do not dispute that changes in
expected inflation via monetary policy signaling are important, but they are captured by Wt∗ . For wj,t we find that
the simple Phillips curve (12) does a good job matching the data. We have also estimated a more general model and
found that the forward looking component does not improve the fit of the model.

       We also ignore corporate investment but this is a lesser concern. First, for all firms (SMEs) that are credit
constrained, we simply add their debts to our constrained households’ debts since what matters is only the implied
budget constraint. Other firms follow a q-equation similar to our Euler equation. There is only a quantitative
diﬀerence in how we interpret the inter-temporal elasticity given that spending on durable goods can be more sensitive
to interest rates than spending on non-durable goods.

is indeed easy to check that both the first order conditions and the market clearing conditions are
identical in the two economies. In that case, housing matters only through debt and we find it
more transparent to model debt directly. The equivalence breaks down if the quantity of housing
is endogenous because the labor market clearing condition must include construction workers. The
downside of not including housing explicitly is therefore only that we might fail to capture the
diﬀerential dynamics of hours worked in construction relative to hours worked in the rest of the
economy. We argue that this is a small price to pay for a major simplification.9
    Another simplification of our approach is that we model directly the (private and public) cost of
funds, instead of modeling the details of each domestic financial system. It is important to emphasize
that we will nonetheless take into account the feedback between sovereign debt and private credit,
as well as the impact of bank recapitalizations on sovereign risk. These are the main channels of
contagion that have been discussed in the context of the eurozone crisis. It is of course possible to
study banking debt overhang in a fully specified model – as in Philippon and Schnabl (2013) for
instance – but the economic consequences of debt overhang ultimately occur through the cost of
funds. The structural equation we would end up estimating would be exactly the same as the one
we are actually going to estimate, so our simulation would be exactly the same. The downside of
not modeling banking explicitly is that we cannot answer micro questions about banking. We are
able to quantify the benefits of limiting private credit expansion, but we are not able to say if this
should be done via direct supervision, capital adequacy ratios, or liquidity regulations. These are
important topics for future research.


3       Dynamic Properties of the Model
We now study the dynamics of a small open economy subject to shocks to the borrowing limit
                         h , to foreign demand F , to interest rates, and to fiscal policy. We
of impatient households Bj,t                    j,t
present some simple impulse response functions to build intuition about the mechanics of the model.
The details of the assumptions and policy functions used to compute these impulse responses are
in Appendix A.6, while Martinez and Philippon (2014) provide a more theoretical discussion of
the same framework, in particular regarding the behavior of savers. Here we only mention one
insight that is useful to interpret the impulse responses. Saver’s spending (in euros) reacts neither
     h , nor to G
to Bj,t            j,t nor to Zj,t , because shocks to these variables aﬀect the path of disposable
income but not the net present value (in euros) of disposable income. As a result, these shocks
aﬀect the expenditures of impatient agents (that are eﬀectively hand-to-mouth) but not those of
patient agents. Shocks to foreign demand or to interest rates, on the other hand, aﬀect directly
the expenditures of patient agents. These results rely on the log preferences of Cole and Obstfeld
(1991). They are convenient because they allow us to solve the nominal side of the model (all

    9
     Even with endogenous construction the dynamics of nominal spending are the same. The equivalence holds in
our setup because we have two permanent types of households, patient and impatient. It would not necessarily hold
in the more advanced setup of Kaplan and Violante (2011) where precautionary savings are important. In that case
modeling housing separately could bring new insights, but this is far beyond the scope of this paper.

variables in euros) independently of the Phillips curve, and we show later that they seem consistent
with the data. Of course, even when nominal expenditures remain constant, real consumption
changes because prices (equal to wages) react to changes in aggregate spending.
    We now outline how we compute the dynamics of a country relative to the eurozone, and then
we present the impulse responses to the various shocks.

3.1      Scaling and Spreads
We now define the country specific component of the variables of the model. We denote by “*”
variables that are measured at the level of the monetary union as whole. We assume that the vari-
ance of interest rate shocks is small and we linearize the Euler equation (6) as Et [Xs,j,t+1 ] ≈
                                                                                      ' ∗ (
β (1 + rj,t ) Xs,j,t . The equivalent equation for the monetary union as a whole is Et Xs,t+1   ≈
β (1 + rt∗ ) Xs,t
              ∗ , where r ∗ is the interest rate for the monetary union as a whole. We define the
                         t
spread as:
                                                                1 + rj,t
                                                  1 + ρj,t ≡
                                                                1 + rt∗
                                                                                  ∗ . We define
In Appendix A.1 we scale all our variables by aggregate (unconstrained) spending Xs,t

                                                               Xs,j,t
                                                    xs,j,t ≡     ∗ .                                  (13)
                                                               Xs,t

We can then write the Euler equation as

                                          Et [xs,j,t+1 ] ≈ (1 + ρj,t ) xs,j,t.                        (14)

From now on we work only with scaled variables (in lower case). For example, the patient budget
constraint becomes:

                                                     β
                                       xs,j,t +            sj,t+1 = sj,t + ỹj,t.
                                                  1 + ρj,t
Similarly the scaled Phillips curve is:

                                             wj,t
                                                   = 1 + κ (nj,t − 1) .
                                            wj,t−1

               Nj,t /N̄j
where nj,t ≡   Nt∗ /N̄ ∗
                           is employment of country j in deviation to its natural level and to the eurozone
level.
   Finally, we assume throughout the paper that Et [fj,t+1 ] = fj,t so that the shocks to foreign
demand are assumed to be permanent. In the empirical section we will assume that spreads follow
an AR(1) process with persistence θ, so Et [ρt+1 ] = θρt .

    In figure (2) a permanent increase in the household debt enables impatient households to increase
spending immediately while patient agents’ expenditures do not move. This is because savers
understand that the net present value (in euros) of their disposable income has not changed. For
the government we assume a mildly counter-cyclical policy: g and z are set one period in advance,
so when tax revenues go up, government debt falls. After the shock the policy simply stabilizes the
level of debt. GDP follows aggregate spending, the current account turns negative, and employment
goes up. The shock has a permanent impact on net foreign assets, but a temporary impact on
employment and wages.
    Figure (15) in Appendix A.6 shows the impact of a permanent increase in government spending.
The consequences are similar to those of a private credit expansion, except of course that public
debt increases. Impatient agents spend more because their income rises, while patient agents do

     The following parameters: α = 0.75, χ = 0.5, r = 0.05, κ = 0.2, τ = 0.4. Prices, wages and employment are
normalized to unity at time t = 0. The debt to income ratio is set at 60% for impatient households at time t = 0,
so that the household debt to income ratio is 30%. The government debt to GDP ratio is set at 50% and the net
foreign asset position over GDP at zero at time t = 0. The shock is a 20% increase of the variable at t = 1.


                                                                        14
not change their nominal spending and nominal interest rates in the small open economy do not
change. Prices are permanently higher in the long run. Figures (2) and (15) show the response
of the economy to two types of autonomous spending: that of constrained agents, and that of the
government. The spending multipliers are increasing functions of αi and χi . A higher share of
impatient agents in the economy implies that an increase in disposable income has a larger impact
on aggregate expenditures. A higher share of spending on domestic goods reduces leakage through
imports. Figure (16) in Appendix A.6 shows the response to an increase in domestic interest
rates.11 It induces patient households to save more, so it reduces their expenditures and generates a
recession (fall in nominal GDP and in employment) that forces impatient households to reduce their
spending. Imports fall and the net foreign asset position improves. Because of lower tax revenues,
the recession increases public debt. Figure (17) in the Appendix shows that an increase in foreign
demand permanently increases nominal GDP. Spending of both patient and impatient households
increase. The net foreign asset position improves. Public debt falls because of higher tax revenues.


4        Reduced Form Model
We simulate 11 eurozone countries from 2000 to 2012: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland,
France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal and calibrate the shocks on the observed
data. The data sources are described in Appendix B.1.

4.1      Calibration
The parameters used in the simulations are presented in Table (1). The discount factor (of patient
households) and the Philipps curve parameter are standard. The country-specific parameters – the
share of credit constrained households (χj ) and the domestic share of consumption (αj ) – are shown
on Figure (3).

    For these impulse response functions we assume an iid process for the spread shock. However, for simulations
we use an AR process with the estimated persistence parameter θ.

of indirect imports. For our sample of countries the average implied domestic share in 2005 (the
latest date in their study) is 72.7%. The lowest is 66.4% for Belgium and the highest is 78.7% for
Italy. For foreign demand Fj,t , given the absence of an intermediate goods sector in our model, we
take the domestic value added that is associated with final consumption in the rest of the world,
which corresponds to value added based exports. As detailed in Appendix B.1, we use the data
from the OECD-WTO Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) initiative to measure this. The scaled value-
added based exports are shown in figure (26) in Appendix B.3. Finally, we take into account net EU
transfers, which are the diﬀerence between EU spending in the country and the country contribution
to the EU. In our model, such transfers play exactly the same role as foreign demand, so we add
EU net transfers to exports in the goods market equation.

Share of Constrained Households: For the country specific share of credit constrained house-
holds, χj , we use a measure based on the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey
(HFCS).12 For each country, we use the fraction of households with liquid assets below two months
of total household gross income to approximate the share of credit constrained households.13 The
  12
      The survey took place in 2010. In Greece and Spain, the data were collected in 2009 and 2008-09 respectively.
This survey has been used recently by Kaplan et al. (2014) to quantify the share of hand-to-month households. They
define these as consumers who spend all of their available resources in every pay-period, and hence do not carry
any wealth across periods. They argue that measuring this behavior using data on net worth (as consistent with
heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models) is misleading because this misses what they call the wealthy hand-to-
mouth households. These are households who hold sizable amounts of wealth in illiquid assets (such as housing or
retirement accounts), but very little or no liquid wealth, and therefore consume all of their disposable income every
period. They define hand-to-mouth consumers as those households in the survey whose average balances of liquid
wealth are positive but equal to or less than half their earnings.

      We thank Caterina Mendicino from the ECB who provided us the data. At the eurozone level, the median
household has 18.6% of its annual income (equivalent to just above two months’ income) available in the form of


                                                           16
average for our set of countries is 48% with a maximum of 64.8% for Greece and a minimum of
34.7% for Austria. Ireland did not participate in the survey so for this country we use the average
of the eurozone. Note that bhj,t in the model is debt per impatient household so the counterpart to
the empirical measure of aggregate debt is χj bhj,t .

Funding Costs:         The cost of fund ρj,t enters the Euler equation of unconstrained agents. It
represents the expected return of savers, the funding cost of firms, etc. The true cost of funds is not
directly observable and we base our estimates on several interest rates: (i) loans rates for SMEs; (ii)
deposit rates; (iii) wholesale bank funding costs; and (iv) yields on 10-year government bonds. In
all cases we compute the diﬀerence between the rate in country j and the median of the eurozone
in year t.
    The link between interest rate spreads and funding costs can be complicated. On the one hand,
interest rates are not expected returns because they include expected credit losses. On the other
hand, we know from a large literature in finance that credit spreads create significant diﬀerences in
funding costs. This is the basic point of all models with distress costs, agency costs, debt overhang,
safety premia, etc. All these models predict that funding costs are increasing in credit spreads, but
less than one-for-one. Banks clearly play a special role during the crisis. Many borrowers depend
on bank loans and the funding costs of banks are therefore critical for the economy. We use data
on banks CDSs to estimate wholesale funding costs. Deposit rates are also informative even though
they tend to move more slowly than market rates. They also depend on the credibility of the deposit
insurance system. Debt overhang in the banking sector makes it more attractive for banks to invest
in the debt of their home sovereign, and this can crowd out private lending.14
    We want our synthetic measure to be as broad as possible, so ideally we want to use the average
of (i) loans rates for SMEs; (ii) deposit rates; (iii) wholesale bank funding costs. Unfortunately we
are severely constrained by data availability, as explained in Appendix B.1. The only series that are
available for all countries and all years are the spreads on government bonds. We therefore project
our three spreads (SME loans, deposits, wholesale funding) on the sovereign spreads and we take
the average of the projected values.15

Figure (27) in Appendix B.3 shows the government bond spreads and our synthetic measure ρj,t .
They are of course strongly correlated, but the important point is that ρj,t is a lot less volatile than
the government spread. In the case of Greece for instance, the sovereign spreads exceeds 20% in

liquid assets (see ECB-HFCS (2013)). Net liquid assets are the sum of deposits, mutual funds, bonds, non self
employment business wealth, (publicly traded) shares and managed accounts, net of credit line/overdraft debt, credit
card debt and other non mortgage debt
   14
      In the limit of a model à la Myers (1977), the bank may end up treating the entire yield as an expected return
because it only cares about the non-default state. See Philippon and Schnabl (2013) for a discussion of debt overhang.
   15
      We regress each of the country specific interest spreads (loans for SMEs, deposit rates and wholesale bank
funding costs captured by CDS rates) on a piecewise linear function of the 10-year government bonds spread. We
then take the simple average of the predicted values.

some years, and this is clearly a reflection of credit risk. Using this raw number in the simulations
would make no sense and would lead to too much volatility in spending. As we show below, our
synthetic measure seems to perform reasonably well in the simulations.
   Finally, agents in our model need to have an estimate of the persistence parameter θ for the
ρj,t series. A higher persistence amplifies the eﬀect of a given spread shock because it increases its
impact on the net present value of future income. It is clearly important to use a longer sample to
estimate the persistence so we extend all our spreads series to 2014 and we estimate θ by running
a panel regression with year and country fixed eﬀects. We estimate θ to be 0.5, which means that
if the spread is 100bps this year, agents anticipate that it will be 50bps next year.

Scaling: We scale the data in a manner consistent with equation (13). We construct the following
benchmark level of nominal GDP for country j at time t:

                                                 Yj,t0 L̄t0 Ȳt
                                       Ŷj,t ≡                  Lj,t ,
                                                 Lj,t0 Ȳt0 L̄t

where t0 is the base year (2002 in our simulations), Yj,t is GDP, Lj,t is population, and Ȳt and L̄t
denote the aggregate GDP and population for the eurozone. In words, the benchmark is the nominal
GDP the country would have if it had the same per-capita growth rate as the eurozone together with
its actual population growth. The key point is that the only country level time-varying variable that
we take as exogenous is population growth. We scale all our variables in euros by the benchmark
GDP. For GDP itself, we define
                                                         Yj,t
                                             yj,t ≡              ,
                                                         Ŷj,t
which is one in the base year. For sovereign debt, we define
                                                          g
                                                         Bj,t
                                             bgj,t   ≡           ,
                                                         Ŷj,t

which is equal to the actual debt to GDP ratio in the base year t0 , but then tracks the level of debt
for t > t0 , as in the model. This is important when we consider deleveraging. With large fiscal
multipliers, a reduction in debt might leave the debt to GDP ratio unchanged in the short run. Ratios
often give a misleading view of deleveraging eﬀorts. Figure (24) in Appendix B.3 shows the scaled
private and sovereign debt series. Figure (25) shows scaled public spending and transfers. Note also
that government spending is adjusted for expenditures on bank recapitalization. Prices and wages
are the same in our model so we use the average of unit labor costs and consumer prices scaled by the
average unit labor cost and consumer prices in the eurozone. For employment, we use employment
                                                                                              ∗

In our business cycle accounting exercise we take as given the observed series for private debt (bhj,t ),
fiscal policy (gj,t , zj,t , τj ) and interest rate spreads (ρj,t ). We define the reduced form model ℜ as a

The scaled data on observed shocks that feed the model for each country are shown in figures (24),
(25), (26) and (27) in Appendix B.3. For each country, we simulate the path between 2001 and
2012 of nominal GDP yj,t, employment nj,t, wages wj,t , net exports ej,t and public debt bgj,t . Figure
(4) shows the simulated and observed nominal GDP and net exports series. Figures (18) and (19)
in Appendix A.7 show employment and wages.

   The reduced form model reproduces well the cross sectional dynamics in the eurozone for nominal
GDP and net exports. In particular, it replicates well the boom and bust dynamics on nominal
GDP and the current account reversal for countries hit by the crisis. It is important to emphasize
that there is essentially no degree of freedom in our simulations. No parameter is set to match the
aggregate data. The model is entirely constrained by observable micro estimates and by equilibrium
conditions. The only parameter that we can adjust is the slope of the Phillips curve κ but it does
not aﬀect the nominal GDP in euro, it only pins down the allocation of nominal GDP between
prices and quantities (employment).
   It is nonetheless important to focus on the errors made by the model. There are three main
simulations errors. One is that the model over-predicts the boom/bust cycle in Greece. We think
that one reason might be that the increase in government spending took the form of higher wages


                                                                                                   19
to public servants. To the extent that these agents are not credit constrained, our model can over-
estimate the departures from Ricardian equivalence. The second issue is the timing of Irish net
exports. The data seem to lag the model by one year. We are not quite sure why this is the case,
and this issue will appear again in our structural simulations. The third issue is in fact a good sign:
in Germany, the model fails to account the increase in the natural rate of employment following the
Hartz reforms of 2003-2005. We think this should show up as a change in the Phillips curve, and it
does.


5     Structural Model
Private leverage, spreads and fiscal policy are interrelated and our goal in this section is to identify
the structural relations between the three variables. We think of country dynamics as being driven
by three structural shocks. The first one is a boom/bust cycle in private debt, which we call credit
cycle for short. The second one is a political economy bias in government spending that creates
fiscal imbalances. The third is a sudden stop that threatens the stability of the eurozone. Formally,
we think of the structural model ℑ as a mapping
                                                                )                                *
           ℑ : (Credit Cycle, Political Economy, Sudden Stop) −→ bhj,t , gj,t , ρj,t , yj,t , ...    (16)

The key point of the structural model is to explain the variables that we took as exogenous in the
reduced form model (15). Our identification strategy is based on a mix of theoretical modeling and
empirical identification using instrumental variables. We do not claim to provide micro-foundations
for every detail of the model. Given the range of data and economic forces that we need to capture,
this is not feasible. But we mean that, either there is an explicit theoretical equation, or there is an
empirical equation that allows us to identify the influence of one variable on the others.

5.1     Using the U.S. to Identify Private Debt Dynamics
A serious identification challenge is to figure out how private deleveraging would play out if without
sudden stops. It is clear that there would be some deleveraging in any case, but exactly how fast
and how much, we do not know. It is also rather intuitive that places that experience the largest
increase in debt during the boom experience the largest decrease during the bust. This makes it
particularly diﬃcult to come up with plausible instruments. Our identification strategy is then
to use the United States as a control group to estimate deleveraging without sudden stops. We
estimate the following model for deleveraging in a panel of U.S. states


                            bh,U S
                                   = α̂1 bh,U S
                                                                       α̂k bh,U S
                                                          +
                             j,t          j,t−1 +                           j,k   + ϵj,t
                                                    k=2002,2005,2008




                                                       20
for t = 2009, .., 2012, j = 1, ..52, and bhj,t is household debt in state j at time t, rescaled exactly
as explained above for the eurozone.16 The idea is that these private leverage cycles reflect various
global and financial factors: low real rates, financial innovations, regulatory arbitrage of the Basel
rules by banks, real estate bubbles, bank governance, etc.17 To a large extent these forces were
present both in Europe and in the US. The diﬀerence of course is that there was no sudden stops
within the US. Hence, we interpret the US experience as representative of a deleveraging outcome in
a monetary union without sudden stops.18 The estimated coeﬃcients αU
                                                                   k
                                                                     S are negative, capturing

the fact that states that accumulate more private debt during the boom deleverage more during the
bust. We then take the estimated coeﬃcients α̂k and use them to construct predicted deleveraging
in eurozone countries:
                                          b̂hj,t = α̂1 bh,                            α̂k bh,
                                                                              +
                                                        j,t−1 +                            j,k
                                                                  k=2002,2005,2008

for t = 2009, .., 2012 and j = 1..11. Figure (5) illustrates the results for California and Ireland.
    Figure (5) suggests the Irish private sector paid back its debts faster than one would expect if
Ireland had be a U.S. state. This is also the case for other countries that experienced a sudden stop.
We can now present our structural equation for eurozone countries for t = 2009, .., 2012:


                                                        bhj,t = b̂hj,t + λρ,h ρj,t.                                                 (17)

Private leverage is equal to the prediction from the U.S. experience plus the impact of the increase
in funding cost. The first element b̂hj,t is interpreted as an exogenous shock. The second element, the
impact of the spread, is endogenous and captures various transmission channels, such as a decrease
in bank lending.

      One issue we have to deal with is that mortgage defaults are much more prevalent in the U.S., because of
diﬀerences in mortgage regulations. Deleveraging in the model does not happen via default, so we must add to the
series of household debt in US states the amount of debt which has been defaulted upon.
   17
      See Cunat and Garicano (2009) on the case of Spain.
   18
      We discuss diﬀerences in local fiscal policy in Appendix B.2.


                                                                   21
5.2     Funding Costs and Sudden Stops
We assume that the cost of fund for country j at time t is
                              ,                                                                    -
                   ρj,t = σt × λρ0 + λg,ρ bgj,t + λg,high,ρ bg,high
                                                             j,t    + λh,ρ bhj,t + λrec,ρ recapj,t                 (18)

where σt captures the time varying risk of a sudden stop. This equation says that funding costs
start to diverge when there is a sudden stop in the eurozone and that the extent to which this
happens in diﬀerent countries depends on public debt bgj,t , private debt bhj,t but also recapitalization
of the financial sector (recapj,t).19 This is a fairly standard equation that emphasizes the interaction
between a common risk factor (σt ) and local sensitivities (debt levels). The time varying risk is
needed to explain rapid changes in spreads while debt levels tend to be very persistent. The local
sensitivities are needed because not all countries are hit by sudden stops. Our specification captures
financial frictions associated with high leverage (debt overhang, risk shifting, adverse selection, runs,
etc.). We allow the impact of public debt on spreads to be non linear to take into account the case of
Greece. More specifically,
                      ) we allow * ) the coeﬃcient
                                             *     to be higher for levels of debt above 90% of GDP
              g,high    g             g
so we define bj,t    ≡ bj,t − 0.9 bj,t > 0.9 . In our data, this non linear eﬀect is only significant
for Greece.
    We estimate the coeﬃcients λ’s on the period 2008-2012 for the 11 eurozone countries. We do so
by running instrumental variable regressions.20 For ρj,t in equation (17) we use as instruments the
government debt in 2002, 2007 and 2008 as well as total public expenditures in 2002 and 2008. For
government and private debt bgj,t and bhj,t and recapitalization (recapj,t ), in equation (18), we use as
instruments government debt levels (bgj,t ) lagged three years, the exogenous component of private
debt (and its lag) predicted by the US experience b̂hj,t. To capture the possibility and the size of
a sudden stop in the eurozone, we measure the coeﬃcient σt as the mean of the observed absolute
value of spreads in the eurozone. As expected, it is close to zero up to 2007 and starts increasing
in 2008 with a maximum in 2012. The estimated coeﬃcients, which we will use in our simulations,
are shown in Table (2).

   19
      Favero (2013) also finds that fiscal fundamentals matter for eurozone spreads in interaction with the time varying
perceived risk of a eurozone breakup.
   20
      For the non linear eﬀect of public debt on spreads, we set λg,high = 1.3 since it gives the best fit for Greece.


                                                          22
5.3    Fiscal Policy
Our last task is to specify a fiscal policy function for the diﬀerent governments. We assume that the
government seeks to stabilize employment but is constrained by its cost of funds. The government
cuts spending when ρj,t is positive.21 We allow the funding constraint to have a stronger impact
for higher levels of the rescaled spreads (above 100 basis points): ρhigh
                                                                     j,t ≡ max (ρj,t − 0.01, 0). This
non linear eﬀect is important for Greece and to a lesser extent for Portugal. Hence, the policy rule
for government spending, with parameters γ n , γ ρ and γ ρ,high , is given by:

                             gj,t = g̃j,t + γ n (nj,t − n̄) + γ ρ ρj,t + γ ρ,high ρhigh
                                                                                   j,t ,                          (19)
                             zj,t = z̃j,t + γ n (nj,t − n̄) + γ ρ ρj,t + γ ρ,high ρhigh
                                                                                   j,t ,


where g̃j,t and z̃j,t are country specific drifts,



                            g̃j,t = gj,0 + δjg (min(t, t1 ) − t0 ) − δjg max (t − t1 , 0) ,                       (20)
                            z̃j,t = zj,0 + δjz (min(t, t1 ) − t0 ) − δjz max (t − t1 , 0) ,

with t0 = 2002 and t1 = 2008. Hence, δjg represents the average “excess” annual spending growth
rate during the boom years. We interpret this drift as a political bias in spending decisions that is
reversed after 2008.22 What matters for us is that countries display diﬀerent degrees of spending
bias during the boom years, and we want to analyze to what extent this spending drift during the
boom years contributes to the crisis.

    21
       In fact we use the lagged spread simply because it fits better, which probably reflects implementation lags in
fiscal policy. This is not related to the identification of the model and our results are not sensitive to this detail.
    22
       The fact that it is reversed is not very important for our results. We could assume that g̃j,t stays constant
after t1 and our simulations would be similar. In fact, our counter-factual results would be stronger since the model
would then choose a larger γ ρ to fit the data. But this can create issues of debt sustainability if we simulate the
model beyond 2012 and we assume that the spreads normalize. In practice we also see that governments are trying
to reverse some of the spending decisions they made during the boom years. The change in political bias might come
from new fiscal rules agreed at the EU level, from explicit requirements for countries in a program, or more broadly
from a shift in attitudes and beliefs about fiscal responsibility


                                                          23
    We focus on the four countries that are most harshly hit by the crisis, namely Spain, Greece,
Ireland and Portugal. We choose our parameters in the policy rule γ n andγ ρ and the spending
and transfer drift coeﬃcients δjg and δjz such that the model reproduces dynamics of public debt
(equivalently, spending and net taxes) during the boom. This leads us to the parameters given
in Tables (3) and (4). The spending biases necessary to reproduce the debt dynamics is larger in
Greece than in the other periphery countries. It is intermediate in Ireland and Spain and null in
Portugal. In Greece, the fiscal drift is entirely in the form of transfers reflecting the high growth
rate of wages in the public sector and the impact of the pension system in the boom years (see
Fernández Villaverde et al. (2013)). Finally, we need to take into account the Greek debt restruc-
turing. Greece benefits from low interest rates, extended repayment periods for the EU and IMF
rescue package, and a large reduction of outstanding debt. Altogether, we estimate that this is
equivalent to a decrease of 50 points of GDP, mostly in 2012.

Note: Goodness of fit is the share of variance explained by the model. It is measured as 1 − rssj /tssj
where tssj is !the total sum of squares and rssj is the residual sum of squares. For instance, for GDP, we
                  2012
have tssj ≡       t=2001 (yj,t −    ȳ )2 , where yj,t and ȳj are the actual GDP and its sample mean, and rssj ≡
                                  #2 j
         yj,t − ŷj,t + ŷ¯j − ȳj , where ŷj,t is the prediction of the model and ŷ¯j its sample mean.

5.4    Fit of the structural model
The structural model is a constrained version of the reduced form model presented earlier. We can
now formally write equation (16) as

subject to the equilibrium condition of the model and the structural equations (17), (18) and (19).
There are three sets of exogenous factors: the fiscal biases δjg and δjz , the predicted private credit
cycle b̂hj,t, and the sudden stop shock σt .

goodness of fit of the structural model, defined as the share of the variance explained by the model.
The goodness of fit is a number between −∞ and 1. It is positive if the model helps reduce the
unexplained variance, and it is one if the model fits perfectly. The fit is good, but there are some
issues. The model over-predicts employment and nominal GDP in Greece during the boom (see the
discussion above for the reduced form case). There is some timing issues with Ireland. In Portugal,
funding costs are a bit low and the model misses the downward employment trend early in the
sample. But, overall, the goodness of fit makes us confident that we can use the model to perform
our counter-factual experiments.24


6        Counterfactual experiments
The goal of this section is to provide counterfactual simulations of what would happen to Greece,
Spain, Ireland and Portugal if they followed a diﬀerent set of policies. We consider four counterfac-
tuals:

     • fiscal policy: what happens with more conservative fiscal policies before 2008?

     • macro-prudential policies: what happens with limits on private debt before 2008?

     • monetary policy: what happens if ECB prevents the sudden stop in 2008?

     • fiscal devaluation: what happens if these countries devalue in 2009?

For the counterfactual experiments, we use the structural equations (17), (18) and (19) with the
estimated coeﬃcients discussed above. In all our experiments, we report on the same graph the
actual data and the predicted counter-factual series.25 The simulations generate series for public
debt, private debt, employment, nominal GDP, net exports and spreads on the period 2001-2012,
using debt in 2000 as an initial point.

6.1      Counterfactual with a more conservative fiscal policy in the boom
How would countries have fared if they had followed more conservative fiscal policies during the
boom? We answer this question by setting δjg and δjz equal to zero for the four periphery countries.
For Spain, Ireland and Portugal all the other benchmark parameters are left unchanged. For Greece,
we need to deal with the debt relief issue. Given that the counterfactual conservative fiscal policy
generates debt to GDP ratios much lower than in the data in 2011 and 2012, we assume that debt

      It might be worth emphasizing that the fit is absolutely not mechanical. Recall that our model has no productivity
shock, which means that we do not extract any information from the actual GDP series. Another important fact,
that we do not have the space to discuss here, is that all these results change dramatically if we use the wrong series.
The goodness of fit turns negative if we do not use Trade in Value-Added to estimate foreign demand shocks, or (even
worse) if we use the raw government spread as an estimate of ρ.

      The predicted series is defined as data + (structural model with counterfactual parameters - structural model
with benchmark parameters).

   Figure (8) shows that the elimination of the spending bias dramatically changes the public debt
accumulation in Greece (remember that this more conservative fiscal policy in Greece also means
that it does not benefit from the debt relief at the end of the period). It also has a significant
impact in Ireland and Spain, but not in Portugal where we estimated no bias. This large change in
the public debt in turns reduces funding costs during the sudden stop in Ireland and Spain but less
so in Greece as shown on the right panel of figure (8) because Greece still has a high level of debt
when hit by the sudden stop. Lower funding costs reduce fiscal austerity during the bust.

   Figure (9) shows that a conservative fiscal policy allows Greece to stabilizes employment. The
actual employment loss of 15.8 percentage points (relative to the eurozone average) between 2008 and
2012 would have been almost halved with this more conservative fiscal policy. The counterfactual
conservative fiscal policies in Spain and Ireland do not eliminate the boom-bust cycle but allow for
an earlier exit from the recession, especially in Ireland. We have also checked that a counterfactual
with a pro-active fiscal adjustment reducing Portuguese public debt during the period 2001-2008
would have allowed Portugal to have a somewhat milder recession.
   Finally, note that, in the counterfactual experiment, Ireland eliminates all public debt by the
end of the boom, and Spain reduces its public debt to around 30% of GDP. This does not seem very
realistic, and it suggests that fiscal policy is unlikely to be enough to stabilize an economy subject
to a large buildup of private debt. We therefore now turn to macro-prudential policies.

6.2   Counterfactual with macro-prudential policies in the boom
In this counterfactual we imagine that countries are able to prevent the private leverage boom. We
assume that b̂hj,t remains constant. We take into account the impact of such policy on the recapi-
talization of financial institutions during the bust: using a cross-sectional regression, we estimate
that a reduction of private debt by one euro during the boom reduces recapitalization needs by
0.25 euro during the bust. The macro-prudential policy in the boom therefore reduces public debt
and spreads. Figure (10) shows that this macro-prudential policy partially stabilizes employment
in all four countries. This is especially true in Ireland: whereas in the data employment falls from
2008 to 2012 by almost 12% more than the Eurozone average, in the counterfactual it falls by only


                                                           28
4.2% more than the Eurozone average. Not surprisingly given that there was little private leverage
boom in Portugal, the impact of a counterfactual macro-prudential policy is small in this country.
The comparison of the conservative fiscal counterfactual and of the macro-prudential counterfactual
shows that the private leverage boom was the key igniting element of the crisis in Ireland and Spain
and that fiscal policies during the boom played a secondary role. The opposite is true for Greece.
Given that the fiscal drifts are not aﬀected in this counterfactual, the fiscal rule (that contains both
a spending and transfer drift and a countercyclical component) induces a larger buildup of public
debt than in a situation without macro-prudential policy.

   The public debt buildup in the boom can be seen in figure (11) in Spain, Greece and Ireland:
larger public debt is substituted to private debt to achieve the employment target. There are
two opposite eﬀects on spreads: on the one hand the reduction in private leverage and in bank
recapitalization reduces spreads. On the other hand, the larger buildup of public debt pushes spreads
upward. In Ireland, the first eﬀect clearly dominates as spreads disappear in this counterfactual
(see figure 11) largely because this counterfactual eliminates the need for bank recapitalization. In
the other three countries, this is not the case. This counterfactual suggests that macro-prudential
policies that do not come with a more prudent fiscal rule may not have been suﬃcient to generate a
fiscally sustainable stabilization of employment. In this sense, macro-prudential policies to constrain
private leverage and prudent fiscal policies to constrain public debt are complements not substitutes.
Indeed, we checked that in the case of Ireland and Spain, only a counterfactual that combines
prudent fiscal policies and macro-prudential policies succeeds in stabilizing both total debt and
employment.

6.3     Counterfactual with “whatever it takes” in 2008
In this counterfactual we ask the following question: what would have happened if the announce-
ments of July 2012 (Mario Draghi’s declaration “Whatever it takes”) and September 2012 (the OMT
program) had come earlier. These announcements were successful in reducing the risk of a euro
breakup, financial fragmentation and the sudden stop. The experiment is to imagine that these
actions were implemented and successful in 2008 rather than 2012. Specifically, we assume that σt ,

the mean of the absolute value of spreads in the eurozone, in equation (18), is kept at its low 2007
level from 2008 on. This eﬀectively eliminates (in Spain and Ireland) or strongly reduces (in Greece
and Portugal) the dramatic rise in funding costs as illustrated in figure (12).

    The lower funding costs enable countries to stabilize employment (see figure 13). Interestingly,
the employment dynamics of Ireland then look similar to the ones of many U.S. states. There is a
large private leverage boom/bust cycle, but it is followed by a recovery starting in 2011. Finally,
although not stabilized, public debt is a bit lower than in the data as illustrated in figure (13). This
is due to larger fiscal receipts thanks to better GDP growth. Lower funding costs aﬀect aggregate
spending and employment through three channels: 1) savers do not slash spending as much (see the
Euler equation 14); 2) the leverage of borrowers does not fall as much (see equation 17) which in
turn positively aﬀects their spending; 3) fiscal austerity is reduced because fiscal policy (19) is less
constrained by the funding costs. We have checked that in all countries the fiscal channel is by far
the most important channel through which lower funding costs help stabilize employment.

6.4       Counterfactual with fiscal devaluation
In this counterfactual we ask the following question: what would have happened if periphery coun-
tries had been able to engineer a fiscal devaluation during the bust in order to recoup part of the
competitiveness they had lost during the boom years? This is close to a “flexible” exchange rate
counterfactual, but it is not identical because a fiscal devaluation does not impact the net foreign
asset position.26

    See Franco (2013) and Farhi et al. (2014) for conditions under which a fiscal devaluation is equivalent to an
exchange rate adjustment.


                                                                                     32
     More precisely, we assume that the fiscal devaluation is achieved through the combination of a
VAT tax on all domestic expenditures (private and public) and a payroll subsidy on wages. Appendix
A.8 details how the equilibrium conditions are amended. The VAT is paid by firms and rebated to
exporters. The payroll subsidy on labor is paid to domestic firms. To simplify further we assume
that the VAT rate and the payroll subsidy are equal to τv,j,t . Hence, export prices p∗j,t fall so foreign
                                 fj,t
demand increases to          (1−τv,j,t )ph
                                               due to unit elasticity, while domestic prices for domestic consumers
                                         j,t
remain       unchanged27 .    The fiscal devaluation is made fiscally neutral through a lump sum transfer
Γj,t to households such that:

                              Γj,t=τv,j,t (χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t + gj,t ) − τv,j,t wj,t nj,t

so that the revenues from the VAT equal the cost of the payroll subsidy and the transfer. However,
the indirect eﬀects on income tax revenues that arise from the stimulative eﬀects of a fiscal devalua-
tion on output remain as would be the case of an exchange rate devaluation. The fiscal devaluation
is applied starting in 2009. We set the VAT rate at 10% so that export volumes increase by the
same amount. The increase in exports attenuates the fall in employment in all countries as shown
in figure (14). Another eﬀect of the fiscal devaluation is that the better employment figures induce
governments to cut spending and transfers. Because of this and because of the stimulative eﬀect of
the fiscal devaluation on income taxes the trajectory of public debt is improved, as shown in figure
(14). This improvement in the debt dynamics is quite large in all countries: in 2012 public debt is
for example lower by around 20 percentage points of GDP in Ireland. This suggests that a condition
for a successful fiscal adjustment is that countries can benefit from such a change in relative prices.
In all countries, because of the reduction in public debt, funding costs are a bit lower.


7         Conclusion
Understanding the dynamics of the Eurozone is a major challenge for macroeconomics. Eurozone
countries have experienced extraordinary levels of real and financial volatility. Unemployment rates
have diverged to an extent that no one anticipated. While most observers recognize that private
leverage, fiscal policy, sudden stops and loss of competitiveness all played a role, it has proven
challenging to analyze them jointly, and even more diﬃcult to disentangle them.
     Our paper makes three contributions. We present a model that accounts simultaneously for
domestic credit, fiscal policy, and current account dynamics. We create a data set for 11 countries
over 13 years that covers the variables of interest and deals with the various accounting issues.
Finally, and most importantly, we propose a new identification strategy that allows us to run counter-
factual experiments regarding fiscal policy, macro-prudential policy, ECB interventions, and fiscal
devaluations. The results from our counter-factual experiments on employment are summarized
in Table 6. Stronger fiscal discipline during the boom would have made the recession less severe,

    27
         Domestic prices and wages actually increase relative to data but only indirectly because of higher employment.


                                                               33
especially in the case of Greece. A macro-prudential policy to limit private leverage during the boom
would have helped to stabilize employment in all countries, and especially in Ireland. However, in
the absence of a more prudent fiscal policy, this could have induced a larger buildup in public debt.


                          Table 6: Counter-Factual Employment Gains
                          2008-2012                    ESP    GRE             IRL      PRT

                                       Counter-Factual Gains

             No Financial Segmentation after 2008      3.4%  12.4%           4.6%      4.0%
             Fiscal Devaluation (10% in 2009 on)       3.3%   4.3%           3.8%      1.7%
Note: Spain lost 12.9 points of employment - more than the eurozone average - between 2008 and 2012. If
Spain had run a successful macro-prudential policy during the boom, its employment would have been 4.1
points higher in 2012, i.e. the drop would have been only 12.9 - 4.1 = 8.8 points.




   One lesson we take from this exercise is that fiscal and macro-prudential policies are comple-
ment rather than substitute when it comes to stabilizing the economy. In the case of Spain, the
combination of conservative fiscal and macro-prudential policies would have meant a counter-factual
gain of 13% of employment by 2012. A prudent fiscal policy, alone, would have generated a gain
of 3.2%. A macro-prudential policy alone would have generated a gain of 4.1%. Both prudent
fiscal policies and macro-prudential policies are therefore required to stabilize the economy. The
sudden stop episode dramatically worsened the crisis by constraining governments during the bust.
If the ECB had successfully reduced the spreads early in the crisis, the four countries would have
been able to avoid fiscal austerity and the second half of the slump. However, this policy alone
would not have avoided the large buildup in public debt. Finally, if those countries had been able
to recoup competitiveness through a fiscal devaluation in 2009, the fall in employment would have
been stabilized and fiscal austerity would have been successful in reducing public debt.
   The contribution of our paper is to provide a coherent and quantitative framework to study
the eurozone crisis. Our approach requires integrating various strands of the literature, which is
diﬃcult, but it allows us to consider a rich set of policies. On the other hand, the weakness of our
analysis is that we are forced to treat some deep issues rather superficially. In our view, political
economy issues and sovereign default decisions deserve a much deeper analysis. In our model,
political economy issues are captured by a bias in the fiscal rules. This is certainly a useful starting
point but it is not a satisfactory answer. For instance, Fernández Villaverde et al. (2013) argue
that financial booms can lead to weaker monitoring and a deterioration in governance. Technically,
this violates our identifying restriction since we assume that the political economy bias and the
leverage boom do not aﬀect each other directly. But more importantly it shows that we need a
deeper understanding of the interaction between governments and financial markets.


                                                  34
   Similarly, we summarize sovereign default risk by a bond pricing equation. We are of course
careful to estimate this equation with plausible instruments and to make sure that it fits well,
which is critical for our experiments. But this clearly is not a satisfactory treatment of strategic
sovereign default. Moreover, this approach does not help us to analyze reforms that would severe
the link between sovereign risk and the private cost of funds. A sensible goal for the eurozone is to
make sure that governments can default within the currency union and without destroying private
financial markets. Understanding what is required to reach this goal is an important avenue for
future research.

A      For Online Publication: Model and Simulation Appendix
A.1     Scaling
We have already defined the Euler equations for countryj and the monetary union (with an asterisk):
                                                          ' ∗ (      .     ∗
                                                                               / ∗
                 Et [Xs,j,t+1 ] ≈ β (1 + rj,t) Xs,j,t ; Et Xs,t+1 ≈ β 1 + rs,t  Xs,t .

and the spread as
                                                               1 + rj,t
                                                  1 + ρj,t ≡        ∗
                                                               1 + rs,t
If we scale the budget constraint (assuming perfect foresight, or equivalently, neglecting the condi-
tional variance of the aggregate shocks), we get
                                                          ∗
                                                         Xs,t+1
                                    Xs,j,t  Sj,t+1 Xs,t
                                                      ∗
                                                             Sj,t Ỹj,t
                                      ∗    + ∗              = ∗ + ∗
                                    Xs,t    Xs,t+1 1 + rj,t  Xs,t Xs,t

and up to the usual approximation we have
                                                     β
                                       xs,j,t +            sj,t+1 = sj,t + ỹj,t
                                                  1 + ρj,t

    For the Phillips Curve we start from (12) and the equivalent equation at the eurozone level:
                                                 % ∗ &κ
                                          Wt∗      Nt
                                           ∗   =         .
                                         Wt−1      N̄ ∗

Then we define
                                                Nj,t /N̄j           Wj,t
                                       nj,t ≡     ∗     ∗
                                                          and wj,t ≡ ∗ .
                                                Nt /N̄              Wj,t
To a first order approximation we then have
                                            wj,t
                                                  = 1 + κ (nj,t − 1) .
                                           wj,t−1

Notice that this kind of log linear relation would hold even if the aggregate wage has a forward
looking component so in fact we only need to assume that the country specific component follows
(12).28 Since

     In logs, we can write log Wjt = log $ Wjt +  log wjt . %For the aggregate component we can then write: log Wjt =
          ∗                     ∗      ∗        ∗          ∗
ζEt log Wjt+1 + (1 − ζ) log Wjt−1 + κ log Nt − log N̄ , where ζ captures the kind of hybrid Phillips curve that
many people have estimated. In particular, our model is perfectly consistent with the idea that monetary policy
can influence expected inflation at the aggregate level. We only assume that the country specific component follows:
log wjt = log wjt−1 + κ log njt . We have also estimated a country specific forward looking component but found it to
be insignificant. For the sake of simplicity we therefore omit it.

Note that if    w j,t−1   = 1, then ∆ = (κ + 1)2 , and       w,t−1   = 1.

A.2    Budget constraints
Let us first rewrite the budget constraints and market clearing conditions. Using the market clearing
condition, and competition phj,t = wj,t , we get

                                  yj,t = αj (χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t) + fj,t + gj,t .

Nominal exports are fj,t, nominal imports are (1 − χj ) pfj,t cfs,j,t + χj pfj,t cfb,j,t since the government
does not buy imported goods. So net exports are ej,t = fj,t − (1 − αj ) (χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t) .
We define disposable (after-tax) income as ỹj,t ≡ (1 − τj,t) yj,t + zj,t .
   We can then write the system for nominal variables
                   β     h
   • xb,j,t =    1+ρj,t bj,t+1   + ỹj,t − bhj,t , budget constraint of impatient agents
                                   β
   • xs,j,t = sj,t + ỹj,t −     1+ρj,t sj,t+1 ,   budget constraint of patient agents

   • yj,t = αj (χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t) + fj,t + gj,t , market clearing
                                           g
   • gj,t + zj,t − τj,t yj,t =       β
                                   1+ρj,t bj,t+1   − bgj,t, budget constraint of the government
               1
   • ej,t =    αj   (fj,t − (1 − αj ) (yj,t − gj,t )), definition of net exports

Combining the first four equations, we get market clearing at time t:

                                                                                 bgj,t+1

                                                                   sj,t+1

A.3    Pseudo-Steady State
We consider a steady state with constant interest rates equal to the rate of time preference of
savers, i.e. β (1 + rj ) = 1 and the spread is zero: ρj = 0. The borrowing limit bhj is exogenous
and we consider equilibria where the borrowing constraint (4) binds. Our notion of steady state is
complicated by the fact that savings sj are history-dependent. We define a steady state as the long
run equilibrium of an economy with initial savings sj and government debt bgj , subject to no further
shocks, constant government spending and constant government debt. All nominal quantities are

constant and employment is at its natural rate n̄.29 The long-run equilibrium conditions are

                       )                     *      r .
            phj n̄ = αj (1 − τj ) phj n̄ + zj + αj
                                                                             /
                                                        (1 − χj ) sj − χj b̄j + fj + gj .

There are several ways to specify government policy. Here we assume that the policy is to keep
government debt and nominal spending gj constant. Long run nominal output is then given by

                                                       αj           fj
                                          phj n̄ =          raj +        + gj                      (23)

where recall that we have defined a as net foreign assets. This equation shows the determinants of
the long run price level. The long run price level depends on the exogenous components of spending:
net asset income, foreign demand, and government spending. All these are inflationary. For a given
tax rate τj , transfers are then chosen to satisfy the government’s budget constraint:
                                                                      r g
                                             zj = τj phj n̄ − gj −      b .
                                                                     1+r j

A.4       Euler Equation and Expected Income
We use a linear approximation of the Euler equation of savers:

                                            Et [xs,j,t+1 ] = (1 + ρj,t ) xs,j,t.

Consider the following experiment. Savers enter the period with a given level of savings. Then there
is a shock to interest rates. For instance, starting from a steady state where ρj = 0, if the new rate
is such that ρj > 0, savings jumps up, and if the new rate is such that ρj < 0, spending jumps up.
The budget constraint at time t is
                                                                         sj,t+1
                                            xs,j,t = sj,t + ỹj,t − β
                                                                        1 + ρj,t

and the expected budget constraint at time t + 1 is
                          #             $
                                sj,t+2
                        Et β              = sj,t+1 + Et [ỹj,t+1 − xs,j,t+1 ] .
                             1 + ρj,t+1

Combining the budget constraints and the linearized Euler equation, we get
                                                #             $
                                                     sj,t+2
              (1 + β)sj,t+1 + Et [ỹj,t+1 ] − Et β              = (1 + ρj,t ) (sj,t + ỹj,t ) .    (24)
                                                   1 + ρj,t+1
  29
       We consider here the case where labor supply is inelastic, so n̄ is eﬀectively exogenous.

A.6     Impulse Response Functions
To compute the impulse response functions of the model we need to make an assumption about the
path of household debt and fiscal policy

Assumptions A1.
                                                     ,       -
   • Shocks on borrowing constraints are such that Et bhj,t+2 = bhj,t+1 .
                                  ,       -
   • Fiscal policy is such that Et bgj,t+2 = bgj,t+1 and the tax rate τj is constant.

   • The variance of interest rates and foreign demand is small, and βb is small enough that bj,t =
     bhj,t at all times.

   • Spreads are iid: Et [ρj,t+1 ] = 0. Savers anticipate spreads to last only one year.



                                                                   42
Assumptions A1 are only necessary to solve for the entire path of macroeconomic variables shown in
the impulse response functions. The first condition says that shocks on borrowing are permanent.
The second defines a class of fiscal policies. The third point is purely technical. It allows us to
linearize Euler equations. We assume that the shocks are small enough that impatient households
find it optimal to borrow up to the constraint (this is a joint restriction on the discount factor and
the size of the shocks). Note that the last assumption does not impose that the interest rate in the
monetary union is iid, only that deviations for a particular country are expected to last one year.
Assumptions A1 are not necessary for the reduced form and structural simulations.
     We now look for decision rules for the savers {sj,t }t=1,2... and the other variables of the model,
yj,t, phj,t, etc. We get the following Lemma:
Lemma 1. Under A1 and Et [fj,t+1 ] = fj,t savings dynamics satisfy Et [sj,t+2 ] = sj,t+1 .
Proof. We guess and verify that the Lemma is correct. Suppose the Lemma is true, then we obtain
two important equations. Equation (24) becomes

                                     sj,t+1 = (1 + ρj,t ) (sj,t + ỹj,t) − Et [ỹj,t+1 ] ,                                  (25)

and expected market clearing at t + 1 is
                                               )                                           *
              (1 − αj ) Et [ỹj,t+1 ] = (1 − β) αj (1 − χj ) sj,t+1 − αj χbhj,t+1 − bgj,t+1 + fj,t.                         (26)

Therefore
                                                              )                                           *    fj,t
(1 − αj ) sj,t+1 = (1 − αj ) (1 + ρj,t) (sj,t + ỹj,t)−(1 − β) αj (1 − χj ) sj,t+1 − αj χbhj,t+1 − bgj,t+1 −        .
                                                                                                             1 − αj

Savings inherit the dynamic properties of bhj,t and bgj,t . Since we assume small shocks and Et [ρj,t+1 ] =
0, this validates our conjecture that Et [sj,t+2 ] = sj,t+1 .

   5. ỹj,t = (1 − τj ) yj,t + zj,t
The five unknown endogenous variables are ỹj,t , yj,t, bgj,t , sj,t+1 , and Et [ỹj,t+1 ]. The exogenous
shocks are bhj,t , fj,t and ρj,t . The policy shocks variables are transfers and public expenditure, zj,t
and gj,t respectively. The state space of predetermined endogenous variables is sj,t and bgj,t .

                                                                     43
    We specify the policy function of the government in order to compute the impulse responses.
We are interested
         ,      - in simple rules that deliver the property that the public debt follows a random
walk: Et bj,t+2 = bgj,t+1 and deliver some automatic stabilization. We assume that spending and
            g

transfers are predetermined. From the government budget constraint, this means that a recession
at time t automatically increases government debt at time t. To maintain fiscal stability,
                                                                                   ,       -we specify
that transfers adjust from t to t + 1 to keep public debt constant thereafter: Et bj,t+2 = bgj,t+1 .
                                                                                     g

More precisely, we specify the general policy rule as follows
   1. Fiscal variables gj,t and zj,t are pre-determined. Government debt bgj,t is determined in equi-
      librium at time t.
                                                      ,      -
   2. Set transfers zj,t+1 for next period so that Et bgj,t+2 = bgj,t+1 assuming a martingale for gj,t .

       (a) The expected budget constraint is

                                               τj Et [yj,t+1 ] = gj,t + zj,t+1 + (1 − β) bgj,t+1

       (b) By definition we have

                                                    Et [ỹj,t+1 ] = (1 − τj ) Et [yj,t+1 ] + zj,t+1

       (c) Therefore (recall that Et [ỹj,t+1 ] is part of our solution at time t), zj,t+1 is given by

                                   zj,t+1 = τj Et [ỹj,t+1 ] − (1 − τj ) gj,t − (1 − τj ) (1 − β) bgj,t+1

Figures (15), (16) and (17) illustrate the impulse response functions of the model for a shock to
household debt (bhj,t ), public spending (gj,t ), interest rates (rj,t ) and foreign demand (fj,t ) respec-
tively.

A.7    Simulation of the reduced form and structural models
To run the simulations, we first need to set the initial conditions in a particular year. We use 2002
as our base year t0 .


                                                                        45
   1. Natural employment and prices (which are equal to wages) are normalized to n⋆ = 1 and
      phj,t0 = 1 (so nominal GDP is normalized in the base year to: yj,t0 = 1)

   2. Variables set to their observed values are: bhj,t0 , zj,t0 , gj,t0 , bgj,t0 , bgj,t0 −1 , rj,t0 . We then get fj,t0 ,
      τj and ỹj,t0 from market clearing and budget constraints:
                                                                                     1
        (a) Foreign demand fj,t0 is chosen to match net exports ej,t0 =              αj   (fj,t0 − (1 − αj ) (yj,t0 − gj,t0 ))
                                                                                                         bgj,t
        (b) We get τj from the government budget constraint gj,t0 + zj,t0 − τj yj,t0 =                   1+rj,t0
                                                                                                                 0+1
                                                                                                                       − bgj,t0
        (c) Disposable income at time t0 is ỹj,t0 = (1 − τj ) yj,t0 + zj,t0

   3. Savers’ assets sj,t0 and sj,t0 −1 are chosen to solve the equilibrium conditions

        (a) sj,t+1 = (1 + ρj,t ) (sj,t + ỹj,t) −     1−βθ     Et [ỹj,t+1 ]
            )                )                     **                        )                                           *

                                                                         )              *
                                         j,t+1      h                           sj,t+1                  g
        (c) (1 − αj ) ỹj,t = αj χj β 1+ρj,t − bj,t + αj (1 − χj ) sj,t − β 1+ρ     j,t
                                                                                          + β 1+ρj,t − bj,t + fj,t .


For the reduced form model, we then feed exogenous processes for the diﬀerent shocks (using scales
values) for observed household debt (bhj,t ), fiscal policy (τj , zj,t, gj,t ), interest rate spreads ρj,t and
foreign nominal demand shocks fj,t. For each country, we simulate the path between 2001 and 2012
of nominal GDP yj,t, employment nj,t , wages wj,t , net exports ej,t and public debt bgj,t.
    The level of output, the price level and the level of net foreign assets is set to their 2002 levels
in the data. Foreign demand is set using data on exports in value added terms for 2001-2012,
normalized so that the level of foreign demand in 2002 satisfies goods market clearing in the model.
Finally, taxes are set so that the path for government debt implied by the model coincides with the
data.30
    Figures (4) in the main text, (18) and (19) show the simulated (reduced form) and observed
nominal GDP, employment and wages. For all the simulated variables, we add the diﬀerence between
the mean of the data and the mean of the simulated model as the base year (2002) which serves to
scale the data and model is somewhat arbitrary.




   30
     Instead of using government debt directly from data, we construct a simulated government debt series in order to
avoid including factors that aﬀect government debt in the data but are not in the model, such as bank recapitalizations,
default, revenues from privatizations, etc. The simulated debt series is constructed by adding to t − 1 period debt
government expenditures including interest payments and subtracting tax revenues.

    The structural model is simulated in the same way but the exogenous variables are replaced by
structural equations (17) and (18) for private debt and spreads respectively and the fiscal policy
rule (19). The tax rate is constant at its 2002 level and equal to total government revenues as
a percentage of GDP. The structural shocks are now b̂hj,t , σt , g̃j,t . and z̃j,t . In addition to the
comparison of the actual and predicted (with the structural model) series for nominal GDP and
employment in figure (6), public debt and funding costs in figure (7) in the main text, we show
observed and simulated net exports in figure (20).

A.8    Fiscal Devaluation
We define a fiscal devaluation as the combination of a VAT tax on domestic expenditures (private
and public) and a payroll subsidy. Let phj,t be the price of home goods for domestic consumers, and
p∗j,t be the price of home goods for foreign consumers. τv,j,t is the VAT so that the government
collects τv,j,t (χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t + gj,t ). The VAT is paid by firms and rebated to exporters.
λj,t is the payroll subsidy so the government pays λj,t wj,t nj,t to firms. Profit maximization implies
the following prices:
                                     (1 − τv,j,t) phj,t = p∗j,t = (1 − λj,t ) wj,t ,
                                         fj,t
and foreign demand becomes           (1−τv,j,t )ph
                                                     .   Given that the VAT is imposed on imported goods,
                                                 j,t
importers (assuming flexible prices for foreign firms as for domestic firms) increase the price of their
                                                                                pft
imports to compensate for the VAT, so we have pfj,t =                         1−τv,j,t   where pfj,t is the domestic price of
foreign goods in countryj and pft is the foreign price of foreign goods. With log preferences, this
leads to a one for one drop in the quantity of imported foreign goods, while the spending shares
remain the same. For simplicity we further assume that the VAT rate and payroll subsidies are


                                                                48
equal, τv,j,t = λj,t so that phj,t = wj,t , yj,t = wj,tnj,t = pj,t nj,t and domestic prices to domestic
consumers are unchanged. We also assume Et [τv,j,t+1 ] = τv,j,t. The government budget constraint,
is then:


       bgj,t+1
  β               + (τj,t − τv,j,t ) wj,tnj,t + τv,j,t(χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t + gj,t ) = gj,t + zj,t + Γj,t + bgj,t ,
      1 + ρj,t

where Γj,t is a lump sum transfer to households. We set this transfer so that the fiscal devaluation
is neutral for the government budget constraint in the sense that the budget constraint remains:

                                              bgj,t+1
                                         β              + τj,t yj,t = gj,t + zj,t + bgj,t ,
                                             1 + ρj,t
so the lump sum transfer is:

                             Γj,t = τv,j,t(χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t + gj,t ) − τv,j,t wj,t nj,t.
Market clearing becomes:

                                         χj xb,j,t + (1 − χj ) xs,j,t        fj,t         gj,t
                             nj,t = αj                h
                                                                      +               h
                                                                                         + h ,
                                                     pj,t               (1 − τv,j,t )pj,t pj,t

and budget constraints are

                                       bhj,t+1                                              sj,t+1
                         xb,j,t = β            + ỹj,t − bhj,t ; xs,j,t = sj,t + ỹj,t − β
                                      1 + ρj,t                                             1 + ρj,t
   where net income is now defined as :

                                               ỹj,t = (1 − τj ) yj,t + zj,t + Γj,t

    Assuming permanent shocks on foreign demand, Et bgj,t+2 = bgj,t+1 , small shocks on spreads
and Et [τv,j,t+1 ] = τv,j,t , expected market clearing at t + 1 is:

B     For Online Publication: Data Appendix
B.1    Eurozone
Most economic data for Eurozone countries (employment, population, GDP, consumption, gov-
ernment debt, expenditures, EU transfers...) comes from Eurostat. We use data for 11 eurozone
countries from 2000 to 2012. Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, Ire-
land, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal. We excluded Luxembourg for which household debt data is
available only starting in 2005 and other countries that joined in 2007 and later.
    The data on household debt comes from the BIS which itself compiled the data from national
central banks. This is debt of household and non-profit institutions serving households. Credit
covers all loans and debt securities and comes from both domestic and foreign lenders. The series
capture the outstanding amount of credit at the end of the reference quarter.
    We call government expenditures total government expenditures net of transfers, interest pay-
ments and bank recapitalization. The data on spending on bank recapitalization comes from
Eurostat. It includes interest payable, capital injections recorded as deficit-increasing (capital trans-
fer) and calls on guarantees and is net of revenues generated by bank recapitalization (guarantee
fees, interest and dividends). Transfers is the addition of direct social benefits and of social transfers
in kind.
    Wages and prices, equal in the model, are proxied by the average of unit labor costs and con-
sumer prices. Both come from Eurostat and the former are defined as the ratio of labor costs to
labor productivity. For exports we measure the domestic value added that is associated with final
consumption in the rest of the world, which corresponds to value added based exports. We use
the data from the OECD-WTO Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) initiative to measure domestic value
added embodied in gross exports. Data is available only in 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2009. For missing
years, we use the ratio of gross exports (from Eurostat) to value added gross exports of the nearest
year and multiply this ratio by the gross exports of the missing year to obtain an approximation of
value added exports of the missing years.
    We use annual averages of 10 year government bond rates as long term rates. The source is
OECD. For the loans rates for SMEs and deposit rates, we use ECB data. SME loans are up to one
million euros. Data is missing for Belgium (2003-2005), Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal (2000-2002)
and Portugal (2007-2010). The deposit rates have maturity of up to one year. Irish data is missing.
For the other countries, it starts in 2003. For 5 year CDS we use IMF data which starts only in
2008.
    The source for the TFP in figure (21) is the Conference Board.

B.2    United States
Data for the United States comes from the BEA, the Flow of Funds (FoF), and from the FRBNY
Consumer Credit Panel. BEA and FoF data are standard and widely used so we do not discuss
them.
    The FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel is described in Lee and van der Klaauw (2012). It is a
new longitudinal database with detailed information on consumer debt and credit. This panel is a
random sample from consumer credit reports. It is available from 1999 onwards. Credit reporting
agencies compile and maintain credit histories for all U.S. residents who have applied for or taken
out a loan. Credit bureaus continuously collect information on individual consumers’ debt and
credit from lenders and creditors. Most individuals begin building a credit history when they first
obtain and use a credit or retail card or take out a student loan, usually when they are at least 18
years of age. New immigrants with little or no credit history from their home country are often older

when a credit file is first created for them. The sample design implies that the target population
consists of all US residents with a credit history. In addition to most individuals younger than 18,
who had little need or opportunity for credit activity, the target population excludes individuals
who have never applied for or qualified for a loan.
   The data at the State level is available in three data sets on the FRBNY web site:

   • State level data for all States from 1999 to 2012, annual data for Q4 only.

   • Selected states from 1999 to 2003, quarterly data.

   • Selected states from 2003 to 2014, quarterly data.

Lee and van der Klaauw (2012) argue that household debt estimates based on the FRBNY Con-
sumer Credit Panel are similar to estimates reported in the Board of Governors’ Flow of Funds
Accounts. There are diﬀerences, however. First, the household debt measures in the Flow of Funds
are not based on direct data but instead are derived as residual amounts. Total mortgage debt
and non-mortgage debt in the second quarter of 2010 were respectively $9.4 and $2.3 trillion, the
comparable amounts in the FoF for the same quarter were $10.2 and $2.4 trillion, respectively.
    Second, the FoF measure of household mortgage debt includes some mortgage debt held by
nonprofit organizations (churches, universities, etc.). On the other hand, FRBNY estimates exclude
some debt held by individuals without social security numbers. There may also be diﬀerences in
the speed at which changes in various types of debt are recorded, where new mortgage accounts
usually appear on credit reports with some delay, making some direct comparisons diﬃcult. The
comparison is shown in figure (22).

Local Fiscal Policy One potential issue is whether fiscal policy was not also active in the US.
Perhaps private debt bubbles were associated with large fiscal revenues and large spending. This
probably happened to some extent, but compared to the Eurozone, these eﬀects are small (of course
we are only talking about cross-sectional variation in government spending). Figure (23) shows this
for two states and two countries. A regression for all the states and all the countries shows that the
link between private debt and government spending was at least four times smaller in the US than
in Europe.

    We therefore argue that the US provides a benchmark for private deleveraging without sudden
stops, and with relatively neutral (cross-sectional) fiscal policy.

The scaled data for household and public debt, government expenditures and transfers, 10 year
government bonds, foreign demand, and spreads and our scaled measure of ρj,t are shown in figures
(24), (25), (26) and (27) respectively.
