                                         ABSTRACT

In the absence of first-best climate policy, energy efficiency has figured prominently among
strategies to reduce carbon emissions. One of the most sought-after green certification in the
building sector is the internationally recognized Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design
(LEED). This paper examines the effects of LEED certification on energy efficiency in federally
owned buildings. Using propensity score matching and difference in differences models, we find
no effect of LEED certification on average energy consumption. This reflects the fact that energy
use is one of a number of attributes that receives scores under the LEED program. Buildings with
above average energy scores have greater energy efficiency post-certification. Some other
attributes, notably higher water scores, decrease energy efficiency post-certification. Trade-offs
across LEED attributes account for the absence of energy savings on average. If energy efficiency
is the primary policy goal, LEED certification may not be the most effective means to reach that
goal.

1         Introduction

In the absence of first-best climate policy, energy efficiency has figured prominently among
strategies to reduce carbon emissions. Nevertheless, ex-post outcomes of energy efficiency
initiatives have fallen short of ex-ante model predictions. Possible explanations include
behavioral failures such as inattention and myopia, the rebound effect, and product at-
tribute trade-offs.1 One of the most sought-after green certification in the building sector
is the internationally recognized Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED).
Despite causing increases in property values (Eichholtz, Kok and Quigley, 2010, 2013), it
is not clear that certification would decrease energy consumption. Much like automakers
trade off fuel economy for car weight or engine power to comply with attribute-based
regulation (Knittel, 2011; Ito and Sallee, 2018), real estate developers may trade off en-
ergy savings for other attributes aimed at improving design and comfort in buildings.
To the best of our knowledge, however, there is no credible evidence on the effectiveness
of green certification programs in reducing energy consumption in commercial buildings,
likely due to proprietary data restrictions.2

        In this study, we examine the causal impact of LEED certification on energy con-
sumption among federally owned buildings over the period 1990-2019, using a difference-
in-differences propensity score matching approach. The U.S. federal government has
enormous direct and indirect influence on energy utilization in buildings. The building
sector represented 39% of total U.S. energy consumption in 2019, and over 12% of to-
tal greenhouse gas emissions (U.S. EIA, 2021). Commercial buildings alone accounted
for 18% of energy consumption, and there appears to be opportunities for savings (U.S.
DOE, 2020). Notably, commercial buildings owned by the federal government have his-
torically consumed more energy than privately owned buildings (U.S. DOE, 2020), and
their energy use information can be made accessible to the public.

        Over the last twenty years, energy efficiency has been an increasing priority for the
federal government. Legislation aimed at energy efficiency in federal buildings was in-
troduced by the Energy Policy Act in 1992 and updated in 2005 (Sharp, 1992; Pombo
and Thomas, 2005). Those policies set efficiency standards for federal buildings and reg-

ulated new construction to comply with standards. In 2009, the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act and the Executive Order (EO) 13514 were released in the context of
the Great Recession to further promote the green design of federal buildings. The EO
required that all new construction and 15% of existing buildings meet the Guiding Prin-
ciples for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings by 2015
(Obama, 2009). In response to this set of policies, the General Service Administration
(GSA) announced a $5.55 billion plan to improve their building performance.3

       Retrofitting existing federally owned buildings and obtaining LEED certification for
these retrofits was a major component of the GSA effort beginning in 2001 and acceler-
ating after the 2008-2009 recession. Buildings are LEED certified based on the sum of
scores across several attributes. As a result, buildings do not need to achieve high scores
in energy efficiency if high scores are achieved in other areas, such as site sustainability,
indoor environmental quality, or water efficiency. These trade-offs have some similari-
ties to trade-offs in the U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and
Japanese fuel economy regulations (Knittel, 2011; Ito and Sallee, 2018).

       This paper examines the extent to which LEED certified retrofits yielded energy
savings. The analysis draws on data from the GSA's Energy Usage Analysis System
(EUAS) for all federally owned buildings as well as data from the Green Building In-
formation Gateway (GBIG). Inspired by Eichholtz, Kok and Quigley (2010, 2013), we
use a difference-in-differences propensity score matching approach to estimate the causal
effect of LEED certification on energy efficiency. Matching methods tackle selection on
observables, and difference in differences controls for the presence of unobservables that
under normal circumstances may lead to biased estimates. In our setting, propensity
score matching addresses the fact that LEED certified buildings tend to be much larger
than average. Then, the difference in differences estimation compares buildings that
would be LEED certified before and after retrofitting with otherwise similar buildings
that were not LEED certified.

       We find that there were no energy savings from LEED certification, on average, and
that this seems to be driven by trade-offs across LEED attributes.4 Our estimates show
   3
     The Biden administration plan for energy and climate policy also considers "dramatic investments in
energy efficiency in buildings, including completing 4 million retrofits" (see joebiden.com/clean-energy/).
   4
     Because federal agencies had to "improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (...)
through reduction of energy intensity by (...) 3 percent annually" (F.R., 2007, p.3919), this finding
suggests that LEED certification did not generate any additional savings relative to that baseline.


                                                    2
no effect of LEED certification on average energy consumption in kBTUs/ft2 . This
reflects the fact that energy use is one of a number of attributes that receives scores
under the LEED program. Buildings with higher energy scores have greater energy
efficiency post-certification. This may reflect, for example, the adoption of high efficiency
lighting and high efficiency HVAC. Having a one standard deviation higher energy score
is associated with 17.2% lower energy usage in all buildings and 18.1% lower usage in
office buildings. Some other attributes, notably higher water scores, decrease energy
efficiency post-certification. This may reflect, for example, the use of sensors for water
in sinks and toilets in bathrooms and sensors for water in landscaping. These trade-offs
across LEED attributes seem to account for the absence of energy savings on average.

       Our paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, we provide the first causal
estimates of energy savings from the LEED program using data from federal government
buildings.5 A number of engineering studies have compared the energy efficiency of LEED
and non-LEED buildings (e.g., Wedding and Crawford-Brown, 2008; Scofield, 2009, 2013;
Scofield and Doane, 2018). Like our paper, they have found no energy savings.6 None
of these studies, however, provide causal estimates. USGBC states that there were $1.2
billion in energy savings from the LEED certified buildings between 2015 and 2018 (U.S.
Green Building Council, 2020b). These estimates, however, are based on comparisons
with guidelines rather than examining the actual performance of buildings before and
after retrofitting.

       Second, we provide evidence suggesting that the absence of energy savings from the
LEED certification is driven by the trade-offs across LEED attributes. The trade-offs are
in some ways similar to the trade-offs in fuel economy regulations. Both Knittel (2011)
and Ito and Sallee (2018) show that automobiles are designed to satisfy the increasingly
stringent fuel standards through a secondary attribute ­ car weight ­ instead of improve-
ment in car efficiency. Consistent with this pattern, our study finds that buildings with
higher energy scores had lower energy consumption following retrofitting.7 Yet, buildings
   5
      Our data does not include ex-ante model predictions of energy savings, so our analysis does not
address the energy gap literature (e.g., Allcott and Greenstone, 2012; Levinson, 2016; Gerarden, Newell
and Stavins, 2017; Fowlie, Greenstone and Wolfram, 2018; Gillingham, Keyes and Palmer, 2018).
    6
      Notwithstanding, Eichholtz, Kok and Quigley (2010, 2013) find that LEED-certified commercial
buildings command substantially higher rents and selling prices than otherwise identical buildings. Their
evidence suggests that the "intangible" effects of the label itself may play a role in determining the values
of green buildings in the marketplace. In fact, Matisoff, Noonan and Mazzolini (2014) find that marketing
benefits due to LEED certification may be the primary drivers in the development of green buildings.
    7
      Eichholtz, Kok and Quigley (2010, 2013) indeed find that variations in premiums paid for certified


                                                     3
with high water scores had lower energy efficiency.8 These findings suggest that LEED
is not the optimal program to pursue if energy reduction is the primary goal.

    In what follows, Section 2 lays out the policy background and introduces the LEED
program. Section 3 describes the data and summary statistics of the buildings in the
analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy. Section 5 reports the (lack of) energy
savings from the LEED program, and discusses the heterogeneity of the treatment effects
identifying a mechanism behind the estimated energy outcome. Section 6 concludes.



2     Background

The building sector represents 39% of the total energy consumption in the U.S. (U.S.
EIA, 2021). A substantial portion of that consumption is thought to be wasted (U.S.
DOE, 2020). Federal government buildings are regarded as less efficient and consume
considerably more energy than non-government commercial buildings (U.S. EIA, 2016).
As a result, there has been a growing attention to green building design and an increasing
number of policies that regulate energy performance in federal buildings.

    Energy efficiency efforts began in the 1990s and gained momentum in the 2000s.
The standards for energy efficiency for federal buildings were first set by the Energy
Policy Act in 1992 (Sharp, 1992). It comprehensively described the energy needs in the
United States and aligned the building codes with energy efficiency codes. This policy
was amended in 2005 to set energy reduction goals for the federal buildings between
2006 and 2015 (Pombo and Thomas, 2005). In response to the Great Recession of
2008-2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was released in 2009 to also
promote green design in federal buildings (Obey, 2009). Later that year Executive Order
(EO) 13514 was signed, requiring new construction and at least 15% of the existing
buildings to comply with the Guiding Principles by 2015 (Obama, 2009). The Guiding
Principles emphasized the improvement of building sustainability, within which energy
performance was expected to be optimized (The Council on Environmental Quality,
2016). A Presidential Memorandum was issued in the next year to ensure the goals
buildings in the marketplace are systematically related to energy-saving characteristics. The attributes
rated for thermal efficiency, as well as sustainability, contribute to premiums in rents and asset values.
   8
     This finding is consistent with results from Kahn, Kok and Quigley (2014). Although their sample
does not include government buildings, they find that commercial buildings that are newer and of higher
quality consume more electricity, contrasting evidence for the residential sector (e.g., Levinson, 2016).

                                                    4
could be properly achieved (Obama, 2011). The EO was revised in 2016 but there
were no major changes in the requirements for building energy usage (Obama, 2015).
Responding to these series of regulations, GSA announced a $5.55 billion plan in 2010
to achieve significant savings from their buildings. Part of the focus was on LEED
certification (Kampschroer, 2010).

        LEED was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) to rate green
building strategies across several categories. Unlike other widely recognized labels such
as the Energy Star, which focuses on energy use, LEED certifies a building based on a
comprehensive evaluation of six categories. The scoreboard includes energy and atmo-
sphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, sustainable sites, water
efficiency, and innovation in operations. The energy component accounts for the largest
share, more than 30%. This paper does not focus on the heterogeneous effects across
LEED tiers because we have a limited number of observations within each tier bin.9
Instead, we investigate the impacts associated with the component scores directly. Ap-
pendix I provides a more detailed introduction to the LEED program, and Appendix
Table A.1 presents an overview of some important credit categories for each component
in the LEED score board.



3         Data Sources and Summary Statistics

This study uses three sources of data: the Energy Usage Analysis System (EUAS) dataset
from the General Services Administration (GSA), the Green Building Information Gate-
way (GBIG) reports, and weather data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
istration (NOAA). The EUAS dataset provides monthly energy consumption data for
GSA buildings in the 48 contiguous American states plus District of Columbia for the
period 1990 to 2019. We aggregate the data to the annual level.10

        The GBIG reports provide information on LEED certified buildings. Based on the
    9
     For the record, LEED-certified projects earn one of four rating levels: certified, silver, gold or
platinum. Prior studies in real estate and marketing have examined tier bunching (Matisoff, Noonan
and Mazzolini, 2014; Rysman, Simcoe and Wang, 2020), but we lack enough data variation in our setting.
  10
     Data are missing for some building-month observations. For the months with missing data, we use
the average consumption of the individual building in that year to interpolate those values. Later we
report that our findings are similar if we use monthly data, although slightly less precisely estimated,
and in unreported analysis we find no noticeable heterogeneity by season of the year.



                                                   5
street address, we match these reports to the EUAS dataset. Specifically, it includes
facility address, program registration and certification dates, certified square footage,
and scores for each LEED category. The NOAA data allow us to control for variation in
weather across time and building location.

       Appendix Table A.2 provides information on the number of buildings in the dataset.
We restrict attention to buildings owned by the federal government, because the LEED
buildings are all federally owned. This reduces the sample size substantially. We only
keep buildings with at least 8 years before and 4 years after the treatment date to ensure
a balanced panel while still keeping enough observations for estimation. This drops
43 LEED buildings, many of which are new construction. A few LEED buildings are
dropped due to incomplete data. Our analysis focuses on the 60 LEED buildings with
complete LEED component score data.11 Appendix Table A.3 shows the type of LEED
programs for these 60 LEED buildings. More than half of those buildings are existing
buildings which obtained LEED certification via retrofitting.

       Two issues are worth noting with respect to LEED buildings. First, buildings can
be LEED certified for a subset of the overall square footage. The guidelines published
by U.S. Green Building Council (2020a) use 5% as the lower bound for certification.
Appendix Figure A.1 shows the distribution of the certified ratio. Most LEED-certified
buildings in our sample obtain certification for a high share of the overall square footage.

       Second, GBIG reports provide both registration and certification dates for LEED
buildings. Because there is no mandatory timeline for a building to achieve LEED cer-
tification after registering with the program, it is hard to determine when the building
retrofit actually starts. Thus, we focus on the awarded date of the LEED certification.
Awarding of the certification only occurs after the completion of retrofits. Some LEED
programs also require one year of "performance period" before granting a building the
initial certification so as to monitor its operation after the renovation (Wehe, 2020).12

       Building energy consumption can be measured as site energy, which is reported by the
EUAS dataset, or as source energy. Site energy is the amount of heat and electricity con-
  11
     The estimates are qualitatively similar to our main results when conducting the analysis with an
unbalanced panel and the incomplete score sample.
  12
     The LEED EB program ­ LEED for Existing Buildings ­ is the program requiring a "performance
period" to monitor operations before granting the certification. As mentioned above, over half of the
buildings in our main sample are certified by this type of program.



                                                 6
sumed by a building as reflected in the utility bill, whereas source energy represents the
total amount of raw fuel that is required to operate a building, incorporating all transmis-
sion, delivery, and production losses (U.S. EPA, 2020). Since both site and source energy
can be served as the benchmark for LEED compliance (U.S. Green Building Council,
2018), we calculate source energy using the U.S. EPA (2019) Technical Reference. The
estimates from site and source energy are similar. We report results for site energy in
the main text and report selected results for source energy in the appendix.

    Table 1, Panel A, provides summary statistics for LEED and non-LEED buildings,
including pre-treatment energy use intensity and building size. Energy use intensity
(EUI) is defined as the ratio of total energy consumption and the square footage of
a building. Pre-treatment is defined as the first 12 months that a building appears
in the dataset. It also reports the differences between treated and untreated building
groups. LEED buildings are significantly larger than non-LEED buildings in square
footage. The federal government appears to have focused on the largest buildings for
LEED certification. The majority of LEED and non-LEED buildings are office buildings,
and most of the remaining buildings are courthouses.

    Table 1, Panel B, provides the number of LEED and non-LEED buildings, and Panel
C reports average LEED program attributes in our sample. Because the LEED program
has changed slightly over time, we report the component score divided by the total
achievable score. Given that the component scores for materials and resources, indoor
environmental quality, and innovation in operations are highly positively correlated (see
Appendix Table A.4), we combined these into a single measure. Histograms of the
scores are shown in Appendix Figure A.2. To facilitate comparison, in the analysis the
component scores and the certification ratio are all standardized to have mean zero and
standard deviation one.



4     Empirical Strategy

This section introduces the methodology to estimate the energy savings from the LEED
certification. Building on Eichholtz, Kok and Quigley (2010, 2013), we implement a
two-stage strategy to address differences in pre-treatment characteristics of the LEED
and non-LEED buildings, and then compare the two groups to infer the energy reduc-


                                             7
tions brought about by the LEED program. Specifically, propensity score matching is
employed in the first stage to construct a sub-sample of the untreated buildings with
similar characteristics to treated buildings. After that, difference in differences models
are applied in the second stage with the newly constructed sample to evaluate the energy
outcome from the certification.

       Our paper implements several matching algorithms and estimates both site and source
energy savings from the LEED program. These specifications generate similar estimates.
Thus, we report the results for site energy with a five nearest-neighbor (5NN) propensity
score matching in the main discussion, leaving other cases for the appendix.13


4.1       First Stage: Propensity Score Matching

In the first stage of the analysis, we regress the LEED indicator on building characteristics
and obtain the propensity scores. Following Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008), we use a probit
regression to bound the LEED indicator in the range of [0, 1].

       The basic specification is


                                     P r(Di = 1|Xi ) = (Xi  ),                                         (1)


where D is a dummy variable equal to one if a building i is LEED certified and zero
otherwise. X represents a vector of building characteristics that may differ between the
treated and untreated buildings, including building size and the pre-treatment energy
use intensity (EUI). Although the two groups of buildings seem comparable in the pre-
treatment consumption from Table 1, this variation is still included in the propensity score
estimation to ensure a similar consumption pattern between the treated and untreated
groups after matching. Moreover, we also incorporate the polynomial forms of these
variables in the X to address biases that might arise from a specific functional form.14

       Figure 1a shows the distribution of the propensity scores before matching. The hor-
izontal axis represents the propensity score while the vertical axis corresponds to the
  13
    The regression results for other cases are reported in Appendix Table A.5.
  14
    The estimated propensity scores become stable after having the energy consumption terms with
third or higher power and the building size term with fourth or higher power. For this reason, the
X includes: pre-treatment site log (EU I )n (n = 1, 2, 3); pre-treatment source log (EU I )n (n = 1, 2, 3);
building sizen (n = 1, 2, 3). We also conduct a robustness check to only match on site energy or source
energy. The estimates are similar to our main results.

                                                    8
proportions of buildings that fall into each propensity score bin. It indicates good com-
mon support if the distribution of the propensity scores is similar for the two groups.
We see from the figure that the treated buildings are concentrated between the propen-
sity score of 0.1 and 0.3, while the untreated buildings are right-skewed with many of
them falling in the first propensity score bin. With the estimated propensity score, we
match the non-LEED buildings to the LEED buildings using k -nearest neighbors (kN N )
with replacement. This method matches k untreated buildings to each treated build-
ing that share similar propensity scores, so as to create a subset of buildings that are
comparable in size and baseline energy consumption.15 Because this approach allows the
non-LEED buildings to be matched more than once, there could be duplicate buildings
in the untreated group. Figure 1b shows the propensity score distribution for treated and
untreated buildings after matching with five nearest neighbors (5NN). We see that the
untreated buildings are now more evenly spread across the propensity score bins. More
importantly, the distributions of the scores are similar across the two groups, which sup-
ports the validity of the matching results. In this matching process, every building in
the treatment group is able to find a relatively good match. Appendix Figure A.3 shows
the locations of LEED and non-LEED buildings before and after matching.

    Table 1, Panel A, also reports the descriptive statistics of LEED and non-LEED
buildings after matching with 5NN. The gap in building size between the two groups is
greatly reduced after matching and becomes no longer statistically significant. Mean-
while, the difference in the pre-treatment energy use intensity also remains insignificant.
These statistics provide supporting evidence for the common support assumption, which
is useful in the second-stage analysis.


4.2     Second Stage: Difference-in-Differences Models

In the second stage of the analysis, we estimate the energy savings from the LEED
program. The specification is as follows:


                            ln(EU Iit ) = Tit + Xit  + i + t +          it ,                       (2)
  15
     If the propensity score of a treated building is higher than the maximum or lower than the minimum
score of any untreated buildings, this treated unit would be considered an outlier and dropped from the
dataset. None of the LEED buildings are dropped.




                                                  9
where subscript i refers to each individual building i, and t refers to year t.16 The
dependent variable ln(EU Iit ) is the energy use intensity in logarithm form. Tit is the
treatment indicator equal to 1 if building i in year t is LEED certified.17 Xit is a vector
that captures weather variation, which includes annual cooling degree days (CDDs) and
annual heating degree days (HDDs). i represents a set of building fixed effects, and t
a set of year fixed effects. Because the matching with replacement in the first stage can
introduce duplicate buildings in the untreated group, the regression is weighted by the
number of repeated observations in the dataset.18

       To examine the parallel trends assumption, we carry out an event study analysis to
show the energy consumption difference between the treated and untreated groups each
year relative to the difference in the reference year. Because the LEED buildings are
certified in different years, we treat the certification year as year zero. After that, lead
and lag terms are created for years before and after the certified year. Our specification
leaves out the -1 year from the regression, as that year corresponds to the beginning of
the "performance period" discussed earlier. That is, we assume building renovations for
the LEED buildings are completed at least one year before the certified date. Hence, the
-1 year is the reference year in our setting. Specifically, the regression is run as follows
                                      q                 m
            ln(EU Iit ) = i + t +         + Di,t+ +                     ~ it  + Xit  +
                                                              - Di,t- + D                   it .     (3)
                                     =2                  =0


       The first sum allows for q leads (+1 ,...,+q ) and Di,t+ equals to 1 if the calendar year
t is  year(s) before the building is LEED certified. Similarly, the second sum allows
for m lags (0 , ...,-m ) and Di,t- equals to 1 if the calendar year t is  year(s) after
LEED certification. Because our data is balanced with 8 years pre-treatment and 4 years
                                                             ~ is a vector that captures
post-treatment, q and m are set to be 8 and 4, respectively. D           it

the sum of lead and lag terms that are far away from the treatment year to minimize
noise in the estimation. It represents the endpoint restrictions (Kline, 2012).
  16
     Appendix Table A.6 estimates this specification with monthly data. The results are almost identical
to our main findings, although slightly less precisely estimated. In unreported analysis available upon
request we find no noticeable heterogeneity by season of the year.
  17
     As a preview of the results of the main analysis, Appendix Figure A.4 shows the full distribution of
energy consumption for LEED and non-LEED buildings, before and after certification. Appendix Figure
A.5 displays the differences in energy consumption between LEED and non-LEED buildings over time.
  18
     More than half of the non-LEED buildings are matched only once, but there are cases when non-
LEED buildings are matched more than once. The maximum number of matches is 5. We also present
results weighted by both building size and duplicates. Estimates are shown in Appendix Table A.7, and
indicate similar patterns as the main results.

5        Results

5.1       Impacts of LEED Certification on Energy Consumption

Table 2 shows that LEED certification did not have a statistically significant effect on
energy consumption. The coefficients on LEED certification in columns (1)-(8) are con-
sistently small and not statistically significant. Recall that the certification ratio and the
component scores are all standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation
of one. Thus, in columns (2)-(8) the coefficients of the interactions represent the effects
of a one standard deviation increase in the corresponding variables. Column (7) shows
the results for all buildings, and column (8) restricts attention to office buildings.

       Buildings with higher energy scores had lower energy consumption following certifi-
cation. In columns (7) and (8), a one standard deviation increase in energy score was
associated with a nearly 17.2% decrease in energy consumption in all buildings and 18.1%
lower in office buildings. LEED certification was associated with improvements in energy
efficiency for buildings where energy efficiency was a focus.

       This reduction in energy consumption is economically meaningful. The average en-
ergy intensity of the LEED buildings in the year they were certified is approximately
21kWh/ft2 . Assuming the electricity price is between 5-18 cents/kWh, the annual sav-
ings associated with the reduction are 18-65 cents/ft2 .19 The typical cost of green retrofit
for an entire building is anywhere between $2-7/ft2 (Lockwood, 2009), and thus the av-
erage payback year of the LEED retrofit is around 7-25 years.20 This implied payback
period is reasonable, given that the usual payback time for an energy efficiency program is
around 2-15 years depending on the building's age and other information. Moreover, the
payback period is relatively consistent with the requirements from the Obama (2011)'s
Memorandum if the retrofit is done properly. The Memorandum specified "agencies shall
fully implement energy conservation measures (ECMs) in federal buildings with a pay-
back time of less than 10 years." These calculations suggest that if the LEED certification
has relied heavily on the energy attribute, which is the energy performance optimization,
  19
     The electricity price varies across states. Based on the U.S. EIA (2020)'s monthly report, California
has the highest electricity price, 18.39 cents/kWh, while Nevada has the lowest electricity price, 4.59
cents/kWh.
  20
     Assuming the average retrofit cost is $4.5/ft2 , the payback year is calculated as P aybackP eriod =

the energy savings should be non-trivial. As shown in Appendix Table A.1, a building
can reach high energy scores by installing efficient lighting and HVAC, for example.

   On the other hand, buildings with higher water scores had higher energy consumption
following certification. In columns (7) and (8), a one standard deviation increase in water
score was associated with a 7-11% increase in energy consumption. This suggests that
some buildings are focusing on attributes other than energy to achieve LEED certification.
As highlighted in Appendix Table A.1, this may reflect, for example, the use of sensors
for water in sinks and toilets in bathrooms and sensors for water in landscaping.

   To illustrate the trade-offs between energy and water, Appendix Table A.8 presents
the effects for different combinations of the energy and water scores. For example, at
the extremes, a building that had a one standard deviation higher energy score and
one standard deviation lower water score than average would have energy use that was
24.7% lower than a non-LEED building. Conversely, a building that had a one standard
deviation lower energy score and one standard deviation higher water score than average
would have energy use that was 23.9% higher than a non-LEED building. A building that
had one standard deviation higher energy and water scores would have energy use that
was 10.5% lower than a non-LEED building. Similar conclusions hold when restricted to
office buildings.

   Figure 2a presents the results of the event study. The post-treatment coefficients are
all around zero, which echo the results from the difference-in-differences model. The x-
axis represents a timeline of the LEED certification procedure. Buildings are certified at
year 0, and the reference year is set at year -1. The average registration year of the LEED
buildings is 3 years before the certified date. The y -axis is the energy savings from the
LEED program in each year relative to the reference year. As observed, all coefficients
are around zero except for some fluctuations around the registration year such as year -4.
We suspect these negative values are a result of building renovation preparation when
occupants of the buildings are requested to leave the buildings for the retrofit to begin.
With fewer residents remaining in the buildings, consumption would decrease. Other
than that, the pre-trend looks flat and seems to supports the parallel trends assumption
needed for our difference-in-differences approach.

5.2    Robustness Checks

One possible reason for the lack of improvement in LEED certified buildings post-
certification might be that the matched untreated buildings are also improving their
energy efficiency over time. The EUAS database has information on upgrades that oc-
curred in both LEED buildings and non-LEED buildings. In fact, approximately half
of the buildings in the dataset have adopted energy conservation strategies, regardless
of their LEED status. These upgrades include advanced metering, building envelope,
building tune up or utility improvement, HVAC, indoor environmental quality, lighting,
renewable energy, water efficiency, and others. Buildings might adopt more than one
of these upgrades, and they are not necessarily completed in the same year. Appendix
Figure A.6 shows the completion year of the first conservation initiative the buildings par-
ticipated in. As indicated in the figure, most of the conservation measures were finished
in 2011 for both LEED and non-LEED buildings. There is no indication that buildings
with LEED certification must have to adopt those upgrades. In fact, the correlation be-
tween LEED certification and participation in any energy efficiency initiative is very low,
-0.036. Further, most of the LEED buildings completed energy conservation upgrades
before their certification, as revealed by Appendix Figure A.7.

   Table 3 shows that our results are robust to the inclusion of upgrades as controls and
dropping buildings with low certification ratios. Columns (1) and (2) re-estimate the
earlier specifications but with these improvements as controls. All control variables in
the table are indicator variables. They equal 1 when building i in year t has completed the
upgrade, and zero otherwise. As shown in the columns, the results are similar to Table
2. To explore the effect of low certification ratios, we drop the 7 LEED buildings with
certification ratios below 50%. Results are shown in columns (3) and (4). Comparing to
our main results in Table 2, the estimates are similar as well.

   To investigate the regional impacts on the energy component score and water compo-
nent score in LEED buildings, Appendix Figure A.8 plots the score distributions across
four census regions. Notice that the energy scores in the Midwest are comparable to
those in the South, despite the contrasting climate zones of these two regions. Likewise,
the water component score distributions are identical across all four regions. Places with
water scarcity problem, such as the West, do not perform better in water conservation.



                                            13
    Appendix Table A.5 shows that our results are robust to the number of nearest
neighbors used in the matching procedure, and to using source rather than site energy.
Appendix Figure A.9 suggests that the parallel trends assumption seems to hold in all
four cases. The effects of different attributes, notably energy and water scores, are similar
to the main estimates reported in Table 2.

    As a falsification test, we run the event study regressions only with the non-LEED
buildings. Although we implemented the propensity score matching, it would still be
a concern if the untreated buildings are affected by some shocks that are missed from
the difference-in-differences model but would drive down their energy use intensity. We
repeat the first and second stage regressions with only the non-LEED buildings and
report the  's from Equation (3). Detailed procedures for this falsification test can be
found in Appendix II. If shocks do not play a major role in our findings, all the  's should
be around zero. Figure 2b plots the results for 5NN matching. The coefficients are all
close to zero. This pattern also holds when conducting the analysis with source energy
and the 3NN matching, as displayed in Appendix Figure A.10.



6     Concluding Remarks

The U.S. federal government has implemented a series of policies to improve energy effi-
ciency and sustainability of the federal buildings. Leadership in Energy & Environmental
Design (LEED) certification was one important focus of this effort. This paper inves-
tigates the energy savings yielded by the certification. By employing propensity score
matching and difference in differences models, we estimate the causal effects of LEED
certification on energy consumption of federally owned buildings.

    We have two primary findings. First, our estimates show no effect of LEED certifi-
cation on average energy consumption measured in kBTUs/ft2 . Second, the absence of
an effect seems to be driven by trade-offs across LEED attributes. Buildings with higher
energy scores have greater energy efficiency post-certification. Some other attributes, no-
tably higher water scores, decrease energy efficiency post-certification. These trade-offs
across LEED attributes seems to account for the absence of energy savings on average.

    Our findings have substantial policy implications. Although the USGBC has been



                                             14
revising the LEED scoreboard to increase emphasis on the energy component,21 the
trade-offs inherent in LEED certification are likely to remain. If energy efficiency is the
primary policy goal, LEED certification may not be the most effective means to reach that
goal. The Biden administration plan considers "dramatic investments in energy efficiency
in buildings, including completing 4 million retrofits" (see joebiden.com/clean-energy/).
Attention should be paid on designing policies that provide the intended incentives.




  21
    In 2016, for example, USGBC members voted to increase the minimum simulated improvement in
energy performance for new buildings from 10 to 18%, and for major renovations to existing buildings
from 5 to 14% (see usgbc.org/credits/core-shell-new-construction/v2009/eap2). Interestingly, they state
that "[t]he proposed changes are based on user and volunteer feedback" (see usgbc.org/articles/leed-
2009-energy-performance-update). It may well be the case that users were already noticing in practice
what we have found in this study.

Notes : This table reports average characteristics of federal buildings with LEED certification and
those without it, before and after five-nearest-neighbor (5NN) matching. The sample includes
buildings observed over the period 1990-2019. Panel A reports building characteristic variables for
buildings in the treated group and buildings in the untreated group before and after 5NN matching.
Pre-treatment is defined as the first 12 months that a building appears in the dataset. EUI stands for
energy use intensity, which is defined as the ratio of total energy consumption and the square footage
of a building. Site energy is the amount of heat and electricity consumed by a building as reflected
in the utility bill, whereas source energy represents the total amount of raw fuel that is required to
operate a building, incorporating all transmission, delivery, and production losses. Panel B shows the
number of buildings for treated and untreated buildings before and after matching. It is important to
note that the untreated buildings are matched to LEED buildings with replacement, thus non-LEED
buildings can appear more than once in the untreated group after 5NN matching. Panel C presents
averages of different attributes in the LEED program for LEED-certified buildings. CR stands for
certified ratio, and refers to the fraction of a building square footage that is LEED-certified. ES,
SS, WS, and MIIS represent the component score proportions evaluated by the LEED program:
energy and atmosphere, sustainable sites, water efficiency, and the combination of material, indoor
environment, and innovation, respectively. Score proportion is defined as the ratio of the component
score and the total achievable score in the LEED program. Standard deviations are reported in
brackets, and standard errors clustered by building in parentheses. *** denotes statistical significance
at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level.

 Notes : This table reports estimates of energy savings from the LEED program in federal buildings
 over the period 1990-2019, and the results of the heterogeneity analysis regarding different program
 attributes. The dependent variable is the log of site energy use intensity, and the untreated group
 is constructed using five-nearest-neighbor (5NN) matching with replacement. Energy use intensity
 is defined as the ratio of total energy consumption and the square footage of a building. Site
 energy is the amount of heat and electricity consumed by a building as reflected in the utility
 bill. T is the treatment indicator equal to one if a building i in year t is certified, and zero
 otherwise. CR stands for certified ratio, and refers to the fraction of a building square footage
 that is LEED-certified. ES, SS, WS, and MIIS represent the component scores evaluated by the
 LEED program: energy and atmosphere, sustainable sites, water efficiency, and the combination
 of material, indoor environment, and innovation, respectively. To facilitate comparison, CR, ES,
 SS, WS, and MIIS are all standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one. Column (1)
 reports the aggregate energy savings from the LEED program. Columns (2)-(6) differentiate the
 energy savings by each attribute of the LEED program. Columns (7) and (8) show estimates when
 including all program attributes in the regression. Column (7) reports the results for all buildings,
 and column (8) restricts attention to office buildings. The coefficients on LEED certification in
 columns (1)-(8) are consistently small and insignificant, which suggest that LEED certification did
 not have a statistically significant effect on energy consumption. A significant negative estimate
 on energy component score, and a significant positive estimate on water component score after
 controlling for the rest of the attributes in the LEED program in columns (7) and (8) suggest
 a trade-off between energy and water components when a building is LEED certified. CDD and
 HDD are included as controls in all regressions. Because of the potentially repeated non-LEED
 buildings in the untreated group due to matching with replacement, all regressions are weighted
 by the inverse of the number of repeated observations. Standard errors clustered by building are
 reported in parentheses. *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and
 * at the 10% level.

Appendix I: LEED Program Introduction

LEED was first developed and launched by USGBC with the help from the Federal
Energy Management Program in 1998 (Rosa, 2016). Unlike other widely recognized
labels such as Energy Star, which focus energy use, LEED certifies a building based on
a comprehensive evaluation of six categories. When the total score of these categories
exceeds a certain range, the building is LEED certified.

      There are several LEED programs involved in our dataset (Appendix Table A.3), yet
more than half of them were certified with LEED EB 2009. The LEED scoreboard gener-
ally includes energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental qual-
ity, sustainable sites, water efficiency, and innovation in operations. With each of them
taking up different proportions of the total score, the energy component accounts for the
largest share, more than 30%.1 Appendix Table A.1 sketches some main credit categories
for different components with examples. Some upgrades in the non-energy component
might results in higher energy consumption. For example, water saving faucets with
sensors might consume more energy compared to those without.

    There could be minimum score requirement for some components, but the mandatory score is small
in comparison to the maximum score of the components.

Appendix II: Robustness Check on Non-LEED Build-
ings

The energy savings are derived by comparing the difference in consumption between
LEED and non-LEED buildings in post certification period relative to the same difference
before the reference year. Although we implemented the propensity score matching, it
would still be a concern if the untreated buildings are affected by some shocks that are
missed from the difference-in-differences model but would drive down their energy use
intensity.

       We repeat the first and second stage regressions with only the non-LEED buildings
and report the  's from equation (3). We follow the step below to first assign the treat-
ment indicator to the untreated buildings:

   1. Generate bins based on the building size with bandwidth of 7,500 ft2 .

   2. If the non-LEED buildings fall into the same bin with a LEED building, those
         non-LEED buildings are assigned the treatment date of this LEED building.

   3. If two or more LEED building appear in the same bin, we generate random numbers
         for both LEED and non-LEED buildings in the bin. Then, we assign the treatment
         date of the LEED buildings to the non-LEED buildings if their numbers match.

   4. If a non-LEED building lays in a bin that does not contain any LEED buildings,
         this non-LEED building will not be assigned to any treatment date and is regarded
         as untreated.

       Take the sample after 5NN matching as an example. Among the 300 non-LEED
buildings, 105 of them are assigned as treated while all the rest as assigned as untreated.
Then, we follow the steps similar to the main results estimation and construct a balanced
panel for the treated buildings to ensure enough pre- and post- treatment periods. This
process eliminates 9 buildings from the treated group and leaves us with 96 buildings.2 We
then apply the same specification as the main results for the propensity score matching
and the event study regression.
   2
    Because there are repeated buildings in the non-LEED buildings group from the with replacement
propensity score matching stage, the number of buildings identified in the text does not correspond to
the amount of unique buildings. Among the 9 eliminated buildings, 4 buildings are unique.

                                                 27
   Figure 2b plots the results of the second stage using non-LEED buildings after 5NN
matching. All the  's are around zero in the figure, which suggest that there is no shocks
in the non-LEED buildings. We also conduct the robustness checks for the sample after
3NN matching and observe similar zero  's for all event times (see Appendix Figure
A.10).

     Figure A.1: The Distribution of the Certified Ratio in the Treated Group




 Notes: This figure shows the distribution of certified ratio in the LEED buildings. Note that
 we regard a building as certified unless the ratio is greater than 5%. Thus, the start point of
 the first bin is 0.05. The ratio average, 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile are 0.831, 0.411, 0.930, and 1.

The energy, sustainable and water component scores spread out symmetrically. The material,
indoor environment, and innovation components combined score is right skewed with most
of the buildings fall in the first bin.   The score average, 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile
are 0.153, 0.058, 0.159, and 0.227 for the energy component; 0.110, 0.036, 0.115, and 0.200
for the sustainable component; 0.050, 0.018, 0.050, and 0.082 for the water component; 0.193,
0.109, 0.155, and 0.297 for the material, indoor environment, and innovation components combined.

 Figure A.5: Difference in Energy Use Intensity between LEED and Non-LEED
                             Buildings Over Years




Notes: This figure displays the difference in energy use intensity between LEED and non-LEED
buildings throughout years. The descriptive regression is specified as follows

                 2019                         2019                 1                 2019

                 =1990                        =1990               i=0                =1990
                                                                                                         (4)
The dependent variable is the energy use intensity in logarithm form for each building i in year t.
Y eart is a dummy variable that equals 1 when t =  and equals 0 otherwise. LEEDi is also an
indicator variable and equals to 1 if building i is certified and 0 otherwise. 1stY earit controls the
noise brought about by the composition difference between the LEED and non-LEED buildings in
the dataset. It equals to 1 if building i first enters the dataset in year t. In another words, the last
three sums serve as the year, LEED, and initial consumption composition fixed effects. The figure
plots the all the  's to show the changes in energy consumption between treated and untreated
groups from 1991 to 2019. Year 1990 is omitted because it is set as the reference year. As can be
observed from the trend, the consumption difference between the two groups are similar and close
to zero throughout years.

Notes: This figure provides the distribution of the completion year differences of the energy
conservation upgrade and the LEED program. For example, -2 means the first energy conservation
upgrade in the building was completed 2 years before the building was LEED certified. Among the
60 LEED certified buildings, 41 of them have adopted at least one energy conservation upgrade.
This figure is plotted with these 41 LEED buildings.

Notes: This table provides an overview of some important credit categories for each component in
the LEED score board using LEED EB 2009 as an example. LEED EB means LEED for existing
buildings. More than half of the treated buildings included in our sample were certified based
on LEED EB 2009. Note that the credit categories listed here are only the ones that contain
the majority of points. The total achievable score for LEED EB 2009 is 110, with 35 points for
Energy and Atmosphere, 26 points for Sustainable Sites, 14 points for Water Efficiency, 10 points
for Material and Resources, 15 points for Indoor Environmental Quality, 6 points for Innovation
in Operations, and 4 points for Regional Priority. Our paper does not include the discussion of
Regional Priority because it grants points based on local issues, thus its requirements vary across
different LEED programs. GBIG reports do not record the points for this component either.

Notes: This table summarizes the changes in sample sizes with corresponding sample construction
criteria. We have a total of 1,561 buildings in the dataset. As discussed in Section 3, the LEED
buildings are identified based on their address in the EUAS dataset and the GBIG reports. 7
out of 110 LEED buildings record vague/inaccurate street address in the EUAS dataset, thus we
manually map them to LEED buildings in the GBIG reports through Google Maps. As indicated
in the table, all LEED buildings are owned by the GSA. The balanced panel ensures that the LEED
buildings have data at least 8 years before and 4 years after the treatment. Among the 43 buildings
that are deducted from the complete data to construct a balanced panel for the analysis, 39 of
them do not contain at least 8 years of data before the treatment date, where most of them only
start recording their consumption around the certification year. The remaining 4 buildings do not
report enough post treatment data (no longer than 2 years after the treatment). Due to different
types of the LEED program, 7 buildings do not report the complete six components scores. The
main results in the paper are estimated using the sample of balanced panel with complete LEED
scores. This sample consists of 60 LEED buildings and 456 non-LEED buildings. 8 out of 60
LEED buildings in the sample are certified more than once, and we assign their first compliance
year as the treatment indicator in our analysis. For robustness check, estimates remain stable if we
exclude those 8 buildings from the treatment group. Also, for the record, we exclude one LEED
building from the dataset because it has abnormal consumption trend over the years. Results with
the inclusion of this building are similar to the main analysis.

    Notes: This table reports energy savings from the LEED program in federal buildings and the
    heterogeneity treatment effects regarding different program dimensions with different matching
    method and energy sources. The dependent variable is the log of site energy use intensity, and
    the untreated group is constructed using five-nearest-neighbor (5NN) and three-nearest-neighbor
    (3NN) matching with replacement. T is the treatment indicator equal to one if a building i in year t
    is certified, and zero otherwise. CR stands for certified ratio, and refers to the fraction of a building
    square footage that is LEED-certified. ES, SS, WS, and MIIS represent the component scores
    evaluated by the LEED program: energy and atmosphere, sustainable sites, water efficiency, and
    the combination of material, indoor environment, and innovation, respectively. To facilitate com-
    parison, CR, ES, SS, WS, and MIIS are all standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation
    one. Column (1), (3), (5), and (7) are estimated regardless of building types, whereas column (2),
    (4), (6), and (8) restrict the sample to office buildings only. As observed, the coefficients are very
    similar to the main results reported in Table 2 column (7) and (8). CDD and HDD are included
    as controls in all regressions. Because of the potentially repeated non-LEED buildings in the
    untreated group due to matching with replacement, all regressions are weighted by the inverse of
    the number of repeated observations. Standard errors clustered by building are reported in paren-
    theses. *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level.

Notes: This table reports energy savings from the LEED program in federal buildings and the
heterogeneity treatment effects regarding different program dimensions with multiple weights. The
dependent variable is the log of site energy use intensity, and the untreated group is constructed
using five-nearest-neighbor (5NN) matching with replacement. T is the treatment indicator equal
to one if a building i in year t is certified, and zero otherwise. CR stands for certified ratio,
and refers to the fraction of a building square footage that is LEED-certified. ES, SS, WS, and
MIIS represent the component scores evaluated by the LEED program: energy and atmosphere,
sustainable sites, water efficiency, and the combination of material, indoor environment, and
innovation, respectively. To facilitate comparison, CR, ES, SS, WS, and MIIS are all standardized
to have mean zero and standard deviation one.              Column (1) reports the aggregated energy
savings from the LEED program.          Columns (2)-(6) differentiate the energy savings by each
attribute of the LEED program. Columns (7) and (8) show estimates when including all program
attributes in the regression. Column (7) reports the results for all buildings, and column (8)
restricts attention to office buildings. CDD and HDD are included as controls in all regressions.
The regressions are weighted by two variables.             First, because of the potentially repeated
non-LEED buildings in the untreated group due to matching with replacement, all regressions
are weighted by the inverse of the number of repeated observations. Second, we also weight
the regressions by building sizes. Standard errors clustered by building are reported in paren-
theses. *** denotes statistical significance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level.

 Notes : This table shows the energy use intensity impacts with different combinations of the energy
 and water component scores. The values are calculated based on columns (7) and (8) from Table 2
 ­ for all buildings and office buildings, respectively ­ and they provide an easier way to understand
 those estimated coefficients. ES and WS in the row and column labels represent component scores
 of energy and atmosphere and water efficiency, respectively. Each number in this table represents
 the average percentage change in building energy use when increasing or decreasing one standard
 deviation (S.D.) of the corresponding score component. For example, at the extremes, a building
 that had a one standard deviation higher energy score than average and one standard deviation
 lower water score than average would have energy use that was 24.7% lower than a non-LEED
 building.
