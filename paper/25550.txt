Job creation in Colombia vs the U.S.: “up or out dynamics” meets “the life cycle of plants”.

                                          ABSTRACT

There is growing consensus that a key difference between the U.S. and developing economies is
that the latter exhibit slower employment growth over the life cycle of the average business. At
the same time, the rapid post entry growth in the U.S. is driven by an “up or out dynamic”. We
track manufacturing establishments in Colombia vs. the US and find that slower average life
cycle growth in Colombia is driven by a less enthusiastic contribution of extraordinary growth
plants and less dynamic selection of young underperforming plants. As a consequence, the size
distribution of non-micro plants exhibits more concentration in small-old plants in Colombia,
both in unweighted and employment-weighted bases. These findings point to a shortage of high-
growth entrepreneurship and a relatively high likelihood of long-run survival for small, likely
unproductive plants, as two key elements at the heart of the development problem. An extreme
concentration of resources in micro plants is the other distinguishing feature of the Colombian
manufacturing sector vis a vis the US.

1         Introduction

The …nding that employment growth over an average business’ life cycle is lower
in Mexico and India compared to the US (Hsieh and Klenow, 2014, hereafter HK)
suggests the life cycle growth of businesses may be a crucial driver of development.
At the same time, employment growth in the U.S. exhibits “up or out” dynamics
with most startups exiting but a small fraction of fast growing surviving startups
contributing disproportionately to aggregate job growth (Haltiwanger, Jarmin and
Miranda, 2013, HJM hereafter).1 To what extent the di¤erences in life cycle em-
ployment dynamics between high- and lower-income countries are also driven by
di¤erences in the upper tail and lower tails of the respective distribution, more than
median growth?
        We take advantage of data on all non-micro manufacturing establishments in
Colombia for a period of 30 years to conduct a full distribution characterization of
plant employment growth in that country, compared to the U.S. We characterize,
more speci…cally, the cross size-age distribution of plants, and the sources of overall
employment growth in the manufacturing. We de…ne non-micro plants as those with
at least 10 employees
        We document some broad (and perhaps surprising) similarities between the two
countries: highly skewed distributions of employment growth; faster growth in young
establishments compared to old ones; negligible median growth at any age; and ag-
    1
    HJM focus on "up or out" dynamics for …rms. The data for Colombia are at the establishment-
level which are more closely aligned with …rms than in the U.S. as most activity is at single unit
establishment …rms in Colombia. In addition, Haltiwanger (2016) shows that "up or out" dynamics
are also present for U.S. establishments. Also, as will become clear, we …nd strong "up or out"
patterns for U.S. manufacturing establishments.

gregate employment creation entirely attributable to the entry of new establishments
over the course of …ve years. Still, average life-cycle employment growth is weaker
in Colombia.
       Among non-micro establishments–to which data availability limits our attention
                          –
for much of this paper slower growth vis-a-vis peers in the U.S. is driven by a less
dynamic 90th percentile of growth for early ages and by more sluggish job destruction
from the exit of weak recent startups. As a consequence, the size distribution of
non-micro plants exhibits more concentration in small-old plants in Colombia, both
in unweighted and employment-weighted bases. These …ndings point at the quasi-
absence of superstar businesses in less developed countries as a feature likely at the
heart of the development problem.2
       While our evidence on micro establishments (those that start and remain micro
or exit) is much more limited due to data availability constraints, the much more
marked prevalence of micro-establishments in Colombia relative to the US is the other
distinctive feature that we illustrate in the data.          That is, at any point in time a
large fraction of productive resources in Colombia concentrates in a type of businesses
typically at the bottom of the productivity distribution. Despite the burden that this
imposes on aggregate productivity at any point–and subject to the limits imposed
by data constraints–we …nd that our characterization of the dynamics of average life-
cycle growth from non-micro establishments is not much distorted by the inclusion
   2
    Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda, 2013, show that high average employment growth by young
businesses in the US is driven by high-growth young businesses. Decker et al (2016) show that
declined business dynamism and entrepreneurship since 2000 in the US is partly attributable to a
decline in the emergence of high-growth young businesses. Autor et al. (2017) show that the decline
in the labor share in the US is attributable to a shift of employment towards superstar …rms, more
capital intensive than others, rather than a decline in average labor shares.


                                                3
of micro establishments. The reason is two-fold. First, for establishments that start
as micro but transit to non-micro we track them accurately in the non-micro data,
including the correct year of startup as a micro business, from the point in which they
cross the size threshold. Second, while some micro-establishments likely remain as
such and thus do not contribute positively to average life cycle growth, there is also
little room for contraction, and the well known high turnover of micro-establishments
implies a selection e¤ect that, if anything, pushes average growth up.
       The contrast between size and age in terms of employment creation is important in
the context of policy-making. Policies targeted at fostering entrepreneurial business
activity frequently adopt a size criterion to operationalize their targets: they focus
on small businesses.3 One underlying assumption is that small units are young
entrepreneurial initiatives that have yet to develop their full potential, but may fail
to do so due to external obstacles to small businesses. Starting with Birch (1981) a
wide literature seemed to support this approach, by showing that small businesses
tend to grow faster than large ones.4
       But the focus on small businesses is potentially problematic, from both a con-
ceptual and an empirical standpoint. Conceptually, the small size of a business may
rather be a re‡ection of low productivity (as in models of business dynamics like
   3
     The Small Business Administration in the US, and the now extinct Mipymes administration
in Colombia are two examples of government agencies aimed at fostering small business growth in
the countries that we study. Over 90% of Public Development Banks lend to SMEs, while other
segments (e.g. startups, large …rms, households) are covered by at most 60% of these banks (Eslava
and Freixas, 2017). International organizations such as the World Bank and the Interamerican
Development Bank also pay particular attention to the challenges faced by small businesses and
entrepreneurs.

Jovanovic’s, 1982, or Hopenhayn’s, 1992). Empirically, recent …ndings— including
those in this paper— do not square with the view that small businesses are particu-
larly dynamic. Hurst and Pugsley (2012) show evidence that, despite high average
growth rates among small businesses, the median small establishment actually does
not grow, and its owners do not even intend to make it grow. Other studies have
emphasized the importance of distinguishing between business size and business age.
Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2013) have shown that the job creating prowess
of small businesses in the U.S. is accounted for by the contribution of entrants and
young businesses–that are typically small— while size actually correlates negatively
with employment growth once age is accounted for. In fact, small mature businesses
in the U.S. have on average negative net job creation. The high average employment
growth at young businesses compared to older ones has been con…rmed for a large
set of developing economies by Ayyagari et al. (2014), for Cote d’Ivoire by Klapper
and Richmond (2011) and for OECD countries by an OECD (2017) study, though
these studies do not conduct full distribution accounting.
      Our study covers the 30 years between 1982 and 2012 for Colombia and a slightly
shorter period for the US. We limit our attention to employer establishments in the
manufacturing sector, given data constraints for Colombia. These constraints also
imply that, for the most part, we abstract from micro employers, by limiting our
study to units of 10 or more employees.5 In this respect, our study is neither about
the businesses without employees or micro employer businesses. However, we do
incorporate information on the latter establishments whenever possible, and show
  5
      Informal establishments of at least this size, however, are in principle included in the data.

that their prevalence is one of the most salient di¤erences between manufacturing in
the two countries.
        The paper is divided into 5 sections, including this introduction. Section 2 pro-
vides a conceptual framework, by placing this study in the context of the literature
and of related policy discussions. Section 3 discusses data and measurement issues.
Section 4 presents our results, …rst on establishment growth by age (4.1.); second
on the contribution of di¤erent cohorts to aggregate growth (4.2); then on how age
growth patterns di¤er from size growth patterns (4.3) and on the evolution of these
patterns over time (4.4.), and …nally on the size-age distribution of plants (4.5).
Conclusions are presented in Section 5.



2         Conceptual Underpinnings and Existing Evidence

Existing evidence shows substantial dispersion in productivity, size, and growth rates
across …rms within narrowly de…ned industries (see Syverson 2011 for a survey).
These features of the data are captured by heterogeneous …rm dynamic models, and
models of creative destruction, which in turn show that job and productivity growth
at the aggregate level are connected through ongoing reallocation dynamics.6 High
productivity businesses should be either large or becoming large through expansion,
with entry and exit reinforcing these dynamics.
        The di¤erent sources and consequences of business heterogeneity are likely rein-
forced for business entry. Young businesses face inherent uncertainty over a number
    6
    E.g. Hopenhayn, 1992; Ericson and Pakes, 1994; Caballero and Hammour, 1994; Mortensen
and Pissarides, 1994; Aghion and Howitt, 2006; Arkolakis, 2016.



                                              6
of dimensions: at entry, their productivity, demand, costs and managerial ability are
poorly observed by managers and owners. Moreover, uncertainty about demand is
likely enhanced by not having yet built up a customer base (as in Foster, Haltiwanger
and Syverson, 2016, and Drozd and Nasal, 2012). These factors imply that young
businesses are likely to be small and exhibit especially high dispersion in productivity
and growth dynamics. At the same time, selection and learning dynamics of young
businesses enhance the contribution of overall entry and exit to productivity growth
(Jovanovic, 1982, Arkolakis, 2016) and the post-entry dynamics of these businesses
are likely crucial determinants of aggregate growth (HK).
   Recent evidence from HJM con…rms that young businesses are crucial drivers of
aggregate employment growth in the data. In addition, HJM also point at particu-
larly marked heterogeneity among young businesses. They …nd evidence that young
businesses exhibit an “up or out” dynamic –that is, they face a high probability of
exit but conditional on survival they have higher net growth rates than their more
mature counterparts. As a consequence, highly dynamic young businesses are crucial
drivers of aggregate growth.
   The work by HJM further suggests that the job creating prowess of small busi-
nesses in the U.S. that is widely cited by U.S. policymakers is best interpreted as
re‡ecting the dynamics of small startups and young businesses. Small businesses do
exhibit higher net growth rates as a proportion of initial size than larger businesses
(consistent with for example, Neumark et al. 2011; Arkolakis, 2016; and Arkolakis
et al. 2018), but this is partly accounted for by transitory dynamics and associ-
ated regression to the mean e¤ects. To mitigate such e¤ects, HJM concentrate on


                                           7
growth rates as a proportion of average (current and prior period) size. While under
this metric small businesses still exhibit higher growth, this is being driven by the
contribution of young businesses, which tend to be small.7
       The …nding that high growth among small businesses is actually driven by a few
of them (the young) is also consistent with …ndings by Hurst and Pugsley (2012)
showing that the median young or small business in the US does not grow, does not
invest in innovation, and in fact does not even pursue growth; its owners frequently
started it for non-pecuniary reasons. As far as businesses without employees, Schoar
(2010) highlights that most self-employed individuals in developing economies are
“subsistence” entrepreneurs that are inherently small-scale and informal (and as
such unlikely to hire few if any workers). The characterization of small businesses
that emerges is one where units that are both small and young are businesses yet to
grow that exhibit healthy growth on average but also a high probability of failure or
stagnation. The fast growing among them will drive aggregate employment growth
and many will die, while the rest of the small— especially the old ones–are typically
not growing or even contracting.
       This discussion helps provide perspective for how and why distortions that impact
startups and post-entry growth dynamics may impact job and productivity growth.
At the core is the idea that such distortions impact allocative e¢ ciency (see, e.g.,
Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993), Banerjee and Du‡o (2003), Restuccia and Rogerson
   7
     Arkolakis’ (2016) integrated model of …rm growth delivers the prediction that growth rates
decline with size both unconditionally and conditionally when growth is measured as a proportion
of initial size, but not when measured as a proportion of average size. The mechanism behind the
size-growth relationship relies on a marginal cost of adding costumers that increases with initial
size.

(2008), Hsieh and Klenow (2009, 2014) and Bartelsman et. al. (2013)), and also
the incentives to invest in future growth at the …rm level (HK, 2014). For present
purposes, distortions of particular interest and relevance are those that impinge on
the startup and post-entry growth dynamic margins. Hsieh and Klenow (2014)
estimate that distortions to pro…tability in Mexico and India may explain the ‡atter
patterns of growth over the life cycle that the manufacturing industries of these
countries exhibit relative to those of the U.S.
    We contribute to this growing literature by characterizing the contribution of
high- and low-growth young businesses to overall job growth for the manufacturing
industry in a middle-income economy, and contrasting such patterns for those for
the United States. We take advantage of the highly detailed data available for
Colombia to analyze the connection between age, size, and growth at the micro
level, characterizing the full distribution of growth and not only its mean.



3     Data and measurement

For Colombia, we use mostly data on plant employment and employment growth
from the Colombian Annual Manufacturing Survey. The survey covers all manufac-
turing establishments belonging to …rms that own at least one plant with 10 or more
employees, or those with production above a level close to US$100,000. The unit of
observation in the survey is the establishment (denominated plant or establishment
interchangeably). An establishment is a speci…c physical location where production




                                          9
occurs. Establishments have a unique ID that allows us to follow them over time.8
Since a plant’s ID is not modi…ed with changes in ownership, such changes are not
mistakenly labeled as births and deaths. We have contrasted some of our results
against those obtained at the …rm— rather than establishment— level, taking advan-
tage of …rm tax identi…ers for the di¤erent establishments. Results show very little
variation at this level for Colombia, as a result of the fact that the overwhelming
majority (over 90%) of establishments are associated to single-establishment …rm tax
IDs.
       Importantly for this study, plants report their initial year of operation. We use
that information to calculate an establishment’s age in each year of our sample.9
We note that having this direct measure of the initial year of operation overcomes
the problems that would arise if we used the …rst period of in-sample presence to
characterize birth, given the minimum size threshold. From here on when we talk
about an establishment’s age at a given year t we refer to the di¤erence between that
year t and the establishment’s initial year of operation.
       This source of data o¤ers great advantages to study growth over the life cycle of
a manufacturing plant, the most important being the possibility of following each
individual plant over time, and for a long period. This is in contrast to studies
characterizing the life cycle of plants from cross sectional data, where cross sectional
   8
      There have been some changes in the coding of plant IDs over time. The last of those changes
occurred in 1992-1993. As a result, we are unable to follow some plants over the 1991-1993 period,
and may overestimate the impact of exit in that period. However, our results for the pooled data
are generally robust to restricting the analysis to 1993-2012.
    9
      The reported initial year is in general consistent over time for any given plant. In the few cases
in which we do observe jumps in this report, or missing values, we …x the initial year of operation
of the plant at the smallest non-missing value reported by the plant over our sample years.



                                                  10
size di¤erences between establishments at di¤erent ages, or at best short term growth
di¤erences for di¤erent cohorts, must be used to infer true life cycle growth (e.g.
Hsieh and Klenow, 2014; Ayagari et al. 2017). Cross-sectional estimates implies
biases from selection and from the relatively weight that large establishments have
in the most recent cohort of plants, as discussed in detail below.
   However, it is clearly the case that, given the exclusion of micro businesses from
this baseline dataset, we are only looking at a fraction of the economy: micro busi-
nesses (i.e. those with less than 10 employees and production below a given level)
represent more than half the employment in the country across sectors and in man-
ufacturing. We use complementary information to provide a more complete picture
of the manufacturing sector. In particular, we use data from the Colombian Sur-
vey of Microestablishments from 2000 to 2007 to estimate cross-sectional life cycle
growth including establishments of all sizes. The Survey of Microestablishments is a
sample of establishments intended to be representative of these establishments in the
country. Among other dimensions, it records employment by broad establishment
age categories. We also use data from the 2005 Colombian Census to provide a full
characterization of the size distribution.
   A related issue is the fact that the exclusion of micro-establishments in most of
our analysis may lead to an exclusion of informality, which is a prevalent phenom-
enon in Colombia–as in the rest of Latin America–. But it need not be the case
that we exclude informality. On the one hand, informal employment in Colombia
and many countries is present not only in micro establishments but also in …rms of
much larger sizes, including some that pay taxes and contributions for a fraction of


                                             11
their revenue and employees (Ulyssea, forth; Eslava, Haltiwanger, Kugler and Ku-
gler,2013). On the other hand, even “business informality”, where a business as a
whole is classi…ed as either formal or informal based, for instance, on formal registra-
tion, may be partly captured in our data. This is so because the sample frame used
to include plants in the Manufacturing Survey is not a formal business registry, but
a combination of such registries with previous censuses and other sources, from the
phone book to in-person inspections. We assess the presence of unregistered …rms
in our sample by calculating the fraction of …rms in it that are not present in the
merchants registry. Registration in the merchants registry is mandatory–though the
mandate is only partially enforced–, and necessary, for instance, to get into contracts
with government. We focus on the most recent part of our sample, starting on 2004,
to minimize potential biases from low quality recording in years where systems were
less reliable and extended.10 We …nd that 20% of plants in our sample belong to
…rms that are not tied to the merchants registry. These are smaller and less pro-
ductive than those registered. The non-negligible presence of unregistered …rms in
our sample suggests that we do partially capture business informality. We also note
that, although informality is clearly a non-negligible phenomenon in Colombia, it
has not increased markedly over our period of study (Mondragón and Peña, 2010),
and actually started to decrease in the 2010s.
       Our imposed exclusion of micro-establishments that remain micro throughout
their life cycle, by leaving out of the picture survival entrepreneurship, arguably also
brings the advantage— in light of the objective of characterizing sources of growth–of
  10
    We conduct this check only up to 2009, as we do not have access to the common identi…ers for
later years.


                                              12
focusing attention on businesses that have growth potential. The literature surveyed
above has documented that micro establishments are typically neither high growers
nor high contributors to aggregate growth, and exhibit extremely high exit rates. We
also note that establishments born micro, but that eventually cross the 10-employee
threshold, make it into our baseline sample starting at the time when they reach
that milestone. And, we do know their correct age at each point in which we do
observe them. As a result, the contribution of those micro establishments that end
up constituting a source of growth is captured by our calculations as soon as they
cross the 10 employee threshold (or the revenue threshold).
    To produce statistics for the U.S. we rely on publicly available tabulations of em-
ployment by sector, size, and age, from the Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS). The
BDS covers all employer businesses in the US’business registry. When comparing
with statistics for Colombia, we either make an e¤ort to include micro-establishments
for both countries or, when this is not possible, restrict calculations to establishments
with 10 or more employees. Notice that the BDS only covers formal businesses, but
this is much less of a problem for the US than it would be for Colombia given the
low prevalence of informality in the former.



4     Growth over the life cycle

4.1    Micro-level patterns of growth for di¤erent ages

We begin our empirical analysis by characterizing employment by age in the cross
section (as in HK, 2014, Figure 1). Figure 1 shows the ratio of average employment


                                           13
at a given age and average employment at birth, for di¤erent ages, for Colombian and
U.S. plants (“birth” size is average size at the …rst age category). The U.S. …gures
are obtained from the Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS). For Colombia, average
size for a size category is the weighted average between average size for establish-
ments of 10+ employees, from the Annual Manufacturing Survey, and average size
for establishments below that threshold, from the Survey of Microestablishments.
The weight for each category is the corresponding weight in the establishment size
distribution from the 2005 Census.11
       The …rst, perhaps not surprising fact, that emerges is that younger establishments
are smaller on average than older ones. This is consistent with patterns of learning
and selection (as in Jovanovic’s 1982 model). Of greater interest is the …nding that
Colombian plants grow at a slower pace than U.S. plants. We …nd that the ratio of
average employment at age 10+ compared to average employment at birth is about
2.3 for the U.S. and 1.7 for Colombia. This is clearly reminiscent of HK’s …nding that
the growth of plants in Mexico and India is slower than that for their counterparts
in the U.S., though the di¤erence with respect to the U.S. is much less marked for

Colombia than for India, and even a little less intense that for Mexico.
       Cross sectional life cycle growth rates, such as those in Figure 1, are a biased
estimate of actual growth over a single business’life cycle, given selection of better

      87% for 0-9 employees, 13% for 10+, see Table 3. In calculating average employment at estab-
lishments of 10+ employees we exclude from the AMS establishments that enter the survey with
less than 10 employees because they reach the alternative revenue threshold.
   12
      A key …gure from Hsieh-Klenow is that the average 40 year-old plant in the U.S. is eight times
as large as a startup, while the corresponding ratio is two for Mexico and zero for India. The
Hsieh-Klenow statistic is based on the economic census for U.S. manufacturing while our statistics
from the U.S. are from the BDS.

businesses into older ages. In particular, employment at age a is normalized by av-
erage employment at birth, which includes employment by businesses which will not
survive to age a. In the remaining of this paper we focus on plant-level longitudinal
estimates of growth.
       Figure 2 depicts average actual plant life cycle growth for Colombia (grey line),
where a plant’s growth is calculated by dividing its employment at a given age by its
own employment at birth (0-5), and contrasts it with cross sectional growth.13 Figure

       For plants which we do not observe from birth, we calculate life cycle growth to age t as

 Lj0    is average growth from actual birth to age B for the sample of plants we do observe from
birth. If we constrain ourselves to that sample we can only estimate growth up to age 15, but the

2 is based solely on Annual Manufacturing Survey data (and therefore excludes
micro-establishments), since it is in this database that we can follow longitudinally
a plant over its life cycle. Longitudinal growth for U.S. is not available. Figure 2
displays more detailed age categories to take greater advantage of the richness of the
data, since in Figure 2 we are no longer constrained to categories dictated by the
comparison with the U.S. or the Colombian Survey of Microestablishments.
    In comparing Figure 1 and 2, it is striking that the cross-sectional life cycle
patterns are so similar with (Figure 1) or without (Figure 2) the inclusion of micro
businesses. It is important to remember that the reported ratios at a given age are
conditional of survival to that age. We draw the inference that micro businesses
exhibit low survival rates and those that do survive for an extended period are likely
to transit to non-micro businesses (and hence we capture them in both Figure 1 and
2). High turnover by microbusinesses in countries similar to Colombia is documented,
for example, by Levy (2018) for Mexico.
    Longitudinal growth is faster than that estimated from cross-sectional data: the
average plant has doubled its own size by age 16, while in the cross section average
employment at age 16 is only 1.5 times that observed at birth. The di¤erences
between the two approaches re‡ect the larger weight that cross-sectional comparisons
give to plants born larger, which results in the dampened cross-sectional dynamics
relative to the longitudinal analogue, counteracting the selection bias that could work
…nding that this growth is faster than in the cross section holds.

in the opposite direction.14




       To deepen our understanding of growth over the life cycle, we document growth-
age and growth-size relationships in Figure 3. From this point onwards, and unless
explicitly noted, we focus attention for Colombia on data from the AMS, with the
implication that we look exclusively at non-micro establishments. When comparing
to U.S. data we constraint both datasets to be comparable when this is possible.

The higher weight to establishments born larger counteracts the upward bias in cross sectional
estimates of life cycle growth that emerge from dividing average survivor size at age t by average
size at birth including just-born plants that will not survive to age t.

       Growth rates in Figure 3 are calculated using the average employment between t
and t-1 as a denominator (as in HJM), and deviated from the overall mean.15 Follow-
ing Colombian legal standards, slightly adjusted to obtain size categories comparable
with those available for the US, small plants are de…ned as those with 10 to 49 em-
ployees, medium ones have between 50 and 249 employees, and large plants have
250 or more employees. The …gure classi…es plants into size classes based on average
employment at the plant between t and t-1.
       Focusing …rst on patterns pooling over plant sizes, shown in the left-most set
of bars of each panel of Figure 3, average annual net growth rates for surviving
plants fall markedly over the life cycle. This is the case independently of whether
unweighted or weighted …gures are considered. On a weighted basis, employment
in the category of plants aged 0-4 grows at a mean rate 6 percentage point above
the overall mean rate, while plants aged 15 years or older grow below average. A
main inference, recurrent in our exercises, is that net growth is highest among the
youngest establishments.
  15
     Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) explain the advantages of these symmetric growth rates.
An important one is that growth rates calculated as fraction of initial size are mechanically larger
for initially small establishments. The use of this traditional approach partly explains why an
early literature starting with Birch, 1981, consistently found that small businesses exhibited high
growth over a range of countries (see Neumark et al., 2011; Baldwin and Picot, 1995; Broersma
and Gautier, 1997; Barnes and Haskel, 2002; Yasuda, 2005; Fariñas and Moreno, 2000). Arkolakis
(2016) and Arkolakis et al (2018) develop models that imply that small businesses indeed grow
faster in relation to their initial size, but not necessarily in relation to average initial-…nal size. In
Arkolakis (2016) model of …rms reaching an increasingly large costumer base, growth rates decrease
with initial size because the marginal cost of adding a costumer is increasing in initial size, so that
any percentage change in underlying productivity has a greater impact on the costumer base of
initially smaller …rms. His calibrations yield an increase relationship between growth and average
(initial-…nal) size. Arkolakis et al (2018) show that a negative relationship of growth to initial size
may emerge in the context of learning, because smaller …rms are also closer to the exit threshold
and therefore bene…t more from growth when there is uncertainty.

   Figure 4 compares the employment-weighted growth rates and exit rates for dif-
ferent ages against those for comparable U.S. data. The latter are constructed from
the public domain Business Dynamic Statistics (BDS) from the U.S. Census Bureau.
For comparability between the two sources, we use data only for manufacturing
plants with 10 or more employees in both cases, and limit the period of analysis to
1992-2012 (which explains the slight changes for Colombia with respect to Figure
3). The numbers displayed correspond to di¤erences with respect to the respective
mean growth rate, which is also shown, below each picture.
   Younger continuing U.S. plants grow at a larger mean rate than older ones, as
previously documented by HJM, and as Figure 2 had already documented for Colom-
bia. Cross-age di¤erences, however, are more marked for the US. While in Colombia
only plants above 15 years grow below average, in the US below-mean growth is ob-
served for all plants older than ten. Moreover, the range between the youngest and
oldest categories is about 8 percentage points in Colombia but 9 percentage points
in the US.
   The less decreasing pattern of growth over the life cycle in Colombia is not driven
by the typical plant (i.e. the plant at the median). Rather, evidence suggests it
re‡ects a relative de…cit of high-growth entrepreneurship and more generally a less
skewed growth distribution for recent entries (Figure 5, which must be taken with
caution because we are depicting the US distribution, from Decker et al. (2014), only
for …rms, rather than plants, and in all sectors). Though in both countries a young
business in the 90th percentile of the employment growth distribution is much faster-
growing than the median and that one in the 10th percentile, the Colombian 90th


                                         20

percentile business does not exhibit the spectacular growth that young superstars
display in the U.S. The 90th-50th and 90th-10th ranges in the U.S. almost double
those in Colombia for ages one to …ve.16
       Back to Figure 4, exit rates also decline markedly with age in both the Colombian
and the US data, but di¤erences between young and older establishments are, once
again, more marked in the U.S. Most noticeable, despite average exit rates being
similar, in the U.S. only establishments younger than …ve years exhibit job destruc-
tion from exit clearly above the mean, while in Colombia it is only establishments
older than 15 years that are below the mean, and only slightly. The fact that a much
higher proportion of job destruction concentrates among startups in the US than in
Colombia implies more selection in the former. A related fact is the much ‡atter
  16
    Appropriate caution is needed in comparing Colombia and U.S. patterns in Figure 5. Figure
for the U.S. is for continuing …rms in the private sector (drawn from Figure 2 of Decker et. al.
(2014)) while Figure for Colombia is for continuing manufacturing establishments. All of the other
comparisons in the paper are from comparable establishment-level data in the two countries.

pro…le of the 10th percentile of employment growth over age in Colombia than in the
U.S. (Figure 5).
   As mentioned, growth is also particularly heterogeneous among young plants,
by contrast to old ones (Figure 5). The bulk of the aggregate and average growth
di¤erence between young and old plants is concentrated in the highest percentiles.
That is, it is the fastest growers among the young that drive most of the more rapid
aggregate growth in plants’early ages. The 90th percentile decreases rapidly with
age, while the 10th one is not that di¤erent across age categories. This is true for both
countries. The decreasing 90th-10th gap over the life cycle compared to a relatively
‡at 50th percentile highlights that young businesses exhibit both more disperse and
more skewed growth that older ones.
   Taken together these …ndings indicate that, while U.S. young manufacturing
plants display a very marked pattern of what HJM (2013) denominate an “up or
out” dynamic, Colombian young manufacturing plants show the same qualitative
pattern but a more muted di¤erence with respect to older businesses. There seems
to be both a shortage of truly high growth entrepreneurship and less cleansing selec-
tion at early ages in Colombia as compared to the U.S.
   Interestingly, despite the potential greater presence of barriers to the growth of
young businesses in the Colombian economy, in many respects the growth patterns
we have illustrated are similar between the two countries. Similarities include higher
growth among young continuing business than for their older counterparts, but with
high heterogeneity especially in the young age categories, and the fact that the fastest
growing ones among the young plants are main drivers of employment growth in that


                                           23
age category.
       HJM have shown that in the U.S. patterns of growth over the life cycle and across
size categories vary widely if computed at the …rm rather than the establishment
level, as …rms replace underperforming plants by new establishments. We note that
in the Colombian data, by contrast, our results are virtually identical if we focus on
…rms rather than plants. This likely stems from the fact that only about 7 percent of
establishments and 16 percent of employment in the Colombian data are accounted
for by multi-plant …rms. In the U.S. manufacturing sector, meanwhile, multi-units
are about 80 percent of employment.17


4.2       Contribution to aggregates in the medium run

We have documented that younger businesses in our sample grow faster than older
ones. But also that young businesses are also generally smaller and their high average
growth rate hides a fair degree of heterogeneity. Do small size, high exit rates and a
relatively small number of very fast growing plants imply that young businesses do
  17
    Establishments are linked to their parent …rms in Colombia through …rm IDs based on taxpaying
unity. In the U.S., the concept of a …rm uses a broader notion of common operational control
based on the Economic Censuses and the Company Organization Survey. These surveys inquire
about company ownership and control based on voting stock as well as having the direction of
management and policies. Unfortunately, such information is not available for the Colombian case,
so our de…nitions of …rm are not fully comparable. When working at the …rm level, we compute
…rm size by adding up the employment of all establishments belonging to the same …rm. For
…rm age, we follow the procedure used by HJM, whereby a …rm is assigned the age of its oldest
establishment when we …rst observe it, and then allowed to age independent of ownership and other
organizational changes. We also follow HJM in constructing …rm growth, so that …rm growth only
represents organic growth: we avoid the overstated job creation and destruction …gures that could
appear at the …rm level when acquisitions are counted as job creation by the acquiring …rm and
job destruction by the selling …rm. For this purpose, the growth of any acquired establishment
is assigned to the acquiring …rm. Our inability to identify parent …rms that do not share tax
codes with their a¢ liated establishments may also account for our inability to establish di¤erential
patterns of growth between …rms and plants.

little in terms of generating aggregate employment over longer periods of time?18
       We tackle this question in Table 1 for Colombia and Table 2 for the U.S.. For spe-
ci…c years of our sample (1982, 1985, and so on), these tables decompose aggregate
employment in the AMS into the contribution of establishments of di¤erent birth
cohorts. A cohort is de…ned by the year reported by the plant as its initial year of
operation. Thus, for instance, the 5th row of Table 1 shows that around half of the
employment covered by the Survey in 1994 corresponded to workers in plants born
before 1970. Since the AMS is a survey of all non-micro manufacturing establish-
ments, aggregate AMS numbers correspond to aggregate manufacturing employment
excluding micro establishments and self-employment. We build the analogous …gures
for the U.S. from the BDS.

    Notice that our employment-weighted statistics in Figures 2 and 4 do not get at contribution
of categories to aggregate employment growth, as weighting is done within age categories.

      We note that monitoring e¤orts in the Colombian AMS were somewhat weaker
before 1993, so that we have less con…dence in aggregate …gures for that earlier
period. We call the attention to these weaker numbers for pre-1993 by using italics
in Table 1 for that period.
      It is in general the case, for any of the years reported in these tables, that most
of the employment is concentrated in plants born before the eighties. For Colombia,
less than 5% of employment in any given year is represented by plants born in the
previous three years. This large weight of older establishments in total employment
re‡ects the fact that older establishments are on average larger, reinforced by the
fact that some plants only outgrow the micro category, and thus enter the survey,
a few years after they are born.19 Startups are similarly unimportant for overall
employment (at non-micros) at any point in time in the U.S.
      Interestingly, despite young plants representing only a small share of total em-
ployment at any point, they contribute the bulk of net employment creation over
the 31 year horizon covered by Table 1. Something similar can be stated about the
period covered in Table 2 for the U.S. The fraction of jobs represented by the pre-
1980 cohorts, for instance, falls by about 25 percentage points in a …fteen-year span
in both countries: from 90% in 1994 to 56% in 2009 in Colombia, and from 69%
in 1990 to 46% in 2005 in the U.S. Everything else equal, non-micro manufacturing
employment would have collapsed in both countries in the absence of entry.
      In fact, a distinguishing feature of U.S. manufacturing is the collapse in manu-

facturing employment in the post-2000 period (Schott and Pierce, 2016). Over the
1990-2005 period, U.S. manufacturing lost over 4 million jobs. The pre-1985 cohorts
lost even more – more than 7 million jobs. This loss of 7 million jobs is accom-
panied by the exit of about half of the establishments from the pre-1985 cohorts.
Interestingly, during this period of massive contraction in aggregate manufacturing
employment there was considerable entry of establishments, and the creation of about
3 million jobs by these establishments born after 1985 is more than driven by the
post-1990 cohorts, as the 1985-1990 cohort also lost a considerable amount of jobs.
     Though aggregate manufacturing employment growth in Colombia over recent
decades has not been as critical as in the U.S., it has been slow, and “de-industrialization”
is a commonly voiced concern in the country. The contribution of entry is as im-
portant as in the U.S. Total employment in the AMS grew by just over 40,000 jobs
between 1994 and 2012. This overall— quite modest— growth hides very diverging
patterns by older and younger plants. Total employment by establishments born be-
fore 1982 shrank dramatically, by more than 170,000 jobs. Meanwhile, employment
by plants born in the more recent years grew, and it did it su¢ ciently to overcome the
contraction of employment at older establishments. The key message is that young


                                                                    27
establishments, despite being born small and representing a small share of non-micro
businesses employment, are the key to employment growth over the medium run.


4.3    Age vs. size

Is age simply proxying for size in our above …ndings? Figures 3 and 4 indicate that
the answer is no. Figure 3 shows that the …nding that net growth for continuers
declines with age is robust to holding size constant, so that the cross-age patterns
emphasized in the past sections are not simply re‡ecting cross-size patterns. In fact,
once we control for establishment age, net growth rates are higher for medium and
large establishments than for small establishments. This …nding, documented by
HJM for the U.S., is con…rmed in our Colombian data. Arkolakis et al (2018) show
that the …nding that growth decreases with age holding size constant may emerge
in the context of a model with …rm heterogeneity and selection, in the presence of
learning about demand.
   Overall, age is a more important determinant of a continuer’s growth than size
is and, controlling for age, large establishments grow faster than small ones. The
latter statement, however, does not mean that small establishments are in general
laggards. Average small startups do grow at a very healthy pace, as illustrated in
Figures 3 and 4. For a longer-run perspective, consider the lines of Figure 6 that show
employment relative to birth level for plants born in di¤erent size categories. The
dashed line corresponds to establishments born small, the dashed-dotted line to those
born medium, and the dotted line to large-at-birth ones. On average, establishments
born small grow more rapidly than those born medium or large, and those born large


                                          28
grow less rapidly than those in the other two categories, and they also exhibit greater
heterogeneity, implying a much larger 90th-50th range than that observed for plants
born larger. An implication is substantial long run convergence in size across plants
born into di¤erent size categories.




   Enormous heterogeneity hides behind these patterns of very dynamic growth
by small startups. The upper right panel of Figure 6 shows the median of the
distribution of growth by size at birth. Median life cycle growth is much ‡atter than
the mean of the same distribution, for all categories of size at birth. Most of the
di¤erences between the life cycle patterns of plants born small compared to those
born larger come from plants that were born small but transited rapidly into the
medium and large size classes (bottom panels). However, only 8% of establishments

                                          29
born small make this transition. Moreover, 35% of them exit the market by age four.
Again, a sign of the weak presence of high-growth entrepreneurship.
   On the other hand, selection at young plants is much more related to size in the
U.S. compared to Colombia. Larger plants are less likely to exit in both countries
compared to smaller and medium sized plants but the interaction of size and age
related selection is much more pronounced in the U.S. Figure 7 depicts the di¤erence
in the young-old di¤erential in exit rates between medium and large plants (this is
a double di¤erence) and small vs. large plants. For medium-large, this double
di¤erential is almost 5 percentage points in the U.S.,. but about zero in Colombia.
The small-large di¤erential is also larger in the U.S: 3 percent vs. 1.4 percent. Since
size is a crude proxy for productivity, the closer size-exit relationship in the US, and
its relationship to age, is a signal of more intensive selection of young less productive
plants in the U.S. relative to Colombia. Less selection of young-small plants in
Colombia suggests a higher probability that low productivity plants stay in business
for a long time, a sign of sclerosis that we see reinforced in the size distribution of
plants (see section 4.5). We do note an anomaly in the pattern of double-di¤erenced
exit rates highlighted above: the small-medium double di¤erence is not larger for the
US, given the very high exit rate for just-born plants in medium compared to small
plants in the U.S.


4.4    Evolution over time

There is some sensitivity of patterns of growth over the life cycle to the periods
considered. Figure 8 shows that life cycle employment growth for plants in the AMS


                                           30
has been faster in the 2000s compared to the 1980s (the doted lines surrounding the
dashed one correspond to the con…dence interval for the di¤erence in growth between
the 1980s and the 2000s).20 Though of course many changes occur in twenty years,
the 1990s are an outstanding transition period characterized by large-scale structural
reforms. Figure 8 thus points in the direction, suggested by Hiseh and Klenow (2014)
that better market institutions provide stimulus for high business growth.
       Figure 9 further explores changes over time in growth patters by depicting annual
growth for continuers and job destruction from exit for the two sub-periods. The
higher life-cycle growth post 2000 in Figure 8 is re‡ected mainly in higher average
  20
    Figure 8 is obtained by running a regression of life cycle growth for a plant against dummies
for age intervals, alone and interacted with a post-2000s dummies. The 1990s transition period is
excluded.



                                               31
annual continuer growth rates, which go from -0.2% in the 1980s to 1.5% in the
2000s, on a weighted basis. Up-or-out dynamics (i.e. both higher growth and higher
exit for young relative to old establishments) are observed in both periods for all
categories of size, except for large businesses. In this category, up-or-out dynamics
are present, and indeed very marked, in the 2000s but not in the 1980s. These set
of patterns are consistent with more high growth- high risk entrepreneurship in the
2000s than the 1980s.


4.5    Size-age distribution

Before closing, we zoom-out to go from these patterns of individual growth for non-
micro plants to the overall size-age distribution that they end up determining. Table
3 presents the size-age distribution of plants in Colombia and the U.S. Since the
Colombian Manufacturing Survey does not cover micro-establishments, whose high

                                         32
33
weight in both the population of establishments and employment in Latin American
relative to developed countries is well known and therefore crucial for our understand-
ing of the size-age distribution (e.g. Pagés, ed, 2010; Eslava, 2018), we complement
the information in the AMS with data on micro-establishments from the establish-
ments module of the 2005 Colombian Census.
       According to the 2005 Colombian Census, 87% of establishments are micro-
establishments and 32% of employment is employed in microestablishments.21 We
use these numbers to impute a share of establishments and employment represented
by age-size categories for small, medium and large establishments. We impose that
the relative weight of small vs. large or small vs. medium …rms is as in the AMS and
the absolute weights for these categories add to 13% of establishments and 68% of
employment. We do not have information on the age distribution of the population
of establishments below 10 employees, thus the empty cells in Table 4 for Colombia.
All of the numbers for the U.S. are from the Business Dynamics Statistics.
       The most outstanding feature of the size distribution is the extreme concentration
of resources in smaller establishments, especially micro ones, in Colombia. While the
U.S. has 4% of employment in the micro and small establishments, the …gure in
Colombia is eight times as large: 32%. While micro establishments are also much
more prevalent in Colombia than in the U.S. in terms of the distribution of numbers
of plants (87% rather than 50%), the di¤erence is not as marked as it is in terms of
employment. This implies a larger average size of micro-establishments in Colombia
  21
    These weights are similar across Latin America. Eslava (2018), for instance, reports that,
according to household surveys, 36% of salaried manufacturing employment in Latin America con-
centrates in …rms of 1-9 employees.



                                             34

than in the U.S.
    In terms of the cross size-age distribution (which we can characterize only for
non-micro plants), there is also a greater prevalence for small businesses among the
categories of older plants in Colombia. Conditional on being small (size between 10-
50), 64% of employment in Colombia is more than 16+ while the analogous fraction is
only 50% in the U.S. In both countries, the size and age distribution of establishments
are clearly tied to each other: small establishments are more likely young than larger
ones.



5       Conclusions

This paper characterizes Colombian manufacturing (non-micro) establishments over
their life cycle, as compared to the U.S. On average, younger businesses outperform
older businesses on a number of dimensions, even after controlling for size di¤erences.
These di¤erences are marked by greater heterogeneity among the young, with high
average startup growth driven by superstars. Moreover, despite the relatively modest
contribution of the young to overall employment at any given point in time, it is
the youngest cohorts of plants that explain the bulk of employment growth over
the medium term. Overall employment by establishments from pre-1980 cohorts
collapsed over our period of study.
    That there is very dynamic growth among some young establishments has been
previously documented using data for the US (HJM). Interestingly, young establish-
ments and …rms in Colombia exhibit similar patterns to those in the U.S. with a



                                          36
few notable di¤erences. First, among non-micro establishments the upper tail of
high growth establishments is less dynamic in Colombia than the U.S. and exhibits
less distance with respect to laggard establishments, which despite their poor per-
formance are more likely to survive to old ages than similarly slow growers in the
U.S. As a result of the less marked up-or-out dynamics in Colombia, especially in
terms of growth at the upper end of the distribution, the size-age distribution dis-
plays a larger concentration on old-small establishments and average employment
growth over a plant’s life cycle is slower in Colombia. This is complemented by
a much greater concentration of establishments and employment in the segment of
micro-establishments, perhaps the most salient di¤erential characteristic of Colom-
bian manufacturing vs. the U.S.’ This set of …ndings suggests that less dynamic
high-growth entrepreneurship is a likely a source of the development di¤erentials
between Colombia and the U.S.
