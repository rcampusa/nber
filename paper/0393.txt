                 Teenage Unemploytnent What is the Problem?

                                   ABSTRACT

    This nontechnical paper was prepared as a background study for the NBER

Conference on Youth Joblessness and Employment. Our analysis of data collected

in the March 1976 and October 1976 Current Population Surveys leads us to the

following conclusions:

    Unemployment is not a serious problem for the vast majority of teenage

boys. Less than 5 percent of teenage boys are out of school, unemployed and

looking for full—time work. Many   out   of school teenagers are neither working

nor looking for work and most of these report no desire to work. Virtually

all teenagers who are out of work live at hone. Among those who do seek work,

unemployment spells tend to be quite short; over half end within one month when

these boys find work or stop looking for work. Nevertheless, much of the total

amount of unemployment is the result of quite long spells amonR a small portion

of those who experience unemployment during the year.

     Although nonwhites have considerably higher unemployment rates than whites,

the overwhelming majority of the teenage unemployed are white. Approximately

half of the difference between the unemployment rates of whites and blacks can

be accounted for by demographic and economic differences.

     There is a small group of teenagers with relatively little schooling for

whom unemployment does seen to be a serious and persistent problem. This group

suffers most of the teenage unemployment. Although their unemployment rate

improves markedly as they move into their twenties, it remains very high

relative to the unemp1oynent rate of better educated and more able young men.

    An individual is officially classified as unemployed if he is not working

and is seeking a full—time or part—time job.1 In recent years, 50 percent of

the unemployed were less than 25 years old. Teenagers alone accounted for

half of this youth unemployment or 25 percent of total unemployment. In 19T8,

an average of 1.56 million teenagers were classified as unemployed, implying an

average unemployment rate of 16.3 percent of the teenage labor force.2

     It is clear therefore that teenagers account for a large share of the

high unemployment rate in the United States. But how much of this teenage

unemployment represents a serious economic or social problem? How niany of

these unemployed are students or others seeking part—time work? How much of

all teenage unemployment represents very short spells of unemployment by those

who move from job to job and how much represents really long—term unemployment

of those who cannot find any job or any job that they regard as acceptable?

This study was prepared as a background paper for the NBER Project on Youth
Joblessness and Employment. We are grateful for comments on our earlier
draft, especially the suggestions of Jacob Mincer, Linda Leighton and Lawrence
Summers. The views expressed are those of the authors and should not be
attributed to any organization.

1lndividuals who are on layoff from a job to which they expect to be recalled
are also classified as unemployed even if they are not actively seeking work.

2The unemployment rate for a demographic group is calculated, as the percentage
of the corresponding labor force who are currently classified as unemployed.
The labor force is defined as everyone in that demographic group who is either
employed or unemployed. An individual may be both attending school and in the
labor force if he or she is working part—time or full—time or is looking for
such work.

Among those who are not officially classified as unemployed but are neither

working   nor in school, how many should really be regarded as "unemployed but too
discouraged to look" and how many should be classified as just "not currently
interested in working"? And       even   among those who are officially classified   as


unemployed,   how many are   unemployed by the official definition but not really

interested    in work at the   current time?

     To   shed light on these questions, we have analyzed the     detailed infor-

mation on youth employment and unemployment that is collected in the

Department of Labor's monthly Current Population Survey. We have not relied

on the published summaries of this survey but have examined and tabulated the

basic records on more than 5,000 individual teenage boys about whom information

was obtained in the Current Population Surveys of March 1916 and a similar

size sample in October 1976. Analyzing the raw data has the very important

advantage of permitting us to examine a variety of special subgroups that can-

not be studied with the published summaries.

     In. particular, we decided quite early in our study to limit our attention

to male teenagers who are not enrolled in school.1 We believe that the problems

and experience of the in—school and out—of—school groups of unemployed teenagers

are very different and must be studied separately.2 Since, as we show below,

half of the male unemployed teenagers are still in school, looking at both


i-In the earlier version of this paper, we focussed on the male teenagers who do
not report attending school as their "major activity." An individual may be
enrolled but also working. For most purposes, the two methods of classification
give similar results but we were convinced by subsequent comment and analysis
that classifying by enrollment is more appropriate, especially for i6 and 17
year olds.

2We are of course aware that remaining in school represents an economic decision
and should in principle be regarded as endogenous to the problem we are
studying. It would be interesting to extend the current analysis to examine the
relation between work availability and the decision to remain in school.
                                         —3—

groups together can obscure much that is important. Moreover, the social and

economic problems of unemployment may be of greater significance for the out—of—

school group than for those who are still in school. Limiting our analysis to

boys also reflects a view that the problems and experiences of the boys are

likely to differ substantially from those of girls of the same age so that the

two should be studied separately.

       Even with the study limited to out—of—school young men, we have a sample

of 1,I5l individuals in October 1976. This is large enough to make statisti-

cally reliable estimates of unemployment and employment rates for most major

groups •    In   some cases, however, e.g., when nonwhites are classified by family

income, the sample becomes too small to permit estimates to be made with great

confidence. In these cases, as in others where a larger sample is desirable, it

would be useful in the future to pool data from several monthly surveys.

       Since our analysis refers primarily to the unemployment experienced in

October 1976 and, in some cases, during the preceding year, it is useful to

describe briefly the state of the labor market during that period. In October

1976, the overall unemployment rate for the population as a whole was a rela-

tively high 7.2 percent. Unemployment had been falling from a peak rate of

9.1 percent in June 1975. The mean durations of unemployment were therefore

very   long; the l1.2 week mean duration of unemployment for all the unemployed in
the   October   1976 survey was roughly 25 percent longer than the average duration

of 11.5 weeks that prevailed in the years from 1960 through 1975. Our study

should therefore be seen as an analysis of the experience of out—of—school

young men during a time in which the labor market was depressed but imprdving.

11n estimating unemployment and employment rates, a sample of 100 yields a stan-
dard error of no more than 0.005. Appendix Table A—i presents selected sample
sizes. Table A—2 presents the standard errors for probabilities based on
selected sample sizes.

This   should be remembered in interpreting any of our findings, a warning that

will not be repeated. It would clearly be interesting to repeat our analysis

for a year like 19714 when the unemployment rate for all persons was only 5.6

percent as well as for 1979 when those data became available.1

       Our finding may be sumxnarized very briefly:

       Unemployment   is not a serious problem for the vast majority of teenage
boys. Less than 5     percent   of teenage boys are unemployed, out of school, and
looking   for full—time work. Many out of school      teenagers are neither working

nor looking for work and most of these report no desire to work. Virtually

all teenagers who are out of work live at home. Among those who do seek work,

unemployment spells tend to be quite short; over half end within one month

when these boys find work or stop looking for work. Nonetheless, much of the

total amount of unemployment is the result of quite long spells among a small

portion of those who experience unemployment during the year.

       Although nonwhites have considerably higher unemployment rates than whites,

the overwhelming majority of the teenage unemployed are white. Approximately

half of the difference between the unemployment rates of whites and blacks can

be accounted for by other demographic and economic differences.,

       There is a small group of relatively poorly educated teenagers for whom

unemployment does seem to be a serious and persistent problem. This group suf-

fers much of the teenage unemployment. Although their unemployment rate impro-

ves markedly as they move into their twenties, it remains very high relative to

the unemployment rate of better educated and more able young men.


-1-We have repeated the analysis for the two other recent years for which data are
available, 1975 and 1977. The results are quite similar to those for 1976
reported in the text of this paper. Tables for these years are available from
the authors.

     1.   More than 90 percent of all male teenagers are either in school,

working or both. Most unemployed teenagers are either in school or seeking

only part—time work. Only 5 percent of teenage boys are unemployed, out of

school and looking for full—time work.

    Although the unemployment rate among teenage boys was 18.3 percent in

October 1976, this figure is easily misinterpreted for two reasons. First since

most teenagers are in school and neither working nor looking for work, the labor

force size on which this unemployment rate is calculated is only a fraction of

the teenage population. The unemployed therefore represent a much smaller per-

centage of the teenage population than they do of the teenage labor force.

Second, more than half of the unemployed teenagers are actually enrolled in

school and generally interested only in some form of part—time work.

     It is reasonable to classify prime age men into the "employed" and "not

employed" and to regard the situation of the first group as satisfactory from

a social and economic standpoint and that of the second group as unsatisfac-

tory. This is clearly inappropriate for teenagers. The "satisfactory" group

for teenagers includes those in school as well as those at work and therefore

more than 90 percent of this age group, almost the same as the "satisfactory

status" rate for prime age males. Less than 5 percent of teenage boys are

unemployed, out of school and looking for full—time work. The problem of

unemployment affects only a very small fraction of teenagers.

     The detailed statistics on which these statements are based are presented

in Table 1. Nearly 70 percent of male teenagers were enrolled in school in

October 1976. Among the teenage boys who are officially classifed as

unemployed, more than half (52.7 percent) are enrolled in school. There are

only 79,000 boys who are out of school and seeking full time work.- Of

course, the fact that half the teenage unemployed are in school does not mean

that the unemployment rate among out—of—school teenage boys is half of the

unemployment rate for all teenage boys. The two rates are in fact quite

similar: 18.3 percent overall and 18.9 percent among out—of—school boys.

     It is also clear that the experience of 16 and 17 year olds is very dif-

ferent from that of 18 and 19 year olds. While 90 percent of the younger

boys are in school,only 148 percent of the older boys are. Among the 16 and

17 year olds who are classified as unemployed, nearly 80 percent are in school

and less than 25 percent are seeking full—time work. In contrast, among the

18 and 19 year olds who are classified as unemployed, only 29 percent are in

school and more than 75 percent are seeking full—time work. Only 1.8 percent

of the 16 and 17 years olds are out of school, unemployed and seeking full

time work. We are reminded that the official unemployment rate once included

the experience of 114 and 15 year olds but that the age limit was raised to

reflect the growing school enrollment of this group. It may   again   be time to

raise the age threshold for official labor force participation. Excluding 16

and 17 year olds, with their official unemployment rate of more than 20 per-

cent, would reduce the overall unemployment rate for men of all ages from 7.2

percent to 6.9 percent.

     These comments should not be taken as minimizing the importance of

unemployment for some young people. The figures do show however that only a

very- small fraction of teenagers are unemployed and that only 146 percent of

.Reca1l that we classify as "in school" anyone who is enrolled, whether or not
 school is his major activity. If we use the "major activity" basis of classifi-
 cation instead, the number of out—of—school boys who are seeking full—time work
 is essentially unchanged at 3914,000. The total unemployed and out—of—school
 group (seeking part—time or full—time work) is 399,000 based on "enrollment" and
 1416,000 based on "major activity."

                                                                   employment.
 Less than 5 percent of teenage boys are out of school, without work, and

 seeking full—time employment.

      2. Most spells of teenage unemployment are quite short and most teenage

 jobseekers have relatively little trouble in finding work. The bulk of

 unemployment is experienced by a relatively small group of teenagers with long

 spells of unemployment.

      Short spells are characteristic of most out—of—school male teenagers

who become unemployed. In October 1976, 145.5 percent of the unemployed in

this group had been unemployed for four weeks or less. The survey also found

that 16.2 percent of the unemployed in this group had been unemployed for be-

tween 5 and 8 weeks. Only 10.7 percent of all the unemployed in the survey had

been unemployed for as long as 26 weeks. Because those who find work relati-

vely quickly are less likely to be counted in the distribution of unemployed,

these figures actually overstate the fraction of longer spells. In fact, con-

siderably more than one—half of all the teenage boys who become unemployed

are no longer so within just one month.1

     The experience of young people during the summer also implies that

finding employment is not difficult for most young people. Although detailed

data is not available by sex and the level of school attainment, the published

figures permit us to trace the overall experience of teenagers of both sexes

on a month by month basis.2 In March 1976, 3.8 million 16 to 19 year olds

were in the full—time labor force. This rose to 7.0 million in June, 8.3

1Clark and Summers report that 70 percent of spells end in one month; some of
these spells end with the teenagers leaving the labor force. See Kim Clark and
Lawrence Summers, "The Dynamics of Youth Unemployment," NBER Working Paper, No.
2114, 1979.

2These figures come from the 1977 Handbook of Labor Statistics (u.s.
Department    of' Labor 1978).
                                     —9—

million in July and 7.5 million in August before dropping back to approxima-

tely )4 million for the rest of the year. Of the 14.5 million extra entrants to

the full—time labor force between March and July, 1.O million or 89 percent

were working in July. Although the number of unemployed rose between the

spring and summer, the unemployment rate actually fell sharply from 22.6 per-

cent in March to 16.3 percent in July and 15.3 percent in August. It is clear

that this comparatively able group of teenage boys and girls had relatively

little difficulty finding work.

     The labor market's ability to increase teenage employment by more than 100

percent between May and July is certainly remarkable. Employers clearly anti-

cipate a seasonal increase in the supply of teenagers and organize production

to take advantage of their availability. We are struck by the contrast be-

tween this experience and the claim that much of the current high teenage

unemployment rate is due to the demographic shift that increased teenagers

from 7 percent of the labor force in 1958 to 10 percent today. If production

can adjust so rapidly to the seasonal shift in the demographic composition of

the labor force, it would be surprising if it could not adjust to the much

slower change in demography over the past two decades. This leads us to

believe that too much weight has generally been given to the demographic

explanation of the rising teenage unemployment rate.

     While most teenagers have little problem with unemployment, teenage

unemployment is concentrated in a group that experiences long periods of

unemployment. Table 2 presents information on the distribution of

unemployment in 1975 based on the responses of the out—of—school group in the

March 1976 Current Population Survey.1 Table 2 reveals that in 1975 rearly

unemployment in the previous year is not collected in October.

two—thirds of these teenagers experienced no unemployment at all. Another 13

percent were unemployed for a total of less than two nnths. Only one

teenager in twelve was out of work for a total of nre than 26 weeks during

the year, but this high unemployment group accounted for 52 percent of all the

weeks of unemployment among these teenagers. Thus about half of all

unemployment among male out—of—school teenagers in a year is concentrated in a

group of roughly 250,000 boys.

        3. Many of the teenagers who are out—of—school and out—of—work are not

officially classified as "unemployed." Most of this "out of the labor force"

group show relatively little interest in finding work. For many of them, there

is relatively little pressure or incentive to find work.

        More than 145 percent of the out—of—school but not employed teenage boys

are officially classified as out—of—the—labor—force rather than unemployed.1

This means they reported having no work—seeking activity during the previous

four weeks, including such things as asking friends or looking in the

newspaper. The evidence that we present later in this section indicates that

only a relatively small proportion of these young men would really like to

work.

        Kim Clark and Larry Summers2 have shown that a substantial fraction of

all measured spells of unemployment end with the individual leaving the labor

force. They argue that the distinction between youngsters who are out of work

and seeking a job and those who are out of work but not seeking employment is

1An individual is classified as out of the labor force if he is neither employed
nor seeking work. The figures in Table 1 indicate that there were 333,000
teenage boys who were not in the labor force in October 19T6. By comparison
there were 399,000 unemployed boys. The out—of—the—labor—force group thus
accounted for nxre than 145 percent of those who were out of school but not
working.

questionable and suggest further that most persons without work might be

regarded as unemployed. According to this interpretation current unemployment

figures understate the magnitude of the problem. While we agree that the dis-

tinction between the unemployed and those out of the labor force may be poorly

captured in the data, our evidence suggests that the vast majority of those

out of the labor force cannot reasonably be classified as "unemployed" with

its implication of active interest in finding work. Indeed it Is quite

possible that current unemployment figures overstate the problem since many

unemployed move frequently to the out of the labor force status where few

report a desire for work.

     Our interpretation of this evidence reflects our conclusion that the young

men who are out of the labor force are not "discouraged workers" who have

stopped looking because they believe no work is available. We have reached this

conclusion after analyzing the data about the out of the labor force group that

was collected in the March 1976 survey. These data are of two types: (i)

questions about the individual's interest In working and beliefs about job

availability1   ,   and (2) evidence on the financial incentives and pressures to

seek work.

     When the out—of—school teenagers who had not done anything to look for

work during the past four weeks were asked, "Do you want a job now?", only 37

percent answered yes.2 Forty—six percent said no and 17 percent said they did


1These questions are asked only of a random subsample of the out—of—the—labor—
force group. Some of this information is available for March and not for
October.

2The question in the CPS may be answered by one adult in the household for all
persons in the household. The questions about a teenager are typically answered
by his mother although the group that is out—of—school and out—of—work may be
more likely than usual to be present at the interview.
                                      —13—

not   know.1

       Among the out—of—the—labor—force group, only 3.5 percent said they wanted

a job but believed there was no work, and 2.8 percent said that the prospec-

tive employers thought they were too young. Thus no more than 21 percent of

those in the out of the labor force group desire employment but believe that

search would not result in finding a job. In 63 percent of the cases, the

individual just did not want a job. An additional 7.1 percent said they did

not look because they were attending school even though school was not given

as their major activity.

       We believe that much of the high unemployment and nonemployment rates among the

out—of—school young men reflect the lack of pressure or incentive to find work.

Although unemployment insurance is relatively unimportant for this age

group,2 the family acts as an alternative source of income when young people

are not working.3 More than 87 percent of the unemployed in this group live

with parents (80.5 percent) or other relatives (7.0 percent). Only 7.5 per-

cent   live alone or with a family of' their own. Among the group that is not in
the labor force, 97 percent live with parents (89.6 percent) or other relati—

1Although the sample of individuals who were asked this question was so small
that these percentages cannot be regarded as precise estimates of the true per-
centages for all teenagers who were out of the labor force, there are enough
observations to assert that there is less than one chance in 10 of observing an
estimated "yes" response rate as low as 37 percent if the "true" fraction of
potential "yes" responses is even 50 percent or higher. (Evidence for October
1976 further supports this conclusion since an even lower fraction of the out—
of—the—labor—force group expressed interest in working.)

2Data on the receipt of unemployment benefits were collected in a special May
1976 survey. Only 10 percent of unemployed male teenagers not in school
receiv-ed unemployment benefits.
31t would be very interesting to have more data on the way in which a young
person's unemployment affects his family's cash and in—kind gifts to him and his
expected contribution to the overall family budget.

 yes   (7.14 percent).   While the unemployed teenagers come disproportionately

 from lower income families, nearly two—thirds of the unemployed were in fami-

 lies with incomes above $10,000 in 1976 and 22 percent were in families with

 incomes over $20,000.

        14. The problem of unemployment and nonemployment is concentrated in a

 group with little education. The unemployment and nonemployment rates in this

 group   drop sharply as they move into their early twenties.   Nevertheless, the rates

 remain very high among those who do not complete high school.

       Since unemployment is concentrated in a group of teenagers with relatively

 little schooling, it is worth emphasizing that nearly 70 percent of 16 to 19

year old males are still in school. The Out—Of—school group whose unemployment

 we are studying therefore left school before two—thirds of those in their age

cohort. Moreover, for our out—of school group, unemployment rates are much

higher among those who did not complete high school (12 years of education).

Table 3 shows that these school dropouts accounted for 57.5 percent of the

unemployed and 58.0 percent of the nonemployed. They had an unemployment rate

of 28.2 percent and a nonemployment rate of 42.1 percent. The rates for

nonwhite dropouts were even higher.

       Table 14 compares the unemployment rates of teenagers with the unemployment

rates of 20 to 214 year olds at each level of education.   Among those with less
than 12 years of education, the unemployment rate drops from 0.282 to 0.175, a

drop of 38 percent. The decreases for the two groups with more years of

schooling is relatively smaller (a 20 percent decline for both groups), but

the final unemployment rates are substantially lover.    Among 20 to 214 year

olds, those who did not complete high school have nearly twice the

unemployment rate of those who did. Note that the unemployment rate for all

20 to 21   year   olds (0.110) is actually 12 percent lower than the teenage rate,

reflecting   the change in the mix of the labor force to those with more educa-

tion and lower unemployment rates as well as the decline in rates within each

demographic group.

     A similar pattern is seen for each race group. Among those with less

than 12 years of education, the white unemployment rate drops by 3 percent

and the nonwhite unemployment rate drops by 33 percent. For the groups with

more education, the gains are relatively greater for nonwhites but the sample

is too small to regard these differences as statistically significant.

     Table 5 presents comparable figures for nonemployment. It will again be

seen that the rates for the lowest education group improve substantially with

time but still remain quite high. Once again, the total rate declines by more

than the decline at each education level because the out—of—school population

changes to include a higher fraction of young men with more education.

     Although these two tables show that there is a substantial improvement in the

condition of the low education teenagers as they age, the figures should also

serve as a warning that the problem of high unemployment and nonemployment

among the low education group does not fully correct itself as these problem

teenagers get older.

5. Nonwhites have considerably higher rates of unemployment and nonemployment

than whites do. However, since nonwhites are a relatively small fraction of

the teenage population, they account for only a small portion of unemployment

and non employment. Lowering the unemployment rate of the nonwhite group to

the rate of the white group would eliminate less than 60,000 unemployed

teenagers in the whole country and would only lower the unemployment rate for

all out—of—school male teenagers from 19 percent to 16 percent.

     Nonwhite teenagers suffer very high rates of unemployment and non—

employment. Forty percent were unemployed in October 1976; nearly 60 percent

were without work. While these figures clearly show a serious employment

problem for nonwhite teenagers, it should be remembered that since the bulk of

teenagers are white, the bulk of the out—of—school teenage unemployed are also

white.

     Table 6 summarizes the racial composition of unemployment and nonemployment

among out—of—school male teenagers. Since nonwhites constitute only 12.7 per-

cent of the 2.15 million boys in this group, they account for only a small frac-

tion of the overall unemployment and nonemployment despite their relatively high

unemployment and nonemployment rates. In October 1976, whites represented 77

percent of the unemployed, 76 percent of the not employed and 114 percent of

those not in the labor force. Even among those out of work for 23 weeks or

more, whites accounted for 77 percent.

     By using the March 1976 survey, it is possible to obtain additional infor-

mation on the relative magnitudes of white and nonwhite unemployment. (This

requires using the "major activity" criteria of classifying an individual's

"school" status; this decreases the in school population and raises the share

of whites in the unemployed from 77   percent   to 81percent.) The March survey
figures   indicate that whites accounted for 79 percent of those who experienced
at least 26 weeks of unemployment in 1975    and   80 percent   of the weeks of
unemployment in that year. The March survey also provides evidence on

unemployment in the central cities of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas.

Because nonwhites constituted 214.3 percent of the male teenage out—of—school

labor force in the central cities of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (in

comparison to 214.2 percent nationally), they accounted for a larger share of

total unemployment in central cities. But even there, nonwhites represented

only 36 percent of the unemployed. Whites accounted for 61 percent of the

unemployment in the central cities and 81     percent outside the SMSA'sJ Even among
families with incomes of less than $10,000, whites accounted for TO percent of

the unemployment nationally and 50 percent in central cities. The stereotyped

image of an unemployed teenager as a black central city resident corresponds to

less than 15 percent of the unemployed.

        The figures in Table 6 imply that reducing the nonwhite unemployment rate

from Lo.6 percent to the 16.2 percent that prevailed among whites would cut

nonwhite unemployment from 91,191 to 36,732, a reduction of 5L,759. This

accounts for only 13.I percent of the total of 1408,705 unemployed male out—of—

school teenagers. Reducing the nonwhite unemployment rate to the white rate

would therefore only lower the total unemployment rate from 18.9 percent to

16.3.

        Again, we want to stress that we are not minimizing the importance of the

high rates of unemployment and nonemploynient among the nonwhite teenagers. With

57 percent not employed, there is clearly a serious employment problem among

nonwhite     out—of—school teenagers. It is important, however, to recognize that

the vast majority of employed and nonemployed teenagers are white. Reducing the

unemployment rate of nonwhite teenagers to the corresponding rate for whites

would eliminate less than 15 percent of all the current unemployment among

teenage boys who are not in school.

         6. Approximately half of the difference between the unemployment rates of

white and nonwhites can be accounted for by other demographic. and economic

differences. Among the very low income households, the unemployment rates of

Axnong the 370,273 unemployed whites, 97,701 lived in central cities of SMSA's.
For nonwhites, the corresponding figures are 88,9614 and 55,781.
                                    —22—


whites and nonwhites are similar. Rising family income appears to be associated

with a much greater fall in the unemployment rate for whites than for nonwhites.

     We have examined how unemployment rates differ within each race by

schooling, family income, and age. More specifically, we have divided the

population into I8 non—overlapping groups based on all interactions aznon

these three factors. Thus, one group contains only those 17 year olds with

exactly 12 years of schooling who live in a family whose income (excluding

that of' the teenagers) is between $10,000 and $20,000. Each group is further

divided into whites and nonwhites, and the unemployment rate is calculated for

each subgroup. On the basis of this detailed information, we can calculate how

much of the white—nonwhite difference in unemployment rates is due to differences

between the rates in each of the 18 demographic groups and how much is due

to differences in the demographic composition of the white and nonwhite groups.1

The results are summarized in the first two columns of Table 7.

     The actual unemployment rate for white, male teenage boys who are out of

school is 16.3 percent; the corresponding rate for nonwhites is 1O.6 percent. If

nonwhites had the same demographic composition as whites but retained their

annual unemployment rates in each demographic group, their overall unemployment

rate would fell from 1O.6 percent to 27.9 percent. This is shown in Table 7 as

the unemployment rate based on "white weights and nonwhite rates." These

figures imply that the difference in the demographic composition of the two race

group accounts for 12.7 percentage points of the 24.3 percentage point dif-

ference in the overall unemployment rates, i.e. for more than 50 percent of the

difference between the races.

1Although the number of observations in each of the 18 cells is small, the
standard error of the mean depends essentially on the total number of obser-
vations. Similar results are obtained with the data for the March Survey.

      Table I   also   shows the implications of reversing this procedure and calcu—

 lating the unemployment rate that whites would have if they retained their

 actual unemployment rate in each demographic group but had       the   same demographic

 composition as the nonwhites. With the nonwhite demographic weights, the white

unemployment rate would rise from 16.3 percent to 21.0 percent, an increase of

14.1 percentage points or only about 20 percent of the difference between the

observed unemployment rates.

     Similar calculations for nonemployment rates are also presented in Table 7.

The first type of adjustment, i.e., using the white demographic composition,

results in a decrease in the nonwhite nonemployment rate from 31.2 percentage

points to 21.0 percentage points, a reduction of 33 percent. Similarly,

applying nonwhite weights to white unemployment rates raises the white

nonemployment rate from 25.9 percent to 32.5 percent, and accounts for only 21

percent of the race difference in noneruployment rates.

     In short, a limited set of demographic factors can account for a substan-

tial part of the racial difference in unemployment rates and a smaller part of

the difference in nonemployment rates. Changing the demographic weights is more

important for the nonwhite population than for whites.

     We have extended our analysis of the relationship between race and

unemployment by examining the unemployment rates of white and nonwhite teenagers

in families at different income levels.1 Two       interesting   conclusions emerge

from this analysis. First, among low income families there is relatively little

difference in the unemployment rates of whites and nonwhites. More precisely,

in families with incomes below $10,000 (excluding any income of the teenager)

white out—of—school boys had    an   unemployment rate of 0.26 while nonwhites had    a

                                       —25—

 rate of 0.30. Similarly, the nonemployment rates for whites wa     0.39   while that
 for nonwhites was 0.145.

       Our second finding is that rising family income appears to be associated

 with a much greater fall in unemployment rates for whites than for nonwhites.

 Among white teenagers, the unemployment rate drops from 0.26 in families with

 incomes below $10,000 to 0.114 in families with incomes of $10,000 to $20,000.

 The nonwhites show no decline at all; the unemployment rate
                                                               actually   rises

 slightly from 0.30 to 0.33. The same lack of improvement with income is seen

 in the nonemployment rates of nonwhites; while the white nonemployment rate

 drops from 0.39 to 0.22, the nonwhite rate rises from 0.145 to 0.514.    Only when
 family   incomes rise to more than $20,000 does the experience of whites and

 nonwhites become similar. The unemployment rates for this income group are 0.26

and 0.18 for whites and nonwhites respectively while
                                                       the corresponding
nonemployment rates are 0.214 and 0.25.

      The poor employment of middle income nonwhites remains a puzzle to us. Our

sample is too small to pursue this by further disaggregation but we believe that

much could be learned by pooling samples in order to explore whether this

apparent difference between middle income whites and nonwhites was just due to

chance in our sample and, if not, whether it can be explained by such things

as location or education.


7.   Conclusion.

      It is our conclusion that unemployment is not a serious problem for the

vast majority of teenage boys. School is the predominant activity of the young.

For many of the out of school but not employed group, the data provide evidence

of weak labor force attachment and little incentive or pressure to find work.

Most youngsters who do seek work remain unemployed only a short time.

       Nonwhites   suffer disproportionately high unemployment rates, but whites

still represent the vast majority of unemployed young people. Nearly half           of
the differences in white and nonwhite unemployment rates are attributable to

demographic differences In age, schooling,, and family income. Unemployment

rates of whites and nonwhites appear to be much more similar at the high and

low ends of the income distribution than in the middle. The mystery is the

middle class nonwhite teenagers who suffer far more unemployment than their

white counterparts.

      There is a small group of relatively poorly educated young men for whom

teenage unemployment is a serious problem. High school dropouts suffer over

half of the teenage unemployment and these persons show only a slow improvement

as they reach their twenties.

      In considering these findings, it should be borne in mind that the

results reported in this paper are based on samples for 1976 only. As we

noted above, we have repeated the analysis by examining data from 1975 and

1977 and found quite similar results, It would nevertheless be useful to

extend   these calculations to   other years in which economic conditions were

substantially different from 1975 through 1977.

      This paper is not the place to discuss the implications of our evidence

for appropriate policies to deal with youth unemployment. It is appropriate

however to conclude with a few words of caution. Since we have emphasized that

the   real problem of   teenage unemployment is currently concentrated in the rela-

tively small group that experiences long periods of u.nemployrnent,   it   may be

tempting   to believe that the problem could be solved by a program of targeted

job creation. The 250,000 boys with long periods of unemployment who. currently

account for more than half of the year's unemployment among out—of—school
                                       —27—

teenage boys could in principle be hired for a cost of $3    billion    even if   they
were   paid more than twice the minimum wage. The   primary danger in such an

approach   is that   the provision of relatively attractive public sector jobs

could   induce a very much larger   number of boys to seek such positions. This

could   detour many of those who have little or no problem with unemployment
away from   more productive jobs or from additional schooling. The challenge to
public policy is thus to create opportunities for employment     and on—the—job

training   for those   who would othervise experience long periods of

nonemployment without providing adverse incentives to the vast majority of

young people.1
