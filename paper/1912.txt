                       The Assessment of National Price Levels



                                       ABSTRACT


        This paper attempts to find norms for long—run national price levels,

  and therefore, by implication, for exchange rates, that are superior to
  those implied by the absolute or relative versions of purchasing power
  parity theory. The structural variables we have found to determine these
  price levels, real income per capita, the openness of the economy, and the
  share of tradables in total output, are used to explain price levels in
  periods since 1960 and to some extent since 1950.
        The results suggest that there was a movement toward a more "orderly"
  alignment   of price levels, especially in the period   before the 1970's. That
  is,   national price levels came to be explained to an increasing degree by

  our structural variables.

        The price levels implied by the structural equations appear to come

 closer    to representing long—run equilibrium levels than do those implied by
 purchasing power parity. The deviations from the structural equations seem
 to have value in   predicting future changes in price levels or real exchange

 rates,   in conbination with changes in the structural variables. And they
 also contribute to predicting changes in the balance of trade.

                               RESEARCH SUMMARY



Synopsis

    Issues: Is there a standard for judging national price levels, and

           therefore exchange rates, that is superior to the criterion that

           they should be equal in all countries? Equality is the norm set

           by the purchasing power parity theory. In this paper we ask

           whether there are long—run determinants of national price levels

           that keep some of them (the U.S., for example) above the world

           average and some of them below the average without necessarily

           producing adverse effects on the countries concerned or inducing

           any movement of exchange rates toward equality of price levels.


   Results: A country's national price level for all the goods and

           services that make up GDP is determined to a large extent by

           its real per capita income, the degree of openness of its economy,

           and the proportion of its aggregate output that consists of non—

           tradables, mainly services. The higher the income level and the

           higher the proportion of nontradables, the higher the price level

           in the long run. A more open economy tends to have a higher price

           level if it is a poor country but a lower price level if it is a

           rich country.

                The degree to which these characteristics explain national
                                   —2---



         price levels increased over the last thirty years or so. That is,

         the structure of international price levels became more orderly.

         During the 1950's, the dispersion in price levels (deviations from

         purchasing power parity) decreased. In later years, the disper-

         sion increased, but more and more of it was explained by these

         structural variables. Not only do the structural variables

         explain differences in price levels at a given time but changes in

         these variables help to explain changes in price levels. Thus a

         rise in a country's relative income level tends to raise the

         country's relative price level.

              Deviations from the price levels implied by our equations

         tend to be persistent over the medium term but disappear over long

         periods. In contrast, deviations from equality of price levels

         appear to be permanent; a country with a high price level in one

         period is likely to have a high price level twenty years later.


Policy Implications

   Measures taken to influence exchange rates are really aimed at

affecting national price levels. Such efforts require a notion of what is

in some sense an appropriate price level for a country and of what is an

inappropriate level. We find strong evidence that the U.S. price level can

be expected to be, typically, above that of almost any other country,

mainly because the U.S. has the highest, or one of the highest, per capita

income levels. For the same reason, we should expect that countries such

as Italy, the United Kingdom, and Japan will tend to have lower price

levels than the U.S. and most major European countries. The developing
                                   —3—

countries will typically have still lower price levels.

    One implication of these results is that, since these relationships

seem to be very durable, they are not indications of disequilibria in

exchange rates. Efforts to move these price levels toward equality might

well be futile or disruptive.


Further Research

    Although we have succeeded in explaining much of the variance in price

levels with the structural variables we have included, considerable unex-

plained deviations remain and appear to be fairly persistent. It would be

desirable to search further for possibly omitted structural variables.

Beyond that, the next step should be a search for short—run influences

that produce short—run deviations from the structural relationships. These

influences would include monetary and fiscal developments and capital

flows, although the last may be quite long—lasting in their effects.

    We have made a first effort to judge the effects of high or low price

levels, relative to the expected ones, on a country's trade, but that is a

subject that needs further investigation. For example, does a persistently

high price level lead to a long—run trade deficit, or does it lead a

country to participate less in world markets without unbalancing trade?

Does a brief episode of high prices relative to long—run national price

levels produce temporary trade deficits?

 Introduction

          It has been evident for some time that there are large country to

 country differences in national price levels. Equality of price levels—--

 sometimes referred to as the "law of one price" or "purchasing power

 parity"2——is not the norm. International comparisons of prices and incomes

 from the UN International Comparison Project (IcP) have shown that price level

disparities often involve spreads of 2 to 1 and can be as big as 3 to 1

 (Kravis, 1984; Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982). Other independent investi-

gations lead to the same conclusion.3 Also, the time—to—time variability of

exchange rates in recent years, clearly unmatched by the changes in price

  2'Purchasing power parity" in this sentence is used in the sense of Cassel's
theory holding that price levels will be equal after conversion to a common
currency via exchange rates. Elsewhere (for example, Kravis, Heston, and
Summers, 1982; Kravis and Lipsey, 1983; and Kravis, 1984), the term has been
used in an empirical sense to denote the number of currency units having the
same purchasing power as a unit of a numeraire currency, usually the U.S.
dollar. The term is employed in both senses in this paper; the context should
make it clear which meaning is intended.

  3For example, a recent report by Peter Hill (1985) of work by the OECD
showed the 1984 price levels of 18 member countries varying from 52 per cent
of the U.S. (Spain) to 97 per cent (Finland). Another study, this one carried
out by the Statistical Office of the European Community covering 15 African
countries found 1980 price levels varying from 56 per cent of the average for
the 15 (Ethiopia) to 126 per cent (Nigeria).

levels called for by the theory, have tilted the weight of opinion against the

validity of the relative version of the purchasing power parity theory.

Offsetting changes in international price movements and in exchange rates are

not the norm either.

         Nevertheless, the purchasing power parity theory of exchange rates

continues to be invoked as a reference point in discussions of exchange rate

behavior, such as those relating to over— or under— valuation of currencies

and overshooting. The implicit assumption often is made that the exchange

rates of some past period were normal and that equilibrium will be attained

when the exchange rates of that period, or the exchange rates adjusted for

differences in inflation (real exchange rates) are restored. In the latter

case, the assumption is that the "real exchange rate" would be constant in

equilibrium. This means, in other words, that the relationship between the

price levels of different countries would be constant. A large part of the

reason for the use of the PPP theory in these contexts is that there is no

other reference point.

         This paper represents an attempt to provide an alternative (see also

work along these lines by Clague, 1986). Our approach is based on the notion

that there is a structural relationship between price levels and basic

national economic characteristics, such as per capita income and propensity to

trade. We investigate the hypothesis that the price level of each country

tends toward a norm, changing slowly over time, which can be established on

the basis of this structural relationship, rather than on the assumption of

identical price levels or identical changes in price levels. Price level dif-

ferences in this view may be expected to be persistent, and they are not
                                       —3--


necessarily inconsistent with trade equilibrium. While the relationships of

the price levels of different countries are determined by long—run factors,

short—run influences can cause price levels to deviate from their structural

norms.

         Some of these issues were explored in terms of a 1975 cross section

in an earlier paper (Kravis and Lipsey, 1983). In the present paper we extend

the investigation to the period 1960—83, focusing on explaining long— or

intermediate—term movements of price levels.

         The international differences in price levels provide a link between

the price level, which can be regarded as a financial variable, and the key

real variables in the economic system. In some versions of the monetary theory

of the balance of payments, the law of one price is assumed to prevail and the

price level is a financial variable with little or no lasting effects. In the

view taken here, which we believe reflects reality better, the general price

level for GDP as a whole has imbedded in it sets of prices that can and do

differ from country to country, thereby directly and indirectly influencing

the nation's transactions with its trading and financial partners. Some of

these prices affect the flows of goods; others the flows of capital. The

literature dealing with the influence of prices on trade flows is voluminous;4

that dealing with the   role   of prices in affecting capital flows is much

sparser. Neither is assessed here; our focus is on the price level itself as

an important link in the real—financial economic nexus. However, we do

investigate whether deviations from our price level "norms" have any power in

                                I. Background

The Price Level and the Real Exchange Rate

         The price level (FL), upon which this work focuses, is defined as the

ratio of the purchasing power parity of a currency (PPP) to its exchange rate

(ER), both taken relative to the U.S. dollar as the numeraire currency.5

Purchasing power parity is defined in turn as the number of units of a

currency that have the same command over GDF as a U.S. dollar. Reliable

purchasing power parities require careful price comparisons for a sample of

commodities and services representative of GDP.6 When the extrapola-

tions on which this paper is based were performed, parities for 1975

were available from the U.N. International Comparison Project (ICP)

for 34 countries.7 The basic data used in this paper are these

purchasing power parities extrapolated on an annual basis backward,

for the most part to 1960, and frward to 1983, using each country's

implicit GDP deflators. For some of the 34 countries, data necessary

for the analysis were not available for all the years of th.e period,

and the discussion in this paper is therefore based on 25 or someti-

mes only 19 countries.8 In some cases countries were dropped because




  5For example, the purchasing power parity of the Japanese yen in 1975 was
271 per U.S. dollar and the exchange rate 2971$. Thus, with the U.S. dollar
as the numeraire, set equal to 100, the Japanese price level in 1975 was 91.

exchange rates that reflected the large prel)OflderanCe of the
country's   international   transactions were not available. In other

instances data on the division of GDP between tradahies and nontra—

dables were missing for some years and it was not possible to

construct figures on implicit deflators for tradables and nontra—

dables.9 Even for included countries, there are sometimes uncertain-

ties about the choice of a representative exchange rate, especially

in the cases of some developing    countries. Errors in the exchange
rates   are imparted to the PLs and if the time—to—time movement of the

exchange rate series is also different from the true series, errors

are introduced also into our time—to—time movements of FL.

          Our focus on the price level differs from the usual formulation in

terms of intertemporal indexes of "real exchange rates" found in the substan-

tial theoretical   and empirical literature on exchange rate determination. The



  9We work with two different sets of definitions of tradahies and nontra—
dables, one based on a subdivision of expenditures on GDP into various cate-
gories of final demand (e.g., shoes), and the other based on a subdivision of
CDP according to its industrial origins (e.g., the leather industry, the shoe
industry, etc.). The final demand categories——representing purchases not
intended for resale——are used in the UN International Comparison Project and
are followed here when equations based directly on ICP data are presented. The
final demand classification is not available for other years on a comparable
basis. Use has therefore been made of a definition of tradables based on more
widely available industry—originating data: the output of agricultural,
mining, and manufacturing industries has been regarded as tradable and the
rest of GDP as nontradahie. The industry—originating classification, of
course, includes both final and intermediate goods directly; the final demand
classification includes intermediate goods only as part of the value of
final goods. While the dividing line between tradahies and nontradables in
the industry—originating classification is somewhat arbitrary, it does
distinguish groups of industries that in the aggregate differ a great deal
with respect to the importance of trade. For the group of industries we
include under tradables, the ratios of exports to output and imports to
output in the U.S. in 1976 were each around 9 to 10 per cent. For the group
we include under nontradables, aside from general government, the ratios
were under 2 per cent (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1983, Table 1).
                                       —6—



most common definition of the real exchange rate (RER) refers to the intertem—
poral movement of the     nominal rate corrected for the relative movement of pri-
ces in the given country and the numeraire country (see, for example, Krueger,

1983).10 The intertemporal      index of PL (IPL), on the other hand, can be
regarded as the movement of a country's own—currency price level corrected for
the movement of the nominal exchange rate. Thus the RER and IPL are recipro—
cals, provided that the same price indexes are used in constructing the two
measures. We have argued elsewhere that the implicit     GOP deflator is the

appropriate     one to use, although the wholesale price index and the consumer
price   index are often employed (Kravis and Lipsey, 1978, p. 199—201).

          We prefer the "IPL" concept to RER' because IPL is a more natural

companion to PL in analyses involving the comparison of levels as well as

intertemporal changes. Formulating the problem in terms of both comparative

price levels and changes in price levels permits us to examine the possibility

that it is the levels that identify disequilibrium situations; a country is in

disequilibrium because its prices are too high rather than because they have

risen. A change in price levels through changes in either exchange rates or

relative own—currency inflation rates may be a response to an unsustainable

price level.



 '°The real exchange rate is sometimes defined in theoretical literature as
the change in the price of tradables relative to that of nontradables
(e.g., Bergias and Razin). This definition is appropriate only if the
price of tradables is the same at home and abroad (or if not the same, in a
constant relationship). Among 25 ICP countries (15 developing and 10
developed) the price level for tradables varied in 1975 from 46 percent
(Pakistan) to 144 percent (Denmark) of the U.S. level. ICP data are from
Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982. The classification used in that work
groups construction with commodities rather than with services. However, for
the tradables—nontradables dichotomy, as already noted, commodities excluding
construction are regarded as tradahies and services plus construction as
noritradable.

their rapid shifts can he          irtling. This may be illustrated by the following

Previous Work

             The starting point for the present effort was a pair of equations
that were found in Kravis and Lipsey (1983) to account for over 80 per cent
of    the   cross—country variation in the national price levels of 34 countries in
1975. The      price    level (PL) was taken as the dependent variable, and the mdc—

pendent     variables were real COP    per capita (r), openness (OP) defined as

exports     plus imports (from national accounts data) divjded by GOP, and the
share of nontradabies in final expenditures on GOP (SN). Corresponding
equations based on the 25 ICP countries used for this paper'1 are as follows:


   'The variables are scaled differently in the present equations; the U. S.
is set equal to 100 for FL and r; OP is entered as a ratio and SN as a
percentage. The mean FL for the 25 countries is 70.2. Some minor corrections
in the price levels have also been made. t—values are in parentheses below
the    coefficients.

            Equations such as these for single years are subject to a good deal of

short—run variability. Since this paper is focused on relatively long—term or

medium—term changes, we rely on equations based on averages for three—year

periods.    We show the   one—year equations here oniy for conparison with the

earlier    work.
           The latest round of the I[CP, for 1980, covers a much larger number of
countries, but at this point data are available only for the variables of
equation 1. For 55 countries in 1980, the corresponding equation is:
(IA) PL(80) =        42.56 + .662    r+      17.54 op                            2=       .623
                     (7.27) (8.50)           (2.00)                             RMSE =    17.4
                                                                          No.Obs. =       55

The explanatory power is        much lower in the later equation than in equation (1)
and the coefficient for r is also much lower. There are two possible explana-

tions for the difference. One is that the relationship did change over time;

the   other is that the additional countries, mainly developing, added in the
broader    survey   did not exhibit the same relationship between price level and

the other    variables as the smaller group. We            can   test for the   source   of the
difference by running the equation with 1980 data for those countries (25) for
which 1975 data were also available. The list of countries is not identical to
that included in the rest of this          paper, but 22 of the 25 are the same.

(Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain are included here hut Jamaica, Malaysia,

and Pakistan are excluded). That equation is:
                                      —9—


(1B)   PL(80) = 32.11    +    .856 r + 17.36 OP                 R2 = .785
                (4.43)       (8.55)   (1.93)                  RMSE = 16.0
                                                           No.Obs. = 25

         The resulting equation is very close to equation 1 with respect to

the size of the constant term, the coefficient of r, and the R2 despite the

difference in country coverage. Thus, it seems safe to say that there was no

major change in the relationship from the substitution of 1980 relative prices

and quantities for those of 1975. However, the addition of more countries did

blur the relationship considerably, particularly because three newly—added

low—income African countries, Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Ivory Coast, had

extremely high price levels, two even above that for the U.S.

         The rationale for the selection of the explanatory variables has been

previously explained (e.g., Kravis and Lipsey, 1983, pp. 11—16, and Bhagwati,

1984), but it may be worthwhile to outline the arguments briefly. We take the

occasion also to develop a little further our use of the openness variable.

         The positive association between PL and r is attributable to higher

prices of nontradables relative to tradables in higher income countries. The

explanation may be couched in terms of rich—country margins of superiority in

productivity that are smaller for nontradables, expecially services, than for

tradables, or in terms of the tendency for nontradables to be labor intensive

and for labor to be more costly relative to other factors of production in

high income countries than in low—income countries.

         In general, we may expect high foreign trade/GDP ratios to reduce

country—to—country divergences in price levels. Trade not only operates

directly in pulling prices of tradables towards greater uniformity, but

affects the prices of nontradables by tending to raise the prices of relati—
                                           — 10 —




vely    abundant factors and lowering the       prices   of relatively scarce ones. If

poor countries tend to have abundant labor, and if nontradahies (comprised

largely of services) tend to be labor intensive, the effects of openness can

he predicted. As between two countries with equal low incomes, the one with

the higher      level of openness should have higher prices for nontradables and
for G1)P as a whole. As between two countries with equal high incomes, the one
with    the   higher level of openness should have lower prices.
              The justification we give for the     openness      variable implies that the
direction of its influence should vary with the factor abundance of the
country involved. If we assume that the level of real income per capita is a
good proxy for capital abundance (or labor scarcity), we could include a term
for the conbinatfon of real income per capita (r) and openness (OP), and the

coefficient for this cross—product term should he negative. Equations 1C and

2C    correspond   to equations 1 and 2 with the addition of this term:
(1C) PL(75) =         15.56 + 1.047r +     33.07 OP — .27 rOP                              =   .855

              The rOP term meets our expectations in one respect hut not in

another. The coefficient is negative, as we expect, but ft is not statisti-

cally significant and in this year at least, while the positive influence of

openness on the price level diminishes with higher income, it never disappears

or    turns negative as   we    exjected it would.'2

     '21f   we make the same addition of a term to the          1980   data used for equations
1A and IB, we have:
(IAC) PL(80) =         39.88 + .711r + 22.16 OP — .08 rOP                            2=        .616

           Over time, the impact of OP may vary according to the direction of

changes   not only in OP but also in the degree of responsiveness of internal
prices to world markets. Increased and more rapidly diffused information nay
result in a larger impact for a given level of openness than was observed in
an earlier period.
           The positive sign on    the   share coefficient, share being defined in

terms of the current value of output in own prices, implies that, given real

GOP per capita and openness, high nontradables shares in final expenditures

are associated with high nontradables prices. Such a relationship may be

attributable to elasticities of substitution between tradahies and nontra—

dables in final demand that are below i.13


                              II. The Price Level for GDP

The Structural Equation for PL

          The further explanation of comparative national price levels starts

with the modification of equation (2) prior to fitting it to data for years

other than 1975 in the period 1960—83. The formulation in equation (2) has

the   disadvantage that two   of the   independent variables,   OP and SN,   overlap.
That is, OP may be regarded as the product of the share of tradables in GOP


(1Bc) PL(80) =       21.68+ 1.027r + 35.61 OP - .28     rOP              2=        784

                                                                     No.Obs. =    25


  '3Since tradables prices are more nearly set by world prices, PL for GOP as
a whole will he high when nontradables are dear, if the         elasticity of substi-
tution between tradables and nontradables in internal consumption is below 1.
The Phase Iii ICP data yield an elasticity of substitution between tradables
andnontradahies of —.44 (calculated from data in Kravis, Heston and
Summers, 1982, pages 12, col. 5; 194, cols. 8 and 9; and 196, cols. $ and 9
for 30 countries).

and the ratio of actually traded goods to tradables:

(3) OP =        GDP         Tradables   X          GDP

An    alternative way to decompose the independent          variable is to substitute the

two    multiplicative components of OP for OP and SN. The results               are:

                     X+N
where OPT = Tradables          and ST = the share of tradables in GDP. Equation

(4C) again    shows an attenuation of the influence         of openness with higher

levels of per capita income, but no reversal of direction.

           There is no statistical basis for choosing between equations (2) or

(2C) on the one hand and (4) and (4C) on           the other, but (4)        and (4C) may be

regarded    as providing a slightly better classification of the factors at work

on the right side of the equation. The same rationale can be offered for OPT

that was given for OF, and what     was said       about SN applies to ST with a changed

sign.'4 It should he reported that the formulations of equations (2) and (4)

were   reached after an investigation of a larger number of structural variables
(e.g.,    relative productivity in traded and nontraded goods), of different

functional forms (log versus arithmetic), and of different formulations of the

variables finally chosen (e.g., defining OP in terms of merchandise trade
only). Although the choices were not always clear cut, some less than thorough
investigation of the alternatives led us to believe that the results described
below would not be very different if the alternative choices had been made.
            A problem encountered in the use of the              (2)   and (4)    equations     as

prototypes for the investigation of long—run trends is that the ICP esti-
mate of the share of tradahies, used to form OPT and ST, is defined in
terms of final products (i.e., goods purchased for final use and not for
use    as intermediate products) and is not readily available for other

years.'5 This difficulty is not insuperable because a rough estimate of the

tradables    component of GDP can be derived from data, available in national
accounts, on the share of GDP accounted for by different industries, each
of   which produces both final and intermediate products. For this purpose,

as noted earlier, tradables have been defined as the output of agriculture,

mining, and manufacturing, leaving the output of construction and of the

service industries to be regarded            as nontradables. The modified OPT and T

variables, OPTI and STI, respectively, produce similar results when substi-

tuted in equation (4):


(4A)      PL(75) = 56.42   + .718r       +   6.03   OPTI   —   .60 STI                 =   .872

Even this       version of the two trade exposure variables is available as far back
as 1960 for only 25 countries and this was one of the facts that determined
the restriction of the analysis to these countries.
Trends       in the Key   Variables
               Since   we are interested primarily In price level trends, we have

recast the       annual   data into a series of non—overlapping three—year averages.

These    reduce the influence of short—term fluctuations and make the trends in
the    underlying      data stand Out more clearly.
              The behavior of the four variables used in equation (4A) is presented
in    Table 1, with two versions of the openness variables reported. One of the

major    changes over the whole period Is that the average       price level relative

to    the U.S., after remaining in the range of 56 to 59 per cent of the U.S.
level during the        fixed—exchange—rate   period, climbed to nearly 80 per cent
in 1978—80 before falling back to 65 per cent in 1981—83. It rose particularly
during       the two periods when there were major increases in petroleum prices

(column 1). The dispersion of country price levels around their average

increased (column 2); that is, deviations from the law of one price became

larger. There was a particularly large jump in dispersion between the fixed

exchange rate period and the floating exchange rate period, but the tren(1

toward larger deviations began during the fixed rate period.

              The two decades witnessed a great expansion in the world economy 16

hut, of course, not all countries gained at the same rate: the U.S. lagged

behind the average of, the others, for example (column 3). The dispersion of

country incomes around the mean remained almost constant (column 4).
              The   share of tradables in total GDP drifted downwards (column 9),   as


service industry output grew relative to goods output, but the ratio of goods

actually traded to tradables output rose sharply, especially in the 1970s

(column 7). That rise in the trade ratio was partly a direct reflection of the

increase in the price of oil, a heavily traded commodity, but was not confined

to that group. It was evident also within manufactured goods (see Lipsey,

1984).

Trends   in    the Structural Relationships
              Table 2   shows the results of fitting equations like (4A) to each of

the 8 cross sections. It is evident that there were marked secular trends in
the coefficients of real per capita GDP and openness. In each case, the coef-
ficient tends to rise through time, with the increases tending to be larger in
the early 1970s at about the the time that the Bretton woods regime ended.

That   is, the price levels of the countries became more sharply differentiated

according to their income levels and the extent of their participation in the

international economy. At the same time, the explanatory power of the indepen-

dent variables increased markedly; the t—statistics and the R2s are clearly

higher in the later periods. The "unexplained" deviations from the law of one

price therefore increased much less than the deviations themselves.

          To trace the changes in these relationships back to the 1950s, it is

necessary to revert to equation (1) and to rely on data for a smaller number

of countries. In Table 3, the results of equation (1) are presented for 23

countries based on data for 1950—1962 and for the same 25 countries as in

Table 2 for 1960—1983, with 1960—62 as an overlapping period.

                                Notes to Table 3



All variables are three year averages.
The dependent variable is PL with the U.S.       100 in each period.
PL = PPP/Exchange rate.

Figures in parentheses are t—statistics in columns 1—3 and root mean square
errors in column 4.

Independent variables:

           r = real per capita GDP with the U.S. = 100 in each period.
          OP = (X+M)/GDP, based on national accounts data

Note: R2s, intercept terms, and standard errors are the same whether the
       absolute or relative values of the variables are used (I.e., whether
       per capita GDP is expressed in dollars or, as is done, as an index
       with U.S.   100).

               The   major story of Table 3 is that the movement towards a more
"orderly' alignment of PLs was very substantial during the 1950s.'1 The
equations for the first three periods do not even meet a test of significance
at the 5 per cent level, but the degree to which our equations explained
price levels, as measured by the R2s, increased monotonica.lLy from the early
1950s to the 1960s and, in fact, through the early 1970s, after which it
changed only slightly. For a good part of the period, up to the end of the era
of fixed" exchanged rates, the standard error of the equations declined
almost continuously. For the first couple of periods at least, that decline
must have represented a fall in the variance of price levels themselves, that
is,    a    move towards aligning exchange rates with the purchasing power of
currencies,          since our equations showed no significant coefficients. After

that,       however, and particularly during the      era of floating   exchange rates,
price levels came to be explained more and more by per capita income and open-
ness, until the last period, when the openness variable suddenly vanished.

               If we add the cross—product term rOPTI to the equations of Table 2 to

permit the direction of the openness effect to vary with income level, we get

the set of coefficients displayed in Table 4. The degrees of explanation and

the    standard errors are      quite similar to those of the   earlier table, but the
openness coefficients are very different and show the expected interrelation
with       income levels. In the   last equation, for example, the coefficients imply

              note, however, an alternative to the suggestion that the struc-
            should
ture of price levels became more rational in some sense over time. It is con-
ceivable that the price level estimates for the 1950s are very poor because
they are extrapolated so far from the 1975 base. They do, however, match
fairly well (r2 = .73 and the average absolute difference is only about 5%)
the independent estimates made for that period by Gilbert and Kravis (1954)
and Gilbert and Associates (1958) for the same countries, as can he seen from
the comparison in Summers, Kravis, and hleston (1980), n. 30.

that    the effect of a greater degree of openness on the price level is positive

for any country with real income ler capita less than 81 per cent of the U.S.

level hut negative for any country above that income. The latter group

included Denmark, France, and Germany in that year. The 52 per cent dividing

line in 1960—62 suggested negative coefficients for the U.S. and all the

European countries except Italy. The coefficient for Japan was always posi-

tive. There was considerable variation in the borderline over time, but in

four of the eight periods the dividing line was between 52 and 67           per cent of
the    U.S. income   level. The equations suggest that openness had    a   positive
effect    on price levels for    all countries in the 1970's, particularly 1975—80.
That    result confirms the failure to find any negative openness effect in the

earlier single—year equations for 1975 and 1980.18

           Aside     from the increasing explanatory power of the equations, it
is clear in all the sets of equations that the slope of the relationship bet-
ween per capita income and       price   level was rising over most of the period.
The coefficients for openness had a different history. In equations without a
cross—product term (Tables 2 and 3), they played no role at all for the period

of    fixed exchange rates, increased in importance afterwards, and virtually
disappeared in the last period. When the cross—product term rOPTI was added

                              the regressions are highly correlated with
     '8Since the deviations from
each other across periods, as is discussed later, and the same variables are
used in each regression, we used Zeilner's "seemingly unrelated regression"
procedure to estimate the whole set of cross—section equations simultaneously.
The results, given in Appendix Table 1 are coefficients for per capita income
and openness quite similar to those of Table 4. The t—statistics for the r and
STI variables increased, and the coefficients were slightly higher as well,
but both were lower for the OPTI variable. Many of the OPTI coefficients were
actually negative, although not statistically significant, in the earlier
periods. Since the per capita income variable is so dominant and the changes
in it were not large, we did not substitute the re—estimated coefficients in
our analysis.

 (Table 4), both its coefficient and that of the        OP term itself were more

 stable    than the   OP or OPTI terms in Tables 2 and 3•19

                The most likely explanation for the shifts in the coefficients over

 time is that there are important variables omitted from the analysis. One can-

didate for       this role is capital movements. Since a capital importer is running
a current account deficit, we might think of a high price level as part of the
mechanism producing such a deficit, or of a low price level as part of the
process that produces a current—account surplus. This variable would he
appropriate if we thought of shifts in the capital account as exogenous,
reflecting forces in capital markets to which the current account must accono—
date. It would he less appropriate if we thought of the capital account as
accomodating changes in the determinants of the current account or of the two
being   determined simultaneously.20



  '9An alternative to the interpretation of these changes as representing
shifts  in the structural coefficients might he that thebasic relationship is
constant  through time hut curvilinear. In this case, the higher coefficients
for r and OPT in the equations for the more recent periods could he due to
their being fitted to a steeper part of the function. That seems an unlikely
explanation       for the most important explanatory variable, real GOP per capita
as a percent of the U.S. , since it increased only from 36 percent in 1960—68
to 42 per cent in 1981—83 (See Table 1).   Of the other independent variables,
the OP and OPTI  measures, particularly the latter, increased substantially,
while the share of tradable goods in GOP edged downwards, but these variables
account for only a small fraction of the estimated price level.
    A preliminary test of the 1980 data for a larger sample of countries
from ICP Phase IV did not suggest ciirvilinearity in the relationships between
Pt and either r or OP. Squared terms for these two variables did not have
significant coefficients, and their introduction only reduced the significance
of the other       variables.

          did    perform   some preliminary experiments that involved adding   to   the
equations of Table 2 a variable for the ratio of the net current balance to
GOP. The coefficients were never statistically significant and often had the
wrong sign. The addition of this variable did not affect the coefficients of
the other variables.

            Over   the last 15 or 20 years, the changing institu tional background
has continually brought new or newly important influences into the deter—
mination of exchange       rates and price levels. The shift from fixed to floating
rates and the enormous rise in the         lmportanCe   of capital movements, mentioned
above, are    only    two of many. These changes      are difficult to capture in econo-
metric formulations. We have made no effort to measure the factors affecting
exchange rates       separately   from domestic price levels or short—term effects       on

international price levels, and little effort to measure the               effects of
changes in the institutional climate. What is attempted here is to identify
and take systematic account of certain permanent factors: those that tend to

remain   in play continuously. Some important factors that are relatively new
and often difficult to quantify appear only as factors changing our coef-
ficients or are left to he explained, possibly in more qualitative terms, as
part of large      and   economically significant residuals.
Alternative Norms for       Price Levels

            The differences between      the price    levels implicit in    one set of
equations    and those implicit in the purchasing power parity theory of exchange

rates are described in Table 5. We compare the deviations from the price
levels implied by the absolute form of the theory (all PL = 100) with tile
residuals from the equations of Table 2 (PL—PL). The results of the com-
parison are, of course, a foregone conclusion, given the high     of Table 2.
Any significant relation between the price level and our independent varial)1CS
implies that our equations fit better than the Purc11a51fli power parity assump-
tion, the absolute form of which implies identity of price levels.
          This comparison is not a test of the predictive power of our struc—

tural   equations, since they have been fitted to the price levels of each

period. Even so, it is of some interest that the fit can be so good using a

common set of independent variables for all the periods, without taking into

account the many short—term factors that can cause price levels to change if

own—price inflation rates and changes in exchange rates are not exactly off-

setting.

            Several tests of predictive or explanatory value with respect to

changes in price levels could he constructed. We    have   carried out only a test

of the usefulness of the   structural   variables for a period, combined with   the
structural equations for a previous period, in explaining price levels and

changes in them. Since the relative form of PPP theory implies no change in

price levels, any contribution these equations and/or changes in these

variables   can make in explaining price level changes is an improvement on
the theory.
         Our test asks whether the structure of one period and the observed
values of the independent variables for the next period, predict the next
period's price levels. Because we know that the deviations from the struc-
tural equation tend to persist from period to period, we include each period's
deviations in the equation for the following period.
         The predictions of price levels for all eight cross sections combined

are shown in equation 6.    It is based on structural equations with r, OPTI,
the cross—product term rOPTI, and STI as independent variables.

              l)espite the changes over time in the structural relationships
 recorded in Table 4, each period's price level was very well estimated from
 that period's structural variables in combination with the previous period's
equation                                                        of the coef-
              and the residuals from that equation. The implication

ficient on the residual is that these deviations from the structural rela-
tionships tended to persist from period to            period   hut were reduced in size by
about 20 per cent from one period to the next.
   The corresponding equations for individual periods are given in Table 6
The predictions are quite good; all hut   2 are about .92 or over. The

coefficients     for the previous periods' residuals are always significant and

generally     below one, reflecting the persistence of the         residuals but some ten-

dency for them to decline over time.

       These equations, although they account for so much of          the variance    in

price    levels, do   not do much   better   in predicting price levels than the       pre-

diction of no change. Relative price levels are so strongly related to rela-

tive real income per capita,        which changes very     slowly, that it   is   hard to

beat    the no—change prediction by much. However, these equations provide esti-
mates of changes in price levels, given changes in the independent variables.
The interesting question is whether these predictions of changes in price
level are superior to the prediction of no change. Equation 7 answers that
ques tion.

where PLt =     PLt       PLt_i, and PL is the PL estimated in equation 6.
            The implication of these equations is that the structural equation
for period t—1 , the residuals from that equation, and the changes in r, OPTI,
and STI do, in conhination, provide a predicted change in price level from
period    t—1 to period t    that   is far better than the prediction of no change.

These structural variables do help to explain changes in price level as well

as differences at a given time.

            The corresponding equations for individual periods are shown                        in
Table 7. For five of the seven intervals the equations and changes in struc-

tural variables   contribute significantly to estimating price level changes.
The exceptions   are two intervals in the 1970's when equations (not shown)

fitted without the interaction term (rOPTI) provided significantly better pre-
dictions.
            The discussion up to         this point has      assumed that market forces
operate on aggregate GOP price levels, price levels relative to those implied
by structural equations, or changes in them, across countries. An alternative
hypothesis is that these forces operate on traded goods prices but not, or to
a much smaller extent, on nontradables prices. To test whether that is the
case we will perform the same comparisons and tests on PLTR, the price level
for tradables, as on the aggregate price level.

 Price   Levels for Tradables and Nontradables

            The likelihood of large deviations from international equality of

price levels is more readily acceptable for nontradables than for tradables,

as is the possibility that price levels should be related to income or other

variables. A number of theoretical analyses of price levels take account of

this difference, as was pointed Out lfl      our   earlier paper (Kravis and Lipsey,

1983). It was also pointed out there that, although the relationship was not

quite    as strong, the    variables that explained aggregate price levels also went

a long way in explaining price levels for tradables. That result does not

necessarily contradict the theories that imply the equalization of prices of

some type of "pure" tradables but it limits their empirical applicability.

The measured prices of tradables inevitably incorporate some nontradable

inputs, such as wholesale or retail services, and would differ among countries

even if "pure" tradable prices were equalized.
           There is   a   particular interest in the   determinants   of the two sets of
prices    separately, since we might expect that departures of tradables prices

from equilibrium might be more quickly erased by changes in exchange rates

than those of the total      price level. They are also likely to he better indica-
tors of   any deliberate efforts by governments to influence trade flows and to

be more influential in determining trade flows.

           For the benchmark year 1975, the equations for the price levels for

GDP as a whole (FL) and for tradables (PLTR) and nontradables (PLNT), based on

                                                             = .726

         As we might expect, the levels for nontradables prices are better

explained than those for tradables prices, and the coefficient for r is con-

siderably higher. That seems reasonable in view of the explanations we have

given for the relationship between income per capita and price levels. The

coefficient for openness is larger in the equation for tradahies, suggesting

that the influence of competition with other countries plays more of a role

for these products than for nontradables, in addition to effects of trade on

factor prices.

         In Table 8, similar equations for tradables and nontradables are

fitted to data for our successive 3—year non—overlapping periods21. As in the

benchmark year equations, the prices of nontradables, viewed across countries,

rise more sharply with increasing per capita incomes (r) than the prices of

tradables.22 The coefficients for openness, the ratio of goods actually traded

to tradables, were similar in the two sets of equations, but the interaction

between per capita income and openness was much stronger for nontradahies.



  21Qnly 19 countries were included in the Table 8 regressions, because
time series on GDP originating in different sectors in current and constant
prices, necessary to derive implicit deflators for tradables and nontra—
dables, were not available for the others. See notes to Table 8. It
should be added to those notes that the constant price series for the dif-
ferent economic sectors are in many instances subject to large margins of
error and to country to country differences arising out of the use of dif-
ferent methods. We do not see any reason to believe that these incom—
parabilities bias the 19—country data in ways that invalidate our uses of
them.

  22Tradahles were defined as final expenditures on commodities other than
construction in the benchmark year and as the output of agriculture, mining and
manufacturing in the Table 8 equations.

    Based on data for 19 countries, those listed in Table 1 with the exception
of Luxembourg, Kenya, Malaysia, Malawi, Brazil, and Zambia. The 1975 PPPs for
tradables and nontradables, derived from ICP exchange rates and price levels
(Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982, pp. 10 and 196), were extrapolated to other
years by the use of implicit deflators. The implicit deflator for tradables
was derived by taking the ratio of CDP originating in agriculture, mining and
manufacturing at current prices to the GDP originating in these industries at
constant prices (data fron IBRD, 1984 Economic Data Sheet 1). The implicit
deflator for nontradahies was formed in a similar way on the basis of GDP ori-
ginating in other sectors. r and OPTI were the same as in Table 2.

In   1978—80, when the U.S. price level was very low, the coefficient for the

interaction between real per capita income and openness is not only insignifi-

cant but even has the wrong sign.


     III. Deviations From the Structural Equations and Their Significance

The Pattern of Residuals

          There are a number of ways to interpret the deviations of price

levels from those predicted by our equations and to think about their con-

sequences. If we regard the equations as representing estimates of

equilibrium price levels, we might expect that deviations from them would be

ephemeral. They might be quickly erased by movements of exchange rates, espe-

cially in the floating exchange rate period, or by price movements, especially

in the fixed exchange—rate era. If the deviations are long—lasting, they might

reflect the omission from our equations of significant structural variables,

such as the inflow or outflow of capital. They might, on the other hand,

reflect government policies that sustain disequilibrium price levels for long

periods, for example by maintaining overvalued exchange rates and exchange

controls or by maintaining undervalued rates to promote exports.23

          One way of analyzing the persistence of residuals is by measuring

whether the countries that have high price levels (PL), relative to those pre-

dicted by the equations (PL), in one period tend to have high price levels

in preceding or following periods. An answer to this question is given in



  231n this case, we might have to consider the possibility that our openness
variable should be treated as partly endogenous. For example, an artificially
sustained high exchange rate that produced a large positive deviation from the
structural price level would reduce exports and perhaps force the country to
cut imports as well. It might he appropriate to examine this possibility by
substituting for openness itself a variable that represents the permanent
determinants of openness, such as country size and population density.

 Table 9, which shows the correlations among residuals in different periods

 for the structural equations found in Table 4. Similar results are obtained

 when the   other structural equations of Tables 2 and 3   are used.

                is clearly a strong tendency for the deviations to be similar
            There

 for a country in the different periods. Although the association atrophies
 with time, the correlation coefficients are all positive and are usually
 significant at the 5 per cent level (r > .40) between a given period and each
 of   three or four prior and three or four   subsequent periods.
            The 25 countries included in the analysis are grouped in Table 10

according to their long—run tendency to have low, intermediate or high price

levels after the price levels have been purged of structural influences as

measured by equation 4A, that is, after levels of real income per capita,

openness, and the share of nontradables in output have been taken into

account. For the most   part, countries with actual PLs falling far short of the
PLs estimated by the equation tended to have such shortfalls (negative

residuals) consistently across the seven periods.24 Similarly, countries with


   24The identifiction of the countries with low purged (or residual) price
 levels (i.e., PL—PL) or high ones is fairly robust to small changes in the
 specification of the structural equation, such as the use of OP or OPT instead
of OPTI or the substitution of logs for arithmetic values. There is, however,
 the possibility that errors in the 1975 benchmark measures ofPL are simply
being extrapolated to other years. Some assurance that is not the case is
given by a comparison of the 1980 PLs for 10 industrial countries extrapolated
from our 1975 benchmarks with the 1980 PLs produced by a new OECD benchmark
study (Hill 1985), most of the data representing comparisons carried out by
the Statistical Office of the European Community (1982). The coefficient of
rank correlation was 0.78. The three countries with the lowest PLs were iden-
tical and so were the three with the highest PLs, though within neither set of
three were the rankings identical and a fourth country was in a tie for the
eighth rank (from low to high) in our estimates. The possibility remains, of
course, that the statistical system of the country, which provides the basic
data for the international comparisons, produces prices or expenditures that
are biased relative to those produced by other countries. The reasonableness
of the conformances of the benchmark series does not provide proof against
this untoward outcome.

The equation was fitted to each of eight non—overlapping three—year periods beginning with
1960—62 and ending with 1981—83. The residuals were averaged and the countries ranked,
beginning with the one with the largest negative average residual. Malawi was omitted from
the ranking because its price level was not available for all periods.

PThere was a positive trend in the residuals. The criterion was a 5% significance level
for the coefficient of time (T) in the equation:
                      Residual = a + bT

1'There was a negative trend in the residuals. See note p, above.

actual   PLs far exceeding estimated PLs tended to have positive residuals that

also appeared rather consistently. Trends in the residuals characterized

several countries, as noted in the table. One of the pronounced ones was for

the U.S.; the U.S. residual moved almost monotonically from +9.2 in 1960—62 to

—31.4 in 1978—80 but then declined sharply in absolute terms in the last period.

          The behavior of price residuals for developed countries was somewhat

different from that for developing countries. In particular, all the 7

countries with consistent low residual price levels (negative residuals in 6,

7, or 8 periods, were developing countries.

          Since the structural equations come closer than identity of price

levels to a representation of equilibrium price levels, the residuals from

identical price levels should be more persistent. Table 11 shows the per-

sistence of deviations from purchasing power parity, as measured by the corre-

lations between PLs in different periods.25 As we hypothesized, these

deviations are more persistent than those from the structural equations of

Table 9. The differences between the two sets of deviations are summarized

below:




       is conceivable that the correlations are high because of non—persistent
variations in FL, but the frequent persistence of high or low deviations
(Table 10) makes this unlikely.

The correlations between price levels (that is, deviations from purchasing

power parity) in one period and those in succeeding periods are higher than

those for the residuals from the structural equations for every length of span,

but the differences are much greater for the longer spans. In other words, a

country with a high price level in one year is likely to have a high price

level   20 years later. On the other hand, a country with a high price level
relative to its structural characteristics, while it   will he likely   to still
have a high price level three years later, is not particularly likely to have
such a price level 15 or 20 years later. Our interpretation of this difference

is that the deviations from the levels predicted by the structural equations of

Table 4 represent something more like departures from long—run equilibrium
                                       — 29 —




 price   levels than the departures from purchasing power parity (equality of

 price levels). The latter represent not only deviations from equilibrium but

 also reflect long—run structural characteristics of the economies.



 Residuals for Tradables and Nontradables

           If equilibrium is more likely to be attained for tradables prices

 than for PL as a whole, and if exchange rates are not too greatly affected by

intervention, deviations from the tradables equations might he expected to be

less persistent than those for PL. That proposition is tested in Table 12, a

companion to Table 9, but based on deviations of tradables prices from their

structural equations.

           Within the fixed—rate era there was little difference in persistence

between tradahies residuals and those for the aggregate price level, as can be

seen below. Within the floating—rate period, the residuals for tradables

were a little less persistent than those for nontradables and the same was

true for intervals spanning the two periods.

           To the extent that persistently high or low price levels relative to

those predicted by   our   equations represent policies of raising or depressing

exchange   rates rather than unaccounted—for characteristics of the economies,
we might   expect that they will operate equally on both tradable and nontra—

dable price levels. Also from a purely statistical standpoint, the shared

importance of tradables and nontradables in constituting GDP makes it

unsurprising that countries that tend to have high predicted price levels for

aggregate GDP generally tend to have high predicted price levels also for the

tradable and nontradable components of GDP.26 However, the connections were not

so close that there was not room for a variety of patterns; the coefficient of

correlation linking the PLTR and PLNT residuals was only .52. Thus, some

countries had higher price levels for tradahies relative to nontradables than

would be expected on the basis of the equations, and others exhibited the

opposite relationship. The prices of tradables were substantially higher.in

these terms in Mexico, India, France, and Uruguay and substantially lower

in Belgium, Korea, Thailand, and Japan (Table 13).27

  26For the 19 countries in Table 13, the coefficient of correlation between
the residuals from the PL equations and those from the PLTR equations was .87;
that between the residuals of the PL equations and the PLNT equations was .72.
The residuals in these correlations were those obtained by averaging 7 sets of
residuals, one relating to each of the seven periods.

       would he interesting to investigate both the causes and consequences of
these differing price relationships, but that must remain a matter for future
research. (See, however, Kravis, lleston and Summers, 1983, and Kravis and
Lipsey, 1983 for the role of service prices which comprise the hulk of
nontradables).

 sort   of long—term relationship, we might expect then to have effects on sub-

 sequent flows of exports and imports of goods and services. A high price level

 relative to this norm (i.e., a large value for PL — PL) should reduce, and a

 low price level should increase, exports relative to imports. This possibility

 is tested in Table 14, in which we relate the price level deviations in the

first and fourth periods to changes in the export/import ratio between those

periods and the seventh and eighth periods, the longest spans for which we

have data.

           The results give consistent, but weak support for the idea that some

such long—term relationships exist. A high price level in 1969—71 relative to

that predicted by a country's real income per capita, degree of openness, and

share of tradables in output was associated with a decline in exports relative

to imports over the period to 1978—80, but the relationship was much weaker

with the period ending in 1981—83. However, equations with fewer variables

(not shown) produced significant correlations over three of the five spans.

           Over shorter periods, the coefficients were quite erratic and only

one was significant at the 1 per cent level: a high price level in 1969—71 was

associated with declines in the export/import ratio in the next period.

           Given all that we know about the factors determining trade flows, it

is obvious that we have not specified a trade equation here. The most we might

say is that there is some indication that it may be worth including some such

measures of general price levels in more completely specified trade equations,

in addition to the usual measures of price change for specific products or

groups of products.

                 IV.     Summary arid Agenda for Future Research


         This paper    starts   from the fact that neither the absolute nor the

relative version of purchasing power parity theory provides an adequate expla-

nation for differences in national price levels. The former assumes that all

price levels are equal and the latter that they all change by identical

proportions. We have tried to find explanations for the price level differen-

ces that exist and for changes in relative levels that would be superior to

those assumptions. From these explanations, we attempt to derive some norms

for national price levels.

         The structural determinants of national price levels discovered in

previous studies of data for 1975 and earlier years were still evident in the

latest and much broader survey covering 55 countries in 1980. We fitted simi-

lar cross sections to a number of sub—periods over 23 years, relating price

levels to real income per capita, the openness of the economy, and, the share

of tradables in total output.

         These equations suggested that since 1960 or even 1950, there has

been a movement towards a more "orderly" alignment of price levels. That is,

national price levels came to be explained to an increasing degree by our

structural variables. Most of that increase in orderliness took place before

the 1970's. The degree to which these structural variables explained price

levels remained roughly constant after that and even declined a bit in the

last period, 1981—83.

        The higher the real income per capita of a country, the higher was

its price level. In general, a greater degree of openness of an economy is

also associated with a higher price level, but there are indications that that
                                      — 33 —




 relationship   varies by income level. In poor countries, more openness is asso-

ciated with higher price levels; in rich countries with lower price levels.

         The coefficients of the structural equations changed substantially

over time, the most important change being a gradual increase in the coef-

ficient for real income per capita, at least through the end of the 1970's. We

have not so far been able to explain the changes in coefficients.

         Various tests suggest that equations including variables such as

these do provide better explanations of both price levels and changes in price

levels than do assumptions of equality of levels or of changes in them.

Furthermore,    deviations of price levels from the norms provided by these
equations are   associated with movements back towards the norms over intervals

of several years and even over periods of one or two decades.

         If the price level norms estimated from our equations are a better

approximation to long—term equilibrium levels than those implied by

purchasing jower parity theory, the deviations of actual PLs from their esti-

mated values should tend to be less persistent over time. This does prove to

be the case. The correlation between deviations from PPP in one period and in

other periods was still above .75 after 20 years or more, while that for

deviations from the structural equations were lower than that after five

years, and only ahout .20 after two decades. The persistence of deviations

from the equations seemed to he less under floating exchange rates than under

fixed exchange rates and least across the change in regimes.

        To the extent that the deviations      from our structural relationships
represent departures from sustainable long—term relationships, they might he
expected to influence trade flows. We   find   that, in fact, a high price level,
                                    — 34 —




relative   to the norm, was consistently associated with a decline in exports

relative to imports over the next decade or two, although many of the coef-

ficients were not significant. The relationship was much weaker and more erra-

tic, however, over three—year intervals.

           We do not imagine that the last word has been said on the specifica-

tion of the structural equation. The next steps include a search for explana-

tions of the residuals to the structural equations. As suggested, short—run

influences may be expected to account for some of the deviations of actual PLs

from those predicted by the structural equations. Their inclusion might

improve the estimates of the structural equations as well as help to explain

the deviations from them. The deviations that persist over many years, found

in this paper for a number of countries, may prove to be explicable in terms

of long—run   factors as yet unidentified. Finally, the residuals appear to
have   economic consequences, such as those on trade flows that deserve to be

investigated further.
