Intergenerational and Intragenerational Externalities of the Perry Preschool Project

JEL No. C4,I21

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of the iconic Perry Preschool Project on the children and siblings
of the original participants. The children of treated participants have fewer school suspensions,
higher levels of education and employment, and lower levels of participation in crime, compared
with the children of untreated participants. Impacts are especially pronounced for the children of
male participants. These treatment effects are associated with improved childhood home
environments. The intergenerational effects arise despite the fact that families of treated subjects
live in similar or worse neighborhoods than the control families. We also find substantial positive
effects of the Perry program on the siblings of participants who did not directly participate in the
program, especially for male siblings.

1     Introduction

This paper examines the impact of the Perry Preschool Project — an iconic early childhood pro-
gram — on the children of the original participants. We find significant beneficial intergenerational
treatment effects on their education, employment, and crime. This is likely a consequence of the
substantial improvement due to intervention in the lives of their parents through late midlife that
is documented in a companion paper (Heckman and Karapakula, 2019). Using data from a ran-
domized experiment,1 we establish that their parents, the original experimental subjects, in the
treatment group experienced significant reductions in criminal activity, enhancements in earnings
and employment, and better health, executive functioning, and socioemotional skills, compared to
those in the control group. Results are particularly strong for male parents.
    Our evidence on the outcomes of the original participants is noteworthy because of our fifty-
year follow-up. It enables us to measure the outcomes of their adult children. Our research con-
tributes to a limited literature on the intergenerational effects of early interventions.2
    While we do not conduct a comprehensive mediation analysis, we find suggestive evidence of
enhanced environments for the children of original treated participants. They grow up in more
stable two-parent families. Their parents have better socioemotional skills, earnings, and employ-
ment, and lower participation in crime. However, their childhood neighborhoods are no better and
arguably worse than those of the children of control participants. This provides some evidence
in support of the importance of family and relative unimportance of zip codes in explaining the
observed intergenerational program effects on the children of Perry participants. We also collected
data on the participants’ siblings who did not directly participate in the program. We find evidence
of beneficial intragenerational spillover effects, especially for male siblings.
    The plan of this paper is as follows. We first discuss features of the data on the children of par-
    1 The Perry Preschool Project was a randomized social experiment in the 1960s that aimed to study the lifetime
impacts of providing high-quality preschool experiences to socioeconomically and developmentally disadvantaged
African-American children. See Heckman and Karapakula (2019) for more details on the intervention.
    2 Barr and Gibbs (2018) and Rossin-Slater and Wüst (2018) study the intergenerational effects of nationwide early
childhood programs in the United States and Denmark, respectively, using non-experimental samples. Ours is the first
paper to use experimental data to assess second-generation benefits.

ticipants in Section 2. We propose solutions to address a major limitation of our data — while the
original participants were randomized into treatment, their children were not. Section 3 defines the
parameters we estimate and why they are useful, in light of data limitations. Section 4 discusses
our econometric methods. Section 5 addresses the potential problem of fertility choices by the
Perry participants on inference and finds evidence suggesting that it is not particularly important in
our sample. Section 6 presents our estimates of intergenerational externalities. Section 7 discusses
the early environments of the children of participants. Section 8 discusses the impact of the pro-
gram on the participants’ siblings who were not eligible to participate in the program. Section 9
concludes.



2     Data on the Second Generation of Perry Families

We collected longitudinal data on the the first generation of Perry participants.3 In their late midlife
survey, they were asked questions about their children and siblings. The survey took place over
three years: 2014, 2015, and 2016. As a result, we only have data on one cross-section of their
children (the second generation) collected in a particular time interval. Figure 1 shows the fre-
quency distribution of the children’s ages from the survey. Ages of the children over all interview
years range from 1 through 43 years with a mean of about 28 years. Since the survey of the origi-
nal participants spanned multiple years, information about children of the same birth year was not
necessarily collected in the same interview year. As a consequence, the distribution of the second
generation’s age at interview differs from the density of ages in 2016.4 The children’s ages in 2016
range from 2 to 44 with a mean of about 30 years. By 2016, less than 5% of the children were
under age 18 and less than 10% were below the age of 21. In contrast, at the time of the previ-
ous follow-up (around 2000), about 63% and 80% were under ages 18 and 21, respectively. As
a result, important educational and economic outcomes for most second-generation children were

survey of the original participants, who are the parents of the children studied here.

unrealized at that time. For this reason, previous Perry studies could not examine adult outcomes
of a substantial number of these children in detail.5

Note: This figure provides the sample size of the second-generation children in each age bin at the last follow-up.



    In the late midlife survey, there is information on the adult lives of a majority of the participants’
offspring. If the characteristics of participant families differ between treatment and control groups,
estimating intergenerational treatment effects solely on the basis of the randomized treatment status
of their parents is potentially misleading, due to parental choices about the timing of marriage and
fertility. To address this problem, we employ non-experimental methods.
    The data on the children of the original participants are not nearly as rich as the data on the
original participants.6 For the second-generation children, we only have categorical or binary data
on a small number of outcomes compared to those for the original participants. Nevertheless,
the data cover a variety of life domains and give a broad picture of the second generation’s out-
comes, including school suspensions, arrests, addiction, teenage pregnancy, health, education, and
employment.
    5 Only Schweinhart et al. (2005) report the outcomes of the children of participants using a limited sample of
second-generation children. The authors state that their data “do not lend themselves to between group comparisons.”
    6 We lack administrative crime data, job history data, biomeasures, and so on for the second generation.

∗ Note:These estimates of the intergenerational treatment effects are statistically significant at the 10% level using the
conservative worst-case test procedures developed in Heckman and Karapakula (2019).



    Figure 2 provides a simple summary of the statistically significant intergenerational treatment
effects (in terms of mean differences between the experimental groups) for age-based subgroups
of the second-generation children.7 As discussed later, our inferences about these effects survive
application of statistically conservative procedures. However, the information presented in Figure 2
alone does not sufficiently account for the problems created by the second-generation sampling
procedures. We now document how we address those issues.




    7 The control and treatment means in Figure 2 represent grand means of second-generation children’s outcomes,
averaged at the participant-level, in the respective experimental groups. Summaries of the first five outcomes and
those of the last four outcomes are computed using the subsamples of second-generation children aged 21 and above
and those aged 23 and above, respectively. Table 3 contains measures of statistical uncertainty for estimates of the
treatment effects. All of the treatment effects in Figure 2 are statistically significant at the 10% level using the worst-
case maximum p-values, which are conservative measures of statistical uncertainty (Heckman and Karapakula, 2019).
The results are robust to a variety of sensitivity checks discussed in the appendix.

3      Defining the Parameters of Interest

We define parameters that can feasibly be estimated given the sampling plan. Si (b) denotes whether
participant i had a child in year b.8 Bi = {b : Si (b) = 1} is the set of birth years of the i-th
participant’s children. Ci (b, a) denotes an outcome of interest at age a for the i-th participant’s
child born in year b. We define Di to be the treatment status of the original participant parent.
      Define Sid (b), Bdi , and Cid (b, a), respectively, as the counterfactual outcomes underlying partic-
ipant i’s observed outcomes Si (b), Bi , and Ci (b, a) when Di is fixed at d ∈ {0, 1}. The observed
outcomes for i are:
                                     Si (b) = (1 − Di ) Si0 (b) + Di Si1 (b),                                   (1)

                                          Bi = (1 − Di ) B0i + Di B1i ,                                         (2)

and
                                Ci (b, a) = (1 − Di ) Ci0 (b, a) + Di Ci1 (b, a).                               (3)

The treatment effect at age a for a child born in year b to original participant i is


                                       τi (b, a) = Ci1 (b, a) − Ci0 (b, a).                                     (4)


      With ideal data, it would be desirable to identify and estimate the parameter


                                      τ̄ (b, a) = E[τi (b, a) | Si (b) = 1],                                    (5)


the average treatment effect for the age-a outcome of a child born in year b, allowing for het-




    8 Weassume that only one child was born in year b and thus abstract away from the case of multiple births in the
same year, since this is not an issue in our data. Allowing for multiple births is straightforward.

                                                         7
erogeneity in the treatment effect by age and birth cohort.9 However, we only observe the child’s
outcomes in one of the three interview years. Thus, in the best case, we can only identify outcomes
for the years and ages we observe: Ci (Ii − a, a), where Ii ∈ {2014, 2015, 2016} is the interview
year and Ii − a = bi for bi ∈ Bi , the set of birth years actually sampled.10
    Because of sample limitations, it is necessary to make certain simplifications. For example,
suppose that an age-a outcome is constant across birth cohorts so that Ci (Ii − a, a) = C̃i (a) across
the interview years. It then follows that the parameter τ̄ (I − a, a) can be identified at age a on the
common support of the child’s age at follow-up available for the interview years I.11 Figures 2
through 24 in the appendix display estimates of this parameter assuming that the fertility decisions
of participants are unrelated to treatment. However, due to small cell sizes, the estimates of this
parameter are imprecise and sensitive to the choice of the estimator used.
    Given these data limitations, we instead estimate an alternative feasible parameter. Suppose
that the outcome of interest is teenage pregnancy, which by definition can be measured for all
children aged 19 or older. One parameter of interest is the average treatment effect on teenage
pregnancy for children whose age at interview is at least 19.12 Figure 3 shows the pattern of our
available data using a Lexis diagram of I × b cells, where I is the interview year and b is the birth
year, with observable teenage pregnancy outcomes. In this diagram, children born in 1998 or later
have not had a chance to realize their full potential teenage pregnancy outcomes, regardless of the
interview year. Those born in 1997 and 1996 have had that opportunity if their interview years


    9 This  is a standard parameter defined in the literature (see Heckman, 1979; Lee, 2009). One might also be inter-
ested in conditional average treatment effects based on characteristics such as child’s gender. We suppress conditioning
variables for simplicity of notation, but not in constructing our estimates. There are a variety of other interesting pa-
rameters, such as τ̃ (a) = E[max{Ci1 (a, b) : b ∈ B1i } − max{Ci0 (a, b) : b ∈ B0i } | |B1i | ≥ 1, |B0i | ≥ 1], the average
difference in the best child outcomes between the treatment regimes. Similarly, one could look at the average treatment
effect on the worst outcomes by replacing max with min in the previous definition. Estimates of these parameters are
explored in Tables 32 through 70 of the appendix.
    10 In practice, the outcomes of all of participant’s children are not always recorded for various reasons. For example,
the design of the interview limits the number of children surveyed to 5 for those participants with more than five
children.
    11 Identification is subject to the assumptions on the relationship between fertility decisions S (b) and treatment.
                                                                                                      i
    12 While the age limit in the example is 19, this choice is arbitrary in general, as one may choose to analyze
pregnancy up to age 20 or age 18 instead, for instance. The key notion is that it is defined for an age where subjects
have completed the process being studied.

estimate is the average treatment effect for the second-generation children in the cells with solid
circles.

Note: This Lexis diagram represents the birth year b along the horizontal axis and the interview year I along the vertical
axis. A hollow circle indicates that the individuals in the cell do not have a completely realized teenage pregnancy
outcome. A solid circle indicates that the individuals in the cell have a realized teenage pregnancy outcome.


    Thus in general for a given lower limit a∗ on child’s age (19 in the case of teenage pregnancy),
our parameter of interest is:


                                       τ̄a∗ = E[τ̄ (b, Ii − b) | Ii − b ≥ a∗ ],                                       (6)


where b is the child’s birth year, Ii is the interview year, and Ii − b is the age at interview. This
parameter is most meaningful for outcomes such as teenage pregnancy which have the property
that the event necessarily occurs at or before age a∗ and cannot occur afterwards, i.e., Ci (b, a) =
Ci (b, a∗ ) for all a ≥ a∗ . The parameter is also meaningful for outcomes such as graduation from
regular high school without suspension by age 21, even though there may be rare cases where the
child may have graduated from regular high school after age 21 but before the year of interview.
The parameter is less meaningful for outcomes such as crime and employment at ages beyond
those surveyed. Nonetheless, τa∗ is still interpretable as an average effect in the subsample of
second-generation children measured at the time of the survey.
   13 Thus, there are two main factors determining whether the outcome is realized:  timing of fertility and childbearing
of the original participants, determining whether a second-generation child is too young to have a realized outcome;
and the choice of the year made by the interviewer to administer the survey to a first-generation participant. In the
next section, we account for these factors affecting non-response in estimating the intergenerational treatment effects.

4      Estimating Treatment Effects

We estimate average intergenerational treatment effects based on the outcome equation:


                            Ci (b, a) = α + β Di + γ 0 Zi + δ 0 Wi (b, a) + εi (b, a),                                  (7)


where Di is the treatment status of the original participant i, Zi is the vector of his or her pre-
program covariates,14 Wi (b, a) is the vector of characteristics of the child born in year b at age a,
and εi (b, a) = νi + ui (b, a), where νi represents a fixed effect for original participant i, and ui (b, a)
is an error term specific to the birth cohort and age of the child.15
     The treatment effect parameter in equation (7) is simple to estimate in the relevant subsample
of the original participants under the assumption that the participant fertility choices are unaffected
                                                  ⊥ Di ,16 if we ignored the covariate vectors Zi and
by treatment, i.e., Bi ⊥⊥ Di , and that εi (b, a) ⊥
Wi (b, a).17 We could simply take the difference in the means of the treatment and control groups
for the outcome C̄i , where C̄i is the average of all non-missing outcomes Ci (b, a) that satisfy our
sample inclusion criteria such that Ii − b ≥ a∗ . This would be equivalent to a simple between-
effects estimator of equation (7) for the relevant subsample. We could also add back and control
for Zi using ordinary least squares.
     Let Ri indicate whether C̄i can, in principle, be constructed in the available data. The afore-
mentioned estimators necessarily only use the subsample of participants with Ri = 1. They do
not take into account three distinct sources of non-response that produce Ri = 0. The first source
is whether or not the original participant was interviewed in the late midlife survey. Let R1i = 1

    14 The pre-program covariates include Stanford–Binet IQ, an index of socioeconomic status, sex, and mother’s
working status at program entry.
    15 Note that in theory it is possible to allow the model parameters to vary by age and birth cohort so that they are all
indexed by (b, a).
    16 An interpretation of this assumption is that ν , which includes time-invariant residual parental investments com-
                                                       i

parental investments (after accounting for Di , Zi , and Wi (b, a)), are orthogonal to the treatment status.

stronger assumption.

denote if so; R1i = 0 if not. The second source is whether the participant has at least one child in
the relevant age group as of 2016 given that R1i = 1. Let R2i = 1 denote that the second condition
is met, and R2i = 0 otherwise. The third requirement is that C̄i is observed for participants with
children in the relevant age group. Let R3i = 1 if participant i is in this condition, and R3i = 0
otherwise. Thus, a person is in our sample or not depending on Ri = R1i · R2i · R3i . We account for
these three sources of sample inclusion using a form of inverse probability weighting.18
     The estimator we use to construct the main estimates reported in this paper assumes that (i)
    ⊥ R1i | Di , Zi , (ii) C̄i ⊥⊥ R2i | R1i = 1, Di , Zi , and (iii) C̄i ⊥
C̄i ⊥                                                                    ⊥ R3i | R2i = 1, R1i = 1, Di , Zi .19
We use the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) estimator of the intergenerational

   18 See, e.g., Huber (2014).
   19 Part (i) of the assumption states that the outcome is independent of the interview status conditional on the treat-
ment status and pre-program covariates. Part (ii) of the assumption states that fertility and childbearing behaviors
are independent of the intergenerational outcome conditional on the interview and treatment statuses and pre-program
covariates. Part (iii) of the assumption states that any remaining reasons for a missing outcome, including decisions of
the interviewer such as timing of the interview and the design of the survey, are conditionally independent of the inter-
generational outcome. The estimator also assumes conditional independence of the counterfactual outcomes and the
treatment status, i.e., (C̄i 1 , C̄i 0 ) ⊥⊥ Di | Zi , where C̄i d is the counterfactual version of C̄i when Di is fixed at d ∈ {0, 1}.
This assumption is valid because of the random assignment of the treatment status conditional on pre-program vari-
ables. Additionally, for computational ease, we assume that study participants do not engage in sex-selective abortion.
This assumption may be controversial for certain cultures, but we believe this assumption holds among the original
participants.

estimator is known to have a double robustness property. It is robust to misspecification of either
the weighting denominator or the counterfactual outcome models.22 The estimates reported in the
text are based on this estimator. In the appendix, we present estimates based on difference-in-
means and ordinary least squares, as well as those based on standard sample selection models.23
    We apply the small-sample statistical methods developed in our companion paper (Heckman
and Karapakula, 2019) to make the inferences reported in this paper. In that paper we show that
conclusions based on conventional inferential procedures can be misleading. Appendix 2 reports
twelve different one-sided single p-values for each of the estimates of the treatment effect on out-
comes we consider. In the text of this paper, we present two of the twelve p-values associated with
our preferred AIPW estimator. The first is the conventional asymptotic p-value.24 Our companion
paper (Heckman and Karapakula, 2019) finds that the asymptotic p-values tend to overstate the
   21 All   of the denominator probabilities for sample inclusion use a logit specification and are estimated with Green-
land and Mansournia’s (2015) penalized maximum likelihood method, which avoids the problem of separation in finite
samples. We use a gender-specific logit specification to estimate λ12i and λ02i .
    22 See Kang and Schafer (2007), Lunceford and Davidian (2004), and Robins et al. (1994). We use a slightly
different form of inverse probability weighting in our companion paper (Heckman and Karapakula, 2019).
    23 Tables 22 through 31 of the appendix contain these alternative estimates. For each subsample of the second-
generation children, Tables 22 through 30 of the appendix report results using the two-step estimator (Heckman, 1979),
series estimator (Das et al., 2003), lower limit of Lee (2009) bounds, random-effects estimator, and pooled OLS. The
two-step and the series estimators do not use exclusion restrictions and are thus limited. The series estimator uses a
linear specification for the outcome equation with regressors including the probability of having a child (in the relevant
age group) and its square as well as the pre-program covariates. Lee (2009) bounds use OLS-based imputation for
missing outcomes for participants with children in the relevant age group. While these bounds are valid under weaker
assumptions than the previous estimators, they do not incorporate pre-program variables except for gender. The
random-effects and pooled OLS estimators in these tables do not incorporate child- and age-specific regressors. In
addition to these estimates, the tables also present heterogeneous treatment effects based on birth order of the children
using the between-effects estimator. Table 31 of the appendix presents random-effects and between-effects estimators
that include as regressors the following variables: child’s gender, child’s age at interview and age in 2016, participant’s
total number of biological children, and the participant’s pre-program variables. Additionally, Tables 68 through 70 of
the appendix report estimates from between-effects regressions for which the specification of the outcome equation is
quadratic in the participant’s total number of children, serving as a size-bias correction that adjusts for differences in
family sizes.
    24 It is equal to Φ(−|t̂|), where Φ is the standard normal distribution function, and t̂ is the standardized estimate
(based on the custer-robust asymptotic standard error, accounting for dependence between original participants within
the same family).

statistical significance of estimates. In that paper, we use the available partial knowledge of the
randomization protocol to identify the worst-case (least favorable) p-values based on randomiza-
tion tests. In this paper, we report a version called the “worst-case maximum p-value”25 based on
the studentized test statistic. In the appendix, we also report adjusted p-values based on multiple
hypothesis tests developed by Holm (1979) and Romano and Wolf (2005).



5       Fertility Decisions of the Perry Participants

The endogeneity of fertility decisions of the original participants might confound any estimated
treatment effects. If treated parents have fertility much later in life or have fewer children, samples
of the second-generation treatment and control children could be fundamentally altered. Since any
differences in the fertility patterns between the experimental treatment and control groups can bias
simple estimators of the second-generation treatment effects, it is important to examine how the
childbearing in the treatment group differs from that in the control group, and to account for these
using methods developed in the previous section. In this section, we show that this is not a major

     The estimates in Table 2 show that the average age at which the participants have the first child
does not differ significantly between the experimental groups. There also do not appear to be statis-
tically significant treatment effects on the average age at which participants had children. However,
the age at birth of the last child is significantly higher for treated women than for untreated women.
This could potentially create imbalances in the composition of the second-generation children of
the treated and untreated families within various age ranges. We account for the effect of this im-
balance using the weighting methods developed in the previous section. Doing so only has a minor
effect on estimates by and large.

of never having been suspended from school, compared with their counterparts in the control
group. The same is also true for graduation from regular high school or any other type of high
school without suspension. This finding is relevant given that African-American students currently
represent 38.7% of students suspended from public schools nationwide, even though they comprise
only 15.5% of all public school students.26 Additionally, this finding is relevant because taxpayers
benefit when educational attainment of children increases, and because high economic and social
costs are associated with high school dropouts.27 The treatment effect on the probability of never
having been arrested or suspended is lower but still sizable, at about 20 percentage points.
     We also find large effects (more than 30 percentage points) on the probability of the children
of original participants being employed with regular or any high school diploma. The treatment
effect on full-time- or self-employment is about 26 percentage points and that on employment with
some college experience is about 23 percentage points. The results on employment taken with the
results on suspensions suggest that the children of subjects in the treatment group likely earn more

     Considering only the outcomes of the male children of participants, we find substantial treat-
ment effects on being in good health, graduating from college, and being employed, as shown in
Table 4. There are also treatment effects on being employed with some college experience, and on


    28 See   Heckman et al. (2018).

                                                                         16
being employed at least as a high school graduate, suggesting that the male children in the treated
families likely have higher earnings than their control group counterparts.
     However, the intergenerational effects reported in Table 3 do not arise solely from the treatment
effects for male children. Many of the results regarding school suspensions come mainly from the
female children of the original participants. Table 5 shows that female children are much more
likely to graduate from regular or any high school without suspension and then to find employment
later. Table 6 shows that these effects mainly arise for the female children of the male participants.

We do not find any effects on the female children of the female participants.
     In contrast, there are significant treatment effects on the male children of the male participants.
Table 7 shows that for these children, there is about a 21 percentage point difference between the
experimental groups in the probability of never having being arrested. About 8% of the second-
generation male children of the male participants in the treatment group are employed college
graduates compared to none in the control group. About 26% of those in the treated families are
employed with some college experience, while no such children exist in the untreated families.

labeled untreated mean and treated mean contain the means of the participants in the control and treatment groups for the second-generation children
(of the original Perry participants) associated with each variable (averaged at the participant-level), respectively. The column labeled AIPW estimate
contains the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) treatment effect estimate (accounting for non-response, imbalance in participants’
preprogram covariates between the experimental groups, and participants’ fertility differences in having a child in the specified age group). The
column labeled asymptotic p-value contains the corresponding one-sided asymptotic p-value based on studentized test statistic using the analytic
standard error. The column labeled worst-case max. p contains the worst-case maximum p-value based on approximate randomization tests using
the studentized AIPW test statistic.




7       Home Environments of the Second Generation

To understand the sources of the substantial intergenerational treatment effects just reported, we
examine home environments of the second-generation children. Some recent discussions highlight
the role of neighborhoods in shaping children’s outcomes (Chetty et al., 2018; Chetty and Hendren,
2018a,b). Another large literature in social science (Almond et al., 2018; Currie and Almond, 2011;
Heckman, 2008) points to the role of family structure and family resources in shaping children’s
outcomes. In this section, we show that the treated Perry participants provide their children more
stable two-parent homes. The children of the treated participants excel in various life domains de-
spite growing up in neighborhoods that are similar to or slightly worse off than the neighborhoods


                                                                         19
of the control group. The evidence in this section suggests that the home environment matters more
than the neighborhood in explaining the intergenerational program effects on the adult outcomes
of the children of the Perry participants.


7.1    Childhood Family Environments of the Second-Generation Children

Figure 4 shows that the treated Perry men are more likely to be stably married over their life course.
We define a stable marriage as one in which the couple was separated for no more than six months
regardless of the length of marriage.29 The higher stable marriage rate of the treated Perry men
is likely related to their higher levels of socioemotional skills and executive functioning compared
with the untreated men that we document in our companion paper (Heckman and Karapakula,
2019). The stable-marriage rate of the treated men rises through their thirties. It declines slightly

between the treated and untreated female participants. As a consequence, we are also unable to
detect significant treatment effects on the amount of time the children of the female participants



                                                                            21
spend with their parents until age 18.
    Table 12 shows that the children of the treated male participants have more income resources
during their childhoods in terms of parental earnings than their control group counterparts.30 This
is associated with the higher earnings that treated male participants experience in their late twenties
and thirties, while engaging less in criminal activity, possibly because of their higher levels of
executive functioning and socioemotional skills (Heckman and Karapakula, 2019). These patterns
are broadly consistent with the fact that there are more substantial intergenerational treatment
effects on the children of the male participants than on the children of the female participants.


7.2     Neighborhoods of the Perry Families

We examine the neighborhoods of the Perry families. An influential literature emphasizes the role
of neighborhoods in determining intergenerational mobility.31 We find no significant treatment
effects on the choice of the neighborhoods by male participants (around age forty) along several
dimensions.32 These are neighborhoods the children of the participants plausibly grew up in, so
the children of both treated and untreated male participants appear to have grown up in similar
neighborhoods. Even so, there are substantial intergenerational treatment effects on the children
of the male participants, as documented in the previous section.
    On the other hand, the children of the treated and untreated female participants on average
grow up in different neighborhoods. Compared to the neighborhoods of the control group women,
the neighborhoods of the treated women are worse in several dimensions having fewer two-parent
homes, lower median household income, lower median family income, and higher poverty among
families with children, as documented in Table 13. Nonetheless, there are significant beneficial
intergenerational treatment effects on the male children of the treated women.33


   30 We do not have data on the characteristics of the spouses of the participants, so we are unable to analyze the total
household income resources during childhood for the second-generation children.
   31 See Chetty et al. (2018); Chetty and Hendren (2018a,b).
   32 See Appendix 12.
   33 Table 82 in the appendix shows that the adverse neighborhood effects documented in Table 13 are mostly con-
centrated on the female participants’ male children, who nevertheless experience intergenerational treatment effects.

probability weighting (AIPW) treatment effect estimate. The column labeled asymptotic p-value contains the corresponding one-sided asymptotic
p-value based on studentized test statistic using the analytic standard error. The column labeled worst-case max. p contains the worst-case maximum
p-value based on approximate randomization tests using the studentized AIPW test statistic.



     Overall, the children of the treated participants are better off with respect to various life out-
comes in spite of growing up in neighborhoods that are no better than neighborhoods of the control
group members. The evidence in this section combined with that in the previous section suggests
that conducive childhood home environments may have reversed any adverse neighborhood effects
experienced by the children of the treated participants.



8       Effects on Siblings of the Participants

A byproduct of the survey at late midlife is information asked of the original participants on the
outcomes of their siblings. We examine the effects of treatment on the siblings of the original
participants who did not themselves participate in the experiment.34 (Siblings eligible for partic-
ipation in the program when the program was conducted were enrolled as participants.) We do

a documentation of negative spillover effects on the siblings of participants of an early childhood program in India
using a non-experimental sample.

families were enrolled in the experiment. However, we find treatment effects for the siblings of the
participants who were present at baseline but not eligible to directly participate in the experiment.
Table 14 shows that such pre-program siblings, who were present before their families joined the
experiment, belonging to the treatment group are more likely to graduate from regular high school
and be employed than the pre-program siblings of the untreated participants.

     As displayed in Table 15, these effects are mostly concentrated in the sample of male pre-
program siblings. The male pre-program siblings of the treated are also more likely to be never
arrested or addicted compared to those related to the control group. We do not find statistically
significant effects on other subgroups of pre-program siblings.

9    Conclusion

This paper estimates the intergenerational and intragenerational externalities of the Perry Preschool
Project and finds that they are of first-order importance. Using the experimental sample of the Perry
participants, we present the first experimentally based evidence on the program’s spillover effects
on the children and siblings of the participants. Spillover treatment effects are especially strong
for the male children and siblings of the participants. We also find strong intergenerational effects
on both female and male children of the male participants. Though we do not conduct a thorough
mediation analysis, we note that the second-generation children in the treatment group grew up in
stable two-parent homes with more parental income resources during childhood. We find intergen-
erational effects despite the fact that the treated families live in similar or worse neighborhoods
than the untreated families. This evidence suggests that family structure is likely more important
than neighborhoods in accounting for the intergenerational treatment effects on the Perry families.
The program’s externalities spanning multiple generations likely represent a non-negligible por-
tion of the true rate of return to targeted high-quality preschool programs. Our findings suggest
that these programs can contribute to lifting multiple generations out of poverty.
