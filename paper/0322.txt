      NON-TRIVIAL EQUILIBRIUM IN AN ECONOMY WITH STOCHASTIC RATIONING

                        Seppo Honkapohja and Takatoshi Ito




                                     Abstract

       Stochastic rationing when the market does not clear draws attention

because both Drèze (1975) and Benassy (1975) quantity-constrained equilibria

have some undesirable features. Gale (1978) gave the existence proof of

trade under uncertainty. His stochastic rationing depends on all the indivi-

dual effective demands. It is too vague to characterize a rationing mechanism.

Moreover, his assumption to ensure a non-trivial equilibrium is economically

not clear.

       In this paper we extend Green (1978) to characterizing the rationing

scheme as the individual effective demand times the rationing number which is a

function of the aggregate quantity signals. We also construct an economy with

money and overlapping generations. We show the existence of the non—trivial

equilibrium and provide an example of a non-Wairasian equilibriim at the

Walrasjan :equi1ibn.um prices.

1. Introduction

       One of the key features in the disequilibrium theory is to face the

fact that trades take place before all the markets clear through the

Walrasian tatonnement process. Moreover, we usually assume the fixed price

and the quantity adjustments in the short run. By quantity adjustments we

mean the revision of individual optimization plans taking into account the

quantity constraints in some markets. However, there are several ways how to

formulate this process. Drèze (1975) defined the effective demands as the

optimal quantity to maximize utility with quantity limit (the upper and lower

bounds). Within the bounds you can trade as much as you want. Therefore,

there are no excess effective demand or supply left in the Dfeze equilibrium.

This is unsatisfactory when we discuss disequilibrium measures such as un-

employment and excess capacity of plants. Benassy (1975) proposed the effective

demand for the ith good as the amount of the ith good which maximizes the

utility given the quantity constraints in all the markets other than the ith.

Since economic agents have to solve the different maximization problems as

many times as the number of the commodities, the budget constraint does not

hold in the effective demand level. This is not satisfactory from the view-

point of rationality.

      The undesirable features in the Drze or Benassy equilibrium lead

researchers to investigate the so-called stochastic rationing schemes. The

realization after the announcement of the effective demands are stochastic.

Svensson (l977)discussed a stochastic rationing scheme and individual decision

making but he did not proceed to establish the market expectational equi-

librium which guarantees the rationing scheme is correct in the statistical

sense in the market.
                                                                             1—2




       Douglas Gale (1977) and Jerry Green (1978) gave the most general

treatment of the stochastic rationing equilibria, where individuals in the

pure exchange economy have the probability distributions on the realization

of his effective demands. With some conditions on the expectation of

rationing given the actions taken by other agents Gale and Green showed

the existence of the stochastic rationing equilibria.

       Although their equilibria show that the budget constraint should be

met in the effective demand level, it does not mean the stochastically

realized trade is such that everybody balance the budget. Moreover, Gale

showed the existence of the non-trivial equilibria, but the sufficient condition

is rather vague to be meaningfully interpreted, where the trivial equilibrium

is the no-action equilibrium.

       In this paper, we specify our economy as an overlapping generations

model with production and the government. We impose the ex post budget

constraint and the ex post production constraint rather than ones in terms of

effective demands. This gives the possibility of discussion of disequilibrium

dynamics in the long-run. We also show a meaningful sufficient condition

for the non-trivial equilibria.


       This framework has also am interesting feature that there may exist

a non-Walrasian equilibrium at the Wairasian equilibrium prices, even though

expectations and agents are perfectly (trational.?? This is confirmed by a

numerical example in the appendix. Note that in our framework, this phenomenon

is caused by the pure pessimism, in contrast to Heller and Starr (1979) whose

example of the same effect is not quite correct in that they allow the money

endowments to vary (hence money prices are 'wrong' though relative prices of

goods are correct.")

        Temporary equilibrium mod&Ls withir overlapping generations have

been studied by Grandmont and Laroque (1973), Fuchs and Laroque (1976),

and Fuchs (1976). They assume that prices move fast enough to clear

the spot markets within a period. They define the stationary market equilibrium

of the series of prices for the relevant length of time generating the present

expected price equal to that price. They showed the conditions for the existence

of the stationary market equilibrium; its Pareto efficiency, the local

stability of the economy near the equilibrium with respect to the charac-

teristics of its agents and a money stock; and the structural stability with

 respect to the expectations.

2. Framework and Notations

       Our economy is composed of four different types of economic agents:

H consumers in each of the young and old generation; firms; and the govern-

ment. There are I different consumption goods and one type of factor of

production named labor. The government issues money which is used as the

medium of exchange and as the store of value. A young consumer is endowed with

no initial money balance and the positive potential labor force. The young

supplies labor, demands consumption goods and saves for the next period. An

older consumer with carried-over money balance does not work any more but

just consumes before the end of the life. Each of I consumption goods are

produced by F identical firms. The production technology of each industry

is characterized by a well-behaved neo—classical production function, f'(.)

       The prices of the consumption goods, (P1,           ,         and the nominal
                                                   P2          P1)
wage, w, are fixed within a period. The aggregate demand and supply Isignals?!

for each market,      are announced and distributed among the economic agents

without costs. Y and           denote the aggregate demand and supply signal in

the ith market, respectively, and Ld and LS denote those of the labor market,

respectively. According to the aggregate signals and the individual effective

demand (or supply), the economic agent faces the stochastic rationing of trade.

An individual agent is assumed to take the aggregate signals as given and to

think that his individual effective demand is so small compared to the market

signals thatchange in his own individual effective demand is negligible. This

assumption is similar to the price-taker assumption in the Walrasian economy.

The realization of trades occur after all the economic agents submit their

effective demands and supplies. The stochastic rationing mechanism will be

defined in the next section.
                                                                                  2-2



          Let us sketch the economic agents decision-making. Consuiners,whether

they are young or old, maximize their expected utility. Older consumers,

(   k =   1,...,   H )       plan   which goods they should order out of the pre-

determined money balance which is the consequence of the preceding period.

Young consumers (h = 1,         ..., H) have to take into account the possibility of

future rationing as well as the present one. A consumer, h, submits his

effective demand for the ith, consumption goods, y, and his effective supply

of labor, ,        after   maximizing the expected utility function with the budget

contraint in the "worst" case of rationing possibility. Therefore, the

effective demand (or supply) is the amount up to which the consumer is "ready"

to buy (or sell). Since an older consumer is not allowed to work, a younger

consumer plans the non-negative money balance for all possible cases of ration-

ing.

          A firm, f,-in the ith      industry   which is assumed to be risk-neutral

maximizes its expected profit. It submits the effective demand for labor,

       and the effective supply of the consumption goods, y         .   The effective

demand for labor and the effective supply of the goods have to be technologi-

cally possible in the "worst" rationing case, i.e., the maximum possible

assignment of sales and the minimum assignment of hiring labor. Therefore,

the effective demand and supply are again the amounts that the firm is "ready"
to accept.
          Since all the markets meet simultaneously,the effective demand and
supply    is final once they are submitted. The origin is assumed to be included

in the production possibility set, hence the firms never plan the negative

expected profit. However, the realization of events may be such that a firm

incurs losses from hoarding the excess labor relative to restrictive rationing
                                                                                                   2-3



on sales. Considering that some firms do make losses in the real world, we

do not think this is a bad assumption. We assume that all the realized profits

and losses are taxed or subsidized by the government. Therefore, the only

store of value available for the young generation is money. The government

demands the constant amount of the consumption goods (y, y, ..., y)and

labor services

       A temporary equilibrium with stochastic rationing, given the fixed prices,

is defined as the signals of aggregate demands and supplies which induce economic

agents to submit individual effective demands and supplies which exactly summed

up to the signals.

signals with the following conditions:

               =            y(a)                                        where y(a)

      In this kind of expectational equilibrium, we usually have the trivial

equilibrium of no-action (see Gale (1977), the last section). That is, if

the signals show zero aggregate demand and supply, then individuals feel they

cannot sell anything. This gives zero purchasing power and zero effective

demands. Therefore, the signals with zero demand and supply are confirmed as

an equilibrium. We are going to show that the existence of government and

the old generation with sure purchasing power, the rationing probability

distribution function bounded away from zero, and the well-behaved production

functions are enough to prove that the trivial equilibrium vanishes.

3. Stochastic Rationing

       Let us describe the stochastic rationing scheme we are going to adopt.

The firm announces its "effective demand't for labor,      and its "effective

supply" of the ith consumption goods, y. The consumer announces his

"effective demand" for the consumption goods, (y1, y,                and his
                                                        ...,
                                                               y')
"effective supply" of labor, h Since the prices are fixed during the period

there is stochastic rationing in the market to make trades feasible.

Rationing is an assignment of trade, which is called "realization," by random

drawing according to a known distribution. We are going to adopt the following

axioms established by Green (1978):


I)   The probability distribution of rationing to the jth agent in the ith (or

     labor) market depends only on the jth effective demand (or supply) and the

     quantity signals of the ith market. That is, the distribution is indepen-

     dent across the markets. Moreover, the distributions are the same if

     the agents in the same market offer the same effective demand (or supply).

II) Rationing does not change the side of the market i.e., a demander remains

     buying the goods, and a supplier selling the goods.

III) Agents are not forced to buy (or sell) more than the amount they announce

     as the effective demand (or supply).


IV) The mean of the probability distribution of rationing balances demand

     and supply.


V)   The probability distribution of rationing is continuous when endowed

     with the topology of weakly convergence.
                                                                               3-2



          The fourth condition requires that the realized trade balances only

its "mean." It is debatable whether we can actually devise a rationing scheme

which balances "realized" aggregate demand with supply "with certainty"

keeping individual rationing stochastic. We will come back to this point

later.

          The fifth condition is the standard technical assumption.

          Green showed that the rationing scheme satisfying the above axioms is

representable in the following form:



                  .f
                 y. =
                            f-f
                           y.1
                                  f

                                          d

                                              S
                                             Y.)
                   1             1   1    1   1


                            h .h     h
                                         \'d
                  -h                                   s
                       =
                                 s
    (3.    1)
                  -f =      f -.f    f    d            s
                                         L
                           J s                 ,   L       )




                       =h h              Ld, LS)




where       and y are the effective supply from firm f, and the effective demand

from household h in the ith consumption goods market; 4        is   the effective labor

demand from the firm f in the ith industry; and h is the effective labor

from household h;          are stochastic functions depending on the individual effec-

tive demand and the market quantity signals. The stochastic rationing functions

have the means which are independent of the induvidual offers.

          Notice that all the firms in the ith industry are identical in the

production function and behavior. Therefore, we have the following simplified

stochastic rationing function:
                                                                              3-3


         -.f      £ -f          d     s
         yi =    y. s.     (Y., Y.)



We also assume the similar rationing function on the other side of the market

and also in the labor market. There we have



               -f =       f -f        d    S
                                    (Y    Y1)


               h          h h d            s
                            i (Y1, ,)
  (3,   1')


               4 = 4 4 (Ld,               LS)



                                    (Ld, LS)




This is an ad hoc assumption, which implies that an economic agent expects

the proportional rationing independent of his action.

        In order to ensure the axioms above, we have certain requirements on

the supports of the probability distributions.



Assumption 3.1


               o <        <1                    V, Vf with probability one

               o<    s.                                           .

                                                   h' with probability one


               o <
                     4<     1                   V, Vf. with probability one



               0 <        <1                    V, h' with probability one

This assumption ensures axioms II) and III). The next assumption implies

axiom IV).

      Although Assumption 3.1 is necessary to ensure the axioms II) and III),

it seems too weak an assumption to derive a meaningful equilibrium. The com-

bination of this assumption with the budget constraint and the production

feasibility in the "worst" cases will end up with the trivial equilibrium. We

are going to assume stronger assumptions about the response of distributions

to the aggregate signals.

     A usual assumption in the disequilibrium macroeconomics is that the

trade is realized at the short side of the market. This assumption implies

that the probability distribution is degenerate at unity for agents in the

short side of the market. For example, suppose that the excess demand

prevai1s in the ith market. And as the disequilibrium deepens, the

long side anticipates the "worse" distribution. We are going to characterize
                                                                                       3-5



this idea by putting restrictions on the upper bound and the lower bound

of the support of the probability distribution. The following are the

assumptions on rationing that the firm faces.



Assumption 3.3


                                                    with probability one

          (i)

                          =   g(Ld,   LS) > 0        ,      with   strict inequality
                                                               if LS >   U


                          =
                              h'(Y, Y)      <   1


        (iii)

                          =
                              h(Ld,   L5) <     i

         (iv)    Functions g and h are continuous with respect to their

                 arguments.



Assumption 3.4



                        f         -f
                      (s.)      E(s.)

                                E(s.)
                                                                                      3-6



where


            £

          (S)m = mZ(Ld,     LS)   ,   continuous with respect to its arguments




Example

          We will give an example of a rationing scheme in an economy where

all firms in an industry and all consumers are identical. The following

rationing scheme preserves the equal treatment of individuals (i.e., the

name does not matter), rational expectations on the quantity rationing scheme,

the randomness for individuals; and balances of the aggregate demand and

supply not only in the mean but also in realization with probability one.

The rationing scheme also preserves the above-mentioned assumptions on the

support of the distribution.

        Take the representative firm in the ith consumption good market:

his stochastic realization of supply, y is now the effective demand multi-

plied by a stochastic "rationing number" s which depends on the market

signals.           is distributed uniformly between       and      in the following

manner: (we omit the obvious subscripts and superscripts here)



          s=l                                   ifYd/Y5>l

            =    1/2 +   (d/2S)                 if    (1/2)   <   d1s       1



            =    3d12s                          if                      <   1/2

        Sm = min(Yd/YS,     1)                       d1s >
         3-7




C
    -s
                                                                                          3-8



              1




          =   -1/2    +     3d12s                if            1/2 <         <1

          =   d12s                               if            0 <   Y/Y <   1/2


        We also need one technical assumption. There is an even number of

firms. Now we explain the procedure of rationing. Suppose the market signal,

         is less than one.            (I) First stage is to make the lottery tickets

stochastically: we are going to create F (an even number of firms) tickets.

For the first ticket, draw a random number between s and s. The second

ticket is s
              m
                  +   (sm   -   n 1 where n 1 is the number of the first ticket. Repeat
                                  )



this process F/2 times; (II) The second stage is the random drawing to decide the

ordering of firms to draw the prepared tickets; (III) The third stage is that

the first firm decided by the second stage draw randomly one ticket from the

urn   prepared    by the first stage, and the drawn ticket is removed from the

urn. Repeat the process F times to exhaust firms and tickets.

        By the first stage, the sum of the rationing tickets add up to

sF FY'/Y with certainty. Each firm                    is   assumed to submit the same effective
        f                               .  .   .
demand y. That means that the actual rationing is Fy Y /Y . From the
                                                                       fds
definition of temporary equilibrium with stochastic rationing,                     yf =

Therefore, the aggregate realization of rationing is always d That is,
the rationing scheme balances the aggregate demand and supply in realization

with probability one. However, from the individual point of view, the ration-

ing is stochastic and the distribution of rationing number is exactly ex-

plained above. Although the third stage of drawing means that a distribu-

tion of rationing tickets is dependent on other drawings, the second stage
                                                                                3-9



erases this problem. Hence, the identical distribution of rationing with

anonymity as a whole system is preserved.

      Note also that            s, and s are continuous with respect to d and

yS for d > 0 and       >   0,   and satisfy assumptions made.

4. The Firms' Behavior

         There are F firms in each of I industries of consumption goods.

All the firms in the ith industry are identical. The representative firm f

in the ith industry produces output                     by the actual labor input 4

         The production technology is represented by the neoclassical production

function with the following properties:


Assumption 4.1

         By the actual input, 4 ,        the   firm      can produce the actual output,
y. ,   which   is



         f1(f) i 1—
                 >y 0    >                     for
                                                           i— 0
                                                             >          V.
                                                                         i Vf -

Assumption 4.2


        f'(O) = 0                         V.        -




        The first assumption means there is no technological externality. The

second assumption means that we cannot produce anything without inputs, or

that no action is possible.



Assumption 4.3


        fI(2..)
               f .is                 .          .
                       a concave and increasing function.

or alternatively,
                                                                           42

Assumption 4.3'



         f1(f)   is   a strictly concave and increasing function.



Assumption 4.4 [Well behavednessj



          (i) There exists a continuous first derivatives for f', V.



         (ii)     f        (0) =

        (iii)     f'() =        0



        These are the standard neo-classical assumptions on a production

function.

        Now we can set up the maximization problem. The representative firm's

decision is to maximize the expected profit:



(4.1)                 Max E(p.
                            11 -           w)1
                  yi,i               -




                      subject   to



(4.2)                      =
                               y(Y, Y)
(4.3)                      =        (Ld,   LS)
                       1


(4.4)


Here the rationing proportions and their bounds are without superscript £ by axiom

ic Green (see p. 3-1 above). The same will be done later for consumers.
                                                                                 4-3


          (4.4)   means that in the "realization" terms, the firm has to be able

to fulfill its promise of effective supply even if the most rationing in

hiring labor and the least rationing in sales happen to be the case. Con-

sidering that we are maximizing the profit,



(4.5)                 y =          (l/.)f1(9)
substituting (4.5) into (4.1)


                      Max £ P.f'(2s
                              1
                                    )s./s. -
                                               1—i 1 1ws1
                           1


The first order condition is



(4.6)                                                       = 0
                      P.(s.) f'(2)/. - w(s)

Since    the   market signals are exogenous to the firm, Assumption 4.3 guaran-

tees that {i} satisfying (4.6), say { ()*} maximizes the expected profit.

Assumptions 4.1 and 4.4 imply (9)* is strictly positive but finite, if

LS > 0 and Y > 0

          By assumptions 3.3 and 3.4 and 4.4, we find the upper hemi-continuous

correspondence ' from the space of the quantity signals to the space of the

effective demand for labor and the effective supply of the ith consumption

goods.

                               =
                                         (Y; Y; Ld; LS)           V(P1, w)   0

                                                                  V(P,w)>>0
                                                                                                5-7



         If so, let [y(n),(n)] c line segment between [)(n),(n)] and

         such    that


                     wt(n)(n)s t(at(n) -            .p.(n)y. (n).(     (n)) =   0




         Such a point clearly exists and satisfies


                     Finally, it is routine to check that in all cases

                                               0    0

may fail if the last assumption is violated.

Proof: Entirely routine.                  QED

     There are, thus, some problems with continuity, which will be dealt with

later.

     The next step is to relate expected future signals tt÷l to current ones

     This is done in the usual way (Grandmont) (1977 or 1978)):                             has a

probability distribution which depends continuously on                      in the topology of

weak convergence of probability measures. Let p(czt) be the distribution of

         given       c. The problems of non-continuity, especially in lemma 5.2,

necessitate the following assumptions.
                                                                          4-5



Proposition 2.2 [Continuity or Single-valued Mapping]

         Suppose Assumptions 3.1-3.4 and 4.1-4.4 with assumption 4.3' instead

of 4.3, then        is single-valued.



Proof is trivial

                                                                                          5-1




5. The Consumer's Behavior

            Let us now consider a representative consumer h. To begin with we

introduce the notations with subscript t:



o                 effective    demand for good i by consumer h at period t,



o <             = effective    supply of labor by h at period t,



       = aggregate effective demand for good i at period t,



L = aggregate            effective supply of labor at period t.



Similarly, we denote by               '    L the aggregate demand for labor. They will
appear as signals in the rationing mechanisms. Also, we let

o   < Lh    =    the    endowment of labor of consumer h,
    —t
       =   price       of good i at period t,


w = nominal            wage at period t,

       =   realized      purchases of good i by consumer h at period t,

      =   realized       sales of labor by consumer h at period t.



Finally, if subscript              is dropped the notation signifies the corresponding

I-dimensional vector, where I is the number of goods in each period.

           At each period a generation of consumers h =         1,   ..., H   is born. They

live for two periods. In the 1st period a consumer sells labor and buys goods.

In the 2nd period he is retired and only buys goods with money balances he

has carried forward from the 1st period of his lifetime. No planned bequests
                                                                                             5—2



exist, so a household has no initial money balances. Any involuntary be-

quests caused by rationing are taxed away by the government.

           Since realizations are random it is natural to assume that the house-

hold has a preference relation h over probability distributions of

realizations. We shall adopt the simpler hypothesis of expected utility

maximization i.e.,                   h can be represented by adopting a utility function
       2I+ --       IR such that



                   -h -h         -
                                     -h -h
           jUh(yt,      Lt           Ztl >'t÷l    1-'




represents ht' where .i                    is    the probability distribution of consequences.

  (   ) will    be taken to be concave. (For a further discussion of this issue

see Grandmont (1972, 1977 and 1978) .)

          To relate realized transactions to effective demands and supplies we

follow the approach of Green (1978) with one further simplification: the

(stochastic) fractions of effective demand/supply that are realized are

independent of the effective demand/supply of each individual consumer. The

fractions do depend on aggregate effective demand and supply in the market.

The assumptions of sign-preservation, continuity, etc. made by Green (1978) hold.

Let        t÷1' denote the random elements in the rationings in each period. Then,

we have



                    h                  d
               =
                             -               s

undefined expected disutility (compare Green (1978)). Note also that the

second inequality in (II) involves effective demands                                 rather than

realizations. This is natural since a consumer does not plan any bequests,

be the set of possible actions by the consumer.

        We make the following assumptions


Assumption 5.1

        The distributions of                       are non-degenerate distributions satisfying


                            {'            {O,l], i =   1,   .   ..I

                       c[5_, ]c[0,1]


Here the bounds may depend on                 and do so continuously.



        Then we have the following situation:


                       We can break the correspondence ( ) into two parts


               =
                        (t)x ÷lt+l' ' y, Z)                           ,        where

                                          a.s.()                          w)
                                                                                 -                 0

Since the rationing mechanism is sign-preserving,realizations are always non-

negative whenever the effective demands are non-negative, i.e.,

   >   e,          >   0,     > 0    are guaranteed. Therefore,



Lemma 5.1

                            is a compact-valued, convex-valued and upper hemi-continuous

correspondence. It is also lower hemi-continuous V for which                               > 0
                                                                                                           5-6


Proof: Upper hemi-continuity is shown in Green. Each image set is convex-

valued since we have the rationing proportion, s, independent of the individual

effective demands, unlike Green. For lower hemi-continuity, let

           -                                        o             o)(ct()).

     and we can choose

     there exist [y(n), 2.(n)J such that the corresponding physical realization

         If so, let [y(n),(n)] c line segment between [)(n),(n)] and

         such    that


                     wt(n)(n)s t(at(n) -            .p.(n)y. (n).(     (n)) =   0




         Such a point clearly exists and satisfies


                     Finally, it is routine to check that in all cases

may fail if the last assumption is violated.

Proof: Entirely routine.                  QED

     There are, thus, some problems with continuity, which will be dealt with

later.

     The next step is to relate expected future signals tt÷l to current ones

     This is done in the usual way (Grandmont) (1977 or 1978)):                             has a

probability distribution which depends continuously on                      in the topology of

weak convergence of probability measures. Let p(czt) be the distribution of

         given       c. The problems of non-continuity, especially in lemma 5.2,

necessitate the following assumptions.
                                                                                                            5—8

                                                       ,t+l



Then, we have


Lemma 5.3

          Any solution to the young consumer's optimization problem is such that

      =
           wtz1'st(a) -             lp...(cLt)y                 > 0       when a   0.


Proof: Assume the contrary. Then by construction                                            E 0


independently of                .   On       the other hand, (5.1), (5.2) and (5.3) guarantee
that the consumer can obtain with certainty a positive amount of some good
in   period t+l, if             >   0.       This with (4)            yield a contradiction.
                                                                                                         QED

          This proposition means that in considering h(a,cz+l) we can assume that

      > 0 so that the continuity problem has been overcome in lemma 5.2.                                     By

(5.3) we have that h(;                   .   ) is   continuous for all                  0    .    To complete the

discussion of the young consumer's maximization problem we can appeal to the

results of Grandmont (1972, 1977) and see that the correspondence




giving current effective demands for goods and effective supply of labor is

a compact- and convex-valued uhc correspondence, when a 0 .                                           For a =     0

we can define dh(at) arbitrarily, since realizations will always yield zeros

to the consunier.

         To complete the picture, consider the old consumer,k's problem. Since

realizations of period t-l have taken place, he has an endowment of money              o

and his problem is clearly

6. Equilibrium and Non-triviality

     So far we have not been very explicit about the range of values

 (excluding the price components) can take. They are, however, important for the

fixed-point argument that follows, so we consider them in detail.

     Current-period prices and wages Pt and w are taken to be fixed and positive.

Then it is evident that

                        h            -h
                o                                  i.       = 1,    ...,I

give the bounds for a young consumer h, provided                                        0• Let    be this
compact and convex set. Furthermore,if                                  =   0, then realizations are all zero
independently of             the random element. Thus, in that case actions could be

taken to satisfy the above inequalities as well.
                                                                                     Thus, Vcit(yP)cKh

    Next, consider the producers. From section 2 we recall that the firm's

best-action correspondence is contained in a given compact and convex set

Nif cJR ,       where we have added zeros for those goods that the form doesn't

produce (i.e. j         i)    .     Let N =
                                              il

                                                                                       whichis compact and convex.

Finally, let us form K = M x N. Then, it is clear that

       =
           (y,   L, Y, L) KC 2I+2

    Now form the aggregate demand correspondence

                     h=lht     +

where we have smoothed the individual correspondences for the case    =


(see e.g. Nikaido (1968, pp. 71-73)). Also, let 1'(c) be the aggregate cor-

responder of the producers (see section 4).



And, finally;



                     y(c) x {'(ct)



is the required uhc, compact- and convex-valued correspondence X : K -- K to

which we apply the fixed-point theorem of Kakutani. Hence, there exists

      such that t*y() x 14(cL). An easy decomposition argument shows that
                                                         *                s*
this is the required non-trivial equilibrium provided c is such that Lt > 0.

To ensure that,consider the following argument.
                                                                                          6—3




      What would the rationing function for demand in a market look like when the

 signal of aggregate supply is equal to zero. The plausible answer is that the

rationing degenerate at O} .       If   there is any "rational" restriction in the

rationing functions, this must be the one. Similarly, if the signals for

aggregate demand in a market is equal to zero, then the rationing function for

the supply side of the market should degenerate at {O}.          Therefore, if all the

aggregate signals are equal to zero {c} =       O,   0, ...,   0},   then the induced

aggregate demands and supplies are also zero, and this should be equilibrium.

This is called the "trivial equilibrium." However, in our framework, the

trivial equilibrium conflict with two assumptions we made earlier.           First, the

government which has the power to finance by itself printing money demands a

positive amount of consumption goods and labor; Secondly, the older generation is at

least indifferent between putting down the deposit for effective demands and

carrying the money to a coffin. Therefore,           cannot be a null-vector to begin

with since     and L*d are necessarily strictly positive.             We have from
assumption (5.3) that L*S    0 which in turn induces firms to produce a

positive amount, by proposition 2.3. Therefore, our economy with the

government and the old generation who has money to spend and the well-behaved

production function generates a "non-trivial equilibrium." These assumptions

are compatible with Gale (1977: Theorem 3)



      Since L > 0,   we see that the necessary smoothing (Lemmas 3.1-3.3) does
not    create any problems i.e, c* does notbelong to the exceptional set. Hence,

we have proved the main theorem.


Theorem 6.1 There exists a non-trivial temporary equilibrium with stochastic

             rationing.
                                                                                7-1



7. Stability and Dynamics: Open Question

    We have shown the existence of a temporary equilibrium with stochastic

rationing. There are two steps in the research agenda we are going to proceed to

in the near future. First, we have to show the short-run stability of expecta-

tions on the aggregate signals. We ought to devise some mechanism to reach the

temporary equilibrium. This process is supposed to take place within a period

to ensure "rational expectations on rationing." Secondly, we would like to show

the long-run stability of price-adjustment. Although the prices are assumed to

be fixed within a period, they may change over time. Therefore, we would like

to show that the price dynamics in a sense does not "explode," or, moreover,

stay near the properly defined equilibrium.

     The first problem corresponds to the tatonnement process in the Walrasian

(temporary) equilibrium. The only difference is that our tatonnement process is

done in the quantity terms instead of the prices space. The second problem has

been studied in a similar framework. Grandmont and Hildenbrandt (1974) used

an over-lapping generations model without rationing, i.e., Pt is adjusted to

clear the spot markets, but the endowments are random every period. They showed

that the price dynamics becomes the Markov process. Green and Majumbar (1975)

considered the model that prices are determined before the stochastic endowments

are revealed so that there may be the excess demands in a period, which, with

the current price, deterinines the price in the following period. They showed

the existence of a "stochastic equilibrium" as invariant probability distributions

of prices. Green and Majumdar allow the excess demand to prevail. However,

they did not provide any theory of how to carry out, if any, transactions when

there is excess demand. Therefore, our model can be regarded as giving a rationale

 for their model. But, note also that the quantity signals as well as the prices
                                                                             7-2


should be considered as the variables to describe dynamics in a proper framework.

This is the topic we are going to explore. An alternative way to handle the

above-mentioned two concepts of stability is that we allow the temporary

discrepancy between the aggregate signals announced at the beginning of the period

and the aggregate effective demand and supply. All other features are the same

within a period. The question to be asked then is whether the dynamics of the

quantity signals, the prices and the expectation formations on the both signals

(in the sense of Fuchs (1977)), are "stable."   This seems to be very interesting

but complicated.

     Finally, there is one more source of dynamics in the model, namely that of

savings, when one imposes a government budget constraint to the system. Böhm

(1978) and Honkapohja (1978) considered this issue in the context of a macro-

economic model of the Benassy type. It would be interesting to analyze similar

problems with the present framework, in particular, since expectation formation

is now explicit.
                                                                              8-1



8. Conclus:ions

     The purpose of this paper was to develop a workable framework for the anal-

ysis of temporary equilibrium with stochastic rationing, which, so far, is the

most convincing framework about the formation of demands and supplies in the

context of non-clearing markets. Though perhaps the most interesting problems of

dynamics still await an answer, we were able to analyze the determination of a

temporary solution in some detail. In particular, an analysis shows that the

problem of non-triviality of equilibria can be overcome in a relatively simple way:

government expenditures provide the necessary signal for producers to produce

and hire inputs.

     The example of a non—Walrasian equilibrium at the Walrasian equilibrium

prices raises some fundamental issues. The Keynesian multiplier story is more than

a "deviation-amplifying' process at "wrong" prices. Indeed, even at the Walrasian

equilibrium prices, the pure pessimism about trading opportunities can make

agents reduce their effective demands and hence create a recession.   This should

be a subject of futher investigation.

Appendix

          We will give an example of a non-Wairasian equilibrium with stochastic

rationing at the Walrasian equilibrium prices, which is reported in Ito (1979).


Example

           Suppose the representative consumer with the following utility function,

(1)                          u=2v1+2v'rri+
where £                and       L denote the actual labor supplied and the disposable time

endowment; y                 denotes the actual consumption goods bought;          rn denotes the

end —     of — per i   od   money balance. The consumer maximizes (1) with respect to

2,    y     and             subject to the budget constraint and the non—negativity constraint:

                             m =   iii + wl   -
(2)
                             mO,
where w           0 and, p          0 denote the nominal wage and the price of the consump-

tion goods; t                 denotes the initial money balance. The Walrasian demand for

the consumption goods, d (which is multi-valued at p =                      1   in this example) and


the Walrasian supply of labor,5, are obtained as functions (or correspondences

to be precise) of the wage and the price.'2

           The representative firm maximizes its profit,

(3)                          v=py-w
subject to the feasibility constraint,

(4)                          y     f(J)

where f is a neoclassical production function dependent on the actual employ-

ment of the labor force, £                    .   This gives the Wairasian demand for labor,

and the Wairasian supply of the consumption goods, S, as functions of the

price and the wage.
                                                                                  A-2



        Suppose the following numerical values for the parameters:

 (5)                 = 200, 2       = 400, and f() = 20v7

        The Wairasian equilibirum in this economy is defined as the price vector

 (p*, w*) such that

                         = yS               and        d ps
        Observe that the Wairasian equilibrium is obtained at (p*, w*) =             (1,   1),

 which gives

                     =
                         d=S        =   200

                 g.,d               =   ioo

       Now keep the economic environment and the Wairasian prices intact, i.e.,

 (1), (4), (5) and (p, w) =         (1,     1). However, the consumer and the firm

 suddenly become pessimistic. They believe (i) that they are in the

Keynesian unemployment regime, i.e., the aggregate excess supply in the both

markets; (Ii) that the short-side of a market (i.e., demanders) can fulfill

their offers; (iii) that l0O'r% of workers are fully employed at their offers,

and 100(1 - w) %         of workers are employed at a half of their offers;


(iv) that (1000 )% of the finns manage to sell everything they produce

to offer, while the rest can sell only (lOOs )%              of   their products, in such

a way that the mean of successful—sales proportion is

                 =       + (1   -
                                                                  < 1.

       Both markets meet simultaneously at the beginning of a period and decide

randomly who are lucky to fulfill their supply and who are rationedJ

       Taking into these constraints, the consumer maximizes the expected utility

to find the effective supply of labor, Les and the effective demand for the

consumption goods, yed:

       The firm is assumed to be risk-neutral, wherefore they maximize the expected

      A non-Wairasian equilibrium with stochastic rationing is defined as

 a self-reproducing aggregate quantity signals (ydysLdLs)(5) Take

      2OO()2N, yS = 2OO()N, Ld =    lOO()2N,   LS =   liON, where N is the
 number of firms or consumers. It is easy to see that if (E) is satisfied

 then (ydysLdLs) is a nori-Walrasian equilibrium.


     In order to confirm that (E) is satisfied by the values given in (6) and

(7), we take the first order condition of the expected utility maximization



                   l// +
problem, i.e., Eu2,= 0, where

Eu= Tr(l//ff1+ -                 (1 -   )(l/2A÷7 i/2/-/2)
                                                        -


Observe that this is satisfied if 2e = 110.      The firm's expected maximiza-

tion yields the followings:


             ed = lOO()2

            es = 2OO().

Given the values of (6) for it and (7) for , (E) is satisfied
