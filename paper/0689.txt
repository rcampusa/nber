                      Tax Policy and Foreign Direct Investment



                                      ABSTRACT



       This paper examines the implications of the most common system of
taxing foreign source income. It is argued that, because the repatriation
of earnings to the home country investor and not the earnings themselves
are typically the source of tax liability, the foreign source income tax
should affect foreign investment differently depending on the required
transfers of funds within the firm.
       One implication of viewing the tax in this fashion is that in order
to maximize after tax profits, a firm should finance its foreign investment
out of foreign earnings to the greatest extent possible. That is, a firm's
required foreign return jumps at the point at which desired foreign invest-
ment just exhausts foreign earnings. This allows us to draw a distinction
between "mature" foreign operations, which are at any point in time financed
at the margin by reinvested earnings (and perhaps also pay dividends to
their parent firm in the home country), and "immature" foreign affiliates,
which rely on funding from their parents (and should not be paying dividends).
It is noted that survey evidence on multinational firm behavior is consistent
with this distinction. Direct investment data indicate that mature foreign
operations probably account for nearly ninety percent of U.S. foreign direct
investment.
       The discussion then turns to investment incentives. It is shown that
the home country's rate of tax on foreign source income and the presence
or absence of a foreign tax credit should be irrelevant to a mature foreign
operation's investment and dividend decisions. This conclusion, which
conflicts sharply with the conventional wisdom, follows because the home
country tax acts as an unavoidable cost. New firms' investment decisions
are, on the other hand, influenced by home country taxes.

                TAX POLICY AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESThIENT


      The importance of foreign direct investment to the economies of most

 countries has increased dramatically in recent years.' For instance, more

 than a quarter of new investment by U.S. firms is made in foreign operations.

 Predictably, the tax treatment of income earned by multinational firms has

 been the subject of frequent debates in both the firms' home countries and

 the countries which host the investments. Broad issues of both equity and

 efficient international investment patterns are raised by the interactions of

 separate national tax systems.

     This paper focuses on issues of home country tax policy. In particular,

it is argued that the incentive effects of the most common system of taxation

are very different from those usually ascribed to such a policy. The analysis

of investment incentives is contained in later sections of the paper. First,

the international tax policy issues and the conclusions of previous studies

are briefly examined. While most of the existing literature is concerned

with U.S. policy, the results have broader applicability.

     One basic concern of all countries has been the double taxation of cor-

porate income which would arise if both the home country and the host country

ignored the multinational nature of a firm and its earnings.   Generally,
such double taxation has been avoided by action of the home countries, which

have recognized the primary right of host countries to tax income earned in

their jurisdictions and have forgone a portion of the taxes they would normally

have collected on foreign source income, Some countries have, in fact,

adopted a "territorial" approach to taxation, under which no tax is owed on

income earned abroad. Under the more common "residence" approach, double

taxation may still be alleviated by allowing a credit for taxes paid to the

host country government. The former system produces an effective tax rate
                                   —2—



equal to the host country rate, while the latter results in an effective tax

rate equal to the greater of the two countries' rates. Thus, the two systems

result in equal tax burdens only if the tax rate in the host country equals

or exceeds that in the home country.

     Some relief from double taxation is, it is believed, necessary to preserve

incentives for capital to be efficiently allocated on a worldwide basis. That

is, capital should be employed in the country in which it will earn the highest

gross return.

     The United States employs the residence approach with a credit given for

foreign taxes paid, but proposals to allow only a deduction for foreign taxes

have gained considerable support. Given the corporate tax rates in effect
                                                  of tax would result from ending
in most of the world, very high effective rates

the U.S. foreign tax credit. A rejection of the present system by the world's

largest direct investing nation could apparently have important welfare

effects worldwide, but the proposal is justified by opponents of the tax

credit by the gains it would bring the U.S. The current system, it is argued,

encourages too much U.S. capital to be invested abroad. The reason is that

firms will profitably invest abroad as long as the after—tax return abroad

exceeds the after—tax return at home, while the U.S. as a whole gains only
                                                                    home.2
 if the after—foreign—tax return abroad exceeds the gross return at

 Therefore, it would seem that providing only a deduction for foreign taxes

 paid is necessary to make firms behave in a fashion consistent with the

 national interest.

      One other aspect of residence—based systems which has come under attack

 in the U.S. is that the home country tax is deferred. That is, the tax on

 foreign source income is paid only upon repatriation of the income to the

 parent firm. Deferral reduces the effective tax rate on income earned abroad
                                  —3--.




and provides some further inducement to foreign direct investment. While

deferral has been called a "loophole" by its critics, it is regarded by many

as crucial to guaranteeing consistency with a basic premise of U.S. law:

that a firm should be taxed only on income it actually receives.3 In fact,

ending deferral raises serious constitutional issues, particularly in the case

of parent firms who, by virtue of having minority ownership in a subsidiary,

may not be able to control the timing of dividend payments.4 Exceptions to

the general policy have been made for actions motivated by tax avoidance, but

the basic principle, that the U.S. should tax not the income of firms incor-

porated abroad but the income recieved from them by U.S. parents, has remained
          5
intact.

     The interaction of the foreign tax credit and deferral of the home country

tax makes examination of foreign investment incentives quite complicated when

the home country's tax rate exceeds the rate of creditable host country tax.6

Generally, those interested in the incentive effects of the U.S. system have

treated deferral as a reduction in the effective tax rate. Specifically,

deferral is viewed as reducing the total effective rate from the U.S. rate

to a linear combination of both countries' rates, with the dividend payout

ratio determining the fraction of subsidiary earnings subjected to the U.S.

rate.7 An increase in the U.S. tax on foreign source income, due either to

the elimination of the foreign tax credit or to the imposition of a special

tax, would discourage foreign direct investment. This, of course, is the

result anticipated by those who propose repeal of the foreign tax credit.

     In this paper a much more important role is ascribed to deferral. It

is argued that, because the repatriation of profits and not the earning of

profits becomes the source of tax liability under deferral, the corporate

tax when applied to foreign source income should be thought of as a tax on
                                 —4—



the transfer of funds. Therefore, this tax could have very different

consequences from those of the tax on domestic income and its effects could

be highly dependent on the funds transfers involved in the marginal foreign

investment. In particular, it will be important to distinguish the tax

implications for new foreign investments from those for what we will call

"mature" foreign operations, namely those which do not require continuing

injections of funds from the parent.

     First, it is shown that the mature foreign operations, which at the

margin are deciding to reinvest versus pay dividends to their parents, are

theoretically distinct from the "immature" foreign operations, which at the

margin are investing funds transferred from the parent.8 That is, we

domonstrate that all foreign direct investment in subsidiaries currently

paying dividends to the parent firm should consist of retained earnings.

Some casual empirical evidence is cited to support the validity of this

separation. In Section II the data on financial behavior of U.S. multi-

national firms are examined to estimate the fraction of foreign investment

accounted for by earnings retained abroad. The conclusion is that all but

a small fraction of U.S. foreign direct investment appears to be financed

by retained earnings of mature subsidiaries.

     In the third section, we examine the effects on mature subsidiaries'

investment and dividend decisions of a home country tax system of the U.S.

type, and of changes in such a tax law.   It is shown that the home country's

rate of tax on foreign source income and the presence or absence of a foreign

tax credit should be irrelevant to a mature subsidiary's investment decisions,

as long as the home country taxes are deferred. This conclusion conflicts

sharply with prevailing opinion. Similarly, the repatriation of profits

from abroad should be unaffected by the tax treatment of foreign source

income, despite the fact that taxes are deferred until repatriation occurs.
                                   —5—



This result stands in contrast to the concerns of some that removing the

foreign tax credit but maintaining deferral would result in reduced income

repatriation.9 Finally, the decisions of the immature subsidiary are examined

and related to the existing foreign investment literature.

I. Foreign Direct Investment and the Funds Transfers It Involves

    Foreign direct investment can be accomplished in several ways. Trans-

fers of funds abroad by a parent firm, either as loans to or equity investments

in subsidiaries, are the most explicit forms of direct investment.10 However,

the retention of earnings abroad by foreign subsidiaries raises the stake of

the parent firm in the operation of the subsidiary just as surely as do

explicit transfers. Retained earnings investment has, of course, been well

recognized, and, beginning in 1979, it has been treated in the U.S. balance of

payments accounts as two separate transactions: an impitcit payment of divi-

dends to the parent firm and an investment of the funds abroad.

     Preliminary to the discussion of tax effects on investment incentives,

this section demonstrates the impact of the tax system on the choice among

the several forms of making direct investments. Later, it will be shown

that this choice, which in a world without taxes would be a matter, of no

significance, can have an important bearing on the tax rate which applies

to the marginal investment. The choice among these forms of direct investment

follows in a straightforward fashion from the following simple proposition:

 if unnecessary funds transfers result in extra tax liabilities or in earlier

 tax liabilities, then the transfers should not be made.

      Previous analyses of tax effects on foreign investment incentives have

 either neglected reinvestment of subsidiary earnings or have assumed a fixed

 retention ratio (a fixed dividend payout ratio), so that marginal direct

 investment can be thought of as involving capital transferred directly from

 the parent. The assumption of stable dividend payouts by subsidiaries,

 even while additional capital flows to the subsidiaries are taking place, has

 been justified in much the same way that the behavior of domestic firms has

 been explained: by the need to maintain a "reasonable'1 debt—equity ratio,
                                          —7--




the desire to signal success, or simply habit. Here, the question is one of

how a given amount of internal funds reach the subsidiary, so the debt—equity

ratio is unaffected. Since the transactions under discussion are carried

out within one firm, considerations such as signaling profitability would seem

irrelevant. In general, then, there seems little reason to expect the

dividend payout ratio to be fixed unless taxes give no incentive for firms

to act otherwlse)2 Therefore, we will assume that firms have complete

flexibility to respond to tax inducements.

       In a no—tax world, there would be no cost to financial transfers across

national boundaries within the firm. Therefore, the firm would be concerned

only about the net transfer of funds between parent and subsidiary.

       What is important for our purposes is the effect of a home country tax

system, such as that of the U.S., including deferral and a foreign tax credit.13

A simple formulation of a home country tax on capital income earned abroad

(at rate t), with a credit for host country taxes paid (at rate t* < t), has

the rate (t —    t*)   applied to the gross—of—foreign—tax return or the rate
(t —   t*)   applied to the net—of—foreign—tax return. t is paid as the capi—
(1 —   t*)
tal income is earned, while (t_t*) is paid only on repatriated dividends. A
                                 (lt*)
dollar of after—foreign—tax earnings repatriated to the home country results,

therefore, in a receipt of               dollars by the parent firm. Because of the

limitation of foreign tax credits to the home tax liability, only the foreign

tax is relevant when t exceeds t.

       To illustrate the implications of various financial transactions which

could occur within a firm consisting of a domestic parent and one foreign

subsidiary, suppose that each has a dollar and intends to invest a dollar.

It is clear that simu1taneou repatriation of profits and direct investment

through funds transfer is inferior to the alternative of making no funds

transfers. With no transfers, parent and subsidiary investments leave them
                                    —8—




with 1 + r and 1 + r*(l._t*) respectively at the end of the period (or

1 + r +         [1 + r*(l_t*)1 in the hands of the parent if earnings are
          (l)
repatriated). The alternative of dividend repatriation coupled with equity

investment simply results in an unnecessary tax payment to the home contry

government at the time of the initial repatriation.   This payment leaves

the parent with only        dollars to invest, rather than one dollar. At

the end of a period, parent and subsidiary have --)[1 + r] and 1 + r*(1_t*)

respectively (or the parent has :)[2 + r + r*(l_t*)] if all income is

repatriated). So, regardless of whether the firm intends to reinvest abroad

at the end of the period or repatriate all assets from abroad, making equity

transfers abroad while earnings are being repatriated is a sub—optimal

strategy.

     This example, which is summarized in Table 1, allows two sources of loss

arising from the sub—optimal transfer policy to be distinguished. The first

occurs because of an implicit assumption that the eventual repatriation of

the extra paid—in equity constitutes a taxable event.   That is, the home

country tax is paid twice on the initial dollar of subsidiary earnings.

However, there is a further loss to the firm making dividend and equity

 transfers which would occur even if the eventual repatriation of the extra

paid—in capital were viewed as a tax—free return of capital.14 This loss

 can be identified as the cost of having to pay the extra home country tax

 immediately, rather than at the end of a period of investment and would

       (t_t*)                                                 should not be
 equal (lt*) r. Therefore, we have shown that a subsidiary

 repatriating profits and receiving equity transfers from the parent simul-

 taneously, even if the equity can be returned to the parent tax free.

      A financial policy of simultaneous dividend payment by the subsidiary

 and direct investment in the form of loans has a similar effect.   The dollar

 of repatriated earnings produces         of parent firm assets, which grow to

           + r) by the end of a period. Since interest payments are ordinarily

deductible under host country tax systems, the subsidiary can pay its gross

capital return to the parent as interest.15 The principal of the loan is

repaid without further tax liability. As in the case of an equity transfer

     In summary, then, a foreign subsidiary should utilize its profits to

finance further investments whenever possible, rather than paying dividends

to the parent and receiving direct investment from the parent in any form.

Only those foreign subsidiaries without sufficient earnings should rely on

parental financing. This result, that a tax on transfers of funds from

subsidiaries to parents should make firms avoid unnecessary transfers, is

certainly not surprising. However, it calls into serious question the

previous discussions of the foreign investment decision which presume that

parent firms are making equity transfers to dividend—paying foreign sub-

sidiaries.

     These previous studies have relied on the aggregate foreign investment

data which show substantial dividend payments and parent company transfers

of funds taking place at the same time. Our analysis is in no way incon-

sistent with this observation, so long as the same firms are not involved

inboth transactions. In fact, there is a great deal of casual empirical

evidence from U.S. firms consistent with the predictions of our analysis.

Barlow and Wender (1955) reported, for example, that U.S. firms operating

abroad tend to "expand the business within the country through reinvestment

of local earnings to the greatest extent possible." From their survey of

U.S. subsidiary firm behavior, Robbins and Stobaugh (1973) similarly conclude
                                    —11--




 "After the initial incubation period, retained earnings and depreciation

 allowances are the dominant source of funds, and these sources, when coupled

 with local brorowing, leave little need for fresh funds from headquarters."

 Unfortunately, there is a near absence of empirical evidence on this issue

 from sources other than interviews or surveys of firms.16

      More recently, Gilman (1980) has presented empirical evidence on sources

 of funds employed by multinational firms, concluding that net parents' contri-

 butions are generally minor, "only becoming a significant source of foreign

 asset financing when asset growth is very rapid, past investments small or

profits small or negative." Unfortunately, his data, while disaggregated by

OECD country, are aggregated across firms; and so, his investment figures net

any dividend payments from capital transferred abroad. However, the cases

in which funds transfers are found to be significant are those in which we

would expect our arguments above to not be applicable, so the results are

at least not contradictory to the conclusions reached here.17

     Without data at the firm level, which could allow isolation of firms

which produce sufficient foreign earnings to finance their chosen levels of

foreign direct investment, it is necessary to be somewhat cautious.   However,

both our theoretical analysis and the evidence available t this time indicate

that direct investment studies should differentiate the behavior of two types

of firms. We will, therefore, characterize foreign operations as "new" (or

"immature"), in which case the marginal source of internal funds is a transfer

from the parent, or as "mature", in which case the marginal source of funds is

a reduction in dividend payments to the parent. As we will show in Section

III, the responses of the two types of firm to a tax policy change could be

very different. First, we will examine evidence on the proportion of U.S.

foreign direct investment accounted for by each category of firm.
                                  —12—




II. The Evidence

     In order to discern whether "maturet' or "immature" firms are more

representative of U.S. foreign direct investment, individual firm data would

be required. Since such information is unavailable, inferences about marginal

sources of direct investment must be made from aggregate data.

     Very reliable evidence exists on the average source of internal funds.

Figure 1 shows the historical pattern of U.S. foreign direct investment and

its division into transfers from parent firms and reinvested earnings. The

data indicate that a dramatic change has occurred over the past fifteen years

in the method by which direct investment is carried out. Reinvested earnings,

which formerly played a minor role in direct investment now account for over

three quarters of the total; the change is even more impressive for manufac-

turing investment alone.

     The trend toward greater reliance on retained earnings in the aggregate

is consistent with the "maturing" of U.S. foreign operations over the past

decade which has often been noted by observers. It has produced a situation

in which the level of firms' operations abroad could continue to grow quite

rapidly without the need for further parent company financing.

     That transfers to subsidiaries play a minor role becomes even clearer

when it is recognized that the data on transfers are for both separately

incorporated and unincorporated foreign affiliates, while the reinvested

earnings figures are for only incorporated affiliates. When a firm's foreign

affiliate is not separately incorporated, all investment is treated as an

"equity and intercompany account" capital outflows in the Commerce Department

statistics. Similarly, the earnings of such affiliates are immediately

included in the company's consolidated income and are taxed as soon as earned.

For purposes of this paper, then, we are mainly concerned with the ninety

percent of U.S. foreign direct investment which occurs in incorporated

affiliates. As Table 2 shows, nearly ninety percent of such investment is

made out of the profits of the subsidiaries.

     While this evidence seems striking, it does not offer conclusive proof

that retained earnings provide the marginal source of funds for most invest-

ment. Evidence on the marginal source of funds is more indirect. As the

theory of Section I has indicated, the payment of dividends should signal

a reliance on internally—generated funds as the marginal source of finance.

The dividends received from foreign subsidiaries have increased from less

than three billion dollars in 1970 to more than nine billion dollars in 1979.

In recent years, about forty percent of total foreign subsidiary earnings

have been paid out as dividends)8 In combination, the available evidence

points to a very large percentage of U.S. foreign direct investment being

undertaken by mature firms.

III. The impacts of Taxes on Mature Foreign Operations

     Since at least U.S. foreign direct investment seems to now be dominated

by firms employing foreign earnings as their marginal source of finance of

new foreign investment, we now turn to an analysis of their behavior. While

in a no—tax world, the fact that such mature firms are the typical investors

would be irrelevant for analysis, the optimal investment decisions in a

system with taxes can be quite sensitive to the marginal source of investment

funds. In particular, common home country tax systems, which we have argued

can best be viewed as imposing a tax on the transfer of funds from the sub-

sidiary to the parent, will obviously affect foreign investment decisions

differently depending on whether the funds are already abroad.

     Consideration of asLmple marginal investment decision of a mature

foreign subsidiary serves to illustrate this point.. Suppose that a foreign

subsidiary has a dollar of after—foreign—tax earnings which it can either

reinvest or repatriate to its parent. If the dollar is reinvested, the

dollar plus the one—period investment earnings will be repatriated at the

end of the period.20

     If the subsidiary firm repatriates immediately, the parent receives

one dollar, must pay the home country tax net of foreign tax credit, and

therefore, has at its disposal          dollars.21 After investing this amount


for the period, the parent has

     By comparison, the subsidiary could reinvest a whole dollar in its

own operations, ending the period with [1 +   r*(l_t*)]   to be repatriated as a

dividend to the parent. Upon receipt of the dividend, the parent must pay

the home country tax on the original dollar of earnings and the return earned

during the period, but it can claim a credit for the foreign taxes paid. So,
                                         —17—



  the parent receives   (l—t)
                                [1 +   r* (l_t*)].
      Comparing these two decisions, it can be seen that the subsidiary will

 optimally reinvest rather than repatriating profits if r*(l_t*) exceeds r.

 That is, the home country system of deferring taxes and providing a credit

 for host country tax payments induces multinational firms to invest abroad

 up to the point at which the after—foreign—tax return available abroad
                                                                                        equals
 the available domestic after—tax return.            Surprisingly, the domestic tax

 applied to foreign source income plays no role in the firm's marginal invest-

 ment decision; the firm behaves in the same manner as it .qould with no home

 country tax on foreign source income. So, home country tax systems

 of the U.S. type provide what is termed "capital import neutrality":

 the tax rates influencing decisions of both host country firms and foreign

 investors in the host country are equivalent.

     This conclusion stands in direct conflict with the previous research

which notes that taxing at the domestic rate with a foreign tax credit provides

for "capital export neutrality" (the same tax rate applied to the foreign

and domestic investment returns of multinational firms) and concludes that

deferral serves to shift the system partially away from such a standard.

Horst (1977), who assumes that new funds advanced from the parent are the

marginal source of direct investment, concludes, for example, that the firm

                                             —
should optimally equate r to [1 —       Pt       (l_p)t*]r*,   where !t1n   is   the dividend
                22
payout ratio.

     Our result that the home country tax should not affect the mature sub-

sidiary's investment decision extends to a system which replaces the foreign

tax credit by a deduction. Under such a system, a dollar of after—f oreign—

tax earnings repatriated to the parent gives the parent (l—t), which produces

(l—t)(l+r) after one period. A reinvested dollar, on the other hand, produces
                                 —18—



[1 + r*(l_t*)] for the subsidiary and, upon repatriation, the parent receives

(l—t)[l + r*(l_t*)]. Again, the firm is induced to invest abroad up to the

point where r(l—t) = rn

    As noted above, if the home country imposed no tax on foreign source

income, the same condition for optimal investment would hold. Conseauently,

the same optimal foreign investment rule applies under the typical home

country system of foreign tax credits when t exceeds t, generating foreign

tax payments in excess of the amount creditable but leaving no home tax

liability. That is, despite the discontinuity in the foreign tax credit around

the home country tax rate, one marginal condition is sufficient to describe

the optimal behavior of a foreign investor. Similarly, the investor's opti-

mal decisions are determined in the same manner if it is able to avoid a

tax imposed by the home country.23

     These results, which are so contrary to the conventional wisdom, are, in

addition to being very simple, highly intuitive. Since the potential foreign

direct investment is to be financed out of foreign subsidiary earnings, which

will currently or in the future bear the same home country tax liability, the

only question for the firm is in which locations those earnings could be

invested to produce the highest net return. The firm's choice is between a

return of r*(l_t*), reduced by the home country tax, on a dollar invested

abroad, versus a return of r on an after—home—country—tax dollar invested

at home. The home country tax on foreign source income affects both available

returns equally.

     That a revenue—producing tax imposed on foreign source Thcome would not

affect investment decisions may still seem curious. The answer to this puzzle

lies in the unavoidable nature of the tax for a firm with subsidiary earnings.

A tax increase would immediately lower the value to the parent firm of the
                                  —19—



future subsidiary earnings, but would do nothing to alter future decisions.

Only for firms with immature foreign operations is the home country tax a

deterrent to investment.

     Implicit in these conclusions is the further result that optimal dividend

payments——subsidiary earnings net of reinvestment——are not sensitive to the

home country tax policy toward foreign ource income. Kopits (1972), who

concluded that a rise in the U.S. tax rate would reduce dividend payments,

neglected the future U.S. tax liability due to repatriation. The consistent

treatment of current and deferred tax liabilities is what produces the absence

of an impact on dividends. One casualty of our results, therefore, is the

argument that eliminating the foreign tax credit without ending deferral could

backfire, resulting in greatly reduced dividends and, therefore, possibly

decreased tax revenue.

     These conclusions have been based on a simple example, but one which is

quite general. Since no particular assumption has been made concerning the

length of the time period, the results hold even if home country taxes are

deferred for a very long time. The analysis would be invalid, however, if the

home country tax could somehow be avoided eventually. An ability to avoid

paying the home country tax later, but not if repatriation occurs currently,

would tend to cause the firm to invest more abroad. In particular, the

ability to repatriate tax—free at the end of a period would cause a firm to
                                              (l—t)   (t_t*)
reinvest abroad as long as r*(l_t*) exceeds rfl(l*) —               This   situa-
                                                       (l_t*)   .




tion could arise if the firm anticipated a tax—favored liquidation of foreign

operations at some future time24 or if a future elimination (or reduction) of

the home country tax were expected. On the other hand, a firm expecting the

home country tax treatment of foreign source income to take an unfavorable

turn will tend to reinvest less abroad.
                                   —20—




     The existence of operations in many countries changes nothing of sub-

stance in our analysis but does point to a role for funds transfers between

mature and immature subsidiaries. An immature subsidiary of a parent firm

with mature subsidiaries should be financed to the greatest extent possible

by funds transferred from the mature subsidiaries (rather than the parent).

An immature subsidiary optimally follows the investment rule anplicable to

a mature subsidiary if its marginal source of funds is a mature subsidiary's

earnings. That is, our concept of maturity is most appropriately defined by

reference to the firm's aggregated operations abroad.

     Thus, we reach the general conclusion that investment by mature foreign

affiliates should be insensitive to home country rates of tax on foreign

source income. It is to the investment decisions of foreign affiliates which

rely on parent funds that we now turn.
                                      —21—


 IV.    The Impact of Taxes on Immature Foreign Operations

        While the available evidence points to the predominance of mature sub-

 sidiaries, in at least U.S. foreign direct investment, the tax effects on

 newer foreign operations could be important also, particularly over time.

 Unlike the mature firms considered in Section III, immature subsidiaries

 should in general alter their investment decisions in response to tax changes,

 since the tax is not, for them, an unavoidable fixed cost as it is for a

 mature firm. As we shall see, the precise nature of the tax effects on the

 behavior of immature subsidiaries depends on the firms' plans for future

 investment abroad.

       The situation in which investment is financed by capital transfers from

 the parent to the subsidiary is the one considered in previous foreign

investment studies. As shown in Section I, a firm would not be expected to

be paying dividends at the same time transfers are being received from the

parent. So, the accepted method of analysis which assumes that the income

generated by new foreign investment faces a weighted average of the home

and host country's tax rates, with weights based on the subsidiary's dividend

payout ratio, seems problematic. 25

       The basic notion of a weighted average tax rate is, of course, correct

in the sense that in every future period the
                                               marginal dividend payout ratio

will determine the marginal rate of combined tax.   Furthermore, it is simple
to show that, if a foreign subsidiary were expected to pay out p of its

earnings in every future period, the weighted average rule would exactly

describe the effective tax rate over the life of the foreign operation. That

is, the present value of all future dividend payments generated by a dollar

of investment abroad (discounted at rn), would equal one only with

r = {l_pt_(l_p)t*}r*.
                                  —22—




    As our earlier analysis indicates, however, a foreign subsidiary

currently relying on parent funds will begin to repatriate dividends to the

parent only when, due to earnings reinvestment over time or to reduced

investment opportunities, the return available at the margin declines.

A precise calculation of the effective tax burden on earnings from a pros-

pective investment would require knowledge of the marginal dividend payout
                                                     formula based on some
ratios in each future period. The weighted average

average dividend payout ratio across firms will, consequently, provide a

better or worse approximation to the tax facing a firm, depending on that

ratio's adequacy in representing the firm's future plans.

     In any case, the general thrust of the received theory is applicable

to the immature firm. A subsidiary whose marginal source of finance is

capital transferred from the parent faces a tax rate between the host

country tax rate and the home rate of taxing foreign source income, with the

exact value depending on the timing of the deferred tax payments.
                                  —23—




V. Implications

      In summary, our analysis of a firm relying on its foreign earnings as

the marginal source of funds for foreign direct investment has left virtually

none of the theory of optimal foreign investment decisions unscathed. For

what is apparently the overwhelming majority of U.S. firms investing abroad,

for example, the size of the U.S. tax burden on foreign source income should

be irrelevant for investment decisions. Even replacing the foreign tax

credit with a deduction would not provide a disincentive for such firms to

reinvest abroad. Similarly, the foreign subsidiary's dec'isions to repatriate

earnings to the parent should be independent of the home country's tax

treatment of foreign source income.

     By contrast, a parent firm whose foreign subsidiaries can not finance

their investments without funds transfers from the parent should respond to

an increase in the home country's tax on foreign source income by investing

less abroad. Crucial to the coexistence of both types Of firm is, of course,

some aspect of foreign investment opportunities which is firm specific.

Otherwise, since the required return abroad is lower for mature firms, no

new investment requiring transfers abroad would occur as long as some firms

were reinvesting less than their total earnings.

     With foreign investment opportunities being firm specific, home country

taxes on foreign source income are distortionary to the extent that oppor-

tunities arise for new firms to invest abroad. An increase in the tax would

tend to cause reduced foreign investment in the period before a foreign

subsidiary matures and might cause a firm to completely forego the opportunity

to invest abroad. However, in terms of aggregate investment, the impacts of

any tax change are likely to be minor and largely temporary in nature. Thus,

the distinction drawn between the territorial and residence approaches to
                                  —24—



taxation is much less important in practice than is commonly believed.

     Another striking conclusion of our analysis concerns the effects of

changes in the general system of capital income taxation in the home country.

Even though the same tax rate might apply to domestic and foreign source

income, changes in that tax rate will, as we have shown, have their main

effect on domestic investment incentives. Therefore, even a tax increase,

which might appear to apply equally to domestic and foreign income, could

cause foreign investment to become more attractive relative to domestic

investment.

     Our results depend on the continued deferral of home country taxes.

The elimination of deferral would, of course, end the distinction between

new and mature foreign operations; and the effective tax rate on foreign

source income would be the greater of the home and host tax rates. Propos-

als to end the U.S. foreign tax credit often include the elimination of

deferral. One reason sometimes given for this package is that, otherwise,

the foreign tax credit elimination would increase the incentive to retain

earnings abroad. As we have shown in this paper, such fears are misguided.

However, the practical significance of our results does hinge on the like—

lihood of deferral being retained as other features of the tax are changed.

The constitutional issues raised by current taxation of foreign earnings would

 seem to make the chances for moving to such a system fairly low. In any event,

 a full understanding of the effects of the current home country systems should

 be important in assessing any proposals for change.

                               FOOTNOTE S


 1Direct investment is distinguished by the existence of capital supplier

 control over the "affiliate" receiving the capital.


 2This argument was made by Musgrave (1969) and numerous others. Later

 extensions, such as Hartman (1980) in which other aspects of firm behavior

 such as host country borrowing are considered, show the result to be sensi-

 tive to the characterization of the multinational firm.   The earlier notion

 of foreign investment will be retained here for reasons of simplicity. The

extension of this analysis to take account of this more recent work is

straightforward.


3See, for example, United Nations (1970).


4lhese issues are discussed in Fatemi, etal (1976), while a different

opinion of the constitutional question may be found in Krause and Dam

(1964).


5The current law does make provision for taxing not only incomes of firms

abroad which are not separately incorporated but also incomes of majority—

owned controlled foreign corporations which do not make substantial dividend

payments, which do not face foreign tax rates approximately as high as the

U.S. rate, and which earn significant profits from sales to related parties

or sales outside the country of incorporation. In other words, the law is

intended to discourage the artificial shifting of profits to sales subsidi-

aries in low—tax countries. However, if even a company which meets these

criteria can demonstrate that its motivation is not tax avoidance, taxes

are deferred. The amount of this currently—taxed retained income
                                                                   (Subpart
F income), $95.7 million in 1972 (Treasury (1979), is minor by any standard.
                                  —26—




6Only brief mention will be made of cases in which the host tax rate exceeds

the home tax rate, since no tax is collected by the home country in such

instances.


7See Horst (1977).


81n order to focus on these important transactions, we will ignore foreign

subsidiary borrowing from unrelated parties. For discussions of subsidiary

borrowing, see Horst (1977) or Goldsbrough (1979).


9Kopits (1972), for example, argues that a rise in the U.S. rate of tax on

foreign source income would produce lower dividend payments.


10Foreign affiliates not separately incorporated as subsidiaries are taxed

on a current basis, as noted above. The analysis of their behavior is

straightforward and will not be discussed here.


11Curiously in contrast to these studiesareKopitS' (1972) study of subsid-

iary dividends which take these payments as a residual in the reinvestment

decision and the survey literature on business decisions, to be discussed

later.


         law may force some subsidiaries to pay some dividends in order to

avoid current taxation of earnings retained abroad, but as was noted before,

 the practical effect of that provision is doubtful.


 13For simplicity, we will ignore foreign withholding taxes, which are paid

 to the host country at the time of dividend repatriation, and also the compli-

 cations inherent in the corporate income tax itself such as depreciation

 allowances.
                                     —27—




14Since we are considering a marginal investment decision, it may be diffi-

cult for such a firm to meet the restrictive conditions under which a return

of capital is allowed (see U.N. (1970)).


15The ability to charge a different rate of interest could provide the firm

with an advantage over charging r* in some situations. Making a low—interest

loan to a subsidiary could be a superior way of transferring funds abroad,

in cases in which a tax—free return of equity transferred abroad is not

available. A loan at high interest could be attractive i'f t'   exceeded   t.



16Kopits   (1972), who assumes the absence of additional parents' funding,

verifies that the dividend payout ratios of subsidiaries respond to invest-

ment incentives.


'7Gilman does not consider the tax implications of funds transfers in his

analysis, attributing the firms' behavior to "exchange rate illusion".


18US Commerce Department, Survey of Current Business, August, 1980.


'9The effects of a tax on dividend payments made by a purely domestic firm

are explored by Bradford (1981). The method of analysis followed here owes

a great deal to both that paper and the work of King (1977).


20The consideration of some discrete time period is, of course, crucial if

deferral of the home country tax is to be incorporated.


     this stage, we are still assuming t    > t.
221f the average and marginal payout ratios are equal and the future home

country tax liability on the retained earnings can be ignored, the firm pays

the home country tax on p of its earnings and only the host tax on the remainder.
                                  —28—




23The flexibility of transactions within the multinational firm is commonly

believed to proiiide some potential for tax avoidance. The fact that a

sizable volume of taxable dividend payments are made seems to imply that, in

general, the marginal method of transferring funds to the parent firm

produces a tax liability. See Horst (1977) for a thorough analysis of intra—

firm financial transactions.


24The U.S. law is designed to prevent tax avoidance at the termination of

the foreign operation. The Revenue Act of 1962 specified' that the sale or

liquidation of a foreign subsidiary produces ordinary income for tax purposes

to the extent of earnings previously reinvested. See Musgrave (1969).


     similar concerns arise from the standard discussions of the "excess

credits" case, i.e., the case of t   > t.
