The Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson Hypothesis: Real Exchange Rates and their Long-Run Equilibrium

                                              ABSTRACT

Frictionless, perfectly competitive traded-goods markets justify thinking of purchasing power parity
(PPP) as the main driver of exchange rates in the long-run. But differences in the traded/non-traded
sectors of economies tend to be persistent and affect movements in local price levels in ways that upset
the PPP balance (the underpinning of the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis, HBS). This paper
uses panel-data techniques on a broad collection of countries to investigate the long-run properties
of the PPP/HBS equilibrium using novel local projection methods for cointegrated systems. These
semi-parametric methods isolate the long-run behavior of the data from contaminating factors such
as frictions not explicitly modelled and thought to have effects only in the short-run. Absent the short-run
effects, we find that the estimated speed of reversion to long-run equilibrium is much higher. In addition,
the HBS effects means that the real exchange rate is converging not to a steady mean, but to a slowly
to a moving target. The common failure to properly model this effect also biases the estimated speed
of reversion downwards. Thus, the so-called "PPP puzzle" is not as bad as we thought.

1     Introduction
Parity conditions remain a key foundation of international macroeconomics. When exchange rates
and the prices of goods are fully flexible and trade between countries is frictionless, equilibrium
in perfectly competitive markets is characterized by goods selling at the same price everywhere
– the purchasing power parity (PPP) condition is a manifestation of this ideal equilibrium. By
analogy, in frictionless risk-neutral markets expected returns to different currency investments
should equalize – the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition being a manifestation of this
observation. In the real world, the costs of moving goods across oceans, tariffs, regulations, capital
controls, fear of floating, limits to arbitrage, and other frictions may undermine the basic premise
underlying PPP and UIP. Yet these mechanisms are so basic and so powerful that one would
expect them to hold to a first approximation and thus provide a basis to broadly characterize the
behavior of exchange rates, interest rates, and prices.
    Financial products can be seamlessly traded across the world at the speed of light but when
it comes to real economies, there are many goods (often associated with services) that cannot
be traded across borders. For this reason, comparisons of the economy-wide price levels in two
countries with their bilateral exchange rate will reflect not only PPP-related forces but also the
effects of differences in the relative prices of tradeable and non-tradeable goods. To the extent
that these differences are attributable to differences in economic development and these differences
persist over time, the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson (HBS) (Harrod 1933; Balassa 1964; Samuelson
1964) hypothesis extends the PPP condition to account for differences in productivity across
countries.
    This paper investigates explanations of long-run secular movements in exchange rates described
by the HBS effect. Several features of our work separate our contributions from an extensive
ongoing literature on this subject (see, inter alia, Chinn and Johnston 1996; Ito et al. 1999;
Halpern and Wyplosz 2001; Choudhri and Khan 2005; Lee and Tang 2007; Lothian and Taylor
2008).1      Our core principle has been to let the data speak for itself and for this reason we
use a relatively extensive collection of countries – 21 OECD countries to be precise. We then
investigate bilateral relationships of these OECD countries using both the U.S. and the “world”
as counterparties.
    However, perhaps the most innovative features of our analysis come from the statistical meth-
ods that we introduce: local projections for cointegrated systems. This approach, which extends
the local projections method introduced in Jordà (2005, 2009), allows for semi-parametric mea-

International Economics 1994 special issue.

surement of the dynamics of long-run equilibrium adjustment. Moreover, local projections provide
a natural and simple separation of these adjustment dynamics into the component explained purely
by long-run forces (encapsulated primarily in the HBS hypothesis) from the component explained
by frictions thought to have effects only in the short-run and for which no explicit economic justi-
fication is given nor sought in this paper. We hope that discerning readers will find the methods
useful for applications other than the one offered in this paper.
    Traditionally, cointegration is examined through the prism of a vector error-correction model
(VECM) but VECMs are difficult to extend to panels because they are parametrically intensive.
In addition, parametrically tractable specifications and the structure of VECMs restrict the range
of dynamics and half-lives that can be estimated from the data. Finally, conventional estimates
from these models offer half-live estimates that conflate the process of long-run adjustment (the
focus of this paper) with the effect of short-run frictions on long-run adjustment (not the focus of
this paper). To be sure, we are not advocating that forces other than those encapsulated by the
HBS effect are unimportant in explaining exchange rate movements. Much like a feather blown
by the wind returns to the ground by the force of gravity, so do exchange rates return to their
long-run equilibrium levels and the strength of this pull is the object of our interest. But just as
the flight of the feather follows the whimsy of the wind, so do exchange rates follow the whimsy
of forces whose characterization we reserve for future research.


2     Statistical Design
2.1    Preliminaries

We begin by presenting the basic set-up in a more traditional linear context to better communicate
the main ideas. Let et+1 denote the logarithm of the nominal exchange rate in terms of currency
units of domestic currency per units of foreign currency, let pt+1 and p∗t+1 denote the logarithm
of the price indices home and abroad. In the strict version of PPP without frictions and where
the price indices refer only to traded goods, then the real exchange rate defined as qt+1 = et+1 +
(p∗t+1 − pt+1 ) would only exhibit temporary fluctuations around a long-run equilibrium level, or in
time series parlance, it would be a stationary variable and hence implicitly define a cointegrating
vector. Similarly, let it and i∗t denote the one-period, risk-free interest rate home and abroad.
The UIP condition can be seen as a statement about the absence of arbitrage of a zero net
investment position. Specifically, let the variable momentum denoted as mt refer to the ex-ante
nominal excess returns of such an investment, i.e., mt+1 = (i∗t − it ) + ∆et+1 , then in the absence
of arbitrage opportunities the ex-ante value of momentum should be zero, that is Et mt+1 = (i∗t −
it ) + Et ∆et+1 = 0, which should make mt+1 a stationary and unpredictable variable. Momentum


                                                 2
can also be expressed in terms of real excess returns as

                                      mt+1 = (rt∗ − rt ) + ∆qt+1                                    (1)

where rt = it − π t+1 with π t+1 = ∆pt+1 , and similarly for rt∗ and π ∗t+1 ; and qt+1 = et+1 +
(p∗t+1 − pt+1 ) so that ∆qt+1 = ∆et+1 + π ∗t+1 − π t+1 . This reformulation of momentum with real
                                                      

variables makes the interaction between PPP and UIP more readily apparent. Finally, we extend
the formulation of the system with xt+1 and x∗t+1 , which denote the logarithm of home and abroad
productivity proxies. If qt+1 is not a stationary variable, persistent deviations from long-run
equilibrium could be explained by persistent productivity differentials (in the traded/non-traded
composition) between trading partners according to the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis.
The implication of this hypothesis can be stated in terms of the variable zt+1 = qt+1 − β(x∗t+1 −
xt+1 ), which should be stationary under the HBS hypothesis.
   The dynamic interactions between nominal exchange rates, inflation, interest rate and produc-
tivity differentials are the constituent elements of a system whose linear combinations explain the
dynamic behavior of HBS-adjusted PPP, and UIP jointly, specifically
                                                         
                                              ∆et+1
                                                         
                                        π ∗t+1 − π t+1 
                                                         
                              ∆yt+1 =                   .                                        (2)
                                               ∗
                                              it − it
                                                          
                                                         
                                                         
                                         ∆x∗t+1 − ∆xt+1

   Several features of this system deserve mention. We will show momentarily that et+1 , (p∗t+1 −
pt+1 ), and (x∗t+1 − xt+1 ) are I(1) variables but that they are cointegrated (and hence ∆yt+1 is
I(0)), a property that we exploit to derive the HBS-adjusted PPP relation below. In addition,
we will show formally (in Table 1 below) that each of the elements in ∆yt+1 is stationary with
appropriate panel unit root tests. The timing of the variable (i∗t − it ) may seem odd but simply
reflects the observation that at time t, the interest rate for delivery at time t + 1 is known. Finally,
appropriate panel cointegration tests reported in Table 2 show that zt+1 = qt+1 − β(x∗t+1 − xt+1 )
is a proper cointegration vector.
   Notice that expression (2) does not characterize the stochastic process we think ∆yt+1 may
follow. This is by design since we will be interested in calculating certain sample statistics of
interest without referencing to any one specific model. The tools required to estimate these
sample statistics are discussed in the next section.

2.2    Local Projections for Cointegrated Systems

Long-run equilibrium in exchange rates under the HBS hypothesis takes on the form zt+1 =
et+1 + (p∗t+1 − pt+1 ) − β(x∗t+1 − xt+1 ). When β = 0 this is clearly just the usual PPP condition.
We are interested in learning how long-run equilibrium is restored in response to shocks and how
this adjustment process manifests itself in the dynamics of nominal exchange rates and prices.
   In order to present our approach, we find it convenient to discuss the basic features of a typical
linear specification first. We do this with as general a notation as possible to accommodate
applications other than the one we pursue in this paper for the benefit of readers with other
applications in mind. Suppose yt is an n × 1 vector of non-stationary random variables, such as
that in expression (2), that is first-difference stationary with Wold representation:
                                                  ∞
                                                  X
                                         ∆yt =          Cj εt−j                                         (3)
                                                  j=0

where the constant and other deterministic components are omitted for convenience but without
                                                                    P∞
loss of generality. The n × n matrices Cj are such that C0 = In ;      j=0 j||Cj || < ∞ where

||Cj ||2 = tr(Cj0 Cj ); and εt is an n×1 vector white noise (relaxing these and subsequent assumptions
is certainly possible but distracting from the exposition of the main results here).
   Further, assume that yt has a finite vector autoregressive (VAR) representation of order p + 1
in the levels and given by
                               yt+1 = Φ1 yt + ... + Φp+1 yt−p + εt+1                                    (4)

where the Φj j = 1, ..., p + 1 are n × n coefficient matrices. Expression (4) can be equivalently
written (see e.g. Hamilton, 1994) as

                          yt+1 = Ψ1 ∆yt + ... + Ψp ∆yt−p+1 + Πyt + εt+1                                 (5)
                                                                Pp+1
with Ψj = − [Φj+1 + ... + Φp+1 ] , j = 1, ..., p and Π =          j=1   Φj . Subtracting yt from both sides
of expression (5) we obtain

                        ∆yt+1 = Ψ1 ∆yt + ... + Ψp ∆yt−p+1 + Ψ0 yt + εt+1                                (6)

where Ψ0 = Π − I = −Φ(1).
   When there is cointegration among the elements of yt , then there exists an n × k matrix A
such that zt = A0 yt is I(0) and contains the k cointegrating vectors. In our specific application
k = 1. Further, the n × n matrix Φ(1) is reduced-rank with rank k and thus can be expressed as
Φ(1) = BA0 where B is an n × k matrix so that expression (6) becomes the well-known error-
correction representation for yt . Notice that (3) can be recast as
                                          t
                                          X            ∞
                                                       X                  ∞
                                                                          X
                         yt = y0 + C(1)         εj +         Cj∗ εt−j −         Cj∗ ε−j
                                          j=1          j=0                j=0

and assuming for convenience that the initial conditions y0 and ε−j are zero, further simplified
into
                                                   t
                                                   X            ∞
                                                                X
                                    yt = C(1)            εj +         Cj∗ εt−j                     (7)
                                                   j=1          j=0

where the first term contains the stochastic trend components, the second term the cyclical com-
ponents and Cj∗ = − [Cj+1 + ...] , j = 0, 1, ... Expression (7) is the well-known Beveridge-Nelson
decomposition and when there is cointegration, A0 yt is stationary which implies that A0 C(1) = 0
and hence an impulse response representation for zt can be easily derived to be from (7)

                                                                  !

This is the essence of the Granger-representation theorem.
   In order to investigate how the dynamics of the long-run equilibrium relations in zt affect the
dynamic responses characterized by the terms Cj , we find it convenient to construct these terms
using projection arguments in a state-space representation of expressions (5) and (6), specifically

Therefore, it is easy to see that the impulse responses associated to the system in (2) due to a
shock to the long-run equilibrium are:

       IR(zt+h |A0 εt+1   = 1; Υt ) = EL (zt+h |A0 εt+1 = 1; Υt ) − EL (zt+h |A0 εt+1 = 0; Υt )   (12)

                                                         5
and

   IR(∆yt+h |A0 εt+1         1; Υt ) = EL ∆yt+h |A0 εt+1 = 1; Υt − EL ∆yt+h |A0 εt+1 = 0; Υt (13)
                                                                                           
                         =

                         =   Ch A = Gh[2,1] + Gh[2,2] A

   Several features of expressions (12) and (13) deserve comment. First, the definitions of the im-
pulse responses are somewhat unusual because they have the flavor of a dynamic average treatment
effect where the treatment is standardized to be A0 εt+1 = 1 and the non-treatment A0 εt+1 = 0.
That is, the impulse response focuses directly on disturbances to long-run equilibrium, but it
is not explicit about the source of this disturbance (i.e. we do not examine shocks to any one
particular element of ∆yt+1 ). In our application A is n × 1 so that zt+1 is scalar and A0 εt+1 = 1
is also scalar and uniquely determined. For this reason, we are not required to make the type
of identification assumption (such as the ubiquitous Cholesky assumptions) commonly found in
the vector autoregressive (VAR) literature regarding the constituent elements in ∆yt+1 . Second,
for reference to what has been traditional in the literature in the past we note that the usual
(not-orthogonalized) impulse responses analyzed correspond to the elements in Ch in expression
(13), which in our set up amounts to Gh[2,1] A0 + Gh[2,2] . Third, notice that the impulse responses in
expressions (12) and (13) depend on the sum of two components, Gh[i,1] and Gh[i,2] , i ∈ {1, 2}. The
terms Gh[i,1] describe the effect that adjustment to the long-run equilibrium zt has on the impulse
response. The terms Gh[i,2] describe instead the effect that the short-run dynamics in ∆yt+1 have
on the impulse response. In our application, such demarcation is very useful because it orthogo-
nalizes the dynamic response to the PPP-HBS term from the response to short-term frictions due
to unmodelled factors.
   It has been traditional to estimate vector error correction models (VECMs) and obtain esti-
mates of the system’s impulse responses (Ch ) with nonlinear transformations of the conditional
mean parameter estimates. Instead, we find it more convenient and suitable to the economic
question of interest to directly estimate the terms Gh[i,j] i, j ∈ {1, 2} with local projections (Jordà
2005, 2009) from expressions (11). This is advantageous for several reasons: (1) direct estimates
of expressions (11) can be done equation by equation with little loss of efficiency (see Jordà, 2005)
and therefore can be adapted directly to panel estimation. A VECM specification is too para-
metrically intensive in our application to afford sufficiently rich dynamics; (2) direct estimation
of (11) does not restrict the dynamics of the estimated impulse responses across periods and is
therefore robust to misspecification and generalizable to allow for nonlinear effects (see Jordà 2005
for examples in the stationary context); (3) because the coefficients in Gh[i0 j] i, j ∈ {1, 2} are com-
puted directly from regression, computation of standard errors is straight-forward. By contrast,


                                                    6
VECM estimates are based on nonlinear functions of estimated parameters with differing rates
of asymptotic convergence which complicates calculation of appropriate inferential procedures;
and (4) direct estimates provide the orthogonalization of the impulse responses that we seek in a
natural and uncomplicated way whereas orthogonalization with VECM estimates would require
complicated nonlinear transformations once again.
   To get a better sense of the large sample properties of the local projection estimator, consider
first the simpler non-panel case. Let ZH be the (T − p − H)×kH matrix that collects observations
                    0
for (zt+1 , ..., zt+H ) ; and let YH be the (T − p − H) × nH matrix that collects observations for
                        0
(∆yt+1 , ..., ∆yt+H ) . Next define the regressor matrices, with X a (T − p − H) × (k + n) matrix
                                                0
that collects observations for (zt , ∆yt ) and W a (T − p − H) × (1 + np) matrix that collects
                                            0
observations for (1, ∆yt−1 , ..., ∆yt−p ) . Notice that W collects all the regressors whose coefficients
are of no direct interest and hence the matrix M = I − W (W 0 W )−1 W 0 projects their effect away.
   A direct estimate of the Gh[i,j] given a first stage estimate of A0 by conventional methods (or
based on economic restrictions) can be found         easily with the local projection estimator

(13) can be constructed given estimates A,
                                        b G        b y . Further, since A0 is either imposed from
                                           b z and G

theory or superconsistently estimated from typical cointegration procedures, then the standard
regularity conditions made in expression (3) and the results in proposition 2 in Jordà and Kozicki
(2010) are all that is needed to show that
                                 p
                                  T − p − H (b
                                             gi − gi ) → N (0, Ωi ) ; i ∈ {z, y}

so that standard inferential procedures are readily available using (14) and (15).
   A convenient feature of the local projection approach discussed in Jordà (2005) is that to
estimate impulse responses in practice, one can obtain consistent estimates of the elements of
b h using equation-by-equation methods with little loss of efficiency when standard errors are
G [i,j]

calculated with non-parametric heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation robust (HAC) variance-
covariance matrix estimators. Since most econometric packages are well suited to estimate panel


                                                       7
regressions, and have pre-built routines for (HAC) variance-covariance estimators, we find useful
to take this more convenient approach since it lowers entry barriers to other researchers wishing
to use our methods.
   Extensions of the local projection estimator to panels in (11) is therefore straight-forward.
In our application, we estimate (11) equation by equation for the panel of countries we consider
and allow for country-fixed effects. It is well-known that in a regression model for panel data
containing lags of the endogenous variable, the within-groups estimator can be severely downward
biased when the serial correlation in the endogenous variable is high and the time series dimension
T is short, regardless of the cross-section dimension M. This is often called the Nickell (1981) bias
and a standard solution is to apply the Arellano and Bond (1991) GMM estimator. However, in
our setting T = 31 and M = 21 which perhaps is best characterized by T /M → c > 0, T, M → ∞
asymptotics. Alvarez and Arellano (2003) show that in this case, the within-group estimator has
a vanishing downward bias. In the simple case with no exogenous regressors and first order serial
correlation, this bias is (1/T )(1 + ρ), where ρ is the autocorrelation coefficient. For example, in
the extreme where ρ ≈ 1, the bias is approximately 0.06 given our sample size. However, the
crude GMM estimator in this case is inconsistent despite being consistent for fixed T. For this
reason we proceed with the within-group estimator. We remark on these issues because readers
may find the panel-cointegration impulse response estimator useful for other applications where
the rates at which M and T grow will differ from ours and where different estimation procedures
will be indicated. The reader is referred to Alvarez and Arellano (2003), who provide a very good
discussion on these issues.
   Summarizing, the half-life of the PPP/HBS relation can be estimated directly by regressing
leads of the cointegrating vector on its current values and on current and lagged values of ∆yt .
Standard errors for the relevant coefficients can be obtained by standard methods, which facilitate
construction of confidence bands. The approach has several advantages: although we use a linear
set-up to explain the method, it should be clear that ours is a semi-parametric method that does
not restrict the half-life to decay monotonically. More generally and as is discussed in Jordà (2005),
there is no obligation to rely on linear projections and one is free to examine nonlinear adjustment
to long-run equilibrium with nonlinear projections (an approach best left for another paper here).
Nonlinearities are easily accommodated with our equation-by-equation approach because they do
not require full blown specification of what the nonlinear stochastic process for the entire system
might be.

3     Data Description
We begin by describing the data. Our analysis is based on quarterly data over the 1973Q2–
2008Q4 period for 21 OECD countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Nominal exchange rates
and CPI data come mainly from the International Financial Statistics (IFS) database maintained
by the IMF, except for Germany’s CPI, available from the OECD’s Main Economic Indicators
database. CPI data are not seasonally adjusted at the source and therefore were harmonized with
the X11 procedure, which is the standard method of seasonal adjustment for many statistical
agencies. Data on GDP and GDP deflators (denoted PGDP) come primarily from the OECD’s
Outlook database (except for Germany, which comes from the IFS database). Interest rate data
come from the Global Financial database. A data file with full descriptions is available upon
request.2
    Throughout our analysis, lowercase symbols will always denote logarithms. Bilateral compar-
isons are made with respect to a reference country (denoted with the superscript * in expression
2). The U.S. is a natural counterparty and so is the “rest of the world.” We consider the latter as
it is well known that the choice of base country can substantially affect the statistical properties
of real exchange rate dynamics. In particular, induced cross-sectional dependence can be an issue
(see, e.g. O’Connell, 1998) and bias may result from the idiosyncratic behavior of a particular
base country (see, e.g. Taylor, 2002).
    In the case of the U.S. base, we construct for all other countries i the logarithms of real
                   US
exchange rates as qit = eU S   US
                         it + pt  − pit , where eU S
                                                 it is the log nominal exchange rate, denoted

in units of home currency per USD, and pit and pU

                                                    are the log CPI levels of the home country
                                            US
and the U.S., respectively. An increase in qit means a real depreciation of home currency, i.e.,
home goods are becoming less expensive relative to the U.S. The relative productivity term, or
HBS term, is naı̈vely measured by the log real GDP per capita ratio, xU S                      US
                                                                      t − xit , where xit and xt

denote the log real GDP per capita levels of the home country and the U.S., respectively. The
inflation differential is defined as π U

data were converted from national currency using official euro conversion rates. Consequently, “national currency”
in always refers to euro for the Euro area countries, and not the legacy currencies. Germany GDP data from the
IFS in billions of deutsche mark at quarterly level were converted to millions of Euro at annual level. Regarding
3-month interest rate series, in cases that 3-month interbank rates (IB) are not available, changes of alternative
rates were applied to the end IB observation to recover levels. The alternative rates we used as substitutes were
(in order of preference) the 3-month commercial paper rate, the 3-month T-bill rate, Government note yields, and
other fixed-income rates. For the 11 Euro area countries, the EuroLIBOR rates are spliced at the end.

the units are commensurate because the difference is taken over quarterly observations and the
interest rates are measured on a per quarter basis.
    We also generate a complete set of series relative to the “World” base, i.e., relative to the
average value of all other countries in the sample. The world-based series can be easily constructed
                                           US
using the U.S.-based series. Suppose that yi,t denotes the collection of U.S.-based variables for

i = 1, 2, ..., 21. To summarize the key features of our raw data for the HBS hypothesis, charts

3.1     Panel Unit Root Tests

For each of the 21 countries in our sample and each of the relevant variables in the system
of expression (2), Table 1 reports univariate unit root tests based on Elliott, Rothemberg and
Stock’s (1996) DF-GLS procedure. In addition, we also conduct Pesaran’s (2003) CADF test for
non-stationarity in heterogeneous panels with cross-section dependence. This test proposes as its
null hypothesis that all cross-section units in the panel are non-stationary and is consistent for
the alternative that all or only a fraction of the units are stationary. Under each variable-name
heading, the first column (in plain text) shows the test statistics for the U.S.-base series, and the
second column (in italics) refers to the “World”-base series.
    The individual DF-GLS test statistics suggest quite clearly that log CPI differentials (p∗t −
pit ), log nominal exchange rates (et ) and log real GDP per capita ratios (x∗t − xit ) are non-
stationary, whereas all elements in ∆yt+1 are stationary.3 However, the DF-GLS tests on log real
exchange rates (qt ), which are intended to check whether et+1 , (p∗t+1 − pt+1 ), and (x∗t+1 − xt+1 ) are
cointegrated, yield mixed evidence, especially those relative to the U.S. This is not too surprising.
Our data series have a short span: “only” four decades. A robust and powerful rejection of the
non-stationarity null with slowly-reverting series like real exchange rates may require a span of
data covering a century or more (Frankel 1986). Thus, we consider these short-span univariate
tests inconclusive.
    However, in the literature on real exchange rate dynamics, when long span data are not avail-

exchange rates (∆eit ), and first differences of log real GDP per capita ratio (∆x∗t − ∆xit ).

able, one widely used method to enhance the power of unit root tests is to employ panel methods
(see the discussion in Taylor and Taylor, 2004). The Pesaran CADF panel tests show that, at
the conventional significance level, that all x∗t − xit series in the panel are non-stationary, whearas
for any other variables, at least one series in the panel is stationary. As a result, we also test for
stationarity based on the magnitude of the test statistic. As large negative values of the CADF
statistic indicate rejections of null of universal non-stationarity, ∆eit , and ∆x∗t − ∆xit are shown
to be the variables most likely to be stationary, followed by i∗t − iit , π ∗t − π it , then by p∗t − pit , eit ,
and qit .
    Based on the weak power of the univariate tests, and the supportive panel results, one might
proceed under the assumption that the real exchange rate is stationary, in accord with the find-
ings from longer-span studies (e.g., Taylor, 2002). However, according to the HBS theory there is
another possibility: that the real exchange rate bears an equilibrium relationship to—and cointe-
grates with—a relative productivity proxy.

3.2     Panel Cointegration Tests

Thus, we next examine the cointegration properties between the real exchange rate, qit and the
productivity proxy differential, (x∗t − xit ), for reference base U.S. or “World.” We begin by testing
the null of no cointegration with the battery of seven residual-based test statistics presented in
Pedroni (1999).
    Each of these statistics is a panel version of the conventional univariate counterparts presented
in Phillips and Perron (1988) and Phillips and Ouliaris (1990). The first four statistics are based
on pooling the data across the within dimension of the panel, specifically, the panel-υ statistic is
a type of nonparametric variance ratio statistic, the panel-ρ statistic is analogous to the Phillips
and Perron (1998) ρ-statistic. Similarly, the nonparametric panel-t statistic is analogous to the
Phillips and Perron (1998) t-statistic, and finally the parametric t-statistic is a panel version of the
augmented Dickey Fuller t-statistic. The remaining three statistics are constructed by pooling the
data along the between-dimension of the panel. These statistics in effect compute the group mean
of the individual conventional time series statistics, and hence the name, group-mean statistics.
The group-ρ and group-t statistics are analogous to the Phillips and Perron (1998) ρ-statistic and
t-statistic, respectively; and the last parametric group-t statistic is analogous again to the ADF
t-statistic. For the panel-υ statistics, large positive values indicate rejection, whereas for all other
statistics, large negative values indicate rejection of the null.
    For our purposes, we implement Pedroni’s tests using estimated residuals from the equation

                                       qit = αi + β i (x∗t − xit ) + uit ,                                  (16)


                                                       12
where qit is the logarithm of the real exchange rate for country i, (x∗t − xit ) is the productivity
differential for country i, and each is computed using both the U.S. or World as the reference
country, the αi are country fixed-effects, and the β i are potentially heterogenous slope parameters
for each country. Allowing for heterogeneity in β i is important: it ensures that we do not bias the
results toward rejecting the null of no cointegration.
      However, these tests are not unproblematic. We should remark that the critical values tabu-
lated by Pedroni (1999, 2004) for these cointegration tests rely on the assumption of cross-sectional
independence in the error term, a condition that is likely to be violated when the reference country
is the U.S. but which is much alleviated when using the World as the reference country and one
makes further allowance for fixed (common) time effects in expression (16).
      Furthermore, Kremers, Ericsson, and Dolado (1992) suggest that the Pedroni-type residual-
based cointegration tests require the long-run cointegrating vector for the variables in the levels
to be equal to the short-run adjustment process for the variables in the differences. Failure of this
common factor restriction causes significant loss of power in the Pedroni procedures.
      For these reasons, we considered four additional cointegration tests proposed in Westerlund
(2007).4 These tests are based on residual tests that explicitly model short-run dynamics and do
not rely on the common factor assumption. They can also be implemented in such a way as to
allow for cross-sectional dependence.
      The four Westerlund (2007) tests are panel data extensions of the cointegration tests proposed
by Banerjee, Dolado, and Mestre (1998) and the underlying premise is to test the null of no
cointegration with residual based tests from regressions given by



                      ∆qit+1    = δ i + αi (qit − β i (x∗t − xit )) +                           (17)

                                       φij ∆qit−j +        γ ij ∆(x∗t−j − xit−j ) + uit .
                                     j=0               j=0

The panel statistics denoted Pτ and Pα (using the nomenclature in Westerlund, 2007) test the null
of no cointegration against the simultaneous alternative that the panel is cointegrated, whereas the
group mean statistics Gτ and Gα test the null of no cointegration against the alternative that at
least one element in the panel is cointegrated. We use the Barlett kernel to estimate the long-run
variances semi-parametrically, and obtain robust critical values with the bootstrap to account for
cross-sectional correlation.
      Table 2 summarizes the battery of Pedroni’s and Westerlund’s cointegration tests. The null
hypothesis of no cointegration between qit and x∗t − xit is rejected firmly by all Pedroni test

  4   These tests are implemented using STATA code prepared by Persyn and Westerlund (2008).

 2. The panel statistics test the null of no cointegration against the alternative that all units in the panel are
 cointegrated, whereas the group mean statistics test the null of no cointegration against the alternative that
 at least one element in the panel is cointegrated. The significance of the pedroni's test statistics is
 determined by standard nomal critical values, while the significance of the Westerlund's (2007) test statistics
 is determined by the robust critical values generated by 1000 times bootstraps. *, ** and *** indicate 10%,
 5% and 1% rejection levels, respectively.
 3. The optimum lag length in the ADF-type regression of Pedroni's tests is selected by Schwarz information
 criterion with a maximum 12 lags. The fixed number of lags pi to be included in the error correction equations
 of Westerlund's tests is determined by Akaike information criterion from 0 to 2 lags for each separate series.



statistics, for both the US-base and “World”-base data. However, these rejections, especially
when the reference country is the U.S. may not be as strong as they appear to be. This is due
to the fact that we evaluate the significance of the Pedroni’s standardized test statistics using
N (0, 1) critical values, despite possible cross-sectional independence. In contrast, the significance
of the Westerlund test statistics is determined by robust critical values generated by 1000-time
bootstraps. The null of no cointegration is rejected by all four of the Westerlund test statistics
at the 1% significance level for the “World”-base series, while only by the Pα statistic at the 5%
level for the US-base series. Overall, the panel cointegration tests indicate that qit and x∗t − xit
are cointegrated, especially those relative to the “World”-base.


4     Estimating the HBS Cointegrating Vector
In estimating the panel cointegrating vector, we employ the group-mean panel DOLS estimator
suggested in Pedroni (2001). As he points out, the point estimates for these between-dimension
estimators can be interpreted as the mean value for the cointegrating vectors in the event that
the true cointegrating vectors are heterogeneous. Specifically, Pedroni (2000) shows that the
between-dimension estimators appear to suffer from much lower small-sample size distortion than
the within-dimension estimators.
    To obtain the group mean panel DOLS estimator, we first estimate country-specific cointe-
grating vectors using dynamic OLS suggested by Phillips and Loretan (1991).The DOLS for an
individual country is formulated as:



                                                        14
                                                    pi

                  qi,t = αi + β i (xi,t − x∗t ) +           θi,s (∆xi,t+s − ∆x∗t+s ) + µi,t ,   (18)
                                                    s=−pi

where asterisk denotes either the US or the “World” counterparts. The country-specific optimal
numbers of lags and leads, pi are selected by AIC. Next we construct the group-mean panel DOLS
                                                      PN
estimator according to Pedroni (2001), β̂ GM = N −1 i=1 β̂ i , where β̂ i is the DOLS estimator,
applied to the ith country of the panel. The associated t-statistic for the between-dimension
                                                   PN
estimator above can be constructed as tβ̂ = N −1/2 i=1 tβ̂ . As can be seen clearly from the
                                             GM                          i

group mean formula, the panel estimate of the cointegrating vector is an average of the estimated
individual cointegrating vectors.
   Table 3 reports the estimated individual slopes, β̂ i , and group mean slope, β̂ GM for our HBS
term, for the U.S. and “World” base cases. A few results are worth noting. First, the point
estimates are positive in most cases as predicted by the HBS theory, albeit they do vary greatly
among different countries. Second, the slopes estimated with the “World”-base data are in general
steeper and more significant than the corresponding ones estimated with the U.S.-base data. As
a result, the “World”-base group mean slope estimate is about twice the size of the U.S.-base one,
though both are positive and statistically significant at the 1% level.
   The positive group mean estimate leads us to conclude that the HBS effect is present in the
panel, even though there is substantial variation in point estimates (and wide confidence bands)
as we look at individual countries. A slope of 0.57 for the U.S. base and 0.78 for the world base
is suggestive of an economically meaningful and qualitatively significant elasticity of price levels
with respect real income levels, and, within the range of estimation uncertainty, is consistent with
reasonable values for the share of nontraded goods in typical theoretical models of the HBS effect.
   To clearly illustrate the magnitude of these effects, Figure 1(a) plots the HBS slope estimates
(individual and group mean) for the full sample using the U.S. base, where the group mean is
0.57. Figure 1(b) repeats the exercise when the panel estimation is limited to the 6 countries
(top tercile) for which the largest HBS slope coefficient is found; for this group all coefficients
are significant and the group mean slope estimate rises to 1.77. Figure 2 repeats this exercise for
the “World” base, where the group mean is 0.78 for the full sample and 1.72 in the case of the
6 top tercile countries. These results support the hypothesis that an HBS effect is present, and
although possibly heterogeneous, it could be qualitatively large in some subset of the countries
in our sample. It now remains to be seen whether the existence of such effects makes a material
difference to the methods used to assess the dynamic speed of adjustment of the real exchange
rate to its long run equilibrium value.

5     Estimating Half-lives of Deviations from Equilibrium
The previous sections provide supporting evidence that recommends analyzing the system in
expression (2) using zt = qt − β(x∗t − xt ) as the cointegrating vector. We proceed by defining the
system’s cointegrating vector for each country i as zit = qit − β̂ GM (x∗it − xit ), where β̂ GM is the
group mean slope estimate which is applied as a homogenous slope to all units in the panel.
    The key results are shown in Figures 3 through 6. Each figure has an identical format for
consistent presentation. The top panel of each of these figures (labeled “panel (a)”) displays
two impulse responses to a unit shock to long-run equilibrium when the HBS term is excluded
(so that we have pure PPP effects only). The left-hand graph displays the traditional response,
which conflates long-run and short-run dynamics, as we explained previously (these are labeled
“incorrect”). The right-hand graph displays the response that isolates the long-run dynamics only
(and are therefore labeled “correct”). The bottom panels of each of Figures 3 to 6 (labeled “panel
(b)”) are organized like those in panel (a) but they refer to the case when HBS effects are included
instead.
    While there is no ambiguity when constructing the long-run response to a shock in z (the



                                                  18
response labeled correct), the short-run responses will vary depending on the sources of the shock
to z (and the responses labeled incorrect will also vary). In order to stack the odds against our
procedures, we decided to construct a unit disturbance in z using weights inverse to the variability
(measured by the mean absolute deviation) of each component in the cointegrating vector (i.e.,
nominal exchange rates, price levels and productivity differentials) in the differences. We also
experimented with weights determined by the cointegrating relation itself, but these resulted in
incorrect responses with even longer total half-lives and wider confidence bands than the ones
reported in Figures 3 to 6.
   Next, Figures 3 and 4 use the U.S. as the reference country whereas Figures 5 and 6 use the
“World” as the base. Finally, the differences between figures for a given country (3 versus 4 for
the U.S. base and 5 versus 6 for the World base) refer to whether we look at all countries in our
sample (Figures 3 and 5), or else the top tercile of countries by the size of the HBS effect in the
cointegrating term (Figures 4 and 6). It is this last subset of graphs where one would expect to
find that HBS effects are strongest and this will prove to be correct. Simultaneous confidence
regions with 95% coverage are reported using Scheffé bands (see Jordà 2009).
   Several results deserve comment. First, there are no significant differences arising from whether
we use the US or the World as the base country – the conclusions are qualitatively and quantita-
tively similar. Second, half-lives computed from incorrect responses are uniformly longer (by as
much as five quarters) than the correct responses. Moreover, the contaminating effect of short-run
dynamics is clearly visible in the lack of smoothness and imprecision that the incorrect responses
display. In contrast, correct responses are smoother and much more precisely estimated. Third,
Figures 4 and 6, which correspond to the experiments based on the top tercile of countries by
the strength of the HBS effect in the cointegration term, show that the inclusion of the HBS
term (seen by comparing panels (a) and (b) in these figures) results in a considerable reduction
in estimated half-lives in the correct responses.
   This is one of our principal findings: omitting the HBS effect, as is common, leads to an up-
wardly biased estimate of the half-lives of deviations from real exchange rate equilibrium. However,
this depends on the correct modeling of the dynamics.
   Interestingly, the effect on the incorrect responses is ambiguous: for example, in Figure 4
(US base) the incorrect response actually results in a longer half-live when the HBS term is
included, whereas in Figure 6 the effect is the opposite. Half-live estimates from incorrect responses
corresponds with what has been found in the previous “PPP puzzle” literature. For example, Glen
(1992), using nine countries over the period 1900-1987 found half-lives of 3.3 years. Our estimates
using the World as the base result in a half-live estimate of 3 years, as can be seen in Figure

5(b). Taylor (2002), using 20 countries (mostly in the OECD) for the period 1850-1996 reports
mean and median half-lives of 2-3 years. Using more complex nonlinear specifications based on
an exponential smooth transition model, Peel, Sarno and Taylor (2001) found half-lives in the
3-5year range using four bilateral dollar exchange rates for the recent free floating period.
    These results are reassuring because they suggest that neither the use of a local projection
estimator; the specific cross-section of countries considered; the time period used; the frequency
of the data; the linearity of the specification; nor the country used as base explain the differences
between the literature and our findings. Rather, the main result that half-lives are about three
to five quarters shorter than previously estimated is driven primarily by correctly allowing for
the contribution of the HBS effect to long-run equilibrium adjustment. And to this end, it is
important to isolate the contaminating effects of short-run frictions, which our local projection
estimator for cointegrated systems clearly shows how to do.


6     Conclusion
Models of open economies describe the behavior of aggregate variables over medium- and long-run
frequencies meant to reflect the time-scale of relevant policy questions. A central ingredient of
such models is an assumptions about how secular movements in exchange rates are determined.
In this respect, it has been traditional to focus on equilibrium conditions in fully flexible and
frictionless markets, such as the well-known PPP and UIP conditions. While basic and powerful,
these mechanisms have found precarious support in the data.
    Harrod (1933), Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) extended the notion of the PPP conditions
to account for differences in the traded/non-traded sectors across economies that may persist over
time due to differences in productivity. This paper investigates whether this mechanism provides
sufficient texture to explain movements of exchange rates in the long-run by introducing new
empirical methods whose applicability transcends this paper.
    We take the view that there are many factors that influence exchange rates but we are interested
in those whose effects are felt over the long-run rather than those whose effects are short-lived.
The methods that we introduce are not simply another way of answering this question: they
provide a decomposition of the data that is central to obtaining the correct answer.
    The local projection approach serves to formulate how one can measure adjustment to long-run
equilibrium in terms of the intrinsic long-run dynamics that the PPP/HBS hypothesis generates
from all other factors whose role is limited to explain short-run movements. Previous studies do
not make this distinction and hence provide contaminated measures of the HBS hypothesis. Not
surprisingly, we find that empirical estimates of half-lives are considerably shorter than what has


                                                 24
been previously reported. Such finding provide support not only for the HBS hypothesis, but also
for the view that equilibrium adjustment speeds are not so puzzling.
   The local projection approach for cointegrated systems is an important econometric contribu-
tion in its own right. The methods not only proved useful in our application but also open the
door for more sophisticated analysis of non-linear error correction adjustments that have been
hitherto complicated by the need to specify nonlinear stochastic processes for the entire system of
variables considered. It is our hope that this paper will also help to illustrate the advantages of
this approach and inspire further applications.
