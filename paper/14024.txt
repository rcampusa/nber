                                              ABSTRACT

Trade between the whole of Africa and China (imports and exports summed) grew from $10.6 billion
to $73.3 billion between 2000 and 2007, and between Sub-Saharan Africa and China from $7 billion
to $59 billion over the same period. China is now Africa's third largest trading partner behind the EU
and the US. The Chinese FDI stock in Africa has grown from $49 million in 1990 to $2.6 billion in
2006. On the basis of these data, one frequently hears the claim that China is now a dominant influence
in Africa. Here we both evaluate such claims, and assess what factors underlay this phenomenon. We
suggest that while the annual growth rates of trade and investment flows are high (around 30% per
year sine the late 1990's), the levels are still considerably smaller than such claims might suggest. China
in 2006 accounted for only $520 million of inward FDI compared to a total from all sources of $36
billion, around 1.4% of total FDI inflows to Africa; and only 8.6% of African exports and 9.6% of
African imports. African interdependence with China thus remains proportionally smaller than that
for most other geographical areas, but is growing rapidly. Factors behind this growth are discussed
in the text.

1.   Introduction

Trade between China and the whole of Africa (exports and imports summed) rose from
$10.6 billion to $73.3 billion between 2000 and 20072, growing at rates in the order of
30% per year. Trade between Sub-Saharan Africa and China increased over the same
years from $7 billion to $59 billion3, growing at 30% per year. China has become the
third largest African trading partner4, behind the U.S. and EU. FDI inflows to Africa from
China are now growing at similar rates. China’s FDI outward stock in Africa increased to
$2.56 billion in 2006 from $49.2 million in 1990 and FDI outflows from China to Africa
reached $520 million in 2006 up from $1.5 million in 1991.5 In 2006, China accounted
for 8.6% of total Africa’s exports and 9.6% of its imports,6 and 1.4% of the continent’s
FDI inflows. The value of Chinese Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Africa
was $2.3 billion in 2006,7 or 8.4% of total ODA to Africa.

China now accounts for around 9% of Africa’s oil and gas exports, 8 and comparable
amounts of Africa’s other key mineral exports (copper, gold, platinum, manganese, and
etc). At the margin, China thus appears to be an increasingly substantial engine of growth
in Africa, and this is for an economy which (at official exchange rates) may still have
GDP per capita of only US$1500 per year, in contrast to the US$30,000 range for most
OECD states. For now, the levels are still modest, but growing rapidly.

In this paper, we document the size and rate of change of this growing presence, focusing
primarily on trade and finance.9 We draw on secondary sources, including the recent IMF
Direction of Trade Statistics 2006 Yearbook, 2006/2007 OECD & AfDB’s African
Economic Outlook report, UNCTAD Handbook of Statistics 2006-2007, and the 2007
UNCTAD’s Asian Foreign Direct Investment in Africa report and others to provide a
macro sub-continental picture, but also evaluate its concentration by type (resources,
construction, etc) and by country. We also discuss its rate of change, and projections of
its growth. Inevitably, given that these developments are so recent, we are forced to use
incomplete and often anecdotal information in putting the overall picture together.

What lies behind these developments seems to involve a number of factors. Clearly
China’s size and rapid GDP growth are clearly central, and to some degree these
developments in Africa simply reflect a rapidly growing Chinese engagement globally
rather than just in Africa. Chinese enterprises are now active in Latin Africa and in
Europe, particularly in Ireland, Bulgaria and Romania. Some inside and outside China,
and somewhat tongue-in-cheek, have suggested that growing Chinese presence in all
these regions reflects Mao’s military strategy in the interwar years in China of
surrounding the towns (the OECD in global development terms) by expanding the
villages (Africa, Latin America, and the fringes of Europe).

But we also argue that there are other factors which come into play in the African case.
One is clearly China’s concern to achieve more security of supply for resources (and
especially oil and gas), rather than relying on global markets. Another is the search for
new avenues to deploy large foreign exchange reserves, and the sense in China of
potential political opposition in North America (but also in Europe) to proposed reserve
financed buyouts, for example the Union Oil Company of California (UNOCAL) in the
US three years ago. The strong commitment at the upper echelons of government in
China to speed the growth and development of countries now poorer than China is also
important. The approach is to set on one side human rights and governance concerns
which have restrained OECD flows in the past and directly use commercial arrangements
to fuel growth and development in Africa; in effect, filling the partial void now left in
Africa by the OECD. The recent extensive spread of elected governments in Africa and
infrastructure improvements further fuels these factors.

Responses to new adjustment resisting trade measures in the OECD against China in
textiles and apparel as the Multi-Fiber arrangement (MFA) has been terminated as well,
although the initial reaction of Chinese investors to MFA removal was to repatriate quota
hopping foreign investment in China. Only subsequently as new measures have been
applied to China, has barrier circumventing investment in this sector returned (see
Dayaratna-Banda and Whalley (2007)). But clearly if these OECD adjustment resisting
measures spread to other product areas (such as autos and electronics), the effect on
Chinese FDI flows to Africa could be even larger. Also entering from anecdotal accounts
are responses by Chinese enterprises to attempts in China by government agencies to
limit corrupt practices by developing new activities in what are seen by such enterprises
as lax accounting standard countries. Thus, multiple factors driving the recent growth of
Chinese presence in Africa each seem to play a role.

The impact of these developments on Africa has been both significant and positive.
Growth rates have been elevated, and with positive impacts on poverty alleviation. Given
China’s present and projected expansion in Africa over coming decades, future impacts
will be even more pronounced. There are issues involving the delivery of this assistance
(including links to corrupt practices), but in the main these flows provide large and
largely untied development finance for Africa (in contrast to present conditional OECD
flows) which impacts directly and positively on living standards and poverty alleviation
across the continent. And if this presence continues to grow, China may eventually prove
to be the new African growth engine that the OECD has hesitated to become.

Implications follow for OECD policy toward Africa, and we briefly mention other non-
OECD country activity in Africa, including India and Brazil. Africa may thus be but a
small part of a rapidly changing global economic structure in which China is centrally
involved, but for Africa this will likely prove to be highly significant.

This paper is organized as follows: section 3 summarizes China-Africa trade and China’s
investment in Africa. Section 4 discusses the broad orientation of China’s policy in
Africa and sets out data on China’s aid to the continent and its effects on its economy. A
more detailed analysis of China-Africa activity in energy and mineral resources is
outlined in section 5. Textile and apparel trade is discussed in section 6. Some concluding
remarks, including discussion of potential links to corrupt practices in China, are set out
in section 7.

2.    Sino-Africa Trade and Investment Flows

China-Africa trade has increased sharply since 2000 when a formal China-Africa
Cooperation Forum was initiated. 10 As figure 1 indicates, China’s bilateral trade with
Africa grew from $10.6 billion in 2000 to $18 billion in 2003, $30 billion in 2004, $40
billion in 2005, $55 billion in 2006, and $73 billion in 2007. About two-thirds of all
African exports to China are oil and related products.11 This trade is expected to grow to
$100 billion by 2010. Figure 2 shows the rapidly growing share of China’s trade that
Africa represents. China is now the continent's third most-important export market,
behind the EU and the United States.12 In 2005, for the first time, China became the
largest individual country exporter for Sub-Saharan Africa with a market share of 7.7%
and $13.4 billion in exports. 13 By 2010, the projections are for China to be Africa’s
leading trading partner overall.

In large part, this growth reflects trade in energy and mineral products, but it also reflects
China’s trade policies. In an effort to promote trade with the continent, China removed
tariffs on 196 imports from 28 least developed Africa countries in 2005. While by the end
of 2006, duty-free imports from Africa were put at $350 million, covering sesame, copper
products, sheepskins, cocoa and other products, in July 2007, China expanded the
coverage of African exports exempt from tariffs to 454 items. These included agricultural

mechanical and electric products. Currently, most African exports now receive duty-free
access to China’s market. These policy initiatives have also helped expand African
exports to China.

Table 1 reports data on China’s top 10 African trading partners. Mineral resources have
been as an especially important part of the growing trade. There is only limited African-
China trade in intermediate goods, apart from those used in textiles and agro business,
and for now seemingly little incorporation of Sub-Saharan Africa into China coordinated
global value chains.

For Sub-Saharan Africa, the share of Africa’s total exports to China in five key
commodities (oil, iron ore, logs, diamonds and cotton) increased to more than 80 percent
in 2005, up from less than 50 percent in 1995. Available studies14 suggest that between
1998 and 2003 show that China may have accounted for most of the increase in global
demand for basic minerals and metals: 99 percent for nickel, 96 percent for steel, 76
percent for aluminum and 100 percent for copper. Indeed the continent’s exports to China
increased more than 50 percent per annum as China’s demand for raw materials and oil
increased sharply during this period. Similar growth rates apply for the period after 2003.
As table 1 also shows, resource trade from Angola, Sudan, Algeria, Congo (Rep),
Equatorial Guinea and South Africa accounts for the most part of China’s imports from
Africa. China’s imports of manufactured products from Sub-Saharan Africa are also
growing, but are geographically concentrated in Nigeria, South Africa, Morocco, Algeria
and Egypt.15

Meanwhile, for seven Sub-Saharan African countries, China has become their largest
trading partner in terms of total imports. Sudan, which in recent years has expanded
energy trade with China, has the largest import share with China accounting for more that
14 percent of its total imports. This is followed by Tanzania and Ghana with 9.1 percent,
Nigeria with 7.1 percent, Kenya and Ethiopia with 6.4 percent and Uganda with 5.1
percent.16 The majority of these imports are manufactures.

This rapid import growth is linked to recent stronger African growth performance.
African Development Bank and IMF data both show that African economic growth rate
reached 5.7 percent in 2006 17 and 6.2 percent in 2007 18 , and is expected to reach 8
percent in 200819. This faster African growth reflects strong demand for oil and mineral
resources outside of Africa.

But more FDI flowing into Africa and stronger agricultural performance have also
contributed to this growth. Having received $2.2 billion worth of FDI from all sources
during the 1980s, Africa currently attracts approximately $36 billion worth of FDI
inflows.20 FDI inflows to Africa from China, as figure 3 reports, were only $520 million
in 2006, a small part of this total, but FDI into Africa from China has still dramatically
increased during the years since 2003.

Table 2 reports data on the stock of China’s FDI in Africa as of 2005 and compares the
situation to 1990 reflecting the rapid growth. These Chinese FDI activities are seemingly
different from those which are sourced from North America or the EU. FDI from the
developed world is delivered by privately-owned enterprises focusing on profits over a
specified period of time, and involves minimal risk. China’s FDI on the sub-continent is
more heavily undertaken by either partially or wholly state-owned enterprises. These
have the objective of not simply making short term profits, but also forming long-lasting
relationships with communities and governments. They are assisted in part by access to
low-cost capital seemingly financed by low interest foreign exchange loans drawn for
China’s reserves. Due to China’s increasing demands for resources to fuel high economic
growth, a number of investments in Africa are linked to securing strategic reserves of
mineral resources for Chinese industries.

This FDI surge (admittedly from a small base) is in part a response to the Chinese
government’s strategic call of “go out”. 21 Chinese investors have established joint-
ventures with local investors across the continent in a number of sectors, particularly in
oil, agriculture, agribusiness, textile and light manufacturing sectors. Chinese FDI in
agriculture has been strongly supported by African governments given their commitment
to food security. For the most part, these investments have helped raise GDP growth
across Africa. Chinese investments have also provided a mechanism for assisting Chinese
business to circumvent trade restrictions in the OECD against direct textile and apparel
exports from China. These have helped to build local capacity, transfer technology and
raise export levels for several African states. In Zimbabwe, for instance, for which
tobacco has been among its top exports, Chinese investors have helped Zimbabwe
process tobacco into cigarettes and export these as finished value-added products.
Chinese investors and local company have also formed joint ventures to establish a large
cement factory in Gweru to meet national demand.22

These Chinese investments can be found in a wide variety of sectors, including so-called
fragile states and projects that western investors have seemingly deemed too risky. In
Mozambique, for example, Chinese companies have recently invested in a large new
shopping center and an industrial warehouse in the capital, Maputo. They have also
financed a Soya processing plant, reportedly worth $10 million and in a facility

processing prawns worth an estimated $12 million. 23 In Zambia, China has invested
nearly $160 million in the mining sector.24 In the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), a country with prior civil conflicts and political instability, China has investments
in cobalt and copper. In Sierra Leone, another country emerging from a devastating civil
war, China is now developing a luxury hotel and making other investments – going
where others would seemingly fear to tread. In Uganda, a Chinese pharmaceutical firm is
producing a new anti-malaria drug, and bidding on contracts to supply treated bed nets.25

Outside of the oil sector, the most significant investments by Chinese firms have been in
infrastructural projects. For example, Chinese firms have been actively involved in the
reconstruction of roads around Mozambique, where approximately two-thirds of the
country’s 600 km of roads have been reconstructed by Chinese multinationals. On the
border between Mozambique and Tanzania, Chinese firms have also won a tender to
rebuild a large bridge carrying cross border trade between the two countries. They have
also recently won tenders to repair water treatment plants in Beira and Quelimane
reportedly worth $15 million and in Maputo worth more than $30 million.26 In Zimbabwe,
China is investing in minerals, roads and farming.

Chinese enterprises have also bought a 70 percent stake in the Zimbabwe’s only
electricity generation facilities at Hwange and Kariba,27 and a significant stake in the
national railway. In Zambia, Chinese investors are working on a $600 million
hydroelectric plant at Kafue Gorge. 28 In Angola, 30 percent of a $2 billion soft loan
offered by China has gone to finance the building of railroads, schools, roads, hospitals
and bridges.29 In the DRC, China has begun work on roads to facilitate mineral exports,
and has evaluated potential future power projects as well.30

This growth of Chinese FDI (and primarily in resources, construction and infrastructure)
reflects a Chinese decision at high level to contribute to South-South cooperation through
mutually beneficial commercial relationships with the African continent. But at the same
time, it also reflects commercial decisions made by individual Chinese enterprises. One
claim supporting this is that Chinese enterprises have been successful in delivering
comparable infrastructure projects at prices between 25 percent and 50 percent less than
those other foreign investors charge.31

Anecdotal evidence also suggests a combination of factors that have allowed Chinese
enterprises to both outbid and outperform Western counterparts across the continent in
their investment activity. These include the use of cheaper Chinese materials; ample
supply of Chinese labor which is often even less expensive than local labor and willing to
live in isolated communities; access to subsidies provided by the Chinese Government to
invest overseas and cheaper capital than local investors; as well as less pressure by the
Chinese Government for state-owned companies to adhere to strict environmental and
labor standards.

Especially important in the growing FDI picture are infrastructure projects and
development initiatives by Chinese state-owned companies across the continent, even in
countries without abundant mineral resources. Some have been directly aid funded
infrastructure projects assisting Africa governments. For example, in Guinea Bissau,
China paid for the tiles and marbles of the parliamentary buildings. In East Africa, China
provided financial support for, and assisted with the construction of new foreign ministry
buildings and stadiums in both Djibouti and Uganda. All of these reflect the commitment
by China to development and poverty alleviation programs for the continent.

While it is worth emphasizing that FDI from China is still small relative to total flows
into Africa, its growth is rapid. Importantly, this recent growth in Chinese presence in
Africa coexists with relatively stagnant OECD inflows despite government attempts to
promote it. For instance, the US has, in recent years, initiated a plan "promoting African
economic growth and opportunity partnership" aimed at encouraging American
companies to enter African markets.32 But the aggregate impact has been small. European
countries such as France have traditionally regarded Africa as their market due to
colonial and linguistic ties as well as cultural factors. In 2006, European Union accounted
for 32 percent of all Sub-Saharan exports, and its investment in Africa accounted for 36.6
percent of total investments on the continent.33 Data for the US were 29.6 percent and 37
percent respectively. 34 Western states have maintained close relationships with Africa
through language, information linkage and personnel exchanges, which assist in trade and
finance and give Western countries substantial advantages. In comparison, Chinese
enterprises have had to face disadvantages in language and culture differences. China’s
ability to rapidly expand its share of African trade and finance is thus all the more
remarkable.

China’s red carpet treatment for 50 of Africa’s Heads of State in November 2006, which
formally commemorated five decades of Sino-African relations, bears testimony to the
continent’s current economic importance as seen from Beijing. High-profile state visits
by top Chinese officials, including the Chinese President Hu Jintao and Chinese Premier

Wen Jiabao to dozens of African states in recent months underscore its perceived
importance. These visits occurred shortly after pledges to increase China’s aid to Africa
from $2.3 billion in 2006 to $10 billion by 200935 (in comparison, U.S. aid to Africa is to
reach $9 billion by 201036, and EU aid to Africa more than $20 billion depending on the
next EU budget37), and to further expand China’s trade and Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) with the continent.

3. The objectives behind China’s Africa Policy

A key element in understanding what is behind the growth in China’s involvement in
Africa is the central Chinese precept that business should not be mixed with politics.
China’s growing presence in Africa thus largely reflects commercial rather than other
political considerations. To underscore the point, Chinese officials have repeatedly
argued that attempts by other countries to link positions on democracy and human rights
to economic integration violate the rights of sovereign countries. This position is
reflected by in comments of China’s deputy foreign minister, Zhou Wenzhong: “Business
is business. We try to separate politics from business…. You [the West] have tried to
impose a market economy and multiparty democracy on these countries which are not
ready for it. We are also against embargoes, which you have tried to use against us.”38

This is in contrast to a seemingly Western policy of linking aid to African recipients to
Western values or specific development models for African countries. In the process,
Western governments have often set meeting political indicators in areas such as
democracy, freedom, openness, transparency, and human rights as criteria for aid.39 In
contrast, China has promoted what it calls the "Beijing consensus" 40 in Africa by
providing unconditional aid to African countries. This reflects an underlying Chinese
position of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs and respecting country rights
to choose the road of development that best suits them. In its financial dealings with
Africa, either through aid or FDI, China thus does not typically use links to policy to
impose its own value system or development model on African economies.

With Western aid increasingly tied to human rights and Western notions of economic
reform, Africa has welcomed China’s unconditional aid approach. Thus, when the
Angolan government hesitated over accepting an IMF loan linked to transparency in its
oil revenue accounting, the Chinese Export-Import Bank offered an interest-free loan
with no such accounting required.41 China also similarly funded infrastructure projects
such as railroad, schools, roads, hospitals and bridges as well as laying a fiber-optic
network.in Angola. In these cases, the wider Chinese interest was perceived to lie in
developing country to country relationships in the anticipation that resource project
approvals would follow. One could claim that narrower self interest still prevailed, but it
remains the case that such aid was untied; it promoted development, and had not been
forthcoming from much wealthier OECD countries.

Equally, when the UN Security Council proposed sanctions against Sudan because of the
Darfur situation, Beijing insisted on their position set out above, namely “the internal
situation in the Sudan is an internal affair, and China is not in a position to impose upon
Khartoum.”42 China then provided assistance in other ways. To help Sudan develop its oil
industry, PetroChina invested $2.7 billion in Sudan, built a 1506km oil pipeline, a crude
processing plant with an annual capacity of 2.5m tons, and several gas stations.43 This not
only changed Sudan from an oil importing to an oil exporting country, but also ensured
Sudan had an integrated oil industry structure covering exploration, production, refining
and transport for sales. In addition, China subsequently invested over $20 million to help
the Sudan build other facilities, including schools and hospitals. 44 This unconditional
investment and aid has flowed quickly into Sudan since China adopted a policy of non
involvement in Sudan’s domestic affairs. But China’s principle of not interfering in other
countries' internal affairs through conditional aid or FDI has not restrained China from
pursuing humanitarian concerns in Africa. For example, in 2004, China contributed 1,500
peacekeepers to UN missions across Africa, such as in Liberia.

Along with growing Chinese trade and foreign direct investment in Africa, Chinese aid to
Africa has also grown correspondingly. China began to provide official development
assistance and debt relief from the mid 1950s on. From 1956 to May 2006, it contributed
a total of $5.7 billion45 for more than 800 aid projects.46 Meanwhile, the value of Chinese
aid in Africa reportedly reached $2.3 billion in 2006. More recently, China has aimed to
keep to its long-standing commitments made to the continent in the early 1990s, by
providing financial assistance and facilitating the forgiveness of loans. More recently, the
third summit of the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation, held from 3 to 5 November
2006, took a number of steps in this direction. China pledged to double its 2006 aid flows
to Africa by 2009. China also cancelled all debt stemming from Chinese interest-free
government loans that matured at the end of 2005, estimated to have reached
approximately $1.4 billion, for the 31 highly indebted and least developed countries
(LDCs) on the continent which had diplomatic relations with Beijing.

China also provided $3 billion in preferential loans and $2 billion in preferential buyer’s
credit to African states, and offered zero-tariff treatment for various exports to China
from 30 of the least developed African countries. In order to further promote China’s FDI
in Africa and bilateral trade, a China-Africa development fund of $5 billion was set up by
the Chinese government to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Africa and provide
support to them. In the meantime, China further opened its market to Africa, increasing
from 190 to over 440 the number of export items to Beijing receiving zero-tariff
treatment from the African LDCs.47

There has also been further assistance beyond direct financial flows. In Liberia, as well as
in Mozambique48, China has signed a memo, canceling all debts owing to it by these
states – which jointly amounted to more than $35 million.49 In Liberia’s case, Beijing
specially introduced a tariff exemption policy for all imports from Liberia.

Another element in this picture is China’s participation in the African Development Bank.
China joined both the African Development Bank Group's (AfDB) 50 and the African
Development Fund in 1985. Currently, China has 24,230 shares, or a 1.117 percent stake
in the AfDB. Since joining, China has donated $314 million to the African Development
Fund, supporting infrastructure construction, and poverty alleviation as well as
educational projects in Africa. To further develop cooperation between China and the
AfDB, Beijing signed a $2 million technical cooperation agreement in 1996. This
agreement provides subsidies for Chinese experts who work on projects and bring
advanced technology to Africa. So far, the Chinese government has paid $900,000 to
support 14 projects in eight African countries.51

Chinese development assistance has also taken a variety of forms in Africa. Engineering,
medical and agricultural teams have provided technical support to African states since the
1960s, although this accelerated by the late 1980s. China trained over 14,600 people in
different fields for Africa.52 In both Liberia and the Central African Republic, China has
directly provided funding for training programs to strengthen the capacity of the civil
service in these countries. In areas of small-scale agricultural production and hydro-
irrigation, China has supported training programs that have involved thousands of
African farmers across the continent.53 In Djibouti, Ethiopia and elsewhere in the Horn of
Africa, Beijing has in recent years supplied modern telecommunication equipment, along
with training programs designed to help locals entrepreneurs maintain their equipment.54
During the 2006 Beijing Summit, China pledged to train 15,000 African professionals,
send 100 senior agricultural experts to Africa, and set up 10 special agricultural
technology demonstration centers across the continent over the by 2009. Additionally, the
number of Chinese government scholarships to African students is planned to double
from 2,000 per year in 2006 to 4,000 per year by 2009.55

China’s aid has also financed building schools and clinics treating patients suffering from
HIV/AIDS. China has thus far sent medical teams to 43 African countries, amounting to

50
   The African Development Bank Group's (AfDB) is the main development finance institution in Africa and was
established in 1964. It has 77 members, 53 from Africa and 24 outside the continent. The bank's priorities include the
reduction of poverty, improving the living conditions of African populations and resource mobilization for the
economic and social progress of its regional member countries.

more than 16,000 person/visits, and helped treat 240 million patients,56 including 180
million cases of HIV/AIDS.57 Today more than 900 Chinese doctors work in Africa.58
Furthermore, during November 2006’s Beijing Summit, China’s leadership announced
the dispatching of more than 300 volunteers to Africa, RMB300 million for artemisinin
(an anti-malaria drug) and 30 malaria prevention and treatment centers, and pledged to
build more than 100 schools and 30 hospitals across the continent by 2009. 59

At the same time, China’s success in securing mineral rights in Africa has gone hand in
hand with support for a wide range of construction projects and financial assistance. In
Sudan, for instance, Beijing used its technical expertise and links to other government
owned companies to help the country’s oil industry become a major export earner. It also
invested some $2 billion in the country’s Merowe hydropower dam, due to open in 2008,
which is expected to provide for all of the country’s energy needs for the next two
decades. 60 China's Sino Hydro Corporation has helped Ghana build a 400 megawatt
hydroelectric dam worth $600 million in the north of the country.61 Beijing also helped
build a $300 million dam project for Ethiopia.62 In Rwanda, Chinese companies have
paved more than 80 percent of the main roads.63 In late 2006, China agreed a $2 billion
credit line to help fund infrastructure projects in Equatorial Guinea. 64

Debt forgiveness and aid from China have also contributed to infrastructure development
in African countries, which in turn has been key for political stability. Particularly
important have been China’s programs in education and health in Africa, which are
recognized as central to African growth, and have improved local living standards. These
infrastructure improvements have also helped African countries secure other loans and
investment opportunities, contributing to further development. “South-South
cooperation” has thus been centrally embodied in China’s aid activity in Africa, which in
turn has been welcomed by a large number of African governments.

4. Resources and China’s Involvement in Africa

A key factor underlying China’s recent rapid expansion in Africa is Beijing’s desire to
gain secure access to supplies of oil, gas and key minerals. The Chinese leadership has
always emphasized that China’s continued high growth will require a growing supply of
raw materials, especially oil. The country’s growing energy demands, coupled with
relatively stagnant coal output65 and falling domestic crude oil production66, prompted the
country to look overseas for stable sources of mineral resources from the early 1990s. In
1993, a turning point for China came when it changed from a net exporter to a net
importer of oil.

By late 2004 China had become the world’s second largest oil user consuming 5.5
million barrels a day (bbl/d), more than Japan’s 5.4 million bbl/d, and placing it behind
only the US at 19.7 million bbl/d.67 Currently, China’s oil consumption is put at 7 million
barrels a day while the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels.68 China’s oil and gas
imports are projected to increase to 60 percent of its total oil and gas demand by 2020
from the current level of 33 percent,69 while its oil consumption is expected to increase
by 10 percent per annum 70 . Approximately 40 percent of the increase in global oil
demand between 2000 and 2004 and 2002 to 2006 is attributed to China’s rapid growth in
demand.71 China’s oil imports from Asia’s oil producing states are not sufficient to meet
either its current or projected energy demands and Chinese officials seemingly believe
there are limits to Middle East oil and gas production, especially given its current primary
allocation to Europe and the US.

As a late entrant to the global oil market, Africa represents perhaps the last major source
of oil reserves which is not primarily managed by major Western energy companies, and
hence available for Chinese corporations to invest in and ultimately partly control.
Libya’s 39 billion barrels of oil reserves and Nigeria’s 36 billion barrels are twice the size
of China’s proven reserves. Africa has only 9 percent of the world’s proven petroleum
reserves compared to almost 62 percent for the Middle East. IHS Energy, an oil and gas
consulting firm, believes that Africa will provide 30 percent of the world’s growth in
hydrocarbon production by 2010. A U.S. Department of Energy study projected that
African oil production would rise 91 percent between 2002 and 2025. African oil tends to
be high quality and low in sulfur, making it particularly desirable to refiners. Africa
currently supplies almost one third of China’s oil imports.72

In recent years, Chinese state-owned enterprises have not only invested heavily in foreign
oil reserves and but have also used Chinese construction and engineering to assist African
oil producing exporters such as Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Angola, Sudan, Gabon and Algeria
in further developing their oil, gas and other mineral resources. In 2005, China imported
more than 38 million tones of crude oil from Africa, about one-third of China's oil
imports73, and this reflects major investments in oil and gas projects in countries such as
Nigeria, Sudan, Gabon and Angola.

Table 3 indicates that oil, minerals and other natural resources account for the major part
of Africa’s exports to China. Currently, all exports of Angola to China are oil. Exports of
Sudan, Nigeria and Congo (DRC) are also all largely oil. The huge reserves of minerals
in DRC imply that its exports are mainly metals. Gabon, Cameroon and Tanzania are

abundant in timber which is imported by China. Agricultural products, such as cotton,
also play an important role in Tanzania’s exports to China. In 2006, oil and gas accounted
for 62 percent of Africa’s exports to China, followed by non-petroleum minerals and
metals with 13 percent. China’s high demand for oil, minerals and other natural resources
is thus motivating active engagement in investment in these sectors and strengthening
economic cooperation with Africa.

By country, the following situations apply:

Nigeria

As a member of OPEC, Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa and the eleventh-
largest producer in the world. Nigeria is a major oil supplier to both Western Europe and
the US, producing roughly 2.5 million barrels per day. Nigeria's proven oil reserves are
approximately 35.2 billion barrels, and there are plans by the Nigerian government to
expand this to 40 billion barrels by 2010. In July 2005, PetroChina finalized a deal
reported to be worth $800 million with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to
purchase approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day for five years.74 In January 2006,
the Chinese state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) acquired a
45 percent stake in a Nigerian offshore oil and gas field reported to be worth more than
$2.27 billion. The company subsequently promised to additionally invest up to $2.25
billion in field development.75 In addition, China has won a license to operate four of
Nigeria’s oil blocs as part of wider package involving a commitment to build a hydro
power station. China is currently reported to be considering $7 billion in investments in
Nigeria, covering a wide variety of sectors.76

Angola

Angola is the second-largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria with oil
production expected to reach 2 million barrels per day by 2008. Angola also has major
offshore sources of gas. China has invested heavily in Angola given its relative current
political stability.77 In March 2004, China granted Angola a $2 billion soft loan as part of
a longer term aid package in exchange for a contract to supply 10,000 barrels of crude oil
per day. 78 Under the agreement, the proceeds of the loan will be heavily invested in
infrastructure construction, with 70 percent of funds earmarked for Chinese companies
and the remaining 30 percent going to local subcontractors, including funds for Chinese

companies to build railroads, schools, roads, hospitals, bridges, and offices; lay a fiber-
optic network; and train Angolan telecommunications workers.79 According to the World
Bank, Angola accounted for half of China’s oil imports from Africa in 2005, and
exported 25 percent of its oil production to China.80

Sudan

Sudan has proven reserves of some 563 million barrels of oil. Since 1999, Chinese
enterprises have invested more than $3 billion in pipeline construction and in refineries.81
The China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) entered Sudan in 1996 and now is
the single largest shareholder in a major project with a 40 percent share82 of $1.7 billion
in the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company, which is Sudan’s largest petroleum
company and controls Sudan’s oil fields. CNPC’s operation, which also discovered
additional oil in Sudan, produced 500,000 barrels per day in 2006 and was expected to
reach 750,000 barrels per day in 2007. 83 In addition, China has recently signed new
partnership agreements to extract oil from the Melut Basin and Darfur.84 China now takes
64 percent of Sudan's oil exports, which are approximately 7 percent of China’s total oil
imports.85

Zambia

China is now the world’s largest consumer of copper, followed by the United States.86
Zambia-CRC hold the largest copper deposit in the world. In 2004, proven copper
reserves in the southern African states were put at 2 billion tons. In 2005, the China Non-
Ferrous Metals Corporation in Africa (NFCA) invested $160 million87 in the Chambishi
Copper Mine, one of Zambia’s largest copper mines, and holds an 85 percent stake.88
Besides copper, Zambia’s mineral resources spans a range of metals, particularly gold,
gemstones, a variety of industrial minerals and potential energy resources - uranium, coal

and hydrocarbons. Chinese companies have also invested in coal and gemstone mining.
China has also begun to invest in copper and cobalt mines in the neighboring DRC.

Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe has large gold reserves and is home to the world's second-largest platinum
mines. Zimbabwe together with South Africa constitutes China’s major source of
platinum and iron ore.89 In addition, China is Zimbabwe’s largest importer of tobacco,
one of the country’s major exports. China has made large investments in Zimbabwe’s
tobacco production and processing, and the agriculture industry. In September 2006,
China announced a $200 million capital injection in Zimbabwe’s farming, manufacturing
and mining.90 The largest deal announced was the $1.3 billion agreement in 2006 with
China Machine-Building International Corporation to mine coal and build thermal-power
generators in Zimbabwe aimed to reduce the country’s electricity shortage.91

Gabon

Gabon has proven oil reserves of roughly 2.5 billion barrels. The China National
Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC) plans to explore both onshore and offshore in
Gabon.92 A Chinese consortium also recently signed a $3 billion iron ore deal in Gabon,
which includes extending a railway and building a bulk commodities and container
port.93

South Africa

South Africa has large reserves of several minerals, including diamonds. Mineral
products are the major exports from South Africa to China, accounting for 65.3 percent
of South Africa's exports to China in 2005. In 2006, China imported $1.47 billion worth
of mineral products and $1.19 billion worth of diamonds, with growth rates of 41.3
percent and 24 percent from 2005.94

Liberia and West Africa

China and Liberia have signed a preliminary deal to allow China's second-largest state oil
and gas firm, Sinopec Group, to explore for oil and gas in the West African state.95 In

addition, a small West African country, Equatorial Guinea, has proven oil reserves
estimated at 1.28 billion barrels. Although Equatorial Guinea has attracted less
investment from China in oil sector than Angola and Sudan, it is still an important
supplier of crude. Since 1999, Equatorial Guinea has been China’s third largest African
supplier. In 2006, its oil exports to China exceeded $2.5 billion.96 Chinese companies are
expected to bid for oil blocs in the 2007 licensing round.97 Chinese companies also run a
major timber operation in this country.98 The Republic of Congo, Sub-Saharan Africa’s
fifth largest oil producer, also has 1.5 billion barrels in proven reserves. They may
become potential oil exporters and Chinese investment has also begun here. China has
also begun to invest in cobalt and copper mines in the Republic of Congo.

China’s emphasis on securing reliable sources of minerals in Africa for its own economy
is also reflected in its approach to vertical integration and ownership of oil production
facilities through to transportation tankers. As a means of securing oil for Chinese
consumers below international market prices, instead of buying rights for future
exploration and development, Chinese enterprises have concentrated on purchasing
equity shares in established oil fields. With a vision of turning themselves into global
players in the energy market, Chinese oil companies in Africa, such as the China National
Petroleum Corporation, have sought to secure equity positions which will enhance their
ability to learn industrial practices, minimize risks and allow for technology transfer. This
strategic judgment thus also partly explains China’s long-term vision with regard to its
engagement with Africa. Chinese enterprises thus have plans to be involved with the
development of oil reserves in Africa for the long haul.

While China’s position in oil in Africa is growing, it is nonetheless worth emphasizing
that Western companies remain the largest consumers of Africa’s oil and related products.
Currently, over 18 percent of U.S. crude oil imports are sourced from Africa,99 and by
2015 this is projected to increase to 25 percent. 100 Of U.S. oil imports from Africa,
Nigeria accounts for 47 percent, and Algeria and Angola provide 19 percent each.101 In
2003 alone, US companies invested $10 billion in African oil. 102 The American oil
company Chevron Texaco invested over $5 billion during 1998-2003 in its African
projects,103 and planned to spend another $20 billion in Africa over the following five

years.104 It owns a 40 percent stake in the joint venture Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL)
with NNPC which is the second largest oil producer in Nigeria and produces
approximately 400,000 barrels per day.105 Another American oil company Exxon-Mobil
laid a $3.7-billion 670-mile oil pipeline from Chad to the Atlantic coast in Cameroon,106
and also holds 40 percent shares of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited with a yield of
around 900,000 barrels per day.107 Exxon alone invested nearly US$10 billion in three
deep-sea oil exploitation projects in Angola in 2000.108 The French oil company Total,
one of the world’s top four oil companies, plans to invest $10 billion in Nigeria and $5
billion in Angola during the next five years for oil exploration.109 British/Dutch Shell
owns 55 percent of the 30 billion barrels of oil reserves in Nigeria (since 2002), and 40
percent of the 2.2 million barrels of daily output in Nigeria.110 In comparison, China's oil
exploration and operations in Africa remain small. Currently, China's oil imports from
Africa are less than one third of US oil imports from the continent.111

While Sino-African oil trade is developing rapidly due to the Chinese focus on partnering
in infrastructure development, it is often viewed by Africans as more mutually beneficial
than trade with OECD countries. For instance, at the end of 2003, PetroChina had
invested $2.7 billion in Sudan, built 1506km in oil pipeline, a crude processing plant with
an annual capacity of 2.5m tons, and several gas stations. This ensured that Sudan has a
complete oil industry system from exploration, production, refining and transport to sales.
In addition, China invested over $20 million to help the Sudan build other facilities
including schools and hospitals. In comparison, Western companies have explored for oil
for over 50 years in Nigeria. However, the country continues to import gasoline, and it
does not have its own oil production and processing system. Western oil companies are
also believed to pay less attention to infrastructure investment. China's energy policy in
Africa is thus seen, for now, by both parties as being more fully implemented in ways
which yield mutual benefits.

5. Textile and Apparel Investments

A further element in the growth of China’s trade and investment in Africa has been the
continued use of African operations to in circumvent new trade restrictions specifically
targeted against China following the removal of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) in
2005. The situation is complex since immediately following the termination of the MFA,
some of the quota hopping foreign investment induced to enter Africa to avoid trade
restrictions on apparel imports in the OECD from China was induced to return to China.
It has been the subsequent new restrictions against China (see Dayaratna-Banda and
Whalley (2007)) under China’s WTO accession terms that have induced new investment
flows.

The Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) was originally set up by European Union (EU),
Canada and the US in 1974 to protect their clothing and textile industries from more
efficient producers in Asia by capping the amount any country could export to them.
Under successive MFAs, country and product coverage expanded as more developing-
country exporters became involved and more categories of textiles and clothing were
progressively added to the agreements. China’s exports of clothing and textiles to OECD
countries were highly restricted by MFA quotas before the removal of the MFA at the
end of 2004. During the MFA implementation period, quota utilization rates in OECD
countries for Chinese imports for the MFA category were extremely high, and some of
them were nearly 100%.

One of the further effects of the MFA has been its generation of quota-hopping foreign
investment (Whalley, 2006). In order to circumvent trade restrictions under the MFA,
some Chinese clothing and textile firms moved production away from their newly quota-
restrained homes to temporarily unconstrained countries. One of the areas especially
suitable for quota-hopping foreign investment was Sub-Saharan Africa.

Africa’s textile and apparel sector also benefited from the US Africa Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA) in May 2000 that allowed textile exports of 38 eligible African
countries with tariff and quota exemptions if they meet certain rules. Those included a
restriction that the product’s raw materials originate either in the exporting country or in
the US. But African countries categorized as least developed112 were exempt from this
additional requirement. Their products are allowed duty-free access into the US market
under the condition that the final assembly of the textile products takes place in the
exporting country, no matter where the yarn spinning, fabric weaving or knitting occurs.
This opening in the U.S. clothing market created a ready market for AGOA countries.

These advantages for those African textile-exporting countries of less constrained quotas
and preferential market access into the EU and the US attracted investments from many
Chinese companies. By way of example, textiles and clothing became Lesotho’s
economic mainstay, which at one point employed 56,000 workers — accounting for
virtually every manufacturing job in the country. Between 1999 and 2001, US imports
from Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mauritius and South Africa increased by 66 percent.
112
      The least developed country is the country with per capita incomes of $1,500 or less in 1998.


                                                             26
From 2001 to 2004, the average increase of Lesotho exports to the U.S. was over 85
percent. In 2003, Africa exported $1.2 billion of clothing and textiles to the US, a 50
percent increase from the previous year. The market share of sub-Saharan Africa in the
U.S. textiles market increased between 2002 and 2004. China has been credited with
promoting Africa exports in both textiles and clothing in this process.

The MFA termination in Jan 2005 brought sharp product specific increases in China’s
exports to the U.S. and the EU in the initial 4 month period (January –April 2005). While
the aggregate exports of clothing and textiles surged substantially to both the U.S. and the
EU in this period, the largest percentage and absolute surges came from China. And these
increases were accompanied by the fall in the market share of non Asian suppliers,
including sub-Saharan Africa. During the first quarter of 2005, textile and apparel exports
from Africa to the U.S. fell to $270 million from $370 million during the same period the
year before, and the market share of sub-Saharan Africa in the U.S. textiles market
dropped in the year of 2005.

Although the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC)113 ended the MFA and aimed to
eliminate quotas and increase developing countries’ access to the previously protected
markets of developed countries, it also allowed developed countries to apply special
safeguard measures under certain conditions by introducing new trade restrictions if their
domestic industries were believed to be threatened by the liberalized imports. Such new
restrictions were also facilitated by China’s WTO accession terms. As a result, after
substantial increases in China’s textile and clothing exports to the U.S. and the EU in the
first quarter of 2005, a series of new restraints on textile and apparel exports against
China successively appeared. These new restraints have been termed the China
Containment Agreements (CCAs) by Dayaratna-Banda & Whalley (2007). In accordance
with the terms of China’s WTO accession protocol, a special safeguard mechanism
similar to MFA aiming at preventing a surge of China’s exports remains in effect until
Dec 31, 2008. In addition, product-specific safeguards which allowed for restrictions to
prevent market disruption caused by any specific products, as well as anti-dumping
measures were also used by developed countries to contain Chinese textile and apparel
exports.

By late summer of 2005, the U.S. made use of China’s WTO accession protocol to force
China to accept new growth rate quotas. The new agreement re-imposed quotas on 34
product categories and major import products (shirts, trousers and underwear) are all
covered by the new restrictions. The EU followed and then reached a similar agreement
with China in the early autumn of 2005. Effectively, the CCAs have placed China’s
textile and clothing sector in a similar situation to the old MFA era.

Although these post MFA quotas are generally higher than the older MFA quotas and
covered fewer categories, they were effective in significantly slowing further export
growth by China. In 2005, aggregate imports of textiles and clothing by both the U.S. and
the EU increased at modest rates (6 percent for U.S. clothing imports, 1 percent for U.S.

113
   The Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC) was concluded in the Uruguay Round negotiations in the World
Trade Organization.


                                                      27
textiles imports, 6 percent for EU clothing and textiles imports). Due to the CCAs,
Chinese export growth under the imposition of new restrictions fell from that of the
immediate post MFA period of 2005. In total, over 12 months on from January 2005,
China’s textile and clothing exports increased, but only at a modest rate of 8 percent for
the U.S. and 7 percent for the EU (Whalley, 2006).

The impacts of the CCAs on China’s FDI investment parallel those of the MFA. The
large volume and share surges into the U.S. and the EU markets in 2005 have been much
reduced in percentage terms in 2006 (Dayaratna-Banda & Whalley, 2007). China’s textile
and clothing exports to the U.S. rose slightly in 2006. This was due in large part to the
surges in products not covered by the agreements. China’s share in the U.S. markets in
restricted categories remained at 25 percent in value terms and 28 percent in volume
terms in 2006, and even several key restricted categories of products show negative
growth in 2006, but shares in unrestricted categories of products rose substantially from
26 percent in 2005 to 46 percent in 2006. Although overall EU apparel imports rose in
2006, EU imports from China in knitted clothing categories declined by 2 percent in 2006
compared to an increase by 53.76 in 2005. In woven clothing categories, EU imports
from China rose only by 4.69 percent in 2006 compared to 39.32 percent increase in 2005.
Chinese quota in the EU in 2006 was nearly fully used by mid-summer. In contrast, other
Asian countries’ exports rose considerably in this period. These show that China’s
exports have suffered in the U.S. and EU markets in 2006 due to CCAs.

Therefore, most of the responses to the MFA, including quota-hopping foreign
investment, are still presented under the CCAs. So far, AGOA countries still hold a
significant advantage in sectors where duty-free exports to the US are allowed since
average US tariffs amount to 17 percent of the landed value of products, with cotton
products averaging 13 percent and synthetics 25 percent for non-AGOA countries. In
order to circumvent the quota limitation under CCAs, Chinese firms have kept using
AGOA countries production to get preferential tariff treatment in the U.S. after MFA
abolition.

6. Other considerations and concluding remarks

China's rapid growth and now its growing presence in Africa is the main focus of this
paper. In the text, we document its content, coverage and speed of change. Africa has
clearly gained, and most likely significantly from this interaction with China. And
somewhat paradoxically, China with GDP per capita of perhaps US$1,800 (rather than
the OECD with incomes per capita of around US$30,000) is now poised to become a
major source of new developmental finance in Africa.

There are, however, other evaluations offered elsewhere of this growing presence not
discussed above. One is the claim that despite all the benefits, China’s growing presence
is also co-mingled with responses to attempts to discipline corrupt practices at home and
this amount to exported corruption. Stories of Chinese enterprises approaching African
governments offering reserve financed low interest loan infrastructure projects on
conditions that contracts are awarded to specified Chinese enterprises tend to underscore
such concerns, and emphasize the incentive to conduct business lax accounting standard
jurisdictions in Africa. Another is claims by local unions of low wage employment of
local workers on the continent by Chinese enterprises, and even displacement of local
labor by arriving Chinese labor. Both arguments have been used to suggest negative
consequences follow for Africa from a growing Chinese presence.

In the bigger picture, however, we would argue that such claims have to be seen
alongside the large benefits flowing to Africa from China’s involvement. Whether or not
corruption at home motivates some amount of FDI, Africa seems to benefit. Meanwhile,
labor adjustments from Chinese FDI appear to be small, especially given the large FDI in
oil and resources. The bottom line would seem to be that large trade and investment
benefits have already accrued to Africa from China’s growing presences, and more seem
poised to follow. China in Africa is thus seemingly a highly positive story for Africa and
also offers an even more promising future for the continent.
