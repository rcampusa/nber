                         The Goodness of Match




    I.   Introduction

         Statistical matching has received increasing popularity in the last

    five years as a method of creating synthetic microdata sets. Benjamin

    Okner merged the 1966 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Tax File with the

    1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO) by first dividing the two

    files into broad "equivalence classes" and employing a distance func-

    tion to choose the best record to match (Okner, 1972). Edward Budd and

    Daniel Radner matched the Current Population Survey File with the

    IRS Tax File by ranking records in each file by income level and

    linking similarly ranked observations (Budd, 1971). Richard Rockwell

    combined the 1970 Public Use Sample (PUS) with the SEO file by dividing

    each sample into equivalence classes on the basis of five common

    variables. Horst Alter linked the 1970 Canadian Survey of Consumer

    Finances with the 1970 Family Expenditure Survey by using multiple

    regression analysis to minimize the "distance" between matched observations

    (Alter, 1974). Currently, Nancy and Richard Ruggles are undertaking

    a match of the 1970 PUS with the 1960 PUS, the 1969 IRS Tax File, and

    the Social Security's Longitudinal Employer-Employee Data File by creating

    matching classes on the basis of interval analysis ard combining records

    on a stochastic basis within these intervals (Ruggles, 1974).
                             —2—

      Though the statistical techniques vary, the matching problem is

 essentially the same in each case and can be stated formally, as

 Christopher Sims does, as follows: Given "observations on X,Y from

 one sample and on X,Z from another sample, when will it be true that

 by matching observations according to X, an artificial Y,Z sample will

 result whose distribution is the true joint Y,Z distribution?" (Sims,

 1972, p. 355). Though the imputed Y,Z distribution will, in gerneral,

 be different from the true Y,Z distribution,1 the closeness of the two

 yields a natural criterion of the goodness of match.

      By making certain simplifying assumptions, we can make this criterion

operational. First, it can be assumed that the closeness of the corre-

lation coefficient between Y and its imputed Z value to the true corre-

lation coefficient between Y and Z reflects the closeness of the two

joint distributions.2 Though the true correlation between Y and Z is,

in general, unknown, we can determine a lower and upper bound on the

true correlation as a function of the matching variables and use the

range as a measure of the goodness of match. In order to do this, we

must, secondly, assume that for each observation in the first file there

exists an observation in the second file with exactly the same X values,

and conversely.3

   1The two distributions will be exactly the same in the special case, which
Sims mentions, when X,Y and Z are mutually independent, and in the special
case when Y is a linear transformation of X and Z a linear transformation of X.

   2The covariance between Y and Z, it should be recognized, is only one
moment of their joint distribution. Moreover, it is implicitly assumed
that Y, Z, and X are continuous variables. Furthermore, we shall ignore
the problem of sample estimation of the correlation coefficients and the
discrepancies between sample estimates and populatior values. In a sense,
we shall treat the sample as the full population.

   31n practice, the major problem arising from matching two files is that
there rarely is an observation in the second file with the same X values
as a given observation in the first file, and
                                              conversely.
                             -3-

     The goodness of match depends on how much of the relation between

Y aid Z is transmitted through X--that is, on how X "mediates" between

Y and Z-- and we will therefore call X the mediating variables and Y

and Z the mediated variables.4 Since the functional form the lower

and upper bounds on the true correlation between Y and Z takes depends

on the number of X variables, we shall treat the problem in three stages:

(a) The case of one mediating variable.   (b) The case of two mediating

variables. Cc) The case of n mediating variables.




   41n principle there may be more than one Y or Z variable. Without
loss of generality we can assume that there is only one of each, since
the correlation of each pair Yj, Zj can be treated independently of
the other pairs.

II. The Case of One Mediating Variable

         Let X, Y, and Z be random variables with zero mean and unit

variance.      Let


                     =cor(Y,Z)
                  q = cor(X,Y)
                  r = cor(X,Z)


Then,


                     =   E(YZ)-E(Y)E(Z)           =   E(YZ)
                                 ayaZ


Likewise,


                  q = E(XY)
                     =   E(XZ)


Moreover,


                  E(X(Y-qX)) =       E(XY)    -
                                                  qE(X2)

                                 =0q-q
                                 =




Likewise,


                  E(X(Z-rX)) =       0


And:



                  E(Y-qX)2   =    E(Y2) - 2qE(XY)          +   q2E(X2)
                             =       -

                  E(Z-rX)2   =    1 -    r2

      5This is not a restrictive assumption.
                                          Suppose Y' has mean                            and   variance
      and Z' has mean p, and variance a2 Then Y =
                                                            and          '' Y'           Z =       - z'   ,
                                                                          cYy,

andeach has zero mean and unit variance,
and cor(YZ') = E(Y'     IJyt) (V -                     = E(YZ)      =    cor     (Y,Z)

Theorem 1: qr +        'Jj5Rj_r >           p   >    qr -   1j5l_2)
Proof:   Noting that Y      =   qX + (Y-qX)         and   Z=   rX + (Z-rX),

                 p = E(YZ) = E[qX+(Y-qx)][rx+(z-rx)]
                 p = E[rqX2+rX(Y-qX) + qX(Z-rX) + (Y-qX) (Z-rX)]
                 p = rq +[E(Y-qx)(Z-rx)]
                (p-rq)2 =       [E(Y-qX)(Z-rX)J2

From Schwartz' inequality,

                 (p-rq)2    <   E(Y-qX)2E(Z-rX)2

Therefore,
                 (p-rq)2 <       (l-q2)(l-r2)               Q.E.D.


     Lower and upper bounds are shown for selected values of q and r in

Table 1. The lower bound is symmetrical in q and r. Denoting the lower

bound by L1

                 aL1                 ____
                        =
                            r+qj2
Therefore,   when q and r have the same sign, the lower bound increases

as either I or ri increases. When q and r are non-negative, the

lower bound is less than or equal to q and r, and equals q when r equals

1, and conversely. The upper bound behaves obversely to the lower bound.

Denoting the upper bound by U1

 When q and r have different signs, the upper bound decreases as

 either I or ri increases. When q equals 1, the upper bound is

 the same as the lower bound, r, and conversely when r equals 1.

 When q and r have the same sign, the upper bound reaches its inaxi-

 mum value of 1 when q equals r,6 and decreases as q deviates from r,

 given r. Conversely, when q and r have different signs, the lower

 bound reaches its minimum when q equals -r, and increases as iI

 deviates from in, given r.

        The upper and lower bounds give the range of values the true

 correlation coefficient between Y and Z may have. The size of the

range is the difference between the two bounds and equals 2

Thus, the larger q and r, the smaller the range and the greater the

 certainty that the imputed correlation between Y and Z is close to

the true one.

        In the special case where q =          r   =   p, the bounds take the following
form:

        Lemma 1:       >   p   >         - 1
                   1               2p2


When        equals 1, p equals l. Since the lower bound is quadratic in P

the range quickly widens as i deviates from 1 (See Figure 1).




   6This can be shown by setting V1/q to zero and noting that the second
derivative is negative.

   7Ii this case, both Y and Z are linear functions of X, say Y = aX+b
and Z = eX + d. Therefore,

                   Z =     (..)Y÷   (d-.)
                            a          a

and Z is a linear function of Y.

III.     The Case of Two Mediating Variables


         The same technique can be applied in the case of two intervening

 variables X1 and X2 as in the case of one to determine the upper and

  lower bounds on p.           Let

                  q1 =             cor(X1,Y)
                  q2 = cor(X2,Y)

                  r1 =             cor(X1,Z)
                           =
                                   cor(X2,Z)
                  s        =
                                   cor(X1,X2)

 Then:

                           =
                  4p               E[q1X1 + (Y-q1x1) + q2X2 + (Y-q2X2)][r1x1 + (Z-r1X1)

                                                                                               +          +
                                                                                                   r2X2       (Z-r2X2)]

                  4p   -                +                                              =
                               (3q1r1       3q2r2- s(q1r2 + q2r1))

                           E(Y-q1X1)(Z-r1x1) + E(Y-q1X1)(Z-r2x2)
                       +
                           E(Y-q2X2) (Z-r1X1) + E(Y                      -                 -
                                                                             q2X2)(Z           r2X2)


 Squaring both sides, collecting terms, using Schwarz1 inequality, completing
 the square, and transposing terms yields:

  To simplify for purposes of analysis,, consider the case where

  q1=q2=q and r1=r2=r. Then

                  where T2 =


        Lower bounds are shown for selected values
                                                   of q, r and S                         in
 Table u.8 It is evident from the table that the lower bound increases

 as q and r increase, when q and r are positive. This can be shown

 formally as follows:


                       =
                               r(3-s)
                                                +
                                                        q((l-r2) + r2(l.s)2/4
                                                                  T2


 where L2 is the lower bound in the case of two X variables. Both terms

 are positive when q and r are positive and

negative when q and r are negative. Since the lower bound is symmetrical

 in q and r, the lower bound increases
                                                           as qJ or In increases, when q and r
have the same signs. When q and r are of opposite signs, the sign of

this arises when Lemma 1 is violated.                         This is a necessary (though not
sufficient) condition, as can be shown                        by proving the converse. Let:

      If q and     r have   different signs, the upper bound decreases as ii                    or
      I r increases. When q and r have the same signs, the direction of

     movement depends on the values of q, r, and s.

             As is also evident from Table II, the lower bound decreases as 5

     increases, when q and r are positive.9 Formally:


                                 =         - (l-s)q2r2

                                                      4T2


     Since   s <   1, aL2/as is always negative when q and r have the same sign,
     and the lower bound increases as s decreases. When q and r have dif-

     ferent signs, the sign of aL2/as depends on the values of q, r and s.

     The obverse holds for the upper bound.

           The upper bound can exceed 1 in certain cases when q and r have

     the same sign and the lower bound can fall short of -l in certain                          cases
     when q and r have different signs. Therefore, the range

     R <     2                                          The upper bound on the range
                 (lq2)(i-r2)_[qr(l.s)]2/4.
     therefore decreases as II or ri increases and as s decreases.

    To simplify the analysis of the results, we shall assume
                                                                                        q1

As in the case of one and two
                                             mediating variables, the upper and lower
bounds have obverse properties. In this section, we shall concern

ourselves only with the lower bound, which is shown                       for   selected values

 (a) First term: 3n2-2n is positive for n > 0.

Since C is the swn of the off-diagonal terms of the correlation matrix S,

C < n2-n and 5n2-4n-2C > 3n2-2n > 0.                      Therefore, the coefficient of
r is positive.

 (b) Second term: r2 < 1 and r2 > 0. Therefore, the second term is

non-negative if:

                 t =     4C2 + 4n2C + (4n-6n2)D + 2(n3-n4) < 0


To maximize t, it is necessary to maximize C, given D, since all the

coefficients of C are positive. Therefore, using Lagrangean multipliers,

it is desired to:


                 Maximize C =

Therefore,

                 sij =           V    ij

Let s=sj . Thus,

where t' equals the expression in the brackets. To maximize t', subject

to D, set:

                    !:!=                     -           =0

t'    is maximized at D =            n2-n,       at which value t' equals zero. Therefore

t <   0, and aLn/aq is positive when q and r are positive and negative

when q and r are negative. Hence, L increases as II or ri increases,

when q and r have the same sign.

          From Table III, it is also evident that the lower bound decreases

as s increases)0 This can be shown formally, as follows:


                              =
                                   -2qr          -   qr2              4C + 2n2 + (2n-3n2)aD/aC
                                   3n2-2n            (3n2-2n)2                     T
The first term is negative when q and                        r   have the same sign. Moreover,

q2r2/(3n2_2n)2 is non-negative. To standardize the result, we assume

D   is constant, and therefore 9D/C is zero. For n=l, C is zero and
2n2   >   0.   For n>1, we note that S is a covariance matrix and there-

fore positive definite. Hence, C +                       n   >   0, and 4C + 2n2        >     2n2-4n    >   0.

Given a fixed D, the lower bound increases as C decreases, when q and r

have the same sign.


   '0In the limiting case, when                          =       1 V i,j ,    the bounds take the form
of the one mediating variable case.
                                          - 15


              It is also apparent from Table III that the lower bound increases

 as n increases. This can be proved for the special case when
          =   s V ij.     In   this case, C =           (n2-n)s,    D         (n2-n)s2   ,   and:


                          L = -2s)n-(4-2s)               qr -

Therefore:


                               =   2-2s
                          I'                    qr -    q2r2(1-s)2(n-2)

qr(1-s)/(3n-2)2           is non-negative when q and r have the same sign. Therefore,

for n=1,

    The lower bound thus increases as n increases, given s, when q and r

    have the same sign.

         In the limit, as n approaches infinity:

    Limiting cases are shown in Table III.

    From the arguments presented above, given their special assumptions,

    it is apparent that Tn decreases as qJ increases, ri increases,

    C decreases, or n increases.

    V.   Conclusion


         The theoretical discussion presented in this paper provides a

    guide for the construction of a viable match:

          (i) In the case of one mediating variable it was shown that

    the range of the correlation coefficient between the mediated variables

    decreases sharply as either q or r approaches one. (In the case where

    q or r equals one, p is determined with certainty.) Moreover, the range

    of p in the case of n mediating variables can be no greater than the

    range in the case of one variable. Therefore, X variables should

    be chosen that are highly correlated with either the Y or Z variable.

         (ii) The upper bound on the range of p declines as the sum of

    the correlation coefficients between the X variables declines. From

    Tables II and III it is evident that the lower bound on p is very

    sensitive to the value of the s parameter. Therefore considerable

    gain in the accuracy of the match can be achieved by choosing X

    variables that are uncorrelated or even negatively correlated.

         (iii) The upper bound on the range of p also declines, given

    certain strong assumptions, as the number of X variables increases.

    Table III shows that there is a large gain from increasing the number

    of mediating variables from 1 to 5 but minimal gain from increasing

    it beyond 5. Therefore, at least five X variables should be chosen

    in engineering a match.
