         Future Social Security Financing Alternatives and National Saving



                                     ABSTRACT

     While the short-run financial status of Social Security is secure, its
long-run financial status is very uncertain. The retirement and disability
part of the system (OASDI) is projected to be in long-run actuarial deficit
under the Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and
demographic forecasts. Hospital Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large
deficit, beginning in the 1990s. OASDI is projected to accrue a very large
surplus over the next thirty years, peaking at almost 30% of CNP. Social
Security has never accrued a surplus this large; it may well be dissipated
for other purposes, such as to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise
benefits, or cut taxes. These alternatives may affect net national saving,
directly because Social Security surpluses or deficits are part of
government sector saving and indirectly through effects on private saving
or the non-Social Security part of the federal government budget.

     This paper documents how various systematic deviations from, or return
to, pay-as-you-go finance of the Social Security system may affect net
national saving. For example, under base case assumptions with respect to
the non-Social Security deficit, a constant net private saving rate of 6%,
and long-run budget balance in the state and local government sector, the
Social Security deficit offsets 40% of other net national saving over the
Social Security Administration's 75-year projection period. In the first
25-year sub-period, the Social Security surplus adds one-sixth to other net
national saving; in the second, it offsets almost one-half; and in the
third, it offsets five-sixths of other net national saving.

     Of course, private saving may respond to changes in Social Security's
funding as may the non-Social Security balance in the federal budget. The
paper presents several alternative scenarios such as benefits increasing or
taxes falling during the OASDI surplus period, various stylized rules
concerning the non-Social Security budget deficit, and separate balancing
of HI via outlay reductions or tax increases. The results indicate that
OASDI may effect net national saving substantially. For example, if
benefits ratchet up during what would have been the period of the OASDI
surplus, the OASDI system may subsequently offset virtually all of
remaining net national saving. On the other hand, if HI is brought into
balance and the OASDI surplus is allowed to accrue, Social Security will
offset only about 4% of other net national saving.

     Changes in private saving may accentuate or ameliorate the swings in
the net national saving rate generated by the future financing of OASDHI,
but the alternative financing options will be important determinant of net
national saving, and therefore of private domestic investment and
international capital flows.

 1.   Introduction

      While the short-run financial status of Social Security is quite

 secure, its long-run financial status is very uncertain. First, future

 economic and demographic trends will heavily affect revenues and outlays.

Second, except under the Social Security Administration's optimistic

economic and demographic scenario, the retirement and disability part of

the system (OASDI) is projected to be in long-run actuarial deficit: small

under the intermediate assumptions; large under pessimistic ones.

Hospital Insurance (HI) is projected to run a large deficit beginning in

the l990s. Finally, the OASDI system is projected to accrue (under the

intermediate assumptions) a very large surplus over the next thirty years.

This surplus is projected to cumulate to almost 30% of GNP, close to the

current national debt to GNP ratio. This surplus is "designed" to reduce

the need for still larger tax increases or benefit reductions during the

baby boom generation's retirement. Figure 1 presents estimates of these

average annual (not cumulative) surpluses and deficits in Social Security,

including and excluding HI, over the next 75 years to highlight this

projected movement away from pay-as-you-go finance.

      We have never been able to accrue a surplus this large in Social

Security; the retirement surplus may well be dissipated for other purposes

(to bail out HI, fund other programs, raise benefits, cut taxes, etc.).

These possibilities involve major inter-cohort transfers relative to

accruing the surplus, as do, of course, the alternative methods of dealing

with the long-run deficit (see Boskin (1986)). They also involve

potentially major effects on net national saving in the United States,

directly because of the role Social Security surpluses or deficits will

play in government sector saving or borrowing and indirectly via whatever

effects they have on private saving or the non-Social Security part of the



                                   1
federal government budget.

     The purpose of this paper is to present calculations of the financial

status of Social Security and its impact on net national saving under

alternative economic, demographic, and future financing assumptions.

Thus, the paper is organized as follows: the next section describes our

methodology and data, and briefly discusses related analyses. Section 3

presents estimates under alternative economic and demographic assumptions

of the long-run actuarial status of OASI. They indicate how the long-run

financial status may vary from very large surpluses to very large deficits.

Section 4 estimates the implications of alternative uses of the large

surplus which is projected to accrue in OASI's trust fund: what difference

it makes in the aggregate if the surplus is used to raise benefits or

reduce taxes, or is spent on other programs.

     Section 5 turns to the potential implications of these alternative

scenarios for the level and time pattern of net national saving. The

status of the Social Security system may affect the net national saving

rate in several ways. First, the surplus (or deficit) in any year

contributes directly to that year's net government saving (or dissaving).

Second, a Social Security surplus or deficit may affect the surplus or

deficit in the remainder of the federal government budget. Third, the

status of Social Security may affect private saving. This paper

concentrates on the first two avenues through which Social Security affects

national saving. While I believe the weight of the evidence is that Social

Security's expected evolution will affect private saving as well, this

effect is somewhat more controversial and its magnitude subject to much

dispute (while much important work has been done since then, the classic

debate on the subject remains Barro and Feldstein (1978)). Thus, the




                                   2
results reported in this paper should be considered a large part of, but

not the entire, story. The results are striking: alternative scenarios

with respect to accruing or dissipating the surplus have major effects on

the net national saving rate. Under the Social Security Administration's

intermediate assumptions, Social Security's long-term deficit (including

HI) offsets almost 40% of the remaining net national saving. The time

pattern is equally interesting: a surplus adding one-sixth to net national

saving in the 1986-2010 period, but a deficit offsetting one-half of all

other net national saving in 2011-2035 and five-sixths in 2036-2060. With

tax increases and/or outlay reductions to cover the HI deficit, the surplus

adds one quarter to net national saving in the 1986-2010 period.

     Section 6 discusses some of the implications of these results for

investment, international capital flows, trade, and productivity growth.

     Section 7 presents a brief conclusion which offers a short summary and

repeats some caveats concerning interpretation of the results.



2.   Data, Method, and Cursory Literature Review

     Several studies analyze the long-run financial solvency of Social

Security under alternative economic and demographic assumptions. The

most important, of course, are the annual Social Security trustees'

reports (formally, the Annual Reports cf the Board of Trustees of the

Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds).

They present both short-and long-terni actuarial projections of Social

Security trust fund finances under alternative assumptions. The reports

certainly have valuable information, but these data are presented only

as fractions of taxable payroll (except, in one table, as fractions of

GNP); dollar figures (whether discounted or not) are not presented for

long-term projections. More importantly, the reports do not in fact



                                  3
consider what the state of the retirement (OASI) trust fund might be at

the end of the report's 75 year horizon. Rather, it presents the simple

average, over 75 years, of each year's surplus or deficit (that is, tax

receipts minus benefit payments) as a fraction of that year's taxable

payroll. The calculation considers neither the increase over time in

taxable payroll nor the interest earned on the cumulated trust fund

surplus. Thus, the 1986 report's claim that the OASI trust fund is in

"close actuarial balance" because the average annual deficit is only

0.29 percent of taxable payroll is based on a fundamental

misunderstanding of what that figure means. The report presents no

sufficient basis for evaluating the long-run financial solvency of Old

Age and Survivors Insurance.1

     Boskin's (1986) estimates of the long-run financial solvency of OASI

avoid these inadequacies by considering annual flows of dollars and by

projecting the actual accumulation and decumulation of the OASI trust fund.

He also considers what will happen if the expected cumulative surplus of

the next three decades is dissipated (for example, by raising benefits) or

if reforms are instituted in retirement age and other features.

     The results presented here are based partly on computer simulations of

present and future families covered by the Social Security system, and




1. In fact, if the report were to present the correct calculation, based on
the report's own assumptions and methodology, the resulting figures would
be more optimistic under each of the four sets of assumptions used. A
comparison of Tables 10 and F2 in the 1986 report shows that taxable
payroll is projected to rise at a rate slightly below the assumed interest
rate (under each alternative set of assumptions). This means that the
earlier positive annual balances should be given greater weight than the
later negative annual balances. Thus, the long-run actuarial balance
should be reported as a little higher.

 partly on the SSA projections discussed above. Our main simulation derives

 figures for annual income to and expenditure from the Social Security

 Administration's retirement (that is, OASI) trust fund over the next 75
          2
 years.

      This simulation begins with earnings records and other data concerning

 Social Security participants who were surveyed in l973. For

subsequent years we estimate participants' earnings based on demographic

characteristics, we derive benefits based on legislated benefit formulae,

and we determine each participant's year of death through a random process

based on mortality tables published by the Social Security

Administration.4

     Cohorts born beginning in 1953 are simulated differently. In

considering typical male and female wage earners born each year, we derive

their expected tax and benefit futures based on mortality probabilities and

the proportion that can be expected to marry. We multiply by the number

born each year (plus the number born that year who later immigrate as

children) who will enter covered employment and thus derive figures for

entire cohorts. To derive income and expenditure for the trust fund as a

whole we make a further adjustment for taxes paid and benefits received by

adult immigrants.

     The discussion is based on a version of our simulation which assumes

the tax law effective at the time of the Trustees' Report. Results

presented below use the recently enacted income-tax law.5

     In the main simulation we rely on Social Security Administration

projections for the proportion of Social Security benefits which are

recovered for the trust fund through income taxation. These estimates are

that this proportion will rise from less than two percent in 1986 to about

five percent in the mid-twenty-first century. Because legislated marginal

tax rates have been reduced since the Social Security Administration made

its projections we assume that, from 1988 on, 20 percent less will be

collected in taxes on benefits. In 1987, the transition year, we assume

that 10 percent less will be collected.

     This simulation is paraineterized by economic, demographic, and legal

assumptions. The most important economic assumption is future growth of

real wages. The chief demographic assumptions are mortality probabilities

by age and fertility rates. The legal assumptions are payroll tax rates

and formulae for the calculation of benefits. In the scenarios below we

consider the alternative economic and demographic assumptions that the

Social Security Administration itself uses for the scenarios in its annual




5. Our calculation is certainly rougher than that undertaken by the actuarial
staff of the Social Security Administration. As a result, we generate
projections of aggregate taxes and benefits which vary from those of the
1986 Trustee's Report. Between now and 2010 we derive less in annual and
cumulative surpluses (due to deriving less in tax receipts) than what the
Trustee's Report suggests is likely. Our figures are close to those of the
Trustee's Report in the early 2OlOs but thereafter until about 2040 we
derive greater annual surpluses or lower deficits than those projected in
the Trustee's Report. After 2040 we again generate higher annual deficits.

 trustees' reports,6 and we consider fixed multiples of the payroll taxes

 and and the benefits currently legislated.




 3.   Long-Run Financial Status of OASI Under Alternative Economic
           and Demographic Assumptions

      Table 1 presents the results of the main simulation using the

Trustees' Report's intermediate assumptions about future economic and

demographic trends. It shows the basic trends, well known by now, that are

expected to develop in the finances of the OASI trust fund. This trust

fund will accumulate a substantial surplus over the next 25 years while the

baby-boom generation is in its peak earnings years. In the following 25

years (more precisely, in the mid 2020s) when the baby-boom generation

retires, benefit payments will begin to exceed payroll-tax revenues. In

the third 25-year period there will be a still higher proportion of

retirees to workers, and annual deficits will equal a fourth of tax

receipts, or a fifth of net benefits.

      For the whole 75-year period we project a deficit of nearly $500

billion in 1986 dollars discounted to 1986. This is equal to about 0.44

percent of (discounted) taxable payroll.7 Thus a rise in the Social



6. We do not consider alternative assumptions for unemployment, female labor
force participation, immigration or real interest rates.

7. This is slightly more than the 0.29 percent long-term actuarial deficit
presented in the Trustees' Report. We discussed above how the latter
figure is not very meaningful, and how a calculation comparable to ours
would yield a deficit that is lower in magnitude. A further difference is
that our calculation assumes the new, lower marginal tax rates. Under the
old tax law our simulated deficit is about 0.34 percent of taxable payroll.
Finally, it should noted that we make no effort to calculate the future
deficit in disability insurance (DI). The Social Security Administration




                                   7
Security payroll tax rate of a little less than 0.44 percent effective now,

or substantially more later, would be needed to close the long-run OASI

trust fund deficit if the intermediate assumptions prove to be the case.

     It is worth noting at this point why we present our figures in

discounted terms. First, this enables us to consider the present value

of potential futures of the OASI trust fund. This is especially

valuable as we compare scenarios with different time paths of surpluses

and deficits. Secondly, it obviates the need to give explicit

consideration to the interest received (or paid out) by the trust fund

on its calculated surplus (or deficit), if we assume that the interest

and discount rates are identical. Of course, individual participants

might value their benefits at more than the expected present value, as

they are paid as inflation-indexed life annuities. The present (1986)

value of the surplus or deficit through 2060 will equal the sum of the

present values of annual surpluses and deficits until then. As a

corollary, it becomes very simple to compute how taxes or benefits can

or must be changed to bring the trust fund into actuarial balance.

     The system finances are also presented in Figure 2, where the

discounted surplus both annually and on a cumulative basis for the system

are shown. On a cumulative basis the system starts to run a deficit

(assuming the surplus accrues and real interest is 2 percent) around 2048,

and on an annual basis, around 2025. We present below some hypothetical


calculates this deficit as averaging 0.15 percent of taxable payroll, or
half as large as the OASI deficit. The Social Security Administration
total projected OASDI deficit is thus 0.44 percent of taxable payroll. The
projected deficit in Hospital Insurance is another 3.5 percent.




                                   8
scenarios of the surplus being dissipated or alternative economic and

demographic projections which alter these conclusions substantially.

     The Social Security Administration's intermediate economic and

demographic assumptions are perhaps as reasonable as any, but we can be

sure that they will not be realized with great accuracy.8 It is thus

important to consider the impacts of a range of possible futures on the

Social Security system's finances.

     Table 2 summarizes the effects of using the Social Security

Administration's optimistic and pessimistic assumptions for future wage

growth, future mortality (and hence, life expectancy), future fertility and

various combinations of these parameters. Wide variations exist in

results for the financial solvency of the retirement trust fund. The

present (1986) value of the trust fund surplus (or deficit) through 2060

ranges from +$3.4 trillion to -$2.6 trillion, for the combined

optimistic and pessimistic assumptions respectively.9 We see in the

column headed "year annual deficit begins" that only when the optimistic

assumptions are combined do tax receipts exceed benefit expenditures in

each year through 2060; otherwise current-flow deficits begin between

2014 and 2030. In the next column we see that the cumulative surplus

suffices, however, to cover benefit expenditures until 2024 in the most

assumptions used in the past, see United States General Accounting Office
(1986).

trillion and -$11.1 trillion. Subsequent figures are also presented in
discounted terms. To remove discounting, multiply by 4.33.




                                     9
pessimistic scenario and beyond 2060 in several of the optimistic

scenarios.

     The Social Security Administration's intermediate (Il-B) assumption

for growth in real wages, used in our base case, is that there will be an

annual gain of one and one-half percent (with some fluctuation in the very

short-run). The optimistic assumption considers a gain of two and one-half

percent annually, and the pessimistic assumption considers a gain of one

percent.

     Interestingly, higher wage growth is better both for the system's

finances and for participants in the system. An increase in the trust

fund's annual surplus (taxes minus benefits) proves consistent with a

higher ratio of benefits received to taxes paid for the participants. The

reason for this is that increases in taxes, which vary with total wages,

precede the increases in benefits to which wage growth leads. The wage

index is used in the formula for determining benefits, and so a faster rise

in this index provides a higher rate of return for participants. What

"balances the books" is a growth in the unfunded liabilities of the

retirement trust fund. These liabilities could become quite burdensome if

wage growth slows in the future.

     We see in Table 2 that variation in wage growth changes taxes and

benefits in the same direction, but that taxes change to a greater extent.

High wage growth increases the long-run surplus by $1.37 trillion, more than

offsetting the long-run deficit expected under the base case. Low wage

growth deepens the long-run deficit by about $450 billion.

     In assumptions about mortality, what is "optimistic" for the solvency

of the retirement trust is "pessimistic" for participants, and vice versa.

The trust fund is more solvent when people die sooner and collect less in




                                   10
 benefits. Table 2 shows that under the Social Security Administration's

 high mortality (low life expectancy) assumption the trust fund is better

 off by $963 billion over the 75-year horizon, but that under the low

 mortality assumption, the system is worse off by $1.20 trillion.

      Alternative assumptions about fertility matter only for those cohorts

 not yet born. However, because Social Security participants begin paying

 taxes some forty years before they receive benefits, fertility rates will

have a big impact on trust fund finances in the next century)° Indeed,

today's low fertility rates are the most widely cited source of probable

future problems in Social Security finance. Current fertility rates are

about 1.9 children per woman over her child-bearing years. The Social

Security Administration's intermediate assumption is that this will rise

within the next two decades to 2.0 children per woman. The optimistic and
       -   -        -                           .     11
pessimistic assumptions are 2.3 and 1.6 respectively.      The results of our

simulation, shown in Table 2, are that high fertility would add $694

billion to the trust fund surplus, more than eliminating what is otherwise

a deficit, while low fertility would add $837 billion to the deficit.

     Under the combined optimistic and pessimistic assumptions for trust

fund finances the differences from the intermediate scenario for long-run

surplus are +$3.88 trillion and -$2.07 trillion (Table 3). The present




10. The level of immigration, especially of young people, will have an impact
for the same reason. We leave this matter for future investigation.

11. In our simulation we use the Social Security Administration's figures for
numbers of births each calendar year, which are derived from these
fertility rates. It should be noted that the fertility rates used by the
Social Security Administration refer to the "average number of children who
would be born to a woman in her lifetime if she were to experience the
birth rates by age observed in, or assumed for, the selected year and if
she were to survive the entire child-bearing period."




                                 11
value of taxes differs between these extreme scenarios by a factor of

nearly two, while benefits vary by a factor of about 1.3.

     Figure 3 shows how the size of the accumulated trust fund varies over

the next 75 years for the overall optimistic, intermediate (base case), and

pessimistic scenarios. Note that the continuing increase in the trust fund

occurs only when all of the optimistic assumptions occur simultaneously.

For any one of the optimistic assumptions alone, interest on the trust fund

is eventually insufficient to cover the difference between current benefits

and current taxes, and the principal itself is exhausted before 2090 (Table

3, last column).




4.   Financial Impact of Alternative Uses of the Potential OASDI Trust Fund
          Surplus

     We noted in the previous section that only under the combined

optimistic assumptions for wage growth, mortality and fertility can we

hope that the retirement trust fund will take in at least as much each

year in taxes as it pays out in benefits. In all other cases an

accumulation in the trust fund is necessary in order to forestall the

time when taxes must be raised or benefits reduced.12 Under intermediate

assumptions, for example, an annual deficit will begin in 2025 but the

accumulated surplus will keep the trust fund solvent until 2048.




12. Of course, the consumption of the economy as a whole is limited by what is
produced by those still working. Thus, in some sense Social Security
benefits must always be funded at the time they are paid. Still, the
method of financing Social Security determines who has what claims, and
this has important implications both for equity and efficiency.




                                  12
      It has always proved difficult to accumulate a large trust fund

 surplus. It is in the interest. of each session of Congrsss, andeach

 administration, to raise benefits (or perhaps to lower taxes, although that

has not yet been tried) if possible. Raising benefits conveys transfers to

those receiving, or soon to receive, benefits while imposing much of the

cost of the action on future generations which do not vote yet. Lowering

taxes, similarly, helps a current generation of workers while requiring

higher taxes from future generations than would otherwise be necessary.

     The situation is now particularly acute for a major demographic

reason: in less than 30 years the baby-boom generation will begin to

retire. If we do not accumulate a trust fund surplus before then,

future adjustments in payroll tax rates or in benefits will have to be

much greater than would otherwise be necessary.

     Figure 4 depicts the combined (employer and employee) tax rates which

would be required each year to fund currently-legislated benefits (given

intermediate assumptions) without adding to or drawing upon an accumulated

surplus. Until 202513 tax rates could be lower than those currently

legislated, but thereafter they would rise drastically.

     Conversely, Figure 5 shows the level of benefits which could be funded

by each year's tax receipts. This level is presented in the form of a

ratio to benefits as provided for under current legislation. We see that

benefits could be raised intermittently through 2009, to a level 30 percent



13. The higher tax rate shown for 2022 is a quirk resulting from the way our
simulation handles the rise in retirement age, from 66 to 67, which occurs
around that time. We simulate the change as occurring all at once rather
than phased in over several years.




                                 13
higher than that now legislated, but that thereafter they must either

decline or, perhaps more plausible politically, be maintained through

increases in payroll tax rates. The tax rates required to finance these

increased benefits are depicted in the broken line of Figure 4.

     Table 3 summarizes the financial impacts of several ways of

dissipating the trust fund surplus which is projected to grow over the next

35 to 40 years. "Pay-as-you-go tax rates" considers the scenario in which,

beginning in 1990, tax rates are set each year at a level which exactly

covers that year's benefit payments. Similarly, "pay-as-you-go benefits"

considers, also for 1990 on, the adjustment of benefit levels to match

projected tax receipts. The tax rates and benefit levels of these

scenarios thus follow the heavy lines depicted in Figures 4 and 5

respectively.

     The "benefit ratchet" scenarios consider the cases in which benefits

rise to their pay-as-you-go peak in 2009 but do not subsequently decline.

The first of these scenarios notes the enormous deficit ($3.69 trillion)

generated when the higher benefit level is not funded with taxes, while the

second considers the case of taxes rising, in a pay-as-you-go fashion, to

fund the increased benefits.

     The last two of these scenarios consider what will happen if the

surplus which would accumulate over the next forty years is dissipated, or

directed to other purposes. Two very plausible possibilities for this are

that the surplus could be used to cover some of the massive deficit in

Social Security's Hospital Insurance fund which (absent a major reform) will

develop within a few years,14 or that the surplus will, in the face of




                                 14
 federal budget deficits, be used to fund other expenditures. The first of

 these scenarios raises taxes in a pay-as-you-go fashion from 2025 on: Thus

 these scenarios are equivalent to the earlier pay-as-you-go scenarios from

 2025 on; they only lack the period in which tax or else benefit levels are

 more favorable for participants than the levels currently legislated. The

 chief result for system finances (Table 3) under all these scenarios        -   -
 except,   of course, the unfunded ratcheting of benefits -   - is   that the long-

 run surplus is, by construction, essentially zero.




 5.   Projections of Net National Saving and Its Components Under
      Alternative Hypothetical Scenarios

      We turn now to estimates of net national saving and its components

under alternative hypothetical scenarios concerning the future of Social

Security financing and various other factors. Before turning to the

results, we reiterate that these are meant only to be simple simulations

designed to highlight some emerging national policy issues. They are not

meant to be taken as a thorough analysis of the likely evolution of any of

the components, let alone all of them. Nor do they exhaust the various

interesting alternative scenarios. In these calculations, we use the SSA

projections, which differ slightly for OASI from my own, as discussed

above.




14. In practice, it is more likely that a portion of OASDI's payroll tax will be
reallocated to HI. The analysis of OASI finances would then be similar to
that of the pay-as-you-go tax rate scenario.




                                   15
      Note that net national saving, which we label total saving, TS, is the

sum   of   private saving, PS (gross private saving, net of depreciation, the

sum   of   personal and business saving), state and local government saving,

SLS (traditionally measured by the state and local surplus, although the

simultaneously accruing liabilities in the pension funds are not properly

accounted for nor is net state and local capital formation), and federal

government saving, FS (traditionally measured by the federal government

surplus, although the simultaneously accruing future pension liabilities

and federal government capital formation are not appropriately treated
            15
either).           Thus,


(1)              TS =   PS + SLS   + FS.



      We decompose the federal government surplus, FS, into the federal

surplus excluding Social Security, FSXS, and the OASDI surplus and HI

surplus. Thus,



(2)              FS =   FSXS + OASDIS      + HIS.


      Before turning to the basic simulation results, it is worth

anticipating the discussion in the next section concerning the importance

of net national saving for investment and international capital flows by

recalling from the national income identity that




15. See Boskin, Robinson and Huber (1987) for a discussion of federal, state
and local government saving when account is taken of capital formation, as
well as a number of other factors.




                                              16
 (3)        FS =   I   -   PS   -   SLS +   NFl,

where I is domestic investment and NFl is net foreign investment. Holding

national income constant, changes in FS must be matched by corresponding

changes in PS, I, SLS, and/or NFl. Once we establish the likely effects on

national saving in this section, we will discuss the implications for

investment and net foreign investment in the next section.

       We start out with some particular ttbase case" assumptions. For

simplicity, we assume in most, but not all, of the calculations that the

net private saving rate is constant at 6% of GNP, close to its historical

average. We discuss below cases in which "Denison's Law" holds, in which

the gross private saving rate is constant. In that case, the growth of the

capital consumption allowance will decrease net private saving. We also

discuss a simple conservative calculation of the impact of changing

demography on the saving rate through time. But in the remaining cases,

the net private saving rate is assumed constant at 6%. The state and local

surplus, according to the Commerce Department, has been abnormally high for

the last several years, in part due to funding issues in their pension

systems. It is presumed to run 1% of GNP for the next five years, then to

decline for the following ten years, until it reaches budget balance and

remains there from the turn of the century onward. This leaves us with

federal government saving, the non-Social Security surplus or deficit, and

the OASDI and HI surplus or deficit. We consider several alternatives for

the non-Social Security deficit. In the base case, we have the non-Social

Security deficit evolve to keep the national debt/GNP ratio constant at

current levels. Holding constant the ratio of national debt to CNP, we

ignore except in one scenario where we explicitly model a balanced primary




                                             17
budget, the distinction between the primary budget deficit and interest

payments.

     We consider various alternative scenarios or rules with respect to the

remainder of the budget, either explicitly or implicitly, via rules on the

overall budget. For example, we examine net national saving under Graimn-

Rudnian with and without HI balanced, a balanced budget from the year 2000

onward, continuing federal government deficits, the optimistic and

pessimistic SSA assumptions, a zero primary deficit, pay-as-you-go OASDI,

and benefits ratcheting up in the era of the OASDI surplus.

     The results of the simulation are portrayed in Figures 6 - 18.   Net

national saving and its components are plotted for the 75 year projection

period usually employed by the Social Security Administration, in this

case, 1986 to 2060. A variety of interesting features emerges from these

graphs. For example, consider Figures 6 and 7 which estimate net national

saving under Granun-Rudman plus the remaining assumptions described above.

The net national saving rate rises abruptly from its current 2% to about 7%

by 1991, due largely to the substantial decrease in the federal government

budget deficit. It then gradually declines to 6% around the turn of the

century for about a decade, then declines sharply to under 4% after 2026.

Importantly, the comparison of Figures 6 and 7 reveals that by moving HI

into budget balance we would raise the net national saving rate by about

two percentage points in the period after the turn of the century. We do

not discuss here what combination of tax increase and/or benefit reduction

is used to balance HI; it is assumed that it occurs in a manner that does

not affect the other components.

     Figure 8 presents net national saving under a balanced federal budget

for the year 2000 and thereafter. This might be thought of as simulating a

strict balance budget requirement, such as that advocated by a



                                   18
 constitutional amendment.   As can be seen, net national saving rises

 substantially, then gradually falls, reflecting the surplus turning to

 deficit in OASDI and the HI deficit. The budget is required to be in

balance for the non-Social Security part of the budget.

      In what might be thought of as a base case, with the debt/GNP ratio

 (excluding Social Security) held constant, Figures 9 and 10 project net

national saving with federal and OASDI deficits, and correspondingly, with

HI in budget balance. The net national saving rate falls precipitously,

beginning about the year 2005, and in the base case, falls to under 1% of

GNP by the year 2030. HI budget balance, as can be seen, adds the usual

couple of percentage points to the net national saving rate early in the

next century.

     Figures 11 and 12 use the base case assumptions for PS and SLS, but

replace the intermediate SSA assumptions by the optimistic and pessimistic

ones, respectively. They also allow the non-Social Security budget deficit

to evolve based on the alternative assumptions on GNP growth, etc. Net

national saving is substantially higher under the optimistic Social

Security assumptions, as the status of the OASDI fund and HI fund improve

enormously, as does, to a lesser extent, the non-Social Security deficit.

In fact, net national saving not only declines much less to slightly under

4% in the peak of the baby-boom's retirement, but begins to rise above 4%

later on. Under the pessimistic assumptions, as expected, net national

saving takes a nose dive, turning negative about 2015. This is due to the

very large deficits in HI, cumulating by then, and the fact that OASDI will

have turned to deficit about five years earlier, thereby offsetting all of

private saving.

     Figure 13 portrays net national saving under a zero primary deficit,




                                  19
i.e., the federal budget net of interest payments. As can be seen, net

national saving falls, but remains positive, if paltry, by the first

quarter of the next century.

     Figures 14 - 16 highlight some potential reactions to the building of

the OASDI surplus. Figure 14 portrays net national saving and its

components under pay-as-you-go OASDI, assuming either the tax increase to

finance deficits, and the benefit decreases during the period of OASDI

surpluses do not affect the other components of net national saving.

Dissipating the early surplus, compared to the base case, lowers net

national saving substantially in the first three decades of the projection.

Net national saving falls to 3% by the turn of the century, and eventually

declines still further to about 2% of GNP. Note, however, that net

national saving under pay-as-you-go OASDI, while substantially lower for

the next thirty years or so, eventually is higher, partially offsetting

base case projections of subsequent large OASDI surplus.

     Figure 15 presents net national saving under the alternative described

in detail in Section 4 concerning the possibility of benefits ratcheting up

during the period of the OASDI surplus and remaining at those higher levels

thereafter. Net national saving plunmiets as in the previous case for the

next thirty years, and then declines precipitously, becoming negative about

2016, and falling to -5% of CNP by about 2030. Undoubtedly, well before

such a national catastrophe occurred, various alternative policies would be

adopted. This is the flip side of the $3.7 trillion deficit estimated for

this case in Section 4. Note that were we to add a tax increase and/or

benefit cuts in the HI system to this case, that net national saving would

rise about 2 percentage points, as seen in Figure 16.

     Figures 17 and 18 estimate the impact of dissipation of the OASDI

surplus (assuming HI is balanced) by using it to finance the general



                                  20
federal deficit and to increase spending, respectively. The impact of the

dissipation of the surplus, and how the funds are used, is substantial.

     Finally, we present in Figures 19 and 20 two simplistic scenarios

where the private saving rate varies: First, because of changes in the age

structure of the population and second because of the alleged constancy of

the gross private saving rate, "Denison's Law". In Figure 19, we have

allowed the net private saving rate to vary with the age structure. We use

SSA projections of the fractions of the population in the three age

cohorts, 20-44, 45-64, and 65-and-over, in the future, assume that the

relative incomes per household of the three groups remain as estimated in

1984 (see Boskin, Kotlikoff and Knetter (1985)), and, for simplicity, that

the saving rate of people in their peak earning years is twice that of

younger workers, whereas the saving rate of the elderly is -3%. The rates

are calibrated so that the overall rate in 1984 is 6%. There is

substantial controversy concerning whether the elderly save or dissave

during retirement, at what rate, and the implications this may have for a

number of important aspects of saving behavior. We remain agnostic on this

issue in this particular paper, and merely present this as one hypothetical

situation which might result in saving rates changing. As can be seen in

Figure 19, however, the saving rate merely varies from 5.8% to 6.2%. We

would need either a much more dramatic change in the relative incomes or a

substantially greater variation in the saving rates by age for large

variations in the private saving rate to occur. Of course, this is

possible if the elderly do dissave and/or if relative incomes change so as

to change dramatically the relative income weighting underlying Figure 19.

In any event, relative to the base case, the variations are quite modest.

    Not so modest are the implications of "Denison's Law", which asserts




                                 21
that the gross private saving rate is constant. Ignoring any feedback from

changes in the net saving rate to the rate of investment, capital

formation, and depreciation, we simulate a simple scenario in which the

capital formation process in the economy results in a gradual rise in the

capital consumption allowance over the next forty years. We presume this

rise is about 2 percentage points. Clearly with the gross private saving

rate constant, the net private saving rate must decline by two percentage

points in this case. Under the other assumptions of the base case

scenario, net national saving, as depicted in Figure 20, declines by 2

percentage points, holding all of the other components constant. In this

case, national saving turns negative by 2016, as it falls continuously from

1991 on, the year in which we begin the simulation of the gradual rise in

the capital consumption allowance. There is no particular reason other

than simplicity why we have chosen this form, nor would we expect the

capital consumption allowance necessarily to move at this rate or to remain

constant after 2020; we present these results because of the strong belief

held by some in "Denison's Law".

     Tables 4, 5 and 6 highlight some of the important results on the

effects of Social Security on national saving. Table 4 projects net

national saving and its components as a percentage of GNP for the 75 year

period and for each of the usual 25 year sub-periods for the base case with

and without HI balanced. As can be seen, the total national saving rate is

a little over 2% for the entire period in the base case, and 3.33% when HI

is balanced. These 75 year averages are composed of a small OASDI deficit,

a federal deficit of 2.33% of GNP, a very small state and local surplus, a

constant 6% private saving rate, and the HI deficit in the base case and HI

budget balance from 1991 in the second case. The three sub-periods show

interesting variations. The net national saving rate is substantially



                                   22
higher in the first 25 year period, averaging slightly over 4%. In the

second period, the net national saving rate falls to 1.7% and 3.1%

respectively. In the third 25 year period, the corresponding net national

saving rates are 0.5% and 2.8%. Given the other assumptions, the primary

difference revolves around the OASDI and HI surplus/deficit pattern.

     Table 5 presents estimates of net national saving averaged over each

of the three twenty-five periods and the entire seventy-five year period

for various alternative future financing scenarios. It reveals the

substantial impact alternative Social Security financing alternatives may

have on net national saving. For example, consider the period 1986-2010.

Moving from the base case with accumulation of the OASDI surplus to pay-as-

you-go OASDI (i.e., tax rate cuts to match outlays) reduces net national

saving by 20%, from 4.0% to 3.2.% of CNP. Still more dramatic changes

occur with other financing scenarios and in the later periods.

     Table 6 presents an alternative method of viewing how quantitatively

important the Social Security surplus or deficit will be as a percentage of

other net national saving over the 75 year horizon and in each of the 25

year periods. For the base case, over the 75 year horizon, the Social

Security deficit, including the HI deficit offsets 38% of all other net

national saving. This decomposes into, adding 17% in the first 25 years,

offsetting almost one-half in the second 25 years, and over four-fifths,

in the third 25 year period. In the case where HI is balanced, by whatever

combination of tax increases and benefit reductions, Social Security

offsets substantially less of other net national saving. The Gramm-Rudman

cases demonstrate substantially higher other net national saving, and

therefore, the Social Security surplus or deficit offsetting a more modest

fraction of net national saving. The other cases indicate just how much




                                 23
 may be at stake in net national saving in alternative future Social

 Security financing policies. For example, in the case where benefits rise

 during the years which otherwise would have had a surplus, and then remain

 elevated, over three-fourths of all other net national saving will be

 offset by the OASDI deficit, starting with a small offset the first 25

 years and then offsetting all other saving. Clearly, in such a case,

 there would undoubtedly be some adjustment in taxes and/or the remainder of

 the budget to compensate.

     We have outlined the results nGt just to present an array of

alternative potential scenarios nor to present estimates of net national

saving which should be viewed in any way other than hypothetical, but to

highlight how important the direct effects of Social Security can be on net

national saving. That effect clearly can be enormous in any year, in each

of the twenty-five subperiods considered, as well as in the 75 year

projection period of the SSA. Assumptions concerning the other components

of net national saving will affect the level of net national saving but

still leave the situation where the status of the future financing of OASDI

will have an enormous direct impact on net national saving in the United

States. Of couse, the direct impact may be offset or accentuated by the

impact of OASDI on private saving and/or other components of government

saving and borrowing.




6.   Implications For Investment, International Capital Flows, Trade,
     Productivity Growth

     The results reported above were designed to highlight the potentially

significant impact that alternative policy options with respect to

accumulation or dissipation of the OASDI surplus will have on the net



                                  24
national saving rate. Net national saving is important for a variety of

reasons. Saving is the method by which individual households transfer

resources from one part of their lifetime to another, e.g., from their peak

earnings years to retirement. Government sector saving or borrowing, among

other things, is the method by which the public sector attempts to transfer

resources, at least tax burdens, intertemporally. More directly, net

national saving is available to finance domestic investment or net foreign

investment. A higher net national saving rate may help increase the level

of domestic capital formation, or decrease the need for imports of foreign

capital. The simplistic analyses we usually teach our graduate students

suggest that a high rate of capital formation will temporarily increase the

rate of economic growth and will lead permanently to a higher level of

income by making labor more productive due to the higher capital labor

ratio. In a closed economy, a higher saving rate will be invested in the

long-run.   In an open economy, a higher saving rate will increase U.S.

capital flows abroad and/or decrease foreign capital flows into the United

States. As discussed above, in recent years, the United States has been a

substantial importer of foreign capital. These imports have become

significant enough to make the U.S. a net debtor, at least if the books are

taken at face value (U.S. assets overseas are usually treated at historic

cost). Thus, each year the United States imports large amounts of foreign

capital, despite the short-run benefits, results in an annual stream of

claims against that investment in the future as interest, dividends and

rents to foreigners. Ultimately, the only way to pay those returns is for

the United States to export more than it imports. For example, in 1986 the

United States imported $144 billion of net capital from abroad. For

simplicity, if we assume a return of 10 percent, this would commit the




                                 25
 United States to an increase of net exports of $14 billion a year.

        Thus, a low net national saving rate will either be matched by a low

 domestic rate of capital formation or if investment in the United States

exceeds net national saving, continued foreign capital inflows into the

United States.

        The extent to which the United States must ultimately finance its

domestic capital formation from its own    saving   is uncertain. While recent

declines in net national saving have been substantially offset by importing

foreign capital, there is no convincing example in economic history of an

advanced economy financing its long-term development by continuing to rely

on foreign capital to finance its investment. The success stories of

external finance assisted growth have been of less developed countries,

whether recently or historically, such as the U.S. and Canada in the 19th

Century. Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Summers (1986) present evidence

which suggests that domestic investment at least in the long-run must be

financed by domestic saving. While the subject is far from closed, no one

can be sure how long foreign investors will be willing to pour several

percent of GNP into the United States annually.       Eventually foreign

portfolios will become less and less diversified as the share of their

assets in dollar-denominated securities grows to significant proportions.

They would thus demand higher returns to compensate for this increased

risk.

        Even if we conclude that in the long-run domestic capital formation

must be financed by national saving, the contribution of capital formation

to economic growth with respect to the magnitude and time frame is a source

of some controversy. Recent studies, for example, by Denison (1985) and

Jorgenson, Fraumeni, and Gallop (1987), come to quite different conclusions

with respect to the quantitative significance of capital formation in post-



                                    26
 war economic growth and in the productivity slowdown of the 1970s.

      While no precise quantitative estimate can be given detailing the

 impact of changes in the rate of net national saving upon domestic capital

 formation and international capital flows, and correspondingly on

productivity growth and/or future trade patterns, the qualitative patterns

are clear, and the quantitative impact is likely to be important: low

rates of net national saving are likely to lead to low rates of domestic

 investment in the long-run and substantial international capital flows into

the United States in the short-run. Thus, the policy options with respect

to Social Security have substantial ramifications for the future

performance of the economy well beyond the importance that they rightfully

deserve in terms of the retirement income security of current and future

retired persons.




7.   Conclusion

     This paper has documented how the systematic deviation from pay-as-

you-go finance of the Social Security system is planned to result in

signficant surpluses for the next several decades in OASDI. Subsequently,

OASDI will run large deficits. HI is projected to run large and growing

deficits beginning in the 1990s.

     Unless offset by changes in private saving or non-Social Security

budget deficits, these deviations from pay-as-you-go finance will cause

substantial systematic swings in the net national saving rate. Alternative

scenarios with respect to the disposition of the OASDI surplus over the

next three decades lead to important changes in the net national saving

rate. These swings are likely to be significant enough to cause




                                   27
quantitatively important changes in the level of domestic investment which

can be financed internally and/or the patterns of net foreign investment.

Thus, future trade patterns and productivity growth will be affected,

perhaps substantially.

     The paper thus highlights the important role Social Security's future

financing patterns will have on the course of the economy quite independent

of whether or not they affect private saving behavior. The potential

interaction of Social Security and private saving, and the potential

interaction of the state of the Social Security surplus (or perhaps more

accurately, its expected state) and the federal government's deficit in the

remainder of the budget will be important as well. The paper has

demonstrated the substantial reduction in the net national saving rate

which will occur if the OASDI surplus of the next three decades does not

accrue and is used instead to raise benefits, reduce taxes, or fund other

government programs (the most likely candidate being the HI deficit). The

likely response of private saving to the various alternative scenarios is a

source of controversy, partly because there is a major debate concerning

the methods by which the Social Security system may affect private saving, as

well as concerns about the quantitative magnitudes of any impact that may

have occurred historically. Changing demography, patterns of risk and

risk-bearing in the economy, household formation and dissolution, and

perceptions of the risks involved in "Social Security wealth" as opposed to

other types of assets may also make extrapolations from earlier studies

somewhat hazardous (see Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) for some interesting

simulation results with respect to changes in demography).

    However, it might generally be thought that if Social Security OASDI

surpluses are used to raise benefits substantially, this may well lead to a

decrease in saving for those then in their peak earning years, who expect



                                 28
 to receive higher benefits without having to pay higher taxes subsequently

 (netting out any private intrafamily intergenerational transfers offsetting

this effect, assuming that they are far less than dollar for dollar).

Other methods of dissipating the surplus would have analogous results,

depending upon the time pattern of changes in expected benefits and taxes

for persons of various ages. There is also the important fact that the

growth of Social Security, changing demography and changes in financial

markets, along with the deviations from pay-as-you-go finance, alter the

perceived risk attached to any potential claims to future Social Security

benefits. For example, well-off current prime age earners may believe that

Social Security will be means-tested at an income level below their

expected other resources when they reach old age in order to finance any

deficits that result. One might expect these perceived risks also to

affect private saving behavior.

     Of course, changes in net national saving may directly affect interest

rates which may in turn affect desired private saving, contributions to

defined benefit pension plans, the valuation of existing stocks of wealth,

etc. While the short-run openness of the economy to international flows of

capital might be expected to mitigate any effect on interest rates, all of

the advanced economies will be aging rapidly and may experience reductions

in private saving and pressure on their public budgets.

     Finally, there is an additional important channel by which private

saving behavior may be altered. In response to the pressures involved in

financing future Social Security benefits for the baby-boom generation, it

may well be that the remainder of the federal budget and/or public policy

with respect to private saving, such as rules governing pension plans, the

taxation of saving, etc., may respond in an attempt to encourage private




                                  29
saving. Of course, the extent to which they would be successful in doing

so raises a host of other questions to which only imprecise answers can be

given.

     In conclusion, this paper should be viewed as highlighting the

important role that Social Security's future financing pattern may have on

net national saving, directly through the accumulation of a surplus and

subsequent larger deficit, and indirectly through the potential interaction

of Social Security and private saving, and the potential interaction of the

state of the Social Security system's finances and the federal government's

deficit in the remainder of the budget. The numerous caveats concerning

the direct calculation discussed above, as well as the issues concerning

the response of private saving, should be borne in mind in interpreting the

results.
