                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper we use indirect inference to estimate a joint model of earnings, employment, job changes,
wage rates, and work hours over a career. Our model incorporates duration dependence in several
variables, multiple sources of unobserved heterogeneity, job-specific error components in both wages
and hours, and measurement error. We use the model to address a number of important questions in
labor economics, including the source of the experience profile of wages, the response of job changes
to outside wage offers, and the effects of seniority on job changes. We provide estimates of the dynamic
response of wage rates, hours, and earnings to various shocks and measure the relative contributions
of the shocks to the variance of earnings in a given year and over a lifetime. We find that human capital
accounts for most of the growth of earnings over a career although job seniority and job mobility also
play significant roles. Unemployment shocks have a large impact on earnings in the short run as well
a substantial long long-term effect that operates through the wage rate. Shocks associated with job
changes and unemployment make a large contribution to the variance of career earnings and operate
mostly through the job-specific error components in wages and hours.

1         Introduction
In this paper we build and estimate a simultaneous model of earnings.                   The model consists of
equations for transitions into and out of employment, an equation for job to job mobility, a wage
equation, an hours equation, and an earnings equation. The model features both observed and
unobserved permanent heterogeneity, job speci…c wage and hours components, a persistent compo-
nent that a¤ects the wage of a worker in all jobs, state dependence in employment and job mobility,
tenure and experience e¤ects, and measurement error.
        We have three main goals.     The …rst is to advance the literature in labor economics on how
employment, hours, wages, and earnings are determined over a career. We examine the e¤ects of
education, race, experience, job tenure and unobserved heterogeneity, employment shocks, shocks
to general skills, and draws of new job opportunities o¤ering di¤erent hours and wages. We trace
out the response of wages, hours, and earnings to the various shocks and determine the channels
through which they operate. Our analysis has implications for a number of long-standing questions
in labor economics. For example, we provide estimates of the relative importance of general skill
accumulation, job shopping, and job tenure for career wage growth and quantify the speci…c channels
through which an exogenous employment shock a¤ects the path of wage rates, hours, and earnings.
We study the e¤ects of shocks on the future variance of earnings changes as well as on the average
path.
        Our second goal is to provide a comprehensive account of what causes inequality in earnings at
a point in time and over the lifetime. We measure the contribution of each of the various shocks,
permanent unobserved heterogeneity, and education to the variance in earnings, wages, and hours
over the course of a career.
        Our third goal is to provide a richer model of earnings for use in studies of consumption and
saving as well as in dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium models that are a cornerstone of modern
macroeconomics and public …nance. Such models have been used to study the distribution of wealth,
the costs of business cycles, asset pricing, and other important questions.1                  The quantitative
implications of the calibrated theoretical models used in these lines of research depend on certain
key features of the earnings process, such as the degree of earnings uncertainty and the persistence
of earnings innovations.2
        Almost all of the existing structural studies base their modeling and calibration choices for the
    1

earnings process on the large empirical literature on univariate statistical models.3                    Much has
been learned about the statistical properties of career earnings from this work.                   However, with
only one indicator, univariate models, no matter how richly speci…ed, cannot identify the various
sources of earnings ‡uctuations, their relative importance, their dynamic behavior, or the economics
underlying how labor market outcomes are determined. Without such information, it is di¢ cult
to think about the potential welfare consequences of speci…c sources of variation or of policies such
as unemployment insurance, employment regulations, wage subsidies, or earned income tax credits
that insure against particular types of shocks to income.                Furthermore, the innovations in the
univariate representation of a multivariate time series process may be aggregates of current and
past shocks in the multivariate representation. This will lead to mistakes in characterizing what
the surprises to the agent are even under the assumption that the agent’s information set is the
same as the econometrician’s.
       Only a few studies of earnings dynamics have considered multivariate models. These include
Abowd and Card’s (1987, 1989) analyses of hours and earnings, and Altonji, Martins, and Siow’s
(2002) second order vector moving average model of the …rst di¤erence in family income, earnings,
hours, wages, and unemployment. Altonji, Martins and Siow’s use of their model to study con-
sumption and labor supply behavior and decompose the variance of innovations in the marginal
utility of income into various sources is not entirely successful, but it does illustrate the potential
that a multivariate model of the income process provides. The models that we consider, in con-
trast to those mentioned above, incorporate discrete events such as job changes, employment loss,
interactions between job changes and wages, and e¤ects of these discrete events on the variance of
wage and hours shocks.4
       There are two distinct paths that one might take in formulating a multivariate model of earnings.
The …rst approach is the development of a statistical model of the process with little attention to
an underlying theory of household decisions and constraints. This approach is in the spirit of the
literature on univariate earnings processes, but the absence of theory limits what one can learn
about how earnings are determined. The second approach is to develop a model that is based on
lifetime utility maximization. Grounding the model of the income process in a utility maximization
framework provides a foundation for using the results to analyze policies when earnings are partially
endogenous.       The main disadvantage is the di¢ culty of specifying and estimating a model that
incorporates labor supply choices, job search decisions, hours constraints, voluntary separations,
   3
     Key early contributions include Lillard and Willis (1978), Lillard and Weiss (1979), Hause (1980), MaCurdy
(1982). More recent contribution include Baker (1997), Geweke and Keane (2000), Haider (2001), Baker and Solon
(2003), Guvenen (2007), and Meghir and Pistaferri (2004). The latter paper introduces ARCH shocks.

     A number of recent studies provide structural models of wage rates, job mobility, and employment dynamics,
including Barlevy (2008), Buchinsky et al (2008), and Bagger et al (2007), who provide references to a few additional
studies. Wolpin (1992) is an early e¤ort. We discuss the evidence below.

and involuntary job changes. Indeed, we do not know of any papers that have studied work hours
and employment using a lifecycle utility maximization model that incorporates job speci…c hours
constraints, let alone job mobility decisions.5 Estimation of a structural model that is as rich as the
one that we work with would require solving an intertemporal model of job search, labor supply (in
the presence of hours constraints), and savings as part of the estimation strategy and is probably
out of reach at the present time from a computational point of view. Low, Meghir, and Pistaferri
(2008) take a major step in this direction by studying earnings risk and social insurance in the
context of an intertemporal model of consumption, employment participation, wages, and mobility.
They work with a simpler model of the earnings process than we do, but are able to measure welfare
costs of the risk associated with innovations in the persistent wage component, an employer speci…c
wage component, and job loss and unemployment. We view our study as complementary to theirs.
       Although our model falls short of a fully speci…ed behavior model, the equations can be viewed
as approximations to the decision rules relating choices to state variables that would arise in a
structural model based on lifetime utility maximization.                   The parameters of the rules depend
on an underlying set of "deep" parameters that characterize consumption preferences, job search
technology, etc.       The class of models that we consider is rich enough to address a number of
core behavior questions in labor economics, but tractable enough (at least the simpler versions)
to be used in place of univariate income models that dominate the literature on savings, portfolio
choice, etc. Furthermore, it provides a natural path along which to extend the analysis to include
other important economic risks that individuals face, including changes in family structure through
marriage, divorce, and the death of a spouse.
       We estimate the model using data on male household heads from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics.       Given the presence of interactions among discrete and continuous variables, unob-
served heterogeneity and state dependence in multiple equations, measurement error, and a highly
unbalanced sample, conventional maximum likelihood and method of moments approaches are not
feasible. For this reason, we use indirect inference (I-I), which is one of a family of simulation based
approaches to estimation that involve comparing the distribution of arti…cial data generated from
the structural model at a given set of parameter values to features of the actual data.6 A compli-
cation arises in our case because our model includes discrete as well as continuous variables. With
discrete variables, the simulated values of moments of the arti…cial data are not continuous in model
parameters, which makes gradient based numerical optimization methods problematic. Given our
   5
     Ham and Reilly (2002) is part of a literature that tests for hours restrictions in an intertemporal labor supply and
consumption framework using Euler equations and within period marginal rate of substitution conditions. Blundell
and MaCurdy (1999) survey the labor supply literature.
   6
      The method was introduced, under a di¤erent name, in Smith (1990, 1993) and extended by Gourieroux,
Monfort, and Renault (1993) and Gallant and Tauchen (1996). It is closely related to the simulated method of
moments.

model size, derivative-free methods are also unattractive. Consequently, we use a smoothed version
of the procedure suggested by Keane and Smith (2003). Estimation of our model is not straight-
forward, and a secondary contribution of our research is to explore the feasibility and performance
of I-I in large models with a mix of discrete and continuous variables.7
      There are too many results to concisely summarize, but a few deserve emphasis. First, edu-
cation, race, and the two forms of unobserved permanent heterogeneity play an important role in
employment transitions and job changes. Second, in keeping with a large literature on the labor
supply of male household heads, wages have only a small (negative) e¤ect on employment and on
annual work hours. Third, even after accounting for unobserved individual heterogeneity and job
speci…c heterogeneity, we …nd a strong negative tenure e¤ect on job mobility. Fourth, job changes
are induced by high outside o¤ers and deterred by the job speci…c wage component of the current
job.
      Fifth, unemployment at the survey date is associated with a large decline of .62 log points in
annual earnings. About 60 percent of the reduction is due to work hours, which recover almost
completely after one year. The other 40 percent is due to a decline of .25 in the log hourly wage rate.
Lost tenure and a drop in the job-speci…c wage component contribute .064 and .027, respectively,
to the wage reduction. The wage recovers by about .10 after 1 period and more slowly after that.
      Sixth, wages do not contain a random walk component but are highly persistent. The persistence
is the combined e¤ect of permanent heterogeneity, the job speci…c wage component, and strong
persistence in a stochastic component representing the value of the worker’s general skills.
      Seventh, shocks leading to unemployment or to job changes have large e¤ects on the variance as
well as the mean of earnings changes. Eighth, job shopping, the accumulation of tenure, and the
growth in general skills account for log wage increases of .111, .122, and .580, respectively, over the
…rst thirty years in the labor market.
      Finally, job mobility and unemployment play a key role in the variance of career earnings. Job
speci…c hours and wage components, unemployment shocks, and job shocks together account for
36.7%, 48.2%, and 46.8% of the variance in lifetime earnings, wages, and hours, respectively. Job
speci…c wage shocks are more important than job speci…c hours shocks for earnings. Job speci…c
wage shocks dominate for wages, with employment shocks also playing a substantial role.                            For
hours, job speci…c hours shocks dominate.              Education accounts for about 1/3 of the variance in
lifetime earnings and wages but makes little di¤erence for hours. In our full sample, unobserved
permanent heterogeneity accounts for about 11% of the variance in earnings and about 46% of the
variance of hours but matters little for wages, although this breakdown is somewhat sensitive to
the model and sample used.

      Other recent papers that apply I-I to panel data include Bagger et al (2007), Nagypal (2007), and Tartari (2006).

    The paper continues in section 2, where we present the earnings model. In section 3 we discuss
the data, which are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and in section 4 we
discuss estimation. We present the results in Section 5, beginning with a discussion of the parameter
estimates and then turning to an analysis of the …t of the model, impulse response functions to
various shocks, and variance decompositions. In Section 6, we brie‡y discuss results for alternative
samples, including whites by education level. In the …nal section we summarize our main …ndings
and provide a research agenda.


2     Models of Earnings Dynamics
The main features of Model A, our main speci…cation, are as follows. Labor market transitions,
wages, and hours depend on three exogenous variables— race, education, and potential experience—
as well as on two permanent unobserved heterogeneity components. The unobserved heterogeneity
components can be labelled, loosely speaking, “innate ability”and “propensity to move”. A typical
worker enters the labor market after leaving school and receives initial draws of an employment
status shock that determines whether the worker is employed or unemployed and an autoregressive
wage component capturing part of “general productivity” that has the same value in all jobs.
The worker also receives initial draws of a job-speci…c wage component and a job-speci…c hours
component.    There is state dependence in both employment and job-to-job transitions. In each
period an unemployed worker receives an unemployment transition shock and an employed worker
receives an employment transition shock. If the worker remains employed from one period to the
next, then whether the worker changes jobs depends on the draw of the job-speci…c wage component
for the new job, the current job-speci…c wage component, potential experience, job seniority, the two
permanent heterogeneity terms and an i.i.d. shock. A typical worker’s wage depends on one of the
heterogeneity terms (ability), the autoregressive general-productivity component, the job-speci…c
wage component, potential experience, and seniority. Unemployment spells have a negative e¤ect
on the autoregressive general-productivity component, and workers draw new job-speci…c wage and
hours components when they leave unemployment. Annual hours depend on employment status,
the heterogeneity terms, the wage, and a job-speci…c hours component that is identical across jobs.
Finally, earnings are determined by wages and hours.
    We work with several variants of Model A as well as with a second model, which we refer to as
Model B. Model B does not include job-speci…c wage or hours components. However, it includes
an autoregressive wage component which allows both the current wage to depend on the past wage
and the variance of wage shocks to depend on whether the individual is continuing an existing job.
In the next two subsections, we de…ne notation and list the equations of Model A and then discuss
the model. We then turn to Model B.

2.1             Model A.
A word about notation …rst. We control for economy wide e¤ects using year dummies, but leave
them implicit in most of the analysis. The subscript i; which we sometimes suppress, refers to the
individual, ti is potential years of labor market experience of i for a particular observation. We
sometimes refer to it as "time" and usually suppress the i subscript. The subscript j(t) refers to
the job that i holds at t: The notation j(t) makes explicit the fact that individuals may change
jobs. In particular, j(t) 6= j(t                 1) if i experiences a job change without being unemployed at either
t or t          1 or if i is employed at t but was unemployed at t                               1. The          parameters refer to intercepts
and to slope coe¢ cients.                    For each intercept and slope parameter the superscripts identify the
dependent variable.                    The subscripts of slope parameters identify the explanatory variable.                                       We

   and           identify the heterogeneity component.                             We use            with appropriate subscripts to denote

each other, and independent of all transitory shocks and measurement errors. We parameterize the
errors of the various equations so that         i   may be thought of as the …xed unobserved heterogeneity
component of wages (or “innate ability”). We also allow                            to in‡uence EE; U E, JC, and hours.
The factor    i   is assumed to have no in‡uence on wages. One may think of it as a factor that is
related to labor supply and to job and employment mobility preferences (or “propensity to move”).

2.2       Discussion of Model A
The EE equation states that the latent variable that determines Eit for previously employed workers
depends on a quadratic in ti , a linear function of EDi;t                        1   with a ceiling at 9 years, BLACKi , EDU Ci

                                                     it . Early on we experimented with including T ENi;t             1     as well as
EDi;t     1    but in simulation experiments found that we had trouble distinguishing the e¤ects of the
two. Standard labor supply models imply that employment at t should depend on the current wage
opportunity, which we proxy with wage0it . It also depends on the permanent wage heterogeneity
component             i   as well as the hours preference and mobility component                     i.

       The U E transition probability has the same form as EE, with unemployment duration U Di;t                                     1

replacing EDi;t 1 .                 Because there are relatively few multi-year unemployment spells, we exclude

U Di;t    1;   restricting          UD   to 0 in most of the analysis. We experimented with speci…cations containing
the lagged latent wage rate or the expected value of the period t wage but had di¢ culty identifying
the e¤ects of these variables, perhaps because we observe relatively few unemployment spells. We
do include the wage heterogeneity component                             i   as well as    i:

       The JC equation refers to job to job changes for workers who are employed in both t and t                                    1.
In our speci…cation of the link between mobility and wages, the main distinction we draw is between
job changes from employment and job changes that involve unemployment. We believe that this
is the most important distinction for the determination of wages and annual work hours, although
it would be interesting in future work to distinguish between quits and layo¤s on the basis of self
reports
       Standard job search and job matching models predict a negative coe¢ cient on                                  ij(t 1) ;   since
higher values of the job match component of the current job should reduce search activity and raise
                                                                                                                 0
the reservation wage.                    In the model each worker is assigned a potential draw of                ij 0 (t)   based on
                                                                                                                  0
(6), which we discuss momentarily. Search models predict a positive coe¢ cient on                                 ij 0 (t) ,   but the
magnitude should depend on the probability that the worker actually receives the o¤er. That is,
the relative magnitudes of the two coe¢ cients should depend on o¤er arrival rates and need not be
equal.8 We include T ENi;t                        1   as well as (t   1) because models of …rm …nanced or jointly …nanced
speci…c capital investment suggest that it will play a role, and the decline in separation rates with
T ENi;t        1   in cross section data is very strong. Little is known about how much of the association
between T ENi;t             1   and JCit is causal because of the di¢ culty of distinguishing state dependence
from the individual heterogeneity ( and ) and job match heterogeneity ( ) in dynamic discrete
choice models, particularly when data are missing on early employment histories for most sample
   8
    One could introduce parameters corresponding to …xed o¤er arrival rates for employed workers and for un-
employed workers into the model and add the value of 0ij 0 (t) into the unemployment equation. Low et al (2008)
work with such a speci…cation. In our job change equation, ij(t 1) may reduce mobility both because it raises the
reservation wage and because it lowers search intensity.


                                                                            9
members. Indeed, Buchinsky et al (2008) is the only other study that we know that accounts
for both individual and job speci…c heterogeneity and deals with initial conditions problems when
estimating the e¤ects of T EN and t on job changes.9
       When interpreting results for EE and JC, one must keep in mind that our employment indicator
refers to the survey date. We undoubtedly miss short spells of unemployment that fall between
surveys. Due to data limitations, we cannot tell whether a person has changed jobs between surveys
only once or multiple times. Furthermore, if a person is employed at t                     1, unemployed for part
of the year, and employed in a new job at t, we would count this as a job to job change even if,
for example, the job change is due to a layo¤ into unemployment. A relatively simple alternative
would be to make use of information on the number of weeks that the individual was unemployed
during the year. However, one would want to distinguish between short spells of unemployment
that are associated with temporary layo¤s with the strong expectation of recall and unemployment
spells due to a permanent layo¤. This is possible only at the survey date. Fortunately, earnings
depend on employment through annual work hours and the transitory error component in the hours
equation should capture the e¤ect on hours of unemployment spells of varying duration. The 25th,
50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of hours of unemployment are 120, 680, 1200, and 1600 when
EM Pit = 0 and 0, 0, 0, and 64 when EM Pit = 1.10
       The wage model (4) is unusual in our use of the concept of a latent wage. For employed
individuals wagelat                                                                          lat
                it and the actual wage wageit are the same. For an unemployed individual wageit

captures the process for wage o¤ers that exceed i0 s reservation wage. At a given point in time the
individual might not have such an o¤er. Our formulation allows us to capture in a parsimonious
way the idea that worker skills and worker speci…c demand factors evolve during an unemployment
spell.     From a practical point of view, the formulation also allows us to deal with the fact that
wages are only observed for jobs that are held at the survey date.
       The variable wagelat
                        it depends on …ve components. The …rst is the regression index
                                                                                                        w
                                                                                                        X Xit ,   which
captures the e¤ects of potential experience ti ; education, race, and economy wide variation (through
year dummies). Since we control for both tenure e¤ects and gains from job shopping, the e¤ect of
potential experience is a general human capital e¤ect. The second of the …ve components is tenure.
   9
     Buchinsky et al (2008) also …nd negative e¤ects in a simultaneous model of wages, employment, and job changes.
Farber (1999) discusses models of the e¤ect of tenure on mobility and surveys the empirical evidence. He presents
evidence showing a negative e¤ect of tenure when one uses prior mobility as a control for individual heterogeneity.
  10
      It is conceptually straightforward to specify the model on a quarterly or monthly basis. Simulated data that
matches the periodicity, level time of aggregation, and dating within the calendar year of the various PSID variables
could be constructed from the higher frequency data from the model. One could use both measures of weeks of
unemployment over the previous calendar year and unemployment at the survey date. One would have to think
carefully about the speci…cation of shocks— few employers reset wages on a monthly or quarterly basis. One might
also wish to incorporate smoothness restrictions on distributed lags, along the lines of Altonji, Martins and Siow’s
(2002) use of Almon lags in a quarterly model. We believe that there is merit in starting with the simpler speci…cation
that we employ.

The third is the heterogeneity component                                  i.    The fourth is a stochastic component ! it ; which
depends on ! i;t 1 , unemployment, and the error component "!it . The dependence of ! it on the past
may re‡ect persistence in the market value of the general skills of i and/or the fact that employers
base wage o¤ers on past wages. We will have more to say about the second mechanism when we
turn to model B. The …fth is the job match speci…c term                                       ij(t) .     When persons leave unemployment
or move from job to job without unemployment, they draw a new value of                                                            ij(t) :   The new value
depends on          ij(t 1) ,   a mean shift term          JC     in the case of a job change without unemployment, and
the shock "ij(t) : We set             JC   = 0 when        ij(t 1)        and       ij(t)   are included in the JCt model (models A.2
and A.3 below), because in that case any shift in the mean of                                           ij(t)   is accounted for endogenously by
the e¤ects of        ij(t 1)    and    ij(t)     on mobility. In standard search models with exogenous o¤er arrivals,
                                                               0
the job speci…c component of the o¤er,                         ij 0 (t)   does not depend on                      ij(t 1)   although accepted o¤ers
 ij(t)   will. In such models the correlation between accepted o¤ers                                              ij(t)   and     ij(t 1)    arises because
                                                                                                                                            0
the reservation wage is a positive function of                             ij(t 1) :     Nevertheless, we allow o¤ers                       ij 0 (t)   to depend
on       ij(t 1)   through the parameter                  for three main reasons.                               The …rst is that employers may
base o¤ers to prospective new hires in part on wages in the prior …rm, including the …rm speci…c
component. Bagger et al (2007), building on Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002) and Postel-Vinay and
Turon (2005), is one of a few recent papers in which outside …rms tailor o¤ers to surplus in the
current job. This surplus will be related to                          ij(t 1)       to the extent that               ij(t 1)    is the worker’s portion
of a job speci…c productivity component. However, in contrast to those papers, we do not allow
the current employers to change                      ij(t 1)   in response to outside o¤ers. (Wages do change through
                                      0
! it :) The second reason             ij 0 (t)   will depend on                ij(t 1)   is that        ij(t 1)   is not likely to be entirely job
speci…c in the presence of demand shocks a¤ecting jobs in a narrowly de…ned industry, occupation,
and region. The third is that the network available to an individual may be related to the quality
of the job that he is in. As it turns out, our estimates of                                     v    are large— about .60.11 We were not
successful in limited experimentation with estimating models in which the link between                                                                  ij(t)   and
 ij(t 1)    when JC = 1 di¤ers from the link following unemployment, although standard job search
models with exogenous layo¤s imply that it should.
       The equation for hoursit includes Xit . It also includes                                 i,      i,   and the product of the job speci…c
hours component            ij(t)   and Eit : We include            ij(t)       because there is strong evidence that work hours are
heavily in‡uenced by a job speci…c component. This component presumably re‡ects work schedules
  11
     Industry speci…c and/or occupation speci…c human capital are not accounted for in the model and are likely to
in‡uence estimates of    more than ! given that industry and occupation changes tend to occur across employers.
They would also a¤ect the estimates of the return to seniority that we import from Altonji and Williams (2005).
See Neal (1995), Parent (2000), and Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) for somewhat con‡icting evidence on the
importance of occupation speci…c, industry speci…c, and …rm speci…c human capital. Extending the model to
distinguish occupation and/or industry is conceptually straightforward but would require models of occupation and
industry transitions and attention to measurement error. We leave this to future work.

imposed by employers.12               A new value of         ij(t) is   drawn when individuals change jobs. The iid
error component "hit picks up transitory variation in straight time hours worked, overtime, multiple
job holding, and unemployment conditional on employment status at the survey.                             It may re‡ect
temporary shifts in worker preferences as well as hours constraints.
       Hours also depend on wagelat
                                it and Eit .                  For most observations, wagelat
                                                                                         it is the actual wage.

However, many individuals are unemployed at the survey date but work part of the year.                                  We
use wagelat
        it as the measure of the wage the individual would typically receive.                             Because wage
shocks turn out to be highly persistent and because we strongly question the standard labor supply
assumption that individuals are free to adjust hours on their main job in response to short term
variation in wage rates, we think of the coe¢ cient on the latent wage as a response to a relatively
permanent wage change rather than a Frish elasticity. We stick with this interpretation even though
we control for       i   in both the wage and hours equations.

might di¤er from 1 for a number of reasons, including overtime, multiple job holding, bonuses and
commissions, job mobility, and the fact that for some salaried workers the wage re‡ects a set work
schedule but annual hours worked may vary.                       We also include a …rst order autoregressive error
component eit to capture some of these factors. In previous drafts of the paper we freely estimated
 e           e
 w     and   h   and obtained values close to 1 for most speci…cations. However, for some versions of
the model it is helpful to restrict the coe¢ cients to be 1, which we do below.
       We have not considered models with an ARCH error structure.                       However, the model implies
that the variance of wage, hours, and earnings changes are state dependent and also depend on
t: This is because the odds of a job change and an unemployment spell depend on T EN; ED,
potential experience, and             ij(t)   and because job changes and unemployment spells are associated
with innovations in         ij(t)   and   ij(t) :   The variances also depend on the permanent components of Xit
(education and race) and on the unobserved heterogeneity components                        i   and   i.

       Many studies of the income process simply ignore the presence of measurement error even though
surveys by Bound et al.(2001) and others indicate that it is substantial. Altonji et al.(2002) and
some other studies have attempted to directly estimate the variances of measurement error in wages,
hours, and earnings under a classical measurement error assumption. Here, we draw loosely upon
studies of measurement error in the PSID and other panel data sets to come up with a range of
estimates of the measurement error parameters. For most of our models our choices imply that mw
                                                                                              it

accounts for 35% of var( wageit ), 25% of var( hoursit ), and 25% of var( earnit ). We abstract
from measurement error in employment, which we believe is relatively unimportant, as well as in
  12
    See Altonji and Paxson (1986) and Senesky (2005), who show that hours changes are much larger across jobs
than within jobs for both quits and layo¤s, and that one cannot account for this as a labor supply response to
di¤erences in wages, nonpecuniary job characteristics, or changes in labor supply preferences.


                                                                 12
the job change indicator, which we suspect is more serious. (See Altonji and Williams (1998)). Our
reported standard errors do not account for uncertainty about the measurement error parameters.13

2.3          Model B
The main di¤erences between Model A and Model B are in the wage and JC equations. The wage
equation for Model B is

           The above wage model does not include the job speci…c wage component                                               but introduces
                                       14
the coe¢ cients        1   and       2.      These allow the degree of persistence and the variance in the wage
innovation to shift with a job change or end of an unemployment spell. As noted above, our
speci…cation of state dependence in wages captures the fact that many employers use past wage
rates, along with other information, in determining wage o¤ers for new hires, as well as the fact
that previous wage rates are a reference point for incumbent workers when evaluating an o¤er. It
may also re‡ect dependence between the productivity of a worker today and productivity last year.
One might expect the degree of dependence to be weaker across jobs than within jobs (                                               1   < 0).
          The JC equation is the same as (3) with the                                terms excluded. We have estimated versions
of Model B with and without wagei;t                          1     in the EE and JC equations but to save space report the
version without the wagei;t              1   terms. The hours equation excludes the job speci…c hours component
 :
          We use Model B for three reasons. First, it is a smaller step from univariate models of the wage
process than Model A. Second, it has proved to be easier to estimate. Finally, it is more tractable
than Model A for use in dynamic programming models of consumer behavior.15
     13
      The assumption of normally distributed, classical measurement error runs counter to evidence that actual reports
are a mixture of correct responses and responses with error. Furthermore, Bound et al (2001) summarize evidence
that measurement error is mean reverting to some extent, with individuals smoothing shocks when they report on
economic variables. In principle, our methods can accommodate almost any measurement error assumption. We
stick with the simpler formulation for lack of hard quantitative evidence on richer measurement error speci…cations
that we can import into our model.
   14
      In early work we experimented with allowing the e¤ect of i to grow linearly with experience, but did not obtain
sensible results.
   15
      Vidangos (2008) has simulated a model of optimal lifetime consumption using a family income process that
embeds a version of model B as the wage process for the household head.

We use the 1975-1997 waves of the PSID to assemble data that refers to the calendar years 1975-
1996. Because some observations are lost due to the use of lags, the current values of the variables
in our model range from 1978 to 1996. We include members of both the SRC strati…ed random
sample and SEO sample. The latter consists primarily of households that were low income in 1968
and substantially overrepresents blacks. We also present results for the SRC sample only. We also
include nonsample members who married PSID sample members. The sample is restricted to male
household heads. We include both single and married individuals.
       Observations for a given person-year are used if the person is between age 18 and 62, was
working, temporarily laid o¤ or unemployed in a given year, was not self employed, had valid data
on education (EDU C) and had no more than 40 years of potential experience. We treat persons on
temporary layo¤ at the survey date as employed. We eliminate a small number of observations in
which the individual reports being retired, disabled, a housewife, a student, other, or "don’t know".
(See Appendix tables A1 and A2).16
       Potential experience ti is ageit    max(EDU Ci ; 10)          5: BLACKi is one if the individual is black
and 0 otherwise. EDit is the number of years in a row that a person is employed at the survey date.
In 1975 and for persons who join the sample after 1975, we set EDit to tenure with the current
employer.17
       The variable U Di;t   1   is the number of consecutive years up to t        1 that the individual has not
been employed at the survey date. We set U Di;t               1   to 0 if the …rst time we observe i is in year t:
Few unemployment spells exceed 1 year, so the error is probably small. The wage measure wageit
is the reported hourly wage rate at the time of the survey. It is only available for persons who are
employed or on temporary layo¤.18
       Finally, we censor reported hours at 4000, add 200 to reported hours before taking logs to reduce
the impact of very low values of hours on the variation in the logarithm, and censor observed earnings
and observed wage rates (in levels, not logs) to increase by no more than 500% and decrease to no
less than 20% of their lagged values. We also censor wages to be no less than $3.50 in year 2000
  16
     We allow persons to come out of retirement and include future observations following a retirement spell if the
individual is working, temporarily laid o¤ or unemployed. As reported in Appendix Table A1, 1.85% of the PSID
sample reports an employment status as disabled in a given year.
  17
     An alternative would be to apply exactly the same censoring that occurs in the PSID in the simulated data. In
the simulated data EDit would be set to tenure when t in the simulated case is equal to t for the …rst value we see
in the corresponding PSID case.
  18
     This measure is the log of the reported hourly wage at the survey date for persons paid by the hour and is based
on the salary per week, per month, or per year reported by salary workers. It is unavailable prior to 1970 and is
limited to hourly workers prior to 1976. We account for the fact that it is capped at $9.98 per hour prior to 1978 by
replacing capped values for the years 1975-1977 with predicted values constructed by Altonji and Williams (2005).
They are based on a regression of the log of the reported wage on a constant and the log of annual earnings divided
by annual hours using the sample of individuals in 1978 for whom the reported wage exceeds $9.98.

dollars.
       After observations are lost due to construction of lagged values, or missing data, we use infor-
mation on 4,632 individuals.       Each individual contributes between 1 and 19 observations.              The
5th, 25th, median, 75th, and 95th percentile values of the number of observations a given individ-
ual contributes are 1, 3, 6, 11, and 18 respectively (see Appendix Table A3). Of course, persons
who are present for many years contributed disproportionately to the total of 33,933 person-year
observations. The number of observations per year varies from 1,200 in 1979 to 2,007 in 1991.
       The sample is highly unbalanced. As we have already noted, an advantage of simulation based
estimators such as I-I is that by incorporating the sample selection process into the simulation, one
can handle unbalanced data. We assume that observations are missing at random, although there is
reason to believe that the heterogeneity components and shocks in‡uence attrition from the sample.
In principle, one could augment the model with an attrition equation. Alternatively, it would be
straightforward to simply use sample weights to reweight the PSID when evaluating the likelihood
function of the auxiliary model if suitable weights were available. However, PSID sample weights
are designed to keep the data representative of successive cross sections of the US population that
originate in the families present in the base year.19 They do not adjust for factors that alter the
US population, such as di¤erences in birth rates by race or education. Furthermore, there are no
sample weights for persons who move into PSID households through marriage. Consequently, we
do not use weights. In essence, we are assuming both that observations are missing at random and
that the model parameters do not vary across demographic groups or over time. The results are
fairly robust to restricting the analysis to the SRC sample, as we discuss in Section 6. We also
report separate results for SRC whites by education level.
       In Table 1a we present the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of the variables
used in our structural model. The mean of Eit is .97, so we observe relatively few unemployment
spells. Note also that the mean of EEit is .98.            Given these magnitudes, even relatively large
movements in the latent variable index determining EEit have only a small e¤ect on whether EEit
is 1 or 0: In Table 1b we provide additional information about our sample, including the mean and
standard deviation for education, race, potential experience, and the calendar year.


4        Estimation Methodology
We begin with a brief overview of our estimation procedure. We then de…ne the auxiliary model
used in the estimation procedure as well as additional moment conditions that we use. Note …rst
that to reduce computational complexity, we estimate the coe¢ cients on vector Xit in equations
  19
    See Fitzgerald, Gottschalk and Mo¢ tt (1998) for an analysis of attrition in the PSID. They conclude that at
least through 1989 the PSID is fairly representative of the US population once internal sample weights are used.


                                                      15
with continuous dependent variables by …rst regressing hoursit , wageit , and earnit on Xit .                 The
vector Xit consists of a constant, years of education, BLACKi , ti , t2i , t3i , and a set of year dummies.
We then work with the residuals of these variables when estimating the remaining parameters by
I-I.20

4.1          Indirect inference
For clarity, we will refer to Model A (or B) above as the “structural”model, even though the models
do not express the parameters of the decision rules for EE, U E, JC, etc., in terms of preference
parameters and parameters governing job search, mobility, and exogenous layo¤s. We denote the
k “structural” parameters by .           Indirect inference involves the use of an “auxiliary” statistical
model that captures properties of the data. This auxiliary model has p                   k parameters . The
method involves simulating data from the structural model (given a hypothesized value of ) and
choosing the estimator ^ to make the simulated data match the actual data as closely as possible
according to some criterion that involves .
         Let the observed data consist of a set of observations on N individuals in each of T time periods:
fyit ; xit g, i = 1; : : : ; N , t = 1; : : : ; T , where yit is endogenous to the model and xit is exogenous.
The auxiliary model parameters           can be estimated using the observed data as the solution to:

                                            ^ = arg max L(y; x; );

where L(y; x; ) is the likelihood function associated with the auxiliary model, y                      fyit g and
x         fxit g.
         Given x and assumed values of the structural parameters           , we use the structural model to
                                                          yitm ( )g, m = 1; : : : ; M .
generate M statistically independent simulated data sets f~                                          Each of the
M simulated data sets has N individuals and is constructed using the same observations on the
exogenous variables, x. For each of the M simulated data sets, we compute ~m ( ) as

                                       ~m ( ) = arg max L(~
                                                          ym ( ); x; );

where the likelihood function associated with the auxiliary model is evaluated using the mth sim-
ulated data set y~m ( )  yitm ( )g rather than the real data. Denote the average of the estimated
                        f~

    20
     Note that we include the constants w    h        e
                                         0 ; 0 ; and 0 in the wage, hours and earnings models even though we also
include a constant when construct hours, wage, and earnings residuals. Our reported standard errors do not account
for …rst stage estimation of the X parameters. We doubt that adjustment would make much di¤erence because the
estimated standard errors for the elements of X are small. Also, note that the coe¢ cients on the experience pro…le
of wages capture not only the e¤ects of general human capital and age but also average growth in j(t) and tenure
with t. When we estimate Model A.3 by indirect inference, we include a quadratic in experience in the equation for
the wage to account for this. We did not include these terms in models A.1, A.2 and B.1, which exclude tenure from
the wage equation.

                                                        16
   I-I generates an estimate ^ of the structural parameters by choosing to minimize the distance
between ^ and ~( ) according to some metric.21 As described in Keane and Smith (2003) and
elsewhere, there are (at least) three possible ways to specify such a metric. Here we choose ^ to
minimize the di¤erence between the constrained and unconstrained values of the likelihood function
of the auxiliary model evaluated using the observed data. In particular, we calculate

                                  ^ = arg min[L(y; x; ^)        L(y; x; ~( ))]:

Gourieroux, Monfort, and Renault (1993) show that ^ is a consistent and asymptotically normal
estimate of the true parameter vector 0 . The reason is that as N becomes large holding M
and T …xed, ~( ^ ) and ^ both converge to the same “pseudo” true value 0 = h( 0 ) where h is a
nonstochastic function.
       Accommodating missing data in I-I is straightforward: after generating a complete set of simu-
lated data, one simply omits observations in the same way in which they are omitted in the observed
data. As we have already discussed, we assume that the pattern of missing data is exogenous. In
the simulated data, we simply omit observations according to the same pattern. In some cases, it
is convenient to estimate auxiliary models in which missing observations are replaced with some ar-
bitrary value (such as 0). In such circumstances, the same principle applies: use the same arbitrary
values in both the simulated and observed data sets.
    In our structural model, the observed data y consists of both continuous and discrete random
variables. Discrete random variables complicate the calculation of ^ because the objective function
(i.e., the di¤erence between the constrained and unconstrained values of the likelihood) is discon-
tinuous in the structural parameters . Discontinuities arise when applying I-I to discrete choice
models because any simulated choice y~itm ( ) is discontinuous in           (holding …xed the set of random
draws used to generate simulated data from the structural model). Consequently, the estimated
set of auxiliary parameters ~( ) is discontinuous in . The non-di¤erentiability of the objective
function in the presence of discrete variables prevents the use of gradient-based numerical optimiza-
tion algorithms to maximize the objective function and requires instead the use of much slower
algorithms such as simulated annealing or the simplex method.
       To circumvent these di¢ culties, we use Keane and Smith’s (2003) modi…cation to I-I, which they
call generalized indirect inference. Suppose that the simulated value of a binary variable y~itm equals
1 if a simulated latent utility u~m
                                  it ( ) is positive and equals 0 otherwise. Rather than use y~itm ( ) when
computing ~( ), we use a continuous function g(~        um ( ); ) of the latent utility. The function g is
                                                           it

chosen so that as the smoothing parameter                        um
                                                    goes to 0, g(~                        ~itm ( ). Letting
                                                                   it ( ); ) converges to y
  21
    When generating simulated data sets, the seed in the pseudorandom number generator is …xed so that the draws
of the random innovations are the same for di¤erent values of .

  go to 0 as the observed sample size goes to in…nity ensures that ~(           0)   converges to   0,   thereby
delivering consistency of the I-I estimator of     0.    Our choice of g is
                                                            um
                                                        exp(~ it ( )= )
                                      um
                                    g(~ it ( ); ) =                        :
                                                      1 + exp(~umit ( )= )

Because the latent utility is a continuous and smooth function of the structural parameters , g is
a smooth function of . Moreover, as         goes to 0, g goes to 1 if the latent utility is positive and to
0 otherwise.
       When the structural model contains additional variables that depend on current and lagged
values of indicator variables y~itm , these additional variables will also be discontinuous in . In our
structural model, for instance, variables such as employment duration and job tenure depend on
the history of indicator variables such as employment status and job changes. Since employment
duration and tenure are discontinuous in , they also contribute to creating a discontinuous objective
function in the estimation process. Our smoothing strategy, however, ensures that all these variables
will also be continuous in      , provided that they depend continuously on y~itm .          In other words,
                                                                       um
replacing the indicator functions by their continuous approximations g(~ it ( ); ) ensures that all

other variables that depend on                   um
                                       through g(~ it ( ); ) are continuous.         Care must be taken in
choosing , because approximation error in indicator functions for a particular year accumulate in
the approximate functions for employment duration and tenure.
       We searched for a combination of the smoothing parameter           and the number of simulations M
that generates su¢ cient smoothness in the objective function, while keeping bias small and compu-
tation time manageable. The larger these parameters are, the smoother the objective function will
be, but large values of     introduce bias and large values of M increase computation time. Based
upon simulation experiments, we chose a small value of , .05, which is large enough to smooth the
objective surface su¢ ciently given our choice of 20 for M . Our simulation experiments as well as
the parametric bootstrap results reported below indicate that the associated bias in the estimates
is small for almost all of our parameters.
       We use a parametric bootstrap procedure to conduct inference. Given consistent estimates of
the structural parameters, we repeatedly generate “arti…cial”observed data sets from the structural
model, estimate the parameters of the structural model for each such data set, and then calculate
the standard deviations of the parameter estimates across the data sets. These standard deviations
serve as our estimates of the standard errors of the structural parameter estimates associated with
the actual observed data.22 Standard errors of functions of model parameters, such as the impulse
response functions and variance decompositions are constructed as the standard deviation across
parametric bootstrap replications.
  22
    As a check, we also computed standard errors using a nonparametric bootstrap procedure based on resampling
from the PSID for some speci…cations. We used 100 replications and obtained similar results.

4.2      The Auxiliary Model
Our auxiliary model consists of a system of seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) with 7 equations
and 25 covariates that are common to all 7 equations. We implement the model under the as-
sumption that the errors follow a multivariate normal distribution with an unrestricted covariance
matrix. One may write the system as




(15)                        Yit = Zit + uit ; uit                   N (0; ); uit iid over i and t;

   where




   Yit = [Eit Ei;t 1 ; Eit (1             Ei;t 1 ); JCit Eit Ei;t 1 ; wageit ; hoursit ; earnit ; ln(1 + wageit 2 )]0 ;

   and

(16)         Zit = [Const; (ti           1); (ti        1)2 ; BLACKi ; EDU Ci ; EDi;t 1 ; U Di;t 1 ; T ENi;t 1 ;
                     Ei;t    1   Ei;t 2 ; Ei;t    2    Ei;t 3 ; Ei;t      1    (1     Ei;t 2 ); Ei;t   2   (1    Ei;t 3 );
                                     JCi;t    1       Ei;t   1   Ei;t 2 ; JCi;t      2   Ei;t   2   Ei;t 3 ;
                         wagei;t 1 ; wagei;t 2 ; hoursi;t 1 ; hoursi;t 2 ; earni;t 1 ; earni;t 2 ;
   wagei;t    1    (ti     1); wagei;t    1   (ti        1)2 ; wagei;t        1    JCit ; wagei;t      2   JCi;t 1 ; wagei;t   2   Ei;t 1 ]0


   Since          has 25         7 elements and                  is a 7           7 covariance matrix with 28 unique elements,
the auxiliary model has 203 parameters. In contrast, Model A.3 has only 46 parameters that we
estimate by I-I (not counting the measurement error parameters, tenure coe¢ cients, and                                                 ! ):   As
we discuss momentarily, a few of the 46 parameters are estimated all or in part using additional
moment conditions rather than exclusively by I-I. Consequently, the number of features of the data
used to …t the structural model greatly exceeds the number of parameters.
   In estimating the model we use the likelihood function that corresponds to (15). Note that the
assumption uit              N (0; ) with uit iid over i and t is false for several reasons, including the fact
that Y contains binary variables and that both wageit and ln(1+wageit 2 ) appear. However, the fact
that we use a misspeci…ed likelihood a¤ects the e¢ ciency of our procedure rather than consistency.
   Our choice of what to include in the auxiliary model is as much a matter of art as science, but
is motivated by the following principles. First, we use a common set of right-hand-side variables in
the seven equations of the auxiliary model to avoid having to iterate between                                         and      to maximize

                                                                          19
the likelihood function. The disadvantage, however, is that we do not tailor the right-hand-side
variables to the particular dependent variable. As a result, the auxiliary model probably contains
more parameters than are needed to describe the data. Furthermore, we are restricted in our ability
to add additional right-hand-side variables to particular equations, such as additional interactions
between (ti       1) and other lagged variables, because the total number of variables would get out of
hand. Although it would be useful to explore di¤erentiating the equations of the auxiliary model
in future work, our simulations indicate that most of our parameters are quite well determined by
the auxiliary model that we have chosen.
       The second principle is to include variables that appear as explanatory variables in the structural
model. This accounts for the presence of (ti 1), (ti 1)2 , EDU Ci ; BLACKi ; EDi;t 1 ;and T ENi;t 1 .
                                                                   UE
We also include U Di;t      1   even though we constrain           it     to equal 0: Since the model is dynamic and
includes state dependence terms in most equations, we include two lags of each dependent variable
except ln(1 + wageit 2 ).        The lags help distinguish between state dependence and heterogeneity.
Finally, we include the interaction terms wagei;t              1    (ti     1), wagei;t   1   (ti   1)2 , wagei;t   1   JCit ,
wagei;t    2   JCi;t 1 ; and wagei;t   2   Ei;t   1   to help capture any nonstationarity in wages.
       One disadvantage of our choice for (16) is that the …rst three observations for each individual
are lost due to lags.       This makes it di¢ cult to identify parameters of the models for the initial
wage and employment status. It also makes it di¢ cult to identify changes with experience in the
variance of shocks at the beginning of a career. In principle, one could add additional equations
with 0, 1, or 2 lags to the auxiliary model to accommodate observations with missing data. The
cost would be a more complex auxiliary model. (Alternatively, one can set values of missing lags
to 0 in both the simulated and actual data.) In simulation experiments we did not …nd that adding
such equations helped a great deal with identi…cation of model parameters. In the next section,
we discuss use of the variance of wages when t                    5 for each race-education group to help identify
parameters of the initial condition for wages. We also discuss the initial condition for employment.

4.3       Use of Additional Moments and Other Information Sources to Iden-
          tify Parameters
In the equation for initial employment we estimate the intercepts b0g as ^b0g = ^b0g ^ E1 where
      q
          EE       EE
^ E1 = (^ )2 + (^ )2 + 1 and ^b0g is the coe¢ cient estimate from a Probit regression of Eit on a
constant estimated on PSID data for t                  5 for each of 4 groups g de…ned by race and whether the
person has more than a high school education. We use the …rst …ve years rather than simply the
…rst because we have relatively few observations for each group when t = 1.23
  23
    As it turns out, ^b0g is 0.918 for blacks with a high school degree or less, 1.427 for blacks with more than high
school, 1.391 for whites with high school or less, and 1.671 for whites with more than high school. We obtained
similar results for other model parameters when we constrain ^b0g to be the same for all groups and use t        3 to


                                                             20

Because of sample size considerations we estimate V ar(wresi1 ; g) as the variance of (residual) wage

    In the case of model A, we also use a large number of moment conditions spanning a much longer
time span than the 3 lags in our auxiliary model to identify                        !    and help distinguish persistence due
to ! it from persistence due to         i   and   ij(t) .   For workers who are continuously employed between

and approximate standard errors for jmax ; gmax = 5, jmax ; gmax = 6, jmax ; gmax = 7, jmax ; gmax = 8,
and jmax ; gmax = 9 are .882 (.027), .919 (.020), .927 (.014), .94 (.011), and .94 (.009) respectively.
We chose :92 as our point estimate.24                 For Model A.1, we obtain .913 when we ignore (17) and
freely estimate    !   by I-I.
    In model B we make use of an expression for the di¤erence in the variance of wage growth
conditional on JCit + Eit (1       Ei;t 1 ) = 1 and conditional on JCit + Eit (1                        Ei;t 1 ) = 0 to express the

  24
     The number of moments varies from 2,789 when jmax and gmax are 5 to 7,906 when jmax and gmax are 9: The
standard errors account for heteroskedasticity but not for correlation among the moments, which use overlapping
data. They are probably understated. In the case of Model A.3, equation (17) is an approximation because Model
A.3 states that employment transition probabilities depend on ! t . This means that the evolution of ! t depends on
the number of periods of continous employment: j + g: We doubt that this is an important problem. Setting ! to
.90 instead of .92 has little e¤ect on the variance decompositions.

                                                                 21
1.25 We do not use moment conditions analogous to (17) to estimate                         !,   although the estimate
we obtain by I-I, .95, is in the neighborhood of the above values.
       Finally, when we include tenure in the wage equation (model A.3 in Table 2), we impose Altonji
and Williams’(2005) estimates of tenure polynomial P (T ENit ) based on PSID data for the years
1975-2001 rather than attempting to estimate it by I-I, which would have required the addition of
a number of additional variables to the auxiliary model.26
       The parametric bootstrap standard errors reported below do not account for sampling error in
the above sample moments of the PSID or in the tenure parameters.

4.4        Mechanics of Estimation
Our chosen values of          = 0:05 and M = 20 yield a smooth objective function that allows the use
of fast gradient-based optimization algorithms with little evidence of bias.27 Not surprisingly given
the size and complexity of our models, the objective function displays multiple local optima with
respect to some of the parameters. We experimented extensively with di¤erent starting values to
make sure that we are …nding the global optimum. We began the process by obtaining estimates
of a series of “reduced-form equations” that correspond to the equations in the structural model.
As part of the process, we have used grid evaluations for the set of parameters that appear most
problematic, and we have used the smaller models to help us …nd good initial guesses and then build
up to more complex ones. The problem is more serious in the case of Model A.1-Model A.3 than
for Model B. This is one of the reasons that we make use of the moments (17) to help distinguish
 !   from      :
       The fact that we have between 39 and 46 parameters estimated by indirect inference, the large
size of the auxiliary model, and the number of simulations make computation very time-consuming
even though we use a fast gradient based optimization algorithm. To reduce estimation time, we
exploit the highly parallelizable structure of our estimation methodology.28
  25
     Due to an error, the condition we actually imposed di¤ers from the condition derived in Appendix 1. Re-
estimating the model using the correct condition made almost no di¤erence for the parameter estimates. We will
recompute the bootstrap standard errors and simulations for Model B in a future draft.
  26
     The pro…le that we use corresponds to Table 6, Panel D, column 2 of their paper. It is .0272563 T en :0023283
T en2 + :00815T en3 =100 :000914T en4 =1000. The implied return to 2, 5, 10 and 20 years of tenure are .046 (.0064),
.008 (.0011), .112 (.016), and .119 (.029). It is obtained using Altonji and Shakotko’s (1987) instrumental variables
approach, which treats t as exogenous and uses the within job j variation in T enijt ; T en2ijt ; T en3ijt , and T en4ijt to
identify the e¤ects of tenure. Our …nding of a modest link between t and ij(t) implies that Altonji and Williams’
estimates are biased downward by a small amount.
  27
     We use a standard quasi-Newton algorithm with line search, which can additionally handle simple bounds on
the choice variables. The algorithm approximates the (inverse) Hessian by the BFGS formula, and uses an active set
strategy to account for the bounds. Gradients are computed by …nite di¤erences.
  28
     Speci…cally, for any given value of the structural parameters, the M simulations required to evaluate the objective
function are essentially independent and can be conducted simultaneously by k di¤erent processors. Using our
parallelized computer algorithm on k M + 1 (balanced) processors reduces computation time by a factor of about
d kM1 e
   M ,    where d e is the ceiling function. All programs are written in FORTAN 90. The parallelization is implemented

4.5    Local Identi…cation and Analysis of Estimation Bias
We have chosen the auxiliary model with an eye toward distinguishing among state dependence,
…xed heterogeneity, and transitory shocks and an eye toward establishing links across equations
in the heterogeneity components. However, one cannot easily verify that the parameters of our
model are identi…ed by matching up the parameters against sample moments. In particular, the
fact that the number of moments that play a role in the likelihood function of the auxiliary model
is much larger than the number of structural model parameters does not establish identi…cation of
any particular parameter. Consequently, we use Monte Carlo experiments extensively to establish
local identi…cation and analyze the adequacy of our auxiliary model given the sample size and
demographic structure of the available data and to check for bias.           For a hypothesized vector of
parameter values, we simulate data and then verify that the parameter values that maximize the
likelihood function of the auxiliary model are close to the hypothesized values. Using a number of
model speci…cations, including ones that di¤er somewhat from the ones presented in the paper, we
informally experimented with varying parameter values to get a sense of how robust identi…cation
is to the particular values. We also used these experiments to investigate whether the objective
function has ‡at regions near the solution, or multiple global optima.
   In general we have found that identi…cation of most of the parameters is quite robust. However,
our Monte Carlo studies also indicate that a few of the parameters are poorly determined given
the sample size. We also found local optima involving alternative combinations of subsets of the
parameters. Bringing in additional information through the moment conditions described above
solved the most serious problems. However, some of the parameters remain sensitive to changes in
the auxiliary model, and starting values must be chosen carefully. This is particularly true of the
coe¢ cients of the experience pro…les in the EE, U E and to a lesser extent, the JC equations, for
reasons that we not fully understand. In table 2 below there is also evidence of bias for some of
the parameters in these equations. Overall, however, the relatively small values of the bootstrap
standard errors in the tables below indicates that for the sample size and demographic structure
of the PSID sample, our auxiliary model is quite informative about most of the model parameters.
Furthermore, in almost all cases the means of the bootstrap replications are close to the point
estimates, indicating that the degree of bias in the procedure is small for most of our parameters.
using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We estimate the model using 21 CPUs supplied by 11 Intel Xeon 5150
dual core processors, which reduces estimation time by a factor of 20, to between 2 to 7 hours.

5           Empirical Results
First, we discuss the parameter estimates for Model A, with heavy emphasis on Model A.3. Model
A.3 is basically the model presented above with the duration dependence term in the UE equation
restricted to 0 and       JC   set to 0: We also present simpler versions of Model A. Model A.2 is identical
to Model A.3 except that we exclude tenure terms from the wage equation. Columns 1a-1c refer
                                                         0                                 0
to Model A.1, which in addition excludes wageit from EE and                ij(t 1)   and   ij 0 (t)   from JC, and
allows       JC   to be nonzero. We also brie‡y discuss results for Model B, with emphasis on the wage
equation. Second, we evaluate the …t of the model by comparing means and standard deviations
of the PSID data to the corresponding values based on simulated data from the model and by
comparing simple regression relationships in actual and simulated data. Third, we present impulse
response functions. Finally, we decompose the variance of wages, hours, and earnings into the
contributions of the main types of shocks in our model.             In the case of Model A.3, inference is
based on 300 bootstrap replications. Because the bootstrap procedure is very computer intensive,
we only use 100 replications for the other models.

5.1         Parameter Estimates for Model A
 Columns 3a, 3b, and 3c of Table 2 report parameter estimates, the means of the parametric
bootstrap estimates, and standard error estimates for Model A.3. Columns 2a-2c refer to Model A.2
and Columns 1a-1c refer to Model A.1. The row headings indicate the variable or error component
that the parameter estimates correspond to and also list the parameter names. The estimates are
grouped by equation, beginning with EE.

5.1.1        Employment Transitions and Job Changes

The EE coe¢ cients on t and t2 imply that the latent variable determining Eit conditional on
Ei;t    1   = 1 declines slowly with t until t is about 12 and then rises slowly. However, the di¤erence
between t = 30 and t = 0 in the latent variable is only .21, and the e¤ect on the odds of a transition
is small because the EE probability is very high. Since the value of min(EDt 1 ; 9) is rising rapidly
over the …rst few years in the labor market, the overall relationship between EE and t is weak. The
point estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, because the relative values of the constant, the
coe¢ cients on t and t2 ; and the coe¢ cient on min(EDt 1 ; 9) are sensitive to the exact speci…cation.
Furthermore, the bootstrap replications provide evidence of bias.
       The coe¢ cient on min(EDt 1 ; 9) is .044 (.018), indicating modest positive duration dependence
in the odds of remaining employed. Below we show that a regression of Eit on EDi;t                     1   conditional
on Ei;t      1   = 1 gives similar results in data simulated from Model A.3 and in PSID data, which



                                                        24
indicates that the combined e¤ect of duration dependence and unobserved heterogeneity in the
model does a good job of matching the weak positive state dependence found in the data.
                                                0
          The coe¢ cient on wageit is -.058 (.076). At …rst glance the negative sign would seem to be
opposite the expected sign because there is only a substitution e¤ect at 0 work hours. However,
it is probably better to think of employment at the survey date as a movement along the extensive
margin when one views labor supply from the perspective of a year. In any event, the coe¢ cient is
not statistically signi…cant and the implied e¤ect on the EE probability is small.
          The U E equation is the least satisfactory equation in the model. The estimated t pro…le implies
that the exit probability declines with experience and then increases, but the standard errors are
very large. As we document below, the model does a poor job of tracking the relationship between
U E and t in the data.                        We experimented with models that included U Di;t                            1   but had di¢ culty
estimating the duration coe¢ cient, perhaps because the overall number of unemployment spells is
small and relatively few individuals were unemployed for two or more surveys in a row.                                                   (Most
work on duration dependence in unemployment spells uses weekly, monthly or quarterly data).
Simulations reported below show that the equation without state dependence is consistent with the
negative link between U E and U Di;t                           1    found in the PSID, presumably because of the important
role played by permanent heterogeneity. However it understates that relationship to some extent.
          The latent variable for JC declines slightly with t over the …rst 20 years, but is strongly de-
creasing in job tenure. The coe¢ cient on T ENi;t                                      1   is      :0673 (:0156), indicating that 10 years of
seniority shift the index determining JC by .673 standard deviations of the job change shock "JC
                                                                                              it .

It is noteworthy that we obtain a large negative e¤ect of tenure on JC even after accounting for
unobserved person speci…c heterogeneity ( and ) and for job match heterogeneity.
                                                                           0
           The job match components                       ij(t 1)   and    ij 0 (t)    play an important role in job mobility without
unemployment, and they have signs and relative magnitudes that are consistent with the theoretical
discussion above. The coe¢ cient on                             ij(t 1)   is -.923 (.127). To get a sense of the magnitude, note
that the standard deviation of                       ij(t 1)   is .273 for a person with 10 years of experience. Consequently,
a one standard deviation increase in                           ij(t 1)    lowers the JC index by -.252. Since the coe¢ cient on
T EN is -.067, this is roughly equivalent to the e¤ect of 3.8 years of seniority. An increase from
0 to .273 in the value of                      ij(t 1)   lowers the probability of a job change for a white individual with
12 years of education, 2 years of seniority, 10 years of experience,                                            = 0 and       = 0 from .130 to
.084, keeping           0
                        ij 0 (t)   constant. The current value                        0
                                                                                      ij 0 (t)   has a coe¢ cient of .594.29 A one standard
                                   0
deviation shock to                 ij 0 (t)   raises the job change probability by 0.066.
          Thus far, we have not discussed the role of race and education or the unobserved individual
     29
          The total e¤ect of ij(t 1) on the JC probability is .029. It is smaller than the partial e¤ect because a unit shift
                                             0
in        ij(t 1) shifts the distribution of ij 0 (t) by .625.




                                                                              25
heterogeneity terms. BLACK has a substantial negative e¤ect on the latent variable for EE and
a substantial negative e¤ect on U E, while EDU C has a substantial positive e¤ect on both. In the
JC equation BLACK is positive, with an e¤ect that is equivalent to having about 2.5 fewer years
of tenure. EDU C does not alter JC. The coe¢ cient on the “innate ability”factor                                    is .443 (.094)
in the EE equation and .637 (.128) in the U E equation. Since the standard deviations of , ,
"EE        UE
 it , and "it are all 1, the factor loadings imply that                      accounts for 15.6% of the error variance in
the EE equation and 27.9% in the U E equation. The productivity factor                                   has a coe¢ cient of -.280
(.136) in the JC equation. All three results are sensible in light of the fact that                                has a positive
sign in both the wage and hours equations. In thinking about the magnitudes, keep in mind that
the factor loadings represent the partial e¤ect of the heterogeneity components in a given period
holding spell duration constant.
      The mobility/hours preference component                      is normalized to have a positive sign in the JC
equation. It enters the EE, U E and JC indices with coe¢ cients of -.237 (.107), .222 (.187), and
.531 (.100), respectively, and accounts for 4.5%, 3.4%, and 19.7% of the error variances of these
equations. The magnitude implies only a small e¤ect on the EE transition probability and the sign
in the EE equation is positive in the other models. The results suggest that raises the probabilities
of transiting out of unemployment and of moving from job to job without unemployment. It has
a coe¢ cient that is essentially zero in the hours equation in the case of Model A.3 but is larger in
the other speci…cations. Across Models A.1, A.2, A.3 and B.1, the relative importance of                                   and
varies somewhat.

5.1.2      The Wage Model

We begin with the parameters of the autoregressive component,
                                                   !                       !
                        ! it =   ! ! i;t   1
                                               +   1 Eit (1     Eit ) +    1 Ei;t   1
                                                                                        (1   Ei;t 1 ) + "!it :

The estimated standard deviation of the initial condition ! i1 varies with race and education but
is between .248 and .306 in Model A.3.                    The autoregressive coe¢ cient ^! is .92, which implies
considerable persistence but is well below unity.                         The shocks "!it have a standard deviation of
.095 (.003). This value strikes us as large given that we separately account for the e¤ects of job
speci…c error components. The only other study we know that allows for a persistent general wage
component, a job speci…c error term, and endogenous mobility is Low et al (2008). They obtain a

time, even when the value of lost tenure is held constant. As will become clear from the impulse
response functions, unemployment also leads to a loss of tenure as well as to a reduction on average
in the value of the job match component, which implies further reductions in wages.31
                        w
       The coe¢ cient       on   is only .049 (.028), so the direct contribution of unobserved permanent
heterogeneity to the variance of wages is small once we account separately for job match hetero-
geneity. Note, however, that          also has an additional e¤ect on wages through its connection to
employment transitions and job changes. One should also keep in mind that                      is net of the e¤ect
of Xit , which contains the important permanent variables EDU C and BLACK; and that the stan-
dard deviation of the initial condition ! i1 is large. Almost 30 percent of the e¤ect of ! i1 is still
present at t = 15: Note that the component             is much more important in Model A.1 and in Model
B.1, perhaps because there is no selective quit behavior in A.1 and B.1 does not incorporate a job
speci…c wage component at all. It is also about twice as important in the SRC sample.
       The parameters of the job match component              ij(t)   are quite interesting. The initial condition
 ij(1)   has a standard deviation of .197 (.021) in A.3. The autoregression parameter                is .625 (.022)
and the value of ^ is large: .269 (.007). As we have already noted, the substantial persistence of
 ij(t)   across jobs suggests that wage o¤ers are based in part on salary history, that demand shocks
may re‡ect narrow occupation, industry and region and thus may not be entirely job speci…c, and/or
that the search network available to workers depends on job quality. As we shall see below, the
contribution of the job speci…c component to the variance of wages and earnings is substantial.
       As we discuss in Appendix 2, one can use Model A.3 to decompose E(wageit jt); the experience
pro…le of wages, into the contributions of general human capital P (t), job mobility E(                ij(t) )jt),   and
                                 w
accumulated job seniority        T EN E(P (Tit )jt).   Figure 1 graphs the components and thus addresses
the fundamental question of what accounts for wage growth over a career.                      Most of the return
to potential experience is due to general skill accumulation. Job shopping and the accumulation
of tenure account for 14.1 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, of the overall growth of wages
over the …rst ten years. They account for 13.7 percent and 15.0 percent of growth over the …rst 30
years.32 Using social security records for quarterly earnings (rather than hourly wage rates) Topel
and Ward (1992) …nd larger gains from job mobility early in careers than we …nd. We suspect their

      Using the PSID Buchinsky et al (2008) estimate a simultaneous model of employment, job mobility, and wage
rates that incorporates tenure e¤ects, general experience, and job speci…c error components. They …nd a large
e¤ect of human capital accumulation and returns to seniority that are more than double the values from Altonji and
Williams (2005) that we impose but do not present estimates of the gains from job mobility. Bagger et al (2007) do
not allow for a direct e¤ect of seniority on wages such as would arise from shared investment in …rm speci…c capital
but obtain an indirect e¤ect that arises through the response of …rms to outside o¤ers. They attribute average growth
of wages within the …rm and growth of wages across …rms to job search. Using Danish matched employer/employee
data they …nd that human capital accounts for about half of all wage growth for workers with more than 12 years
of education that occurs after the …rst …ve years in the labor market. Human capital accumulation is neglibible for
less educated groups.

estimates are overstated by the school to work transition and growth across jobs in hours worked,
while ours are understated because we miss some job changes and we do not use the …rst three
years of wages.33

5.1.3      Hours and Earnings

In the hoursit equation ^ hE , the e¤ect of Eit ; is .413 (.008). This indicates that unemployment at
the survey date is associated with relatively long completed spells of nonemployment. Short spells
will tend to be missed given our point in time measure at annual frequencies. They will show up
in the hours component "hit . The wage elasticity is small and negative, which is consistent with a
large literature on the behavior of male household heads. The coe¢ cients on                            and   are .125 and
.0145 respectively, suggesting only a modest role for individual heterogeneity (net of EDU C and
BLACK) in annual hours in a given year. However, permanent heterogeneity turns out to be quite
important over the lifetime. The importance of                 relative to       varies across the speci…cations. The
standard deviation of "hit is .169, indicating substantial year to year variation in hours even when
the job speci…c component         does not change. The standard deviation of                        is large— .157 (.014).
                                                                     e           e
       Turning to earnings, recall that the coe¢ cients              w    and    h    are constrained to equal 1. The
earnings component eit has an autoregression coe¢ cient of .553 (.007) and the standard deviation
of the shock "eit is .211 (.002).

5.2       Estimates of Model B
Columns 4a-4c of Table 2 report estimates for Model B.1. As we noted earlier, Model B does not
contain job speci…c wage or hours components. However, it allows the autoregression coe¢ cient and
the standard deviation of wage shocks to shift when individuals change jobs or leave unemployment.
The speci…cation is closest to that of Model A.1. We had relatively little di¢ culty estimating this
model and estimate the autoregressive parameter                 !   by indirect inference rather than by using the
moment conditions (17), which do not apply to Model B.1 without modi…cation.
       The results for Model B.1, in keeping with those for Model A, provide clear evidence that job
changes, whether with or without unemployment, involve substantial wage risk. The coe¢ cient on
lagged wages is .958 for job stayers but only .723 if the job changes.                            At the same time, wage
innovations have a standard deviation of .0934 (.002) for stayers but are about 3 times larger for
                                                                                           w
persons who have changed jobs ((1+2.10)*0.0934). The estimate of                               is .151 (.012), so permanent
heterogeneity plays a more important role in Model B.1 than in A.3.34
  33
    Model A.1 does not allow for selective quit behavior but includes the term 0 JCit . The coe¢ cient ^ 0 is :042,
which indicates that on average JC increases ij by .042. Models A.1 and A.2 exclude tenure e¤ects on wages.

5.3     Evaluating the …t of the Model:
We simulate careers for 138,960 individuals using the parameter estimates for Model A.1, A.2, A.3
and Model B.1— 30 for each individual in the PSID sample. From each simulated career we select
data so that the temporal pattern, education level, and race matches that of a corresponding PSID
case. Note that in all cases the simulated variables incorporate measurement error. We examine
the …t of the model in two ways.            First, we compare the means and standard deviations of the
key variables implied by the model with corresponding values from the PSID. We then turn to a
comparison of the regression relationships among key variables that are implied by the model with
those of the corresponding PSID estimates.

5.3.1     Predicted and Actual Mean and Standard Deviations of Key Variables, by
         Potential Experience

Figure 2 compares the actual standard deviations of wageit , earnit and hoursit in the PSID to the
95 percent con…dence interval estimates of the standard deviations based on data simulated from
Model A.3. The standard error bands in the …gure re‡ect both sampling error in ^ and sampling
error due to randomness in the careers of the individuals in a particular sample.35 The bands are
tight, which means that we sometimes conclude that the PSID values are statistically di¤erent from
the model predictions even when the values are close in economic terms.
    Across experience levels, the model overpredicts SD(wageit ) by about 6% (not shown) and
implies less of an increase with experience than we …nd in the actual data.                        We suspect that
most of the discrepancy is due to the fact that we have removed the e¤ects of education and
race from the PSID wage measure, but include them in the equations for EE, U E; and JC in
the model.      Consequently, the e¤ects of race and education on wages, hours, and earnings that
to models that are very similar to A.1 and to model B, where Hit is an indicator for poor health, and is 1 for those
who answer yes to the question, “Do you have any physical or nervous condition that limits the type of work or the
amount of work you can do?”, & i captures …xed heterogeneity in health, and "H   it is an iid health shock. We added
the indicator Hit to the EE, U E, wage, and hours equations. We also added an equation for Hit to the auxiliary
model and added two lags of Hit to all equations of the auxiliary model. The heterogeneity term & accounts for
67% of the variance of the composite error term for the health latent variable. We also …nd strong state dependence
in health and (not surprisingly) that health status worsens with age. The e¤ects of health are small for EE, U E,
and for wages. Work hours are about 6% lower for people in poor health, everything else equal. The relatively small
e¤ects of health, at least as we have measured it, on employment, wages, and hours imply that health shocks account
for little of the variance in career earnings. We focus on models without the health equation for this reason. See
Vidangos (2008) for models with health and permanent disability.
  35
     We obtain the distribution of SD(wageit ) implied by the model as follows. First,we obtain the point estimate
d
SD(wageit ) by using the point estimates of for Model A.3 to simulate 30 careers for each member of the PSID.
(That is, we preserve the race, education and experience mix of the available data.) To obtain the standard deviation
   d
of SD(wage    it ) given the PSID sample size and demographic properties, we repeat the simulation for each of the 300
parametric boostrap estimates of using only 1 career for each member of the PSID and then compute the standard
                                                                                            d
deviation of the 300 values of SD(wageit ): The bands we report are the point estimate SD(wage        it ) plus or minus
1.984 SD(SD(wageit )). Other variables are handled in similar fashion. For each value of t in the table the results
are the average over t 1, t; and t + 1 with the exception of t = 40; which is the average for t = 39 and t = 40.



                                                          29
operate indirectly through EE, U E, and JC rather than directly through wages and hours in‡uence
the model predictions for SD(wageit ) but not the PSID value.36                     The values for Model A.2 (not
reported) are reasonably similar to A.3, while the values for Model B.1 in Appendix Figure A1
shows a ‡atter pro…le for SD(wageit ).
       The sample value for SD(hourst ) is .285, which lies a bit below the model value .293. The
model implies that SD(hourst ) varies little with t and misses the increase when t is 40, which might
re‡ect the e¤ects of partial retirement not captured by the experience pro…les in the model. The
results for Model A2 and B.1 are similar. The actual and simulated SD for earnings are 0.567 and
0.585, respectively. However, there is an erratic pattern in the data that is not matched by the
model predictions, which display a smooth hump-shape pattern with a peak around t = 20. The
error at t = 40 for earnings mirrors the error for hours and probably re‡ects partial retirement.
       The left panels of Figure 3 compare the PSID values and the model predictions for the mean
of Et and for the mean of JCt conditional on Et = 1 and Et                   1   = 1. The PSID values lie close to
the model estimates. The overall mean for Et is .967 in the data and .960 based on the model.
Overall, the model overstates JCt by about .014 but tracks the experience pro…le fairly closely.
       The upper right panel of Figure 3 reports the sample means and simulated means of EE tran-
sitions, which match reasonably well. However, the lower right panel shows that A.3 does poorly
in explaining the experience pro…le of exits from unemployment (U E). The actual and simulated
means of U E are .74 and .69, a substantial discrepancy. Furthermore, the model does not track
the experience pro…le well.37          Model B.1 does somewhat better than model A.3 despite the fact
that the EE and U E equations of A.3 and B.1 are the same (Appendix Figure A2).
       Figure 4 examines the behavior of the mean of T EN , ED, and U D. The …ts for T EN and U D
are reasonably close, although the two models overpredict U D by an average of about 0.4 years.
  36
      We could not think of an easy way to check this, but in earlier work excluding education and race from these equa-
tions, the model closely matched the standard deviations for SD(wageit ). There were still some minor discrepancies
in the experience pro…les.
   37
      As was mentioned earlier, we experienced di¢ culty in estimating the e¤ect of t in the U E equation, by I-I, whether
or not we allow for state dependence. We also had di¢ culty with the EE equation. We are puzzled as to why. It
may be that longer lags than we use would be helpful in pinning down the parameters. For the U E speci…cation
reported in the paper we also estimated the U E equation by maximum likelihood, treating ( U E )2 + ( U E )2 as a
single parameter. Even though U E does not depend on duration, this is only an approximation. The problem
stems from the fact that and appear in both the EE and U E equations. Consequently, the distributions of
   and    conditional on Et 1 = 0 depend on t 1, BLACK; and EDU C; and the stochastic components that
in‡uence the wage. They will not have a normal distribution. In any event, the MLE estimates (standard errors)

   (N=1065, number of individuals contributing spells=748.) The I-I estimates of the co¢ cients on BLACK and
EDUC are somewhat larger. The experience pro…les are also quite di¤erent. The I-I estimate of [( U E )2 +      d( EE )2 ]:5
is .675, which is close to the MLE estimate.    We cannot take the same approach with the EE equation due to state
dependence in that equation.

The models overpredict ED by a substantial amount. This is probably attributable to our use of
T EN as the initial value for ED when an individual …rst enters the sample (see the Data Section).
The results for the models A.2 and B.1 are similar.

5.3.2         Comparison of Regression Relationships Among Key Variables

Tables 3a-3d report a series of regressions. The “a”columns are based on the PSID sample, and the
“b”and “c”columns are based on data simulated using the estimates of Model A.3 and Model B.1.
We also report robust panel standard errors for the PSID estimates.38 Columns 1a and 1b of Table
3a report regressions of Et on (ti       1)=10; (ti     1)2 =100, and EDt    1   conditional on Et   1   = 1. This is
a stripped down version of the EE equation in the structural model. There are some di¤erences in
the experience pro…les. The coe¢ cient on EDt              1   is .0025 in the PSID and .0031 in the simulation,
a close correspondence.
       Columns 2a and 2b report results for a version of the U E equation.                The di¤erences in the
coe¢ cients on the experience pro…le are substantial, a fact that is re‡ected in the failure of the model
to …t the experience pro…le. The model understates the degree of persistence in unemployment spells
to some extent.        The equations for JC in columns 3a and 3b match fairly closely, although the
weights on the experience terms are somewhat di¤erent.
       Table 3b examines the dynamics of wages. When only one lag is included, the coe¢ cient on
waget     1   is .885 in the PSID and .905 in the simulation. When two lags are included, the sums of
the coe¢ cients are very close but there is a substantial di¤erence in the coe¢ cient pattern. The
coe¢ cient on JCt is small and negative in the PSID and in the simulated data for A.3. It is small
and positive for B.1.
       Table 3c examines hours.        The results based on the simulated data and actual data match
reasonably closely, although the sum of the coe¢ cients on the lags of hours is about .6 in the
simulated data and about .55 in the actual data (columns 1a and 1b).                     The wage coe¢ cient is
essentially 0 in the actual data and -.0191 in the simulated data— a close correspondence.
       Finally, in Table 3d we report earnings regressions. Note that all of the dynamics in earnings
stem from dynamics in the wage, hours, and the autoregressive earnings component eit : The sum
of the coe¢ cients on earni;t     1   and earni;t   2   is .873 in the PSID data and .800 in simulated data,
so that the model understates the persistence of earnings by a small amount. There is also some
  38
     For the simulated data the point estimates are based upon a sample 30 times as large as the PSID with the
same demographic structure. The coe¢ cient standard errors reported for the simulated data are based on this large
sample and are intended to provide a sense of numerical accuracy rather than sampling error. We could provide the
latter by estimating the regressions on each of a series of simulated samples that match PSID demographic structure
with only one career per person. One sample in the series would be created using one of the 300 values of the model
parameters obtained through our parametric bootstrap procedure. The PSID standard errors should provide a rough
guide to whether the coe¢ cients based on the simulated data are di¤erent from the PSID regression coe¢ cients.

di¤erence between the data and the model in the coe¢ cients on waget and hourst (Column 2a and
2b).
       Overall, the match between the model and the data is good, although there is room for improve-
ment, particularly in the case of U E:

5.4       Mean and Variance Impulse Response Functions
Figures 5a-c report impulse responses to shocks that occur when t = 10. The point estimates are
constructed as follows. First, using the parameter estimates for Model A.3, we simulate a large
number of cases through t = 9. Then we impose the shock indicated in the …gures in period 10.
After that, we continue the simulation in accordance with the model parameters. The …gures show
the mean paths of wages, hours and earnings relative to the base case. The base case represents
the mean of the simulated paths in the absence of the speci…ed intervention in period 10.39
       Since wages and hours are re‡ected in earnings with coe¢ cients of 1, we focus on earnings to
save space.     The diamond line in Figure 5a reports the response of the mean of earnit to a one
standard deviation shock to "!it , the error term in the autoregressive component of wages. Earnings
                                                                                               !
rise by about .088, and the e¤ect slowly decays, governed by the value .92 for                 w.   The pattern
for earnings closely mirrors the response to wages because the coe¢ cient on the wage is 1 and the
response of hours to the wage is small.
       The line with circles shows the e¤ect of becoming unemployed when t = 10: The pattern is very
interesting. The log of earnings drops by about -.62, recovers by more than two thirds after one
year, and then slowly returns to the base case. The initial drop is the combination of a drop of
about -.38 in log hours and a drop of about -.25 in the wage.                  Hours recover almost completely
after one period. The wage increases by about .08 in the …rst year and recovers slowly after that.
       The drop in wages is due to three main factors. First, the distributed lag coe¢ cients on un-
employment in the wage equation and ^! indicate that unemployment reduces ! it by -.190 (0.010)
followed by an increase a year later of .104 (0.013) plus .190*(1-.92) if the person leaves unemploy-
ment.      After that, the response of ! it to unemployment is governed by ^! .              Second, the loss of
tenure lowers the wage by an average of .064 relative to the baseline average for persons at t = 10:
Third, since there is no selectivity in the job change induced by the unemployment spell, on average
workers su¤er a decline in     ij(t)   equal to (1   )E(      ij(t) jt   = 10); or .027. On average, endogenous
mobility following the unemployment spell leads            ij(t)   to back up toward the base case mean for a
given value of t:
       The pattern of a long-lasting impact of unemployment on earnings is broadly consistent with a
  39
    1.984 standard error bands were obtained by computing impulse responses using each of the 300 values of the
model parameters obtained by parametric bootstrap (100 values in the case of B.1). The bands are quite narrow,
and we omit them to avoid cluttering the …gures. They are available upon request.

number of previous studies, including Jacobson, Lalonde, and Sullivan (1993), who use establish-
ment earnings records. Using the PSID and a …xed e¤ects strategy, Stevens (1997) …nds a 30%
drop in earnings and a 14% drop in wages in the year of a layo¤. Earnings recover substantially
in the …rst year, but wages recover very slowly. Her estimate of the initial earnings loss is smaller
than ours, perhaps because those who are laid o¤ do not necessarily become unemployed, and those
who are unemployed at the survey date tend to be in a long spell. Our model and the PSID data
permit us to examine e¤ects that operate through wages and hours separately, as well as to identify
the speci…c channels of in‡uence.40
     Finally, the …gures report the response of wages, hours, and earnings to an exogenous job

that negatively a¤ects the relative attractiveness of the current job rather than from a large draw
     0
of   ij 0 (t) .   The line marked with "x" shows the average response. The negative e¤ect on earnings
re‡ects the value of lost tenure (.063). Since the job change is not selective on                     ij ,   ij(t)   declines
by (1             )E(   ij(t) jt   = 10) or .027. The line with triangles is the e¤ect of an exogenous job change
that is accompanied by a value of "ij(t) that is one standard deviation above its mean, or .269. The
net positive e¤ect is large and highly persistent. These results are mirrored in wages (Figure 5b).
In addition, we show the e¤ect of an exogenous job change that is accompanied by a 1 standard
deviation increase of .157 in the job speci…c hours component                      ij(t) .   This is associated with a
positive increase in hours worked and in earnings that decays in half in the …rst few years but
slowly thereafter. Since                ij(t)   is independent across jobs, the persistence stems from the fact that
when t is greater than 10, job changes with or without unemployment are infrequent.41
     We also use the model to estimate the e¤ects of an exogenous job loss and an exogenous job
change on earnings risk using the methodology described above. The circle line in Figure 6a graphs
the ratio of var(earnit                 earni;t 1 ) following an exogenous unemployment shock when t = 10 to
the baseline variance for the model. The variance ratio is slightly below 1 when t = 10, it is 1.46
when t = 11; declines to 1.17 when t = 12; and then slowly declines to 1 over the next ten years.
The corresponding ratio for var(earnit ) is about .83 when t = 10; presumably because di¤erences
   40
      Kletzer (1998) surveys the literature on job loss and wages. A number of studies examine how employer and
industry tenure a¤ects the size of the loss. When the problem of unobserved worker heterogeneity (but not job
heterogeneity) is addressed there appear to be modest tenure e¤ects of the loss that are consistent with Altonji and
William’s (2005) estimates used here. Neal (1995), Carrington (1993) and Parent (2000) argue that industry tenure
is more important than …rm tenure. Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) argue that occupational tenure is more
important than …rm or industry tenure. As we noted earlier, one could extend the model we consider to include
industry and occupation transition equations, but leave this to future research.
   41
      We also computed, but do not report, the e¤ects of shocks that occur when t = 3. The immediate e¤ect of
unemployment on earnings and wages is somewhat smaller than when t = 10 because the decline in tenure and in
   is smaller. The e¤ects are also less persistent. Job changes accompanied by shocks to and to also have less
persistent e¤ects.



                                                                 33
in wages matter less when everyone is unemployed, 1.08 when t = 11, and then slowly declines
to about 1.03. The exogenous job change induces a big spike in the ratio var(earnit         earni;t 1 )
when t = 10. The corresponding ratio for var(earnit ) rises slowly following the shock, presumably
because in some cases the exogenous job change induces additional ones.            We have produced
corresponding …gures for shocks at t = 3 (not shown). The impact on the variance is somewhat
smaller and less persistent.

5.5    Variance Decompositions
We have used our model to measure the relative importance of the initial condition and shocks to
the autoregressive wage component, the iid hours shocks, the iid earnings shocks, job changes and
employment spells and the associated shocks, the permanent heterogeneity components            and ,
and the e¤ects of education and race. However, because the sample overrepresents blacks, we report
variance decompositions using the white sample. To do this, we …rst compute the variance in the
sum of the annual values of earnit , wageit , and hoursit over a 40 year career. We then repeat the
simulation after setting the variance of the particular random component in the model to 0. We
use the drop in the variance relative to the base case as the estimated contribution of the particular
type of shock. Since the model is nonlinear, the contributions do not sum to 100% and may be
negative. We have normalized them to sum to 100. We report results for the levels of variables,
accounting for the experience pro…le in all variables. The decompositions of the sums of the annual
values of logs of earnings, hours, and wages are similar (not reported). We use the parametric
bootstrap distribution of the ^ to estimate the standard deviation of variance contributions, which
are reported in parentheses. We continue to focus on Model A.3, but also brie‡y discuss results
for Model A.2 and B.1.
   The results for Model A.3 are in Table 4a. The …rst row refers to the sum of lifetime earnings.
The earnings shocks "eit account for 6.6% of the variance in lifetime earnings even though they
account for about 17% of var(earnit ) in a given year (Table 4b).        The reason for the relatively
small contribution is that the shocks are not very persistent.       Similarly, the value in column II
indicates that iid hours shocks   "hit   contribute only 2.4% of the variance in lifetime earnings but
account for between 7.7% and 9.3% in annual earnings (Table 4b).            One can easily self-insure
against these shock categories.     In contrast, in column III, the initial condition "!i1 and the iid
shocks to ! it are together responsible for 12.4% of the variance in lifetime earnings. The earnings
results re‡ect the fact that these shocks account for 20.6% of the variance in lifetime wages. They
contribute little to the variance in hours because the response of hours to wages is small.
   The most striking result is in Column IV, which shows the collective impact of job speci…c hours
and wage components, unemployment spells, and job changes.            Altogether, mobility and unem-


                                                    34
ployment related shocks account for 36.7%, 48.2%, and 46.8% of the variance in lifetime earnings,
wages, and hours, respectively.         Given the interactions among the job change and employment
related factors, we break down their relative contributions by …rst turning o¤ the job speci…c hours
shocks, then turning o¤ both hours and job speci…c wage shocks, then turning o¤ hours, wage, and
unemployment shocks, and …nally turning o¤ hours, wage, and unemployment and the idiosyncratic
job change shocks ("JC
                    it ). The estimates are reported in columns VIII, IX, X, and XI. For earnings,

job speci…c wage shocks are more important than hours shocks. Job speci…c wage shocks dominate
for wages, while job speci…c hours shocks dominate for hours.42
       Finally, we turn to the three permanent heterogeneity components for whites: , , and EDU C.
Surprisingly, the estimates in column V indicate that the mobility preference component                    does not
play much of a role.       The point estimate is actually negative.            However,       accounts for 11.4%
of the variance in lifetime earnings and 46.2% of the variance in work hours but explains none of
the variance in wages.43       The positive direct e¤ect that           has on the wage variance is o¤set by
its role in reducing transitions into unemployment and job changes. Education is very important,
contributing 31.4% of the variance in lifetime earnings and 34.6% of the variance in lifetime wages
but only 4.9% of the variance in lifetime hours.
       The results for Model A2 (not reported) are basically similar to those for Model A3, except
that      plays a somewhat larger role in the variance of earnings and wages. The results for Model
B.1 are in Tables 5a and 5b. Model B.1 does not include job speci…c wage or hours components.
Without these features, the interpretation of the results in terms of underlying economic factors
is less transparent than those for A3. However, job changes with and without unemployment are
associated with reduced persistence and large innovations in ! it . This is re‡ected in the fact that
the initial condition for ! it and the "!it shocks account for 24.6% of the variance in lifetime earnings
and 45.59% of the variance in lifetime wages, respectively.                The two unobserved heterogeneity
components        and     together account for about 30% of the earnings variance, 12% of the wage
variance, and 85% of the hours variance.            Education is also very important for both wages and
earnings. Education, , and            are much less important for variance in a given year. Note that
one can use the model to examine the contributions of the shocks between, for instance, t and
t + 5 to the variance in earnings over the same period or subsequent periods, but we exclude such
computations.
  42
     A few of the estimated variances contributions are negative. We have veri…ed that this re‡ects nonlinearity in
the model. Variance in one shock can reduce the in‡uence of other shocks.
  43
     Note that because the lifetime variance of log hours is lower than the lifetime variance of log wages, the 46.2%
impact of on work hours translates into only an 11.4% impact on the variance in lifetime earnings.

6      Results for Other Samples
In this section we brie‡y summarize results using the full SRC sample, the SRC sample of whites
with some college or more, and the SRC sample of whites with a high school degree or less and no
post secondary vocational education. We estimate wage, hours, and earnings residuals separately
for each sample, removing the race dummies from the models for whites. We use the tenure pro…le
from Altonji and Williams (2005) for all subsamples. In the case of Model A.3 we continue to use
 !   = :92 for the full SRC sample and the SRC sample of whites. For the SRC samples of whites
by educational attainment we use   !   = :90 because the evidence based on (17) pointed to a slightly
lower value. Columns 1b and 2b of Table 6 report estimates of Model A.3 and Model B.1 for the
full SRC sample. Because of the computational burden, we have only computed standard errors
for the full SRC sample. For ease of comparison, we report estimates for the combined SRC-SEO
sample in Columns 1a and 2a, which are the same as Columns 3a and 3c of Table 2 .
     Overall, the point estimates for the SRC sample are very similar to those for the SRC-SEO
sample. The coe¢ cient on BLACK is smaller in the SRC sample, which may re‡ect the fact that
the SEO sample was drawn from households in low income areas. Individual heterogeneity plays a
somewhat more important role in the wage equation.
     Figure 7a reports the average response of earnings to shocks at t=10 and may be compared to
Figure 5a for the SRC-SEO sample. The results are very similar to those for the full sample. Panel
A of Table 7 reports variance decompositions of lifetime earnings, wages, and hours. The results
are also quite similar to those for the SRC-SEO sample in Table 4a.
     Columns 1d and 1e in Table 6 report model estimates for SRC subsamples of whites with a high
school degree or less and whites with some college or more. (Individuals with a high school degree
and some postsecondary vocational education are excluded from both samples.) For comparison,
we also report estimates for the full SRC sample of whites in column 1c. The point estimates are
quite similar overall. However, a few di¤erences are worth noting. First, mobility is less sensitive
to seniority for the high education sample than for the low education sample. Second, JC is more
responsive to outside o¤ers in the case of the high education sample. Third, unemployment is less
common for the high education sample.        These facts are re‡ected in the decompositions of the
experience pro…le of wages in Appendix Figures B1 and B2, which show little growth in            with t
for the less educated sample. We also …nd that         !   is considerably larger for the high education
sample— .100 versus .075. The standard deviation of the iid component of hours is much larger
for the less educated sample, which probably re‡ects greater variation in overtime hours and in
unemployment spells between surveys.
     The variance decompositions in Panel B and Panel C of Table 7 indicate that the persistent
productivity component ! it is more important for the high education sample than the low education

sample for wages and earnings. Employment shocks, iid hours shocks, within group heterogeneity
in education, and         are more important for the low education sample.                   The job speci…c hours
component        is more important for the high education sample.


7        Conclusion
In this paper, we study earnings across individuals and over careers. To this end, we construct a
model of earnings dynamics from equations governing employment transitions, job changes with-
out unemployment, wages, and work hours.                 Since both state dependence and heterogeneity are
important and one cannot determine the role of one without accounting for the other, our models
incorporate state dependence in employment, job changes, and wages, while also including mul-
tiple sources of unobserved heterogeneity as well as job-speci…c error components in both wages
and hours. These turn out to play an important role in the variance of lifetime earnings. The
equations of our model provide a rich statistical description of the earnings process but can also be
viewed as …rst approximations to the decision rules suggested by structural models of employment
transitions, job search, and labor supply. Our simulation based estimation strategy permits us to
handle a highly unbalanced sample in the context of a model that mixes discrete and continuous
variables and allows for both state dependence and multifactor heterogeneity and for measurement
error. Vidangos (2008) shows the potential for using models of the type we develop by studying
the implications of a related multi-equation model of family income for precautionary behavior and
welfare within the context of a lifecycle consumption model.44
       Our results address many important questions concerning wages, hours and earnings over a
career. In keeping with many other studies, we …nd that education, race, and unobserved perma-
nent heterogeneity all play an important role in employment transitions and job changes and that
labor supply of male household heads is inelastic. By accounting for both unobserved individual
heterogeneity and job speci…c heterogeneity, we are able to show that a substantial portion of the
strong negative relationship between job seniority and job mobility found in many previous studies
is causal.    Job changes are induced by high outside o¤ers and deterred by the job speci…c wage
component of the current job. Job o¤ers are strongly positively related to the job speci…c compo-
nent on the current job, in contrast to the usual assumption in the search literature that o¤ers are
drawn at random. We discuss a number of possible explanations in the text.
       Overall, wages are highly persistent but do not contain a random walk component. The persis-
  44
    He allows for additional sources of variation in family income such as health and disability shocks. The con-
sumption model is used to quantify the welfare e¤ects of uncertainty generated by each source of variation and to
measure the contribution of each source to the accumulation of precautionary savings. Perhaps surprisingly, he …nds
that for plausible values of the coe¢ cient of relative risk aversion, consumers would be willing to give up only a small
percentage of consumption to eliminate risks. Low et al’s (2008) estimates of the value of insurance are larger.

tence results from permanent heterogeneity, the job speci…c wage component, and strong persistence
in the stochastic component that re‡ects the value of the worker’s general skills.
   We also contribute to the displaced workers literature by providing a full decomposition of
earnings losses from unemployment. We …nd that short-term earnings losses from unemployment
are dominated by hours and the long-term costs are dominated by wages, with lost tenure, movement
to a lower paying job, and a drop in the autoregressive skill component all playing a role. We …nd
general human capital accumulation is the dominant source of wage growth over a career, although
job tenure and job mobility both play signi…cant roles.
   Finally, job mobility and unemployment play a key role in the variance of career earnings. They
operate primarily by leading to large changes in job speci…c components of wages and hours rather
than through their direct e¤ects on wages and hours. For whites in our full sample, job speci…c
hours and wage components, unemployment shocks, and job shocks together account for 36.7%,
48.2%, and 46.8% of the variance in lifetime earnings, wages, and hours, respectively. Job speci…c
wage shocks are more important than job speci…c hours shocks for earnings.           Job speci…c wage
shocks dominate for wages, with employment shocks also playing a substantial role.         For hours,
job speci…c hours shocks dominate. Education accounts for about 1/3 of the variance in lifetime
earnings and wages but makes little di¤erence for hours. In our full sample, unobserved permanent
heterogeneity accounts for about 11% of the variance in earnings and about 46% of the variance of
hours but matters little for wages, although this breakdown is somewhat sensitive to the model and
sample used.
   There are number of extensions to the model that would be worth exploring. Thus far, we simply
remove year e¤ects from wages, hours, and earnings, but it would be natural to add aggregate shocks
to the model.   It would also be natural to extend the model to explore changes in the stability
of earnings, building on work by Gottschalk and Mo¢ tt (1994, 2008), Haider (2001), Shin and
Solon (2008) and others.    This would require a very di¤erent auxiliary model.        With matched
employer-employee data such as those used by Abowd et al (1999) and Bagger et al (2007), one
could distinguish …rm speci…c risk associated with observed as well as unobserved variables from
job match speci…c risk. A much more ambitious extension would be to construct a model of the
household income of an individual that incorporates marriage, divorce, and death of a spouse. This
will be pursued in separate work.
   Given the large number of issues that the paper already addresses, we do not attempt the
formidable task of seeking to identify how much of the stochastic variation in earnings that we
analyze is anticipated by agents, how far in advance they anticipate it, or how much is insured.
Adding a family income model (with private and public transfers) as in Vidangos (2008) gets
partially at the question of insurance.   Dealing with expectations is more di¢ cult.      One needs


                                                 38
either data on expectations or an expanded model that incorporates decisions that depend on
and/or reveal the information set of the agent, such as consumption choices. Work by Blundell and
Preston (1998), Blundell, Pistaferri, and Preston (2008), Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro (2005),
Cunha and Heckman (2006), and Guvenen and Smith (2008) illustrate the latter approach.

10         Appendix 2: Decomposing Career Wage Growth into
           the E¤ects of General Human Capital, Tenure, and Job
           Shopping
The experience pro…le of wages E(wageit jt) is the sum of the e¤ect of general human capital accu-
mulation, the accumulation of job tenure and the gains from job shopping. That is,

                                                                          w
                                  E(wageit jt) = hc(t) +                  T EN E(P (T ENit )jt)               + E(vij(t) jt)

                                                                                        w
where , hc(t); is the value of general human capital,                                   T EN E(P (T EN it )jt)             is the expected value of
the terms of the tenure polynomial, and E(vij(t) jt) is the expected value of the job match component.

                                                                             46
We approximate E(wageit jt) using a cubic polynomial in t and obtain estimates from the regression
of wageit on a cubic in t, education, race, and a set of year dummies. The coe¢ cients of the
experience polynomial are reported in Table 2.          Note that in the estimation of Model A.3 but
                                                          w
not the other models, we account for the fact that        T EN E(P (T EN it )jt)         + E(vij(t) jt) is removed
from the PSID wage residuals that are used with our I-I estimator by adding a quadratic in t to
                                                                                         w
the wage equation. This polynomial is a quadratic approximation to                   [   T EN E(P (T EN it )jt)    +
E(vij(t) jt)]:Failure to include t and t2 when estimating the other model parameters is likely to bias
the parameters involving the job match coe¢ cient.
   We simulate data from the model to compute the values of E(          ij(t) jt)   and ^ w
                                                                                          T EN E(P (T EN it )jt),

where ^ w
        T EN is taken from Altonji and Williams (2005). In …gure 1 we graph


                                             w
                      E(wageit jt); hc(t);   T EN E(P (T ENit )jt)   and E(    ij(t) jt):


As one can see, most of the return to potential experience is due to general skill accumulation or
the e¤ect of age. Job shopping and the accumulation of tenure account for 14.6 percent and 13.5
percent, respectively, of the overall growth of wages over the …rst ten years. They account for 12.1
percent and 15.8 percent of growth over the …rst 35 years. In thinking about this, one should keep
in mind that job losses counter the e¤ects of selective mobility on growth in E(                ij(t) jt).   The fact
that we exclude the …rst three years of labor market experience in the I-I estimator and miss job
changes probably leads to an understatement of the return to job shopping.

The table presents estimates and standard errors for models A.1, A.2, A.3, and B.1. Estimates were obtained by Indirect Inference, unless indicated otherwise. Parametric bootstrap standard errors are in parentheses.
Bootstraps are based on 100 replications, except for model A.3 which uses 300 replications.
(*)
  The potential-experience profile estimated in the first-stage regression reflects the effects of general human capital accumulation, job tenure accumulation, and job shopping. Since the effects of job shopping are
endogenously accounted for in model A.3, by the inclusion of a job-specific wage component that affects job mobility, model A.3 includes a "correction term" in the wage model, estimated by indirect inference. The
correction term is a quadratic in potential experience. The estimated correction term is: -0.0343 - 0.0753*(ti-1)/10 + 0.0072*(ti-1)2/100, with corresponding standard errors (0.0340), (0.0344), and (0.0075).

(i)
       Estimate obtained in first-stage least-squares regression.
(ii)
       Estimate obtained using additional moment conditions. See discussion in Section 4.
(iii)
       Imposed.

The table presents least-squares regression results comparing PSID data and data simulated from estimated models
A.3 and B.1. Regressions on simulated data are based on a simulated sample which is 30 times as large as the PSID
sample, but has the same demographic structure (by potential experience) as the PSID sample. Standard errors are in
parentheses.
(1)
    Sample restricted to observations where E t-1=1.
(2)
      Sample restricted to observations where E t-1=0.
(3)

Entries in columns I to VII display the contribution of a given type of shock to the variance of lifetime earnings, wage, and hours, and
are expressed as a percentage of the lifetime variance in the basecase. In the basecase we simulate of the full estimated model. To
compute the contribution of a particular shock, we simulate the model again, setting the variance of a given shock to zero for all t. We
then compute the variance of the appropriate variables. The difference relative to the basecase is the contribution of the given shock.
Since the model is nonlinear, the contributions don't sum up to 100%. We normalize columns I to VII to sum to 100. Column IV is the
combined contribution of the job match wage and hours components, employment and unemployment shocks, and job change
shocks. In columns VIII through XI we decompose Column IV. Column VIII shows the marginal contribution of ξ, IX the marginal
contribution of υ with var(ξ) set to 0, X the marginal contribution of unemployment spells with Var(ξ) and Var(υ) set to 0, and
column XI displays the marginal contribution of job changes with Var(ξ) and Var(υ) set to 0, and no unemployment. Bootstrap
standard errors are in parentheses.

Entries in columns I to VII display the contribution of a given type of shock to the variance in earnings, wage, and hours for a cross
section of simulated individuals with potential experience t. The contribution is expressed as a percentage of the variance in the
basecase. In the basecase we simulate the full estimated model. To compute the contribution of a particular shock, we simulate the
model again, setting the variance of the given shock to zero for all t. We then compute the variance of the appropriate variables at the
specified value of t. The difference relative to the basecase is the contribution of the given shock. Since the model is nonlinear, the
contributions don't sum up to 100%. We have normalized columns I to VII to sum to 100. Column IV is the combined contribution of the
job match wage and hours components, unemployment shocks, and job change shocks. In columns VIII through XI we decompose
Column IV. Column VIII is the marginal contribution of ξ, IX is the marginal contribution of υ with var(ξ) set to 0, X is the marginal
contribution of eliminating unemployment spells with Var(ξ) and Var(υ) set to 0, and column XI is the marginal
contribution of job changes with Var(ξ) and Var(υ) set to 0, and no unemployment. Bootstrap standard errors are in parentheses.

Entries in columns I to VIII display the contribution of a given type of shock to the variance in earnings, wage, and hours for a
cross section of simulated individuals with potential experience t. The contribution is expressed as a percentage of the
variance in the basecase. In the basecase we simulate the full estimated model. To compute the contribution of a particular
shock, we simulate the model again, setting the variance of the given shock to zero for all t. We then compute the variance of
the appropriate variables at the specified value of t. The difference relative to the basecase is the contribution of the given
shock. Since the model is nonlinear, the contributions don't sum up to 100%. We have normalized columns I to VIII to sum to
100.

The table presents estimates for models A.3 and B.1 restricting the PSID to the SRC sample and subsamples. Estimates were obtained by Indirect Inference, unless indicated
otherwise. Parametric bootstrap standard errors are presented in parentheses for the SRC+SEO and the SRC samples. Bootstraps are based on 300 replications for the
SRC+SEO sample and on 100 replications for the SRC sample (we limit the latter to 100 because of the computational cost of the calculations).
(i)
     Estimate obtained in first-stage least-squares regression.
(ii)
      Estimate obtained using additional moment conditions. See discussion in Section 4.
(iii)
      Imposed.

The table presents estimates for models A.3 and B.1 restricting the PSID to the SRC sample and subsamples. Estimates were obtained by Indirect Inference, unless indicated
otherwise. Parametric bootstrap standard errors are presented in parentheses for the SRC+SEO and the SRC samples. Bootstraps are based on 300 replications for the
SRC+SEO sample and on 100 replications for the SRC sample (we limit the latter to 100 because of the computational cost of the calculations).
(*)
    The potential-experience profile estimated in the first-stage regression reflects the effects of general human capital accumulation, job tenure accumulation, and job shopping.
Since the effects of job shopping are endogenously accounted for in model A.3, by the inclusion of a job-specific wage component that affects job mobility, model A.3 includes a
quadratic in potential experience as an adjustment in the wage model, which is estimated by indirect inference.

(i)
     Estimate obtained in first-stage least-squares regression.
(ii)
      Estimate obtained using additional moment conditions. See discussion in Section 4.
(iii)

Entries in columns I to VII display the contribution of a given type of shock to the variance of lifetime earnings, wage, and hours, and
are expressed as a percentage of the lifetime variance in the basecase. In the basecase we simulate of the full estimated model. To
compute the contribution of a particular shock, we simulate the model again, setting the variance of a given shock to zero for all t. We
then compute the variance of the appropriate variables. The difference relative to the basecase is the contribution of the given shock.
Since the model is nonlinear, the contributions don't sum up to 100%. We normalize columns I to VII to sum to 100. Column IV is the
combined contribution of the job match wage and hours components, employment and unemployment shocks, and job change
shocks. In columns VIII through XI we decompose Column IV. Column VIII shows the marginal contribution of ξ, IX the marginal
contribution of υ with var(ξ) set to 0, X the marginal contribution of unemployment spells with Var(ξ) and Var(υ) set to 0, and
column XI displays the marginal contribution of job changes with Var(ξ) and Var(υ) set to 0, and no unemployment. The table
presents bootstrap standard errors for the full SRC sample (in parentheses).
