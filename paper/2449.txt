                     Trade Policy Under Endogenous Credibility




                                     ABSTRACT


    Because  trade liberalization which is anticipated to be temporary creates a
divergence between the effective domestic rate of interest and the world rate
of interest, tariff—reduction in the presence of international financial asset
trade may reduce welfare for a small country. Calvo has argued that even
though the government intends to liberalize trade permanently, if the private
sector believes with some probability that a tariff will be imposed in the
future, then free trade may not be optimal. This paper first formalizes this
argument and discusses the optimal policy for a qovernTrnt which seeks to
maximize representative household welfare. The government's lack of
credibility is represented by a set of beliefs the private sector holds about
the type of government it faces. Next, beliefs are endcenized by allc,riing the
private sector to update thesi using Bayes' rule. In one approach, the true
government's objective is maximize welfare for the economy, so that it does not
seek to imitate another type, in contrast with other recent medels of policy
credibility. With learning, the government eventually adopts free trade, even
though restricted trade is optimal initially.

1. Introduction

       Trade liberalization which is anticipated to be temporary creates a

thfference between the effective domestic rate of interest and the world rate

of interest.    In some recent papers, Calvo (1985, 19b) has demonstrated the

second—best result that temporary trade liberalization, even in the absence of

market power or distortions, may reduce welfare for a small country.     (Froot

(1986) demonstrates a similar result.) Because a tariff will be relinposed in

the future, there is an intertemporal distortion when financial assets can be

traded internationally     which may dominate the welfare-increasing effects of
temporary   tariff   reduction.

       In another paper, Calvo (1986a)   has argued that even though the
government intends to liberalize trade permanently, if the private sector
believes with some probability that a tariff will be imposed in the future,
then   free trade may not be optimal. Calvo takes the beliefs of the private

sector as given exogenously.

       In this paper we first formalize Calvo's argument and discuss the optimal

policy for a government which seeks to maximize a representative household's

welfare.    The government's lack of credibility with the private sector is

represented   by a set of beliefs which the household holds   about the type of

government it faces. The households perceive the possibility of two types of
governments, one of which is the true one. We assume that there is a single

false type, which is believed to select a tariff with a positive probability.



                                        1
Households choose their cons.mption aixi saving plans to maximize expected
utility, where the expectation is taken over the policies of the two types of
governments, given their prior beliefs about the probabilities of which type
they face.         The true government also maximizes household expected utility;
however, it knows its type, so that the expectation is                taken   using this
information. The government would ideally always choose free trade. Because
their      policyobjectives are           incredible,      tariff   imposition        (i.e.,
non-liberalization) may lead to a       higher level of household utility than free

trade.

        We next endogenize learning by allowing the private sector to update its

beliefs using      Bayes' rule. C)ur   approach is somewhat similar to that      taken by
Backus    and   Driffill (1985,1986), Barro arid Gordon (1983), and Barro (1986) in

their analyses of monetary policy.               However, in our model          the    true

government' s     objective is th maximize   welfare for the economy rather than some

arbitrary       function.   Furthermore, the true government does not increase its
payoff by imitating another type -- our equilibrium is not the Kreps-Wilson
reputational type. The true government' a payoff is greater the larger is the
probability perceived. by the private sector that they face the true type.
In   the presence of learning, Calvo's case          for    non—liberalization is much
weaker.      If a government is committed to maximizing welfare, then we show

first that with learning, the private sector must be more skeptical initially

(than without learning) for a tariff to be superior            to free   trade. We also

show that there is an upper bound        on the number     of periods in   which a tariff
will    be chosen by the welfare maximizing government.

        Section 2 presents a simple two-period model with a single consumption

good.     Calvo's    argument is developed in the absence of learning.           Learning



                                             z
about the government's type is introduced in section 3. In the single
consumable model, there are no atemporal effects of trade policy. Section 4
adds a second consumption good and a static welfare gain from free trade. The
model is    also extended beyond two   time   periods. Section 5 concludes.




2.   A Two-Period Model Without Learning


       effects of private sector incredibility about the objectives of the
      The

government are introduced in a simple two—period model of a small open
economy.     There   is a single imported   consumption good, which is    not produced
at   home, and an export good (manna) which is not used domestically and is

available in an exogenously fixed supply each period. The private sector is

represented by a single household which maximizes the expectation of a

discounted sum of utility of current consumption.               The discount rate is

constant    and   equal to the world rate of interest.

      The   government's only role is to set trade policy and reditribute any
tariff revenue in a lump-sum fashion. The government seeks to maximize the
welfare of the representative household.              However the government lacks
credibility with the private sector:              the household believes that      the
government is the true welfare-maximizing one with positive probability less
than unity. For simplicity, we assume that           the   household believes the only

alternative possibility is a government which adopts the rule:                impose a

tariff next period with probability q, or choose free trade for the next

period with probability (1—q).

      Because we will introduce learning by the household about the


                                            3
government's true type, we restrict the policies which can be chosen in any

period to a       finite set. Otherwise, if the government selects a policy which
has   zero probability of being chosen by the alternative government, then the

government's type will be fully revealed. For simplicity only two policies

are assumed to be available —-                free   trade or a fixed positive tariff rate.

Furthennore,       taxes on foreign borrowing             or   capital   controls   are unavailable
(see below).

      The    export good      is chosen as numeraire. The representative household's

utility     is   given by:

                                   U(c1,c2)     V(c1) +    /3E(V(c2)),
where c1 and c2 are consumption in periods 1 and 2, respectively.                          V(c) is

twice continously differentiable, increasing and concave and 3 is the discount

factor. V' (c) approaches infinity as consumption falls to zero and approaches

zero as consumption rises toward infinity. The expectation is taken over the

beliefs of the household about the government's type and respective behavior

in period 2.

      The   household    has    access to an        international     capital market, in which it
can   borrow or lend at given rate of interest, r. Any debt incurred in period

1 must   be repaid     in full      in period 2. We assume           that the   household's rate of
thscount     equals the world rate of interest, so that /3                      (1+r). Units for

the itnportables and exportables are chosen so that their free trade price                       is
unity   and the relative price of the import in terms of the export cum tariff

is p > 1.

      The   household solves

                             max                                +

      arethe lump—sum transfers of period 1 and period 2 tariff revenue,
respectively. If p1 is one, then      is zero. Planned consumption in period 2
is given by c2 in the event a tariff is imposed in the second period and by c2
in the event of free trade in the second period. The first period current
account deficit is given by x, and y is the amount of manna available each

period.
       The household equilibrhun conditions                     are:

the second and third equations.
       The government chooses trade policy in each period to maximize household
welfare,         which   is expected utility.             However, the government knows its true
type, so         that its   objective function is
                                       W=                  + /3V(c2).
                                                 V(c1)

In    the       second   period, the true government is indifferent between free trade
and a tariff because there is no static tariff distortion in this special


                                                          5
model.      There are only intertemporal thsthrtions in the             presence   of
international asset     trading   induced by   the government's lack of credibility.
We will assume   that   the true government always chooses free trade in period 2,
because this   choice would always be optimal in the last period        for   a small
country   if there were multiple consumption goods.       The subjective probability

that the tariff is imposed in period 2, 7r, is the product of the probability

that the false government imposes the tariff, q, and the perceived probability

that the government is the false type, (1—X).

     The true government's problem is to choose p, from the set {1,p) to

maximize the value of W, given the resultant expected utility maximizing

consumption behavior of the household. Equation (1) implies that if 71 exceeds

zero and free trade is selected in the first period, then consumption in

period 1 exceeds y and consumption in period 2 is less than y. That is, the

country borrows from abroad since the effective market rate of interest faced

by the household is less than the world rate' of interest.

     If 71 is zero, then free trade in the first period (p1 =       1) achieves the
first-best allocation of consumption over periods, and if iT is unity then the

tariff achieves the first-best. In both these cases, the intertemporal terms

of trade for the household are identical to the foreign terms, (1+r), so that

there is no intertemporal distortion and consumption is the same in each

period. When      is between zero and one, there is a welfare loss due to the

intertemporal distortion created by the government's lack of credibility under

either free trade of the tariff.

     In this model, any policy which brings the effective rate of interest for

households into equality with the world rate it' interest eliminates the

intertemporal distortion and achieves the first-best outcome. One such policy



                                           6
is an intermediate tariff which yields a domestic relative price of the

importable between one arid p. However, our motivation is the problem of trade

liberalization when the private sector is skeptical about the government's

resolve to stay with the liberal regime.            If the private sector assesses

probability ir to a return to the old status quo and probability 1—U that

whatever liberalized regime is chosen will be maintained, then our set—up is a

simple representation of the optimizing government's problem.                    The two
possibilities perceived by households are simply normalized to yield relative

prices,     1 or p.      Therefore, we exclude      the      .-il.j.Ity   that   the true
government can select a tariff rate other than one of the two rates the false

government   might   select.

      Other policies which alleviate the intertemporal distortion are capital

controls, as noted by Calvo (1985). An optimal policy is to impose a tax on

foreign borrowing (lending) along with free trade (tariff), so that

consumption    is ,just equal across periods..        In    the presence of a static

distortion under a tariff (substitution in production            or consumption), free
trade   and a tax on foreign      borrowing of the appropriate magnitude can achieve
a first-best   allocation.        For the remainder of this paper, we assume that

capital controls are infeasible, or that taxes on international                     asset
transactions can     be evaded.

      The government chooses between free trade and the tariff to maximize

household utility, cognizant of how the household subsequently consumes and

saves. The value of social welfare in the case of free trade in the absence

of learning is given by a function of the household's prior beliefs, U:

(4)                               W1(U)   V(c1) + 13V(c2)

such that


                                            7
(5)                                     V' (c1) cv' (c2), and


(6)                            c1 + (1+rY'1o2 =        y(1 + (1+r)), where

                                             n(1/p) + (1—fl).

The     function q. is the ratio of            the world market discount factor to the

domestic effective discount factor and is always less than or equal to one.
W1(ir) achieves a maximin for it equal to zero and is monotonically decreasing
in    it.    To see this, note that differentiation of equations (4), (5) and (6)

yields:

            dW1/dlr     [V' (c1)—V' (c2)]V' (c2)((1/p)—1)/[V"(c1) + V"(c2)(1+r)q)].

Equation (5) implies that V' (c1) < V' (ca), so that, with strict concavity of

V(c), dW1/dit < 0, for all it >0.

        Social welfare when the tariff is imposed is given by:

(7)                                  W(fl)     V(c1)    + /3V(c2)


such that

(8)                                    V1 (c1) =   pc'V' (c2),      and


(9)                            c1 + (1+r)c2 y(1 +

where p           p.q)    1.     W(ir) achieves a maxiniun when 71 equals one and is

monotonically increasing in it.                This is derived from differentiation of

equations (7), (8) and (9) which yield

                          [V1 (c1)—V' (c2)]V' (c2)(1—p)/EV"(c1)+V"(c2)(1+r)pcl.
               dW/d1r
Since in this case (8) implies that V' (ci) > V1 (ca), dW/dli > 0, for all ir<1.

        The values of social welfare are depicted in Figure 1 for both the free

trade and tariff cases. The value of iT, its, such that the two are equal is

greater than one-half. To see this, first note that since the rate of time


                                                   8
preference equals the interest rate, and utility is concave, the farther c or

c2 deviate from c1 =
                                 c2
                                      =   y,   the lower is social welfare. When free trade is

chosen in the first period                 by   the government, c1 > y arid there is dissaving,

while c2 < y. Let           us   call the choice of consumption in the first period              under
free    trade c' ,   arid   the choice of consumption in the second period under free
(first period) trade c.      From the first order conditions, V' (c' )
(i/2)(1+(1/p))V' (c*). When a tariff is chosen in the first period, then c1 <
y arid c2 > y. Note that if c were consumed in the first period, and c' were
consumed in the second period, that the first—order conditions would not be
satisfied.    It would be the case that V (ci) < (1/2)(1+p)V' (c' )

(1/4)(l+p)(1+(1/p))V'            (c*) because (i+p)(i+(l/p))(l/4) > 1.               Therefore, it is

the case that the first period consumption is less than c (because utility is

concave, a lower first—period consumption is needed to achieve the first—order

condition). Hence, when the tariff is imposed at fl                              1/2, the consumption
bundle   is   farther from the optimum and welfare is lower. Thus at ir                        1/2,   W1
>   W and the intersection must                 occur   to the right of one-half.
    p
        If the private secthr's beliefs in period 1 are that the joint
probability of the government being false and imposing a tariff in period 2 is

greater than 7r, then the true optimizing government will impose a tariff in

the first period. Otherwise, free trade in the first period will be optimal.

In the case that q is less than                  one-half,      free trade will be optimal in period

1   for all prior subjective probabilities that                     the   government is the true type.

                     Let utility display constant relative risk aversion with the

coefficient of relative risk aversion equal to two:

3. Two-Period, Single Consumable Model with Learning



      We now introduce learning by the private sector about the government's

type using Bayes' Rule. The household upiates its beliefs about the type of

government given the observation that if th government is the true one, it
has acted optimally in the first period. The updating rules given that free
trade or a tariff is optimal for the true government are straightforward. We
assume that the government knows the household's prior beliefs and that the
household recognizes that the true government chooses between the tariff              and

free trade optimally given the posteriors that will be formed by the

household.

        If the parameters of the economy are such that a tariff is optimal for

the first period, then the prior probability that a tariff is imposed in

period 1 is given by

                                           q(l—0) +

where      is the prior probability that the government is the true type. This

prior    comes from the facts that true government                  chooses a tariff with

probability   one (because we are          talking about the case in which a tariff is

optimal) and the false government chooses a tariff with              probability q (it has
the same probability of choosing a tariff in period 1 and period 2). Using

Bayes' rule, the posterior that the government is the true one once it is



                                                10
revealed that there is a tariff in place in period 1 is
                                                  +
                                                      X0j.
Therefore,   the posterior ir,   the subjective probability that   a tariff will be

imposed   in period   2, in this case is


                              q(1—1)       q21T1q - (i-q)710J,
where      was the prior probability of a tariff in period 2 (the subjective

probability of a tariff in period 2 before the tariff in period 1 was revealed

  q( 1—X,)). This is because the probability that the true government will

impose a tariff in the second period is zero, while the probability that the

false one will is q.

     In other words, households know what the true government would do if it

were in power.        They know the parameters of the model, so they know if a

tariff is the optimal choice by the true government if it is in power.            In

this case it is optimal to put on a tariff.            Prior to observing the tariff

that is actually chosen by the true government, households have some prior

probability that the true government is in power. After it is revealed that a

tariff is imposed in period 1, they update their priors.                 Consumption

decisions are made in period 1 after the tariff is revealed.            Because the

(true) government has full information, they meke their tariff choice in

period 1 knowing how consumers will update their priors.

     If the parameters of the economy are such that free trade is optimal in

period 1, then the prior probability that free trade will be observed is

                                  (1—q)(1—X0) + X0.

The posterior probability that the government is the true one, after having
observed free trade in period 1 is



                                           11
                                                                           + x0J.
Therefore, the posterior 1, the subjective probability of a tariff being

imposed in         period      2, in   this   case is
                                                         =
                                              q(1-X1)

        For        <       < q, both                    are       less   than   ire. Note   that       g    for a
given prior 7(o,           as   long as A0 exceeds zero.
       There       will be a prior 1(,, call it Il, that gives rise to posteriors such

that W1()                 W().          This is the point where the government is just

indifferent between putting on a tariff or not.                                            For greater prior
probabilities of a tariff it will definitely put on a tariff, and for lesser

prior probabilities it will definitely not put on a tariff. The following

proposition shows that 11> 11. That is, the prior probability that makes them

indifferent            between putting on a tariff                and not with learning is           greater than
the    prior probability that made them indifferent without learning.                                      Hence,

with    learning, the household has                    to be initially more             skeptical before the
government         is induced to put on a tariff in period 1.

4. NIodel with Two Consumpon Goods



       In the model of the previous sections, there was no atemporal distortion

created by tariffs.       The only distortion was in the saving behavior of the

household      This arose because the househoild was dubious about. the motives of

the government and    perceived   a possible change ii     r-'He   policy   in the next

period. Extension    of   the model   to   include a static distortion in consumption

from the tariff is possible. In such a case, the true government will always
choose free trade in the last period.     For positive values of ir, tariff
imposition in the first period can partially offset the intertemporal
distortion. However, it also introduces an adthtional atemporal welfare
reduction. In the one good case, there always exist possible priors for which
choosing the tariff in the first period is superior to free trade (e.g., 1(

1).    When there   are two consumption goods, free trade may or may not be a
superior policy for all prior beliefs.
       Adding a second consumable to our two-period        model is straightforward.
For simplicity, the country is coflipletely specialized in production of the
export good, which is taken as numeraire. Output of the exportable is
exogenous and constant, and both the importable and exportable are consumed.
Household   utility is again intertemporally separable, arid the discount rate      is

equal tothe given world rate of interest. We write the utility of current
consumption in indirect form and assume that units are chosen so that the


                                             13
world relative price of the importable is unity.

      Because     free trade will always be          chosen by the true government in the

second     period, social welfare under time—consistent policy is given by:
                                W V(p1,11) +
where
        I    is consumption expenditure        in   period    1     valued at domestic price p1,
and   22
           is   consumption expenditure in period 2 valued at the world (and true

domestic) price, one.

      The representative household maximizes expected utility, given prior

beliefs summarized by 1.        The first-order conditions for maximization yield

consumption of good 2 in period 2 in the event of a tariff in period 2 is

equal to c. The superscript refers to the second good.                                  12 is consumption
expenditure      valued   at domestic prices if there were a tariff.                         The current

account deficit in period 1 is given by x.

      We now assume that the utility from current period consumption                                       is
homothetic      and displays constant relative risk aversion. Indirect                           utility   in

each period is given by:


                                V(p,I)




                                                14
where V (p) < 0 and          CT   >   0. Also we define

                                            a        (p—1)c2/I,

where  the superscript 2 refers to the second good, so that expenditures

        The first-order conditions for household optimization yield:

        It is useful to notice that (7—1)1(1--a) is a measure of the atemporal

welfare loss from a tariff since this quantity equals


                             [(P(p)I)
                                          1-a —
                                                    (i.'(l)z) 1-0 ]/(1—a),
which is the difference between the utility for some given level of

expenditure     measured    at world prices when a tariff is in place and when it is

not.    This quantity   must         be negative.
        For many   cases,   equations (10) and            (11)   imply      that    if IT is between zero

and    one,                         world prices will be less (greater) in
              then expenditure measured        at

period 2 than in period when free trade (the tariff) is adopted in period 1.
                                 1


The possibility exists that the opposite effects occur for particular

combinations of tariff magnitude,                      elasticity of substitution between
commodities,     and coefficient of relative risk aversion, as long as the latter

is greater than unity. In such instances, social welfare with the tariff,
W( It), is monotonically decreasing in , so that free trade in period 0 is
superior to the tariff               for all values of U.                  Therefore, we restrict our

attention th cases in which z1 is greater than z2 if free trade is adopted in

period 1, so that free trade leads to a current account deficit in the first

period, as in the one-good model. That is, we restrict attention to cases in

which 7(1—a) < 1. This will always hold if '7                    is       less than one.

        W1(lt) is monotonically decreasing in U and has a derivative equal to

zero for I equal to zero. However, W(1() has a maximum value for some value

of 11   between zero and one.
        Because the static distortion is created by tariffs, free trade may be




                                                     16
superior to the tariff for all prior beliefs about the government's type.

if the tariff is superior to free trade for some possible beliefs, then

those values of lr for which it is the optimal policy all exceed one—half.

This follows from the one—good model, since the presence of the atemporal

welfare effect can only reduce the benefits of tariff imposition. Figures

2(a)   and 2(b) display curves W1(lr)          and W(m) for    to possible cases.

Proposition 2: The least prior value of 71 between 0 and 1 such that W1 () z

W2(lr), if it exists, under Bayesian learning exceeds the prior                        such that

W1(lt*) = W2(1T*)         in   the absence of learning.

Proof:       Because W(i) is not monotonically increasing in i, the argument for
Proposition     1 is insufficient. The possibility arises that W1(*)                   W(71) for

       The two-period model can be extended to an arbitrarily long finite

horizon or an infinite horizon model. With learning, each period that the

true government chooses its optimal policy, the prior belief that it is the

false type     is   reduced. This is true        whether the   optimal policy is free trade

or tariff imposition in any given period.                   If tariff imposition is optimal

given the initial prior, then, in the absence of learning, it will always                        be
the    optimal policy until the last period (or always, if the horizon is



                                                  17
infinite.)      However, when the household updates its beliefs about the

government's type           after   observing the policy chosen each period, if               the
horizon is long enough free trade will eventually become the optimal policy

choice.      This is true even when the tariff                is   the best policy in early

periods.

     The multi-period extension of the model is straightforward.                              The

household maximizes

variables for the incredulous household. The household knows the objective of

the true government (but assesses less than probability one to the government

being this type), so that it can calculate the path                of   policies chosen by both

the true type and       false type recognizing how its own beliefs           will be updated.

the optimal time consistent one given the updating rules and initial (time 0)

priors of the private sector. The horizon T can be infinity.

        The    Bayesian          updating      rules are unchanged.       Bach period that the           true

government         chooses the policy            which is optimal, the prior belief, A,              of the
household that it                   is   the true type rises.        For a given initial prior, A,,

greater than zero, the number of periods for the prior, A, to decline to any

value less than unity is finite.                            Therefore, even if the tariff is optimal

initially, for a large enough T, free trade will become                       a   superior policy in a

bounded number of periods and it will be selected thereafter.                                       This is

summarized as:

Proposition            3    For the infinite horizon problem, if .,                >   0,   the   nunber    of

periods       such that the tariff is the optimal policy is bounded by a finite

number K. K will                depend     upon the parameters of the model.

Proof     If                (l—A0)q is zero, then the first-best is achieved by the policy
sequence, {p               i}o.           Let q > 0, and denote the value of social welfare under

this policy of free trade as a function of o' W(10).                              Furthennore, for any

alternative policy sequence, ttO' such that 3 t <                              for which           = p, the

value of social welfare                          is strictly less than W(A0) for A0               1. Strict

concavity and twice-continuous differentiability of U(c1,c2) imply that

is continuous in A0. Continuity of W therefore implies there exists AX < 1

such that W(A0) >                         for all A > X, where the policy generating                is       =

p and              1, 'V'   t        1.    This implies that given At > AX, at any time t, the

optimal time—consistent policy thereafter is free trade as long as A >                                     for

all s         t.       This condition holds by the Bayesian updating rules which imply

that both X and A exceed A.

     The dynamic behavior      of the current account can be inferred      in the normal

case we consider (that is, an anticipated future tariff induces a current
account    deficit).     If the tariff is a superior policy given initial prior
beliefs,     than a current account surplus occurs since         there is a perceived
positive probability that free trade will be chosen in a subsequent period.

As the prior probability that the government is the false type falls with

learning, the intertemporal distortion created by the tariff increases and the

current account surplus rises. Once free trade becomes optimal, the current

account goes into deficit because the private sector perceives a positive

probability of a tariff the next period.          With learning, this probability

declines, so that the current account deficit falls toward zero.                Since the

optimal saving path followed by the economy depends upon the initial prior

beliefs of the household, the steady-state wealth and consumption also depends

upon the initial priors.




5. Conclusion



     When a government is       in power that   wishes   to maximize     the   welfare of
consumers,    but the consumers do not believe that is the government's goal, a

distortion is introduced inth the economy.        In the models we have examined,

the misperception is about future tariff policy.                     The incredulity of

households creates an intertemporal distortion.

    A   first—best     policy to remove this distortion -— such as a ta on foreign



                                          20
borrowing --    is   not available to the government. As a second-best policy it

may be desirable to impose a tariff, if the atemporal distortion is smaller

than the intertemporal distortion.

        The optimizing government cannot reach the first-best solution under the

constraints we have postulated. Therefore, even when it implements the best

policy among the ones it has at its disposal, a distortion remains. However,

we have shown that the mere act of choosing policy optimally over time reduces

the size of the externality. This is true even if the optimal policy is to

choose a tariff currently. By acting optimally, the government establishes

credibility, A government cannot achieve credibility instantaneously —-           it
must do so over time by choosing the policy which is best for the public. The

public will begin to recognize the benificence of the government, even if it

is imposing a tariff, if that tariff is the best choice the government can

make.     (The irony   is that the skepticism cf   the public   is   what forces the

government   to choose a tariff, and is what keeps the economy away from an
unconstrained Pareto optimum.)
     The presence of learning generally weakens the case for a tariff as a
policy to deal with the interteniporal distortion caused by household's
incredulity. First, the public must       initially be more skeptical about the

good intentions of the government (as     compared to the case without learning)

for it   to be optimal to impose a tariff. Second, over time with learning it

is inevitable that free trade becomes the best policy.
