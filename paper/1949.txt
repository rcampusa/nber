   Maximum Hours Legislation and Female Employment in the 1920s:
                           A Reassessment




                               ABSTRACT


     The causes and consequences of state maximum hours laws for
female workers, passed from the mid—1800s to the 1920s, are explored
and are found to differ from a recent reinterpretation. Although maximum
hours legislation reduced scheduled hours in 1920, the impact was
minimal and it operated equally for men. Legislation affecting only
women was symptomatic of a general desire by labor for lower hours,
and these lower hours were achieved in the tight, and otherwise
special, World War I labor market — hours of work declined substantially
for most workers in the second decade of this century. Most importantly,
the restrictiveness of the legislation had no effect on the employment
share of women in manufacturing. The legislation was, on the contrary,
associated with a positive impact on the employment share of women in
sales (another covered sector). Finally, labor force participation rates
of women across cities during the 1920s were strongly and negatively
correlated with shorter hours of work per day, consistent with one
time—series explanation for the increase in female market work.
These results are consistent with a labor market model in which
scheduled hours of work per day are negatively related to days worked
per week, and that assumption is justified using previously untapped
data on actual hours, scheduled hours, and days worked for women in
the covered sectors.

     The development of . . . state legislation on hours has tended to
     follow a very definite pattern. An insistent and persistent demand
     for general legislation to insure shorter hours for all led to the
     passage of general eight—hour laws. When statutes of such unrestricted
     application proved unavailing, attempts at hours regulation concentrated
     on specific classes of employees (Cahill 1968, orig. 1932, p. 94).


     State laws mandating daily and weekly maximum hours of work appeared as

early as 1847 and by 1921 all but four states passed such legislation. Half

the states adopted their first laws during the initial two decades of this

century, and 40 states passed some form of hours legislation during the second

decade. While the precise number of hours and the details varied by state, one

aspect was common to all ——   the   laws applied almost exclusively to the employment

of women.1 At the time of their passage they received mixed reviews. To their

champions the laws would serve to protect women from their employers however others

predicted they would result in reduced female employment.

     The motivation for and impact of protective legislation have received renewed

attention. In her study of maximum hours legislation Elisabeth Landes (1980)

concluded that it greatly reduced hours worked per week by women in 1920 and

lessened their employment share in manufacturing, the major covered sector.

Furthermore, the reduction in employment was most pronounced among the daughters

of the foreign born, and the passage of this legislation was, by inference,

supported by native—born, male manufacturing workers, who stood the most to gain.

    This paper reassesses the interpretation of maximum hours legislation and

introduces new information on its impact.        The findings differ substantially

with those of Landes. Although maximum hours legislation reduced scheduled

hours, the impact was minimal and it operated equally for men. The reasons for

this apparently curious result are clear from the headnote. Legislation affecting

only women was symptomatic of a general desire by labor for lower hours, and


                                          1
                                                                                  2

these lower hours were achieved in the tight, and otherwise special, World War

I labor market. It is important at the outset to point out that states that

passed legislation did not always have lower scheduled hours; there is no

relationship between scheduled hours of work by state in 1909 and subsequent

legislation. 2

     Most importantly, the restrictiveness of the legislation had no effect on

the employment share of women in manufacturing. The legislation was, on the

contrary, associated with a positive impact on the employment share of women in

sales (another covered sector). Finally, higher labor force participation of

women across cities during the 1920s was strongly correlated with shorter hours

of work per day, consistent with one time—series explanation for the increase

in female market work. A by—product of this endeavor has been the collection

of information on the relationships among actual hours, scheduled hours, and

days worked for women. The evidence indicates that shorter scheduled hours per

day were associated with more days worked per week. More days worked per week

were translated, by way of the U.S. Population Census question on gainful

employment, into greater labor force participation rates.

     Some of the differences between my findings and those of Landes are rooted

in misspecifications in the original article, while some are founded in new evidence

on hours of work. None of the differences between this paper and the Landes

article detracts from the contribution of the original, which was to highlight

an important and almost forgotten part of the history of hours of work, female

employment, and protective legislation.

     The resolution of the impact of hours legislation is particularly relevant

with the recent passage of comparable worth legislation and with renewed interest

in the political economy of "rent seeking" behavior. Various types of protective
                                                                               3

legislation, such as child labor laws, compulsory attendance, and pay equity,

which were once viewed as humanitarian in origin, have also been reinterpreted

as directly benefiting certain groups —— but not the ones to which the legislation

directly applied.

        Maximum hours legislation may be relevant, as well, to understanding the

long—term decline in hours of work over the course of this century. The findings

of this paper regarding the relationship between the decline in male and female

hours necessitate further study of the decline in hours in general. The average

scheduled work week in manufacturing fell by almost 9 hours from 1900 to 1920,

or by one full work day. Much of the decline occurred in the brief period from

1916 to 1920 (Historical Statistics 1975, Series D 769, p. 168) during and just

after an outpouring of state hours legislation (38 important laws were passed

from 1911 to 1919) and coinciding with generally favorable economic conditions

and trade union strength (1920 was the year of maximum membership). The roles

of World War I legislation, such as that affecting the railroads, and special

product demand, such as in lumber, complicate the general decline in hours but

not the relationship between it and protective legislation.

I. The Impact of Maximum Hours Legislation on Hours of Work

        Did maximum hours legislation have an impact on the scheduled hours of

women and, if so, by how much? Landes (1980) explored this question with

state—level data from the 1919 U.S. Census of Manufacturing, which aggregated

male and female employees and gave scheduled (not actual) hours of work per
week.

        To separate the impact of hours legislation on male and female employees

an identity is estimated in which mean scheduled hours by state are regressed

on the female share of employment in manufacturing (PMFF2O), a dummy variable
                                                                                4

equal to one if the state passed a maximum—hours law by 1914 interacted with

the percentage female (PMFF2O * DUM),        and several variables (South dummy,

urbanization) to account for differences in hours across states. By including

only PMFF2O * DUM, the maximum—hours law dummy multiplied by percentage female,

the impact of hours laws is constrained to fall entirely on female employees.

The coefficient on PMFFZO *   DUM   is then the decrease in the number of hours

worked by women in states with hours legislation.4

     A more general specification would also include the dummy variable (DUM),

the coefficient of which is the decrease in the number of hours worked by men

in states with hours legislation.      The coefficient on PMFF2O *    DUM   is the

difference in the decline in hours (due to legislation) of women compared with

men, and that on the percent female (PMFF2O) is the difference between average

hours for females and males in the unconstrained states. The constant term is

the unconstrained value of male hours.5

    Various hours equations estimated across states (and the District of

Columbia) are presented in Table 1.       Column 1 gives the results in Landes

(1980); column 2 reestimates the same equation following the variable construction

in the original article and results in similar coefficients. The equation in

column 5 is identical to that in 2 but weights the observations by the square

root of the number of manufacturing employees in each state.      Column 3 omits

the interaction of the dummy variable with the percentage of manufacturing

labor that was female but includes the dummy variable.        Finally, column 4

contains the least constrained estimation.

    Landes' estimation of the more restrictive equation indicated that hours

legislation decreased scheduled hours of women by 8 per week.        Note that 8

hours per week was 15 percent of mean scheduled hours per week — almost one
                                                                                  13

general, on the relationship between (Cf + 1) and         ——   essentially   a battle

between the usual labor supply elasticity and the less conventional elasticity

of days with respect to hours per day.

     The elasticity of interest, that pertaining to female employment, can be

negative or positive even under the parameter restrictions in the Landes

formulation.22 Furthermore, the sign is independent of the signs of the other

elasticities.   Female employment can increase with either an increase or a

decrease in the wage.     The increase in female employment with a decrease in

hours now operates through two effects and is therefore easier to achieve with

given parameter values.     It operates first through the initial increase in

wages as hours decline and secondly through the (negative) elasticity of labor

with respect to hours (_)23 Note that the data on scheduled hours and days

worked in Table 2 can be used to estimate the parameter , which is about —1

indicating that actual hours worked per week were relatively constant.24

     The possibility that maximum hours laws could have expanded female employment

should not be surprising.     It has been frequently asserted that female labor

force participation rates rose over the long run because scheduled hours of

work per day declined, enabling women with responsibilities at home to work

more days.25

     In the employment equation estimated by Landes, the dependent variable was

the percentage of the total manufacturing labor force that was female in 1920 and

the key independent variable accounted for the degree of restrictiveness of the

state's maximum hours legislation.2' Other variables were included to account

for differences in the demand for or supply of female workers, such as urbanization,

region, and a lagged employment share in manufacturing capturing a host of

relevant factors.
                                                                               6

hours legislation (once again, that cover only women) was virtually identical

to that from the full estimation in Table 1.

     These findings suggest that protective legislation for women was associated

with a decline in hours of work for men. The reason for this apparently peculiar

result is, as suggested by the headnote, that laborers in states that passed

protective legislation for women had sentiments for decreased hours of work in

general. They were able to lobby more forcefully for laws covering women whose

plight appealed to legislators, and state supreme courts did not, in general,

challenge those laws.    Note that this analysis does not assess whether women

were "hours constrained" in the presence of legislation or whether men and

women were hours constrained prior to the large declines in hours from 1909 to

1919. Those are separate and difficult issues.

     The proposition that protective legislation was passed in states in which

male labor lobbied vigorously for general hours reductions can be tested by

using disaggregated data by industry for 1914 and 1919 from the 1920 Manufacturing

Census.    In each state the two major female—intensive industries and the two

major male—intensive industries were selected. In the former, females were, on

average, about 50% of the labor force; in the latter, however, they were less

than 2% of the labor force. The male—intensive industries therefore could not

have viewed increases female labor as a direct threat; these industries (lumber,

foundries, steam car railroads) never contained many female employees (if any

at all).

     Define MDIFF to be average scheduled hours for males in 1919 minus average

scheduled hours for males in 1914 and FDIFF to be the same for females. Let

LIM14 be the existing weekly hours limit in 1914 (with the zero limit set equal

to 66 hours). Then,
                                                                                 7

 MDIFF = —20.75 + 0.268 LIM14 +   1.35 SD + 0.0320 PURB
          (5.67)   (3.12)         (1.54)   (1.47)                 R2 =   0.232
 is obtained when estimated across the 49 states (plus D.C.) and indicates that

 the 1914 hours limit is positively related to the decline in hours for males from

 1914 to 1919. However,

FDIFF =    2.80 — 0.072 LIM14 + 0.022 SD — 0.0493   P1IRB
          (0.53) (0.90)        (0.03)     (2.44)                 R2 =   0.139
 indicates that the decline in female hours was not related to the existing 1914

 limit.   These results, taken together, suggest that labor in male—intensive

 industries lobbied effectively for female hours limits in states in which they

were ultimately successful at lowering their own hours. In many of these states

the dominant male—intensive industry was lumber, in which the Wobblies led

successful strike activity in the unique World War I environment (see Hidy, et

al. 1963, pp. 332—51). Organized labor in male—intensive industries cared about

female hours of work probably because the more laborers working shorter hours,

the more it becomes the norm for all. Labor was successful in obtaining shorter

hours in the special 1914 to 1919 period.10

     A further problem with the assertion that hours legislation substantially

reduced hours of work is that the data analyzed are for scheduled, not actual,

hours. It is actual hours worked that are at issue. Data on actual hours are

unavailable on a national basis for this period of time, but exist for 17

states in various surveys of the Women's Bureau. These states are not, however,

a random sample; the Women's Bureau directed its efforts at states with higher

than average scheduled hours.11 Even with this bias to the sample, the unweighted

mean of scheduled hours is 51.2 or exactly 1 hour below the unweighted mean of

scheduled hours in the 1919 Census of Manufacturers, which is the average for

males and females.'3
                                                                                8

     Scheduled weekly hours, actual weekly hours, the hours laws in effect at

the time of the survey, and days worked per week are given in Table 2 for the

various states included in the Women's Bureau bulletins. The data show that

mean actual hours were far more similar across states than were mean scheduled

hours. While it is true that states with the least restrictive hours legislation

had the highest scheduled hours per week, actual hours per week worked by

female employees in manufacturing and mercantile establishments were far less

than were average scheduled hours. In Missouri and South Carolina which had

among the highest scheduled hours, actual weekly hours worked were only 82

percent of scheduled hours. In Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, which

had among the lowest scheduled hours, the ratio was over 90 percent.          The

elasticity of actual hours with respect to scheduled hours was 0.82.13

     Row did employees manage to work fewer than the scheduled number of hours?

Female workers achieved fewer hours by working fewer days per week, not by working

fewer hours per day.14 Thus the difference between actual and scheduled hours

per week is found in the number of days worked, not the number of hours worked

in a day. Thus hours worked per day can be appropriately proxied by scheduled

daily hours, but the same is not true of hours worked per week. This finding

will be of particular relevance in exploring the impact of scheduled daily

hours on the employment of women.

     The claim that hours worked per day varied less than did days worked per

week is supported in these data by various types of evidence. One is the

relationship between average days worked and average actual hours worked per week.

The data on days worked come from employees whose time was reported in days and

the data on hours per week come from employees whose time was reported in

hours.15 Thus the two data series are derived from different individuals. The
                                                                                9

question is whether the individuals who reported their time in days actually

worked full days. (The data necessary to do this exercise are not given in

Table 2.)     Multiplying the number of days they claim •to have worked by the

average number of scheduled (not actual) hours in a day, will give the average

number of hours worked, if individuals varied days and not hours per day. The

fact that this number is very close to that obtained by a different group of

individuals, those reporting time in hours per week (column 2), indicates that

both groups probably varied days and not hours per day."

     The close resemblance of the hours equation in Table 1 to that in the

original article indicates that the variables used are nearly identical. Thus

the next stage of the empirical work, that on employment, using an almost

identical set of variables should produce similar results. That, however, is

not the case.

II. The Impact on Employment: Theoretical Underpinnings and Empirical Results

     The impact of maximum hours legislation on the employment of women in the

covered sector provided the key result in the Landes article. The estimation

was motivated by a model of a labor market which predicted, under the most

reasonable parameter values, that the female share of the covered sector would

decline with effective maximum hours legislation.

     Landes posits a model of labor hours in which individuals choose hours of

work (h)1 say per week, as a function of their hourly wage (w):


        = w eh   i




and then choose to supply their labor (L1), say in laborers per week, as a function

of their weekly earnings (wh1):

                     aLl
     L1 =   (whj)
                                                                               10

where i = male (m), female (f) workers. Workers are perfect substitutes for

each other, and thus the wage is the same for both groups.         Total hours of

labor services, S =    h1L1, are identical, in equilibrium, to firm demand:

     D =
Effective   maximum hours legislation for females alters the equilibrium in two

manners: the elasticity of female hours with respect to the wage hf automatically

becomes 0 and hours of work for females are reduced if the constraint is binding.

The effects of the reduction in female hours on the total supply of hours, the

wage, female labor, and male labor are given by: dS/dhf > 0; dw/dhf < 0; dL./dhf

< 0; dh./dhf < 0; and dLf/dhf    0.

     Thus all effects are unambiguous in sign except for that on female labor which

is the derivative of interest.        It depends on the relationship between the

elasticity of demand for labor hours plus an elasticity weighted male labor

force share, and the female labor force share, (i + €'mSm — Sf)      0.17 As

Landes points out, the most reasonable parameter estimates yield a positive

impact. The female labor force in the covered sector would decline with effective

maximum hours legislation.

     This result is tested (and affirmed) in the Landes article by estimating the

impact on the female share of the manufacturing labor force of hours legislation.

Although the empirical results obtained by Landes are consistent with the

predictions of this model, I will demonstrate that they are in error.          The

corrected results can be better explained by a slight revision of the model,

which is, as well, consistent with the data in Table 2 on actual hours of work.

Those data indicate that hours of work per week varied by the number of days worked

and not by the number of hours worked in a day. That is, hours per day were not

a choice variable to individuals, at least not at a point in time. The difference
                                                                             11

 is one of major importance because maximum hours legislation frequently mandated

both maximum hours per day and per week. If the only intent of the legislation

was to constrain the number of hours women worked, only hours per week would

have been necessary.

     The evidence suggests that the number of hours worked per day is given to

the worker and the worker decides on the number of days. While the number of

hours per day varies by firm and by industry, it varies far less than does the

total number of actual hours worked per week. Assume, therefore, that hours

per day are the same across all firms." Tastes for work at each prevailing

wage—hours point will vary across individuals; some will not desire to work at

all when the work day is 10 hours, while some will work only a few days a week.

A shorter work day will lead a greater percentage to enter the labor force and

will lead those in the labor force to work more days per week.1'

     Assume that the negative relationship between days worked and minimum

hours per day exists for women but not for men —— a reasonable assumption given

the aggregate labor force participation rates of the two groups. Therefore the

supply of female labor is given by:1°


          =
               —           Cf
     Lf       hf   (whf)

while that for men is given by:

                     Cm
          =
     Lm       (wb)
where h = the given number of hours per day, L. =
                                                  days of labor supplied per
time period, w = the wage, f = female, and m male. The demand for hours of

labor is assumed identical to that in the original model (D =   w).   Note that

in this model, as in the original, firms treat hours of work as fungible across
                                                                                             12

laborers —— two six—hour shifts are equivalent to one 12—hour shift. The absence

of extreme substitutability would reduce employment of the constrained group.

      The new version of the model is distinguished from the old because minimum

hours of work per day demanded by employers affects the number of days worked

by females. To obtain this result I assume that hours worked per day is not a

choice variable.21 There are now three effects generated by a mandated decline

in hours of work per day, rather than two. The two in the original model are

that days worked decreases because the reduction in hours reduces earnings, but

days worked increases because the wage rate increases. A third effect, serving

to increase the supply of labor, is added through the negative relationship

between minimum hours per day and days worked per time period.

      The four elasticities of interest are those concerning total labor hours

(S). female labor (Lf) the wage (w), and male labor (Lm)s and they are given

by:

                                  —   + 1)/a         0     as Cf —      + 1     0

where a =   (+   s8 + Smem) and                = (L1h1IS), the female or male share of

total labor hours. In the original model, maximum hours legislation for women

reduced their equilibrium hours and increased the equilibrium wage rate. Thus

the impact on female labor was ambiguous because earnings declined through hours

but increased through wages. The impact on male labor was unambiguously positive,

operating only through wages.         All effects are now ambiguous and depend, in
                                                                                  13

general, on the relationship between (Cf + 1) and         ——   essentially   a battle

between the usual labor supply elasticity and the less conventional elasticity

of days with respect to hours per day.

     The elasticity of interest, that pertaining to female employment, can be

negative or positive even under the parameter restrictions in the Landes

formulation.22 Furthermore, the sign is independent of the signs of the other

elasticities.   Female employment can increase with either an increase or a

decrease in the wage.     The increase in female employment with a decrease in

hours now operates through two effects and is therefore easier to achieve with

given parameter values.     It operates first through the initial increase in

wages as hours decline and secondly through the (negative) elasticity of labor

with respect to hours (_)23 Note that the data on scheduled hours and days

worked in Table 2 can be used to estimate the parameter , which is about —1

indicating that actual hours worked per week were relatively constant.24

     The possibility that maximum hours laws could have expanded female employment

should not be surprising.     It has been frequently asserted that female labor

force participation rates rose over the long run because scheduled hours of

work per day declined, enabling women with responsibilities at home to work

more days.25

     In the employment equation estimated by Landes, the dependent variable was

the percentage of the total manufacturing labor force that was female in 1920 and

the key independent variable accounted for the degree of restrictiveness of the

state's maximum hours legislation.2' Other variables were included to account

for differences in the demand for or supply of female workers, such as urbanization,

region, and a lagged employment share in manufacturing capturing a host of

relevant factors.
                                                                               14

     The restrictiveness variable (REST) measures the percentage of the state's

nianufacturing labor force in 1909 that worked (in actuality, the percentage

working in establishments that had scheduled hours) over the legal maximum in

effect in 1914. Note that the restrictiveness variable is a highly appropriate

variable for this exercise and is considerably better than a simple dummy

variable indicating whether or not a state passed an hours law from 1905 to

1914. The REST variable accounts for prior conditions and gives the proportion

of the labor force in 1909 that would be constrained by the hours legislation

passed by 1914. Landes' estimated regression, given in column (3) of Table 3,

indicates that states with more restrictive legislation had a lower female

employment share in manufacturing. Further estimations by Landes indicate that

most of the decline in the employment share occurred for the daughters of the

foreign born and for foreign born women. These results provided persuasive

evidence that hours legislation was passed under the guise of humanitarian

concern through the efforts of labor groups and others that stood the most to

gain from restricting the employment of immigrant women and their daughters.

     Note, however, the other regressions for the manufacturing sector appearing

in Table 3.   These were estimated on identical variables by state, most of

which were also in the Table 1 estimation. Unlike those in Table 1, there is

little relationship between my results and those of Landes. Most importantly,

the coefficient on REST is insignificant and that on the hours legislation dummy

variable is significant only at unconventional levels.27 These results are

robust to restricting the sample to the 40 states (and District of Columbia)

that are highlighted in the original article (that is, excluding 8 mountain

states having few manufacturing workers), to weighting the regression by the

square root of manufacturing employment in the state (not included in the
                                                                              15

table), and to estimating a (weighted) logistic transformation of the dependent

variable (also not in the table).'

     The source of the difference is in a computational error in the original

estimation. States that had the most restrictive legislation passed both daily

and weekly hours laws. The REST variable in the original article was inadvertently

computed using a weekly restriction that was always 6 times the daily restriction.

That procedure resulted in the correct weekly restriction in many of the cases,

but 11 states (or one—quarter of the sample) had more restrictive weekly hours.

    Focus now on a different equation in Table 3, one in which the dependent

variable is the percentage of sales (not clerical) labor force that is female

in 1920 (PSF2O), as in column (4). Retail trade was also covered by maximum

hours legislation and in many states mercantile establishments were covered

before manufacturing firms. An equation similar to that for the manufacturing

sector is estimated for the sales sector with results that are very different.

Rather than declining, as in the original article, and rather than being

insignificant, as was the case for the manufacturing equation estimated in this

paper, the female share of sales employment actually increased in states having

more restrictive hours legislation.2' It should be emphasized that the decline

in the female share of the manufacturing labor force during the 1900 to 1920

period did not mark a new trend. The female share of the manufacturing labor

force had been declining for decades preceding maximum hours legislation, and

the share probably peaked as early as the 1840s (see Goldin and Sokoloff,

1982). Female employment in the sales sector, however, began to increase

during the first decades of this century.      The coefficient on REST in this

equation suggests that maximum hours legislation, by reducing daily hours in

this sector, increased the employment share of females.       Thus maximum hours
                                                                              16

legislation may have had little or no effect on female employment in manufacturing

and a positive effect on female employment in sales.       The possibility that

there was a differential effect of hours legislation on these two sectors

should not be disturbing. The framework outlined earlier suggested that certain

parameters would determine the sign of the effect, in particular s which was

higher in sales, and it is possible that other parameters differed by sector.

     The variables used thus far to measure the employment effect are the shares

of women in a particular sector.     The female labor force participation rate

could also have been altered by hours legislation because, under the gainful

worker definition, participation is related to the average number of days an

individual works (see Goldin, forthcoming).       To assess this proposition a

relationship was estimated across large urban areas (cities having over 100,000

persons) in various states between the labor force participation rate of a

group of women, for example native—born white married women, and mean scheduled

hours of work in manufacturing.

     Constant elasticity equations were estimated for white women of native—born,

foreign—born, and native—born of foreign—born parents, separately for married

and all marital statuses. The coefficients on hours per day in all equations

were negative, indicating that shorter hours were associated with higher

participation rates. The result holds across all subgroups of white women, but

it is strongest, by nativity, for married women (except for the foreign born).30

The generally larger elasticities for married women indicate that days worked

per year were more responsive to scheduled hours per day for those with greater

home responsibilities.

     How important is the effect of hours on days worked and thus on labor

force participation rates? The mean labor force participation rate of married
                                                                              17

native—born white women living in large urban areas in 1920 was 10.6 percent

and mean scheduled hours per week were 51.5.       Mean scheduled hours per week

fell to about 44 by 1940 and the labor force participation rate of white married

women in large urban areas rose to about 18 percent.31 The increase in the

participation rate predicted by the decrease in hours worked is 3.6 percentage

points or almost half the difference in the actual change.

III. Summary Comments

     The causes and consequences of maximum hours legislation have been explored

and found to differ from the reinterpretation presented by Landes (1980).      In

particular, hours declined for men as well as for women in states with hours

legislation and the employment share of women in manufacturing did not decrease

with the restrictiveness of the legislation. Indeed, the employment share of

women in another covered sector, sales, rose with increasing restrictiveness

and female labor force participation rates were positively correlated with

shorter hours.82

     These findings are ezplained within the context of a model similar to that

in Landes (1980) but in which scheduled daily hours is a binding constraint on

the worker.   Workers with home responsibilities choose fewer days when face

with higher daily hours. Thus lower daily hours, within some limits, increase

days worked. The negative relationship between scheduled hours and days worked

is explored with previously unused data sources.

     This work has raised further questions about hours legislation and the

long—term decline in the work day and week in America.       I have suggested the

reasons for the relationship between the decline in hours worked by men and

legislation protecting women, but it is still not clear what precise mechanisms

operated to reduce hours of work for all.

all coefficients by 100 (except EMP_1) because the numbers in Landes express
the share as a percentage rather than as a proportion. OLS estimation used for
consistency with Landes. A weighted logit transformation yields almost identical
slopes around the mean for the 49 states (and D.C.) and the nonmountain sample.

                                                         FOOThOTES


1. Mississippi (in 1910) and Oregon (in 1920) passed legislation covering men,
and the Georgia law covered all textile workers (see Cahill, 1968). Many other
states attempted to pass general legislation but were thwarted by various state
supreme courts, except when the laws explicitly allowed contracts for more than
the maximum number of hours —— rendering them virtually useless.

2. The possibility that hours legislation was passed in states in which hours
had already declined, and therefore in which there was less opposition, is
reduced by the estimation in Landes (1980, p. 481) of an hours equation for
1909.   States which passed hours legislation after 1909 did not have lower
average scheduled hours in 1909. It is conceivable, however, that actual hours
of work for men greatly exceeded scheduled hours because of overtime, but there
is no indication that overtime work was negatively related to the existence of
hours restrictions.

3. On child labor laws in Britain see Marvel (1977).    Note that Landes and
Solmon (1972) interpret the passage of compulsory schooling legislation as
coming after most children were in school for the legislated amount of time.
Neither E. Landes nor I have been able to find convincing empirical evidence to
support the hypothesis for the case of hours (see footnote 7).

4. The identity is simply:

                      —
     H =
            afHf + (1   af)L,              +
                                               (af   *
                                                         DUM)fBf
where H is average scheduled hours, R is average scheduled hours for females
in unconstrained states, Km is                  average scheduled hours for males in unconstrained
states, DUM is = 1 if a state                   has a maximum hours law, af is the percentage of
manufacturing employment that                   is female, and    is the marginal impact of hours
laws on mean female hours and                   is expected to be negative. Rewriting yields the
estimated equation:

       =         +         —
            1m       (Hf       H,)af   +
                                               (Hff)(af    * DIJM)


Thus the coefficient on af is the difference in female and male hours in
unconstrained states and the coefficient on af * DUN is the decline in female
hours in constrained states.

5. The more general specification adds to that in footnote 3 a term for the
impact of hours legislation on male hours.

    K =              + (1 —                    (af   *                   ((1   —
            afHf            af)Hm +                      DUM)fKf     +
                                                                                   af)   *
                                                                                             DUM]mHm

Rewriting   yields the estimated equation:

                   —
    H =
           H. + (Hf H.)af +                 (Hff — '1mmf              * DUN) +
                                                                                             Pm)DUM
                                                                                    24

6. The percentage of the manufacturing labor force that was female was 12.3
(unweighted).  Multiplying by the coefficient on PMFF2O * DUM from column 2
gives 1.29.

7. The weighted version of this equation yields a somewhat lower and less
significant coefficient on DUM.

8. As noted in the table, the equations are not corrected for possible
heteroscedasticity problems inherent in estimating identities.

9. The results for the foundry data (using the variable definitions and
constructions in Table 1) are, first for the unweighted sample and then for the
weighted sample:

     HRS19 =   54.7 — 0.052 PURB — 0.109 SD — 1.31 DUM      ;    = 35.5;   N = 44
               (60.9) (3.11)            (0.14)    (1.54)


     HRS19 =   54.8 — 0.033 PURB    —
                                        0.336 SD — 1.84 DUM ; R2 = 30.9; N = 44.
               (56.3) (2.03)            (0.40)    (2.06)

Five states had insufficient employment in foundries to be listed in the census.

10. Note that there is no implication that female employees were unconstrained
in states with maximum hours legislation, although I have not been able to estimate
a decline in their hours (for the female—intensive industry sample) in states with
restrictions (an exercise similar to that in Table 1 of the paper). Male—intensive
industry hours, however, are lower by 1.5 in states with legislation, consistent
with the foundry data.

11. The Women's Bureau did include several states (such as New Jersey and Ohio)
which had restrictive hours legislation. These states had requested surveys to
assist in evaluating their legislation or formulating minimum wage standards.

12. One problem with making comparisons between the 1919 Census of Manufacturers
figure and that of the Women's Bureau Bulletins is that the latter span the
period 1919 to 1925.   Beney (1936) and others (Historical Statistics, 1975)
find, however, that hours were relatively level during the 1920s and declined
sharply from about 1914 to 1920.

13. An equation estimated across the 15 states with complete information yields:

     log Actual Hours = 0.576 + 0.821 log Scheduled Hours
                       (0.78) (4.40)

R2 = .598;    =   .57;   t—statistics in parentheses
Source: Table 2

14. The difference between scheduled and actual hours is due to two sets of
factors: those affecting the firm, which are a constraint on the individual,
and those resulting from individual choices. It seems clear that states with a
high percentage of women working in cotton textile mills had shorter work weeks
                                                                              25

because of firm closings.

15. It is probably the case that the individuals who reported time in hours were
primarily time workers and those who reported time in days were primarily
piece—rate workers. The bulletins are not clear on this distinction, but those
surveys that requested information on time and piece—rate work contain data
that are consistent with this interpretation.

16. The result for New Jersey, for example, is 45.2 hours compared with actual
hours of 44.3 per week. A second set of data (not given in the table) demonstrates
the same point. Information in the Women's Bureau bulletins indicates that the
majority of individuals who worked fewer than scheduled hours lost hours in
multiples of the modal daily scheduled hours (or modal Saturday hours) for the
state. That is, they did not lose, for example, 3 or 17 hours per week but 6
or 16 hours per week, when modal daily scheduled hours were 10 and modal Saturday
hours were 6. Such evidence creates a prima facie case that individuals varied
days and not hours.

17. The term Cm = €Lm +               + (CLm * Bhm).

18. The choice of hours per day by these firms will depend on the technology
used, in particular the degree of complementarity across types of labor and the
cost of idle capital. It will also depend on the distribution across individuals
of the cost to them of working.

19. This negative relationship between hours and days worked will only hold
within some range.   Surely as the given number of hours per day of work gets
low enough, some individuals will not find it worth their while to go to work.

20. The notation in the model and the empirical work that follows is almost
identical to that in the Landes article.   The only difference is that the
subscripts 1 and 2 are replaced here by f and m.

21. If hours per day were a choice variable, women could work fewer hours per
day and not have to trade—off days per week and hours per day.

22. That is, if (Cf —        )
                         + (8f(t + SmC —
                                                  f)/I}
                                                ( 0, which is needed for Lf to
increase with a decrease in hf1 then (Cf — 3) + 11 can be of either sign. The
only restriction that can be imposed is that    + smem —

                                                         Sf) > 0, as suggested

23. The precise difference is as follows. In the Landes model there is a positive
elasticity of male hours per day with respect to the wage rate, c, which is
zero in my model because hours per day are exogenous. The requirement in the
original model for dLf/dh < 0 is:

            + CmSm —
     Cf(q              Sf) + CfSmC(1 +           < 0

The requirement for dLf/dh < 0 in my model is:

     8f(1 + 8m5m
                 —
                       Sf)   + 1(ef   —   ) <0
                                                                                                        26

Thus it is clear that there are weaker restrictions in my model because of the
existence of the elasticity of female labor (in days) with respect to hours per
day (—a).

24.   The equation is:

       log Days = 5.41
                       — 0.955 log Scheduled Hours
                (2.66) (1.85)

Number of observations = 10; R2 =             .301;      =   .213; t—statistics in parentheses

25. As John Durand noted (1948, p. 118), "The secular decrease in weekly hours
of work is perhaps almost as important as the change in occupational composition
of the demand for labor, as a factor in the increasing employment of women.
The length of the working week is especially important in connection with the
availability of married women for jobs."

26. Note that d(Lf/Lt)/dhf can be < 0 even when dLf/dhf > 0 in the original
formulation of the model. That possibility is less likely to occur in the new
version.

27. The dummy variable indicates the passage of the first hours law from 1905
to 1914 and is therefore a less reliable indicator of the level of hours
restrictions than is the REST variable.

28. Another set of key estimations in the original paper focused on the impact
of hours legislation on the employment share of native—born, foreign parentage
women and foreign—born women. The results of these estimations yielded larger
and more statistically significant coefficients than in the entire sample. My
attempt to replicate these results did not yield significant effects on the key
variable, REST. These equations have been estimated across the 41 (non—mountain)
states (and D.C.) highlighted in the original article.

Share of Native—White, Foreign—Parentage Women in Manufacturing Labor Force

       = —0. 0050 + 0.692 EMP1 — 0.0007 SD + 0.0002 P11B             —   0. 0119   DIThI +   0.0042 REST

R2 = 87.2    ;   N = 41   ;   Mean of dependent variable =        0.036.
Share of Foreign—Born Women in Manufacturing Labor Force

      = —0.0083 + 0.669
                        EMP_1 + 0.0028 SD + 0. 0003 PURB                 0.0018 DUM          0.0036 REST
                                                                     —                  —

           (3.12)     (14.6)              (1.07)         (4.70)            (0.68)              (0.88)

  = 94.5     ;   N = 41   ;   Mean of dependent variable =        0.020.
29. Note that the restrictiveness variable is computed for the manufacturing
labor force because scheduled hours for mercantile establishments are not
available.  The Women's Bureau bulletins cited in Table 2 indicate, however,
that there was relatively homogeneity within states across manufacturing and
                                                                               27

sales hours schedules. Note, as well, that the estimation includes the percentage
of sales workers who were female in 1910 rather than the percentage in 1900, as
in the manufacturing estimations. While it would have been more appropriate to
use 1900, only 1910 data are available for sales workers.

30. The elasticities of labor force participation with respect to mean scheduled
hours of work per week in manufacturing for various nativity groups of married
and all women in 1920 are:

                    Elasticity t—statistic                   Elasticity t—statistic
Married                                 All Marital Statuses
       NN        —2.32      (2.58)                        NN —1.24       (2.42)
       NP        —3.70      (3.93)                        NP —2.71       (4.07)
       PB        —2.33      (2.98)                        FB —2.45       (3.86)

where NN =   native—born, native parentage; NP = native—born, foreign parentage;
FB =   foreign
             born.   Source: Hill (1929). Equations were estimated across the
large urban areas of 31 states.

31. The figure for scheduled hours in 1940 is approximate; only data for actual
hours are readily available.

32. One finding that is not in dispute is the relationship between the passage
of maximum hours laws and union strength, which Landes found to be a prime
determinant of the restrictiveness of legislation as of 1914 (using the state's
unionization ranking in 1964). My interpretation of this result, however, is
that unions were less interested in restricting female employment than they were
in reducing hours in all industries, especially male—intensive ones such as
lumber and steel.
