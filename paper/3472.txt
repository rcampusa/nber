     The objective of the work reported in this peper is to fied if the
consumption data from the six waves of the Retiremont History Survey are
consistent with the life cycle hypothesis of consumption ani to test the
importance of a bequest motive for saving. The 12 data itats which are used
cover an estimated 36% of total consumption; the most important datum is food
consumption. The findings support the life cycle hypothesis: as required,
omasured consumption among the elderly declines with age. A test of the

bequest motive for saving based on the variation by extended family stricture
in consumption paths provides no support for a bequest motive.

 1. Introduction.



        Although the life cycle hypothesis of coosumption has been the most impoctanttheory for the

study of saviog behavior, intercst in thc bequest motive for saving has grown considerably.1          This

interest has been stimulated by three kinds of empirical results: 1. In simulations of lifetime
                                                                                                earnings
and consumption trajectocies, "reasonable" utility function parameter values lead to savings that are

considerably smaller than observed household wealth (White, 1978; Darby, 1979). This implies          that
a   good deal of household wealth has been inherited.     Although, when the date of death is unknown,

large inheritances are not necessarily inconsistent with the life cycle hypothesis, many people would
think they indicate that   at least part   of the bequests are intentional.   2. Kotlikoff and Summers

(1981) find from estimated earnings and consumption paths that as much as 80% of household wealth

is inherited.   3. The elderly do not seem to dissave as they age (Danzigec, ci. at, 1982; Eotlikoff and

Summers, 1988). Because this contradictsa pcediction of the life cycle hypothesis,   it has been   taken   to
be particularlydamaging to the hypothesis.

       In this paper, I first review some evidence on how wealth changes as the elderly age. The best

evidence is that the elderly do dissave as required by the life cycle hypothesis. Then, I
                                                                                          present some
findings based on consumption data in the Retirement Ilistory Survey (ff115). As measured in the

11115, consumption dcclmmmes as households age, which is in accordance with the life cycle hypothesis.     If
a   bequest motive for saviug is an important drterminent of consumption, the consumption paths of

parents and nunparents should differ, but no systematic difference hetween their consumption paths is
found. The overall conclusion is that the wealth and consumption data in the RHS are consistent with
the life cycle hypothesis;      they do oot support a role for a beqoest motive as a determinent of

corisumptioo behavior.



2. Wealth Chaoge.



        As originally formulated, the life cycle hypothesis of consumption (LCH) specified that utility

derives only from consumption, not from bequests, and that the length of life is known with certainty.

Jo this formulation     a condition of lifetime utility maximization    is   that wealth   will decline to zero hy

the date of death. If the date of death is uncertain, but the maximum age to which anyone can live               is

fixed and known, wealth must decline to zero at that maximum age. In either case a prediction of the

LCII   is that at   some age wealth will decline with increasing age. The age at which wealth should

decline is not known, however, without forther specification about the form of the lifetime utility

function. A specification    that is often made   is the following (Yaari, 1965).

       An individual maximizes in the consumption path {ct}


               N         -t at dt
               Ju(c) e

in which   o) is the instantantaneousutility function, p is the subjective time rate of discount, at is the
probability of living   at least until   t, and N is the maximum age to which anyone can live           (N = 0).
Because in this formulation utility does not depend on leisure, the model         is only valid   after retirement.
The constraints on the maximization are initial wealth, and the equation of motion of wealth, wt,


               dwt    = rwt —ct
in which r,     the real interest rate, is constant and known.               Utility maximization implies that


                            —
                            —      at+h           h(r-p)                  h(r—p— mt/at)
( 1)              Ut                          C                       C
                              Ut+h      _5•                    Ut+h



over an interval (t, t+h) in which wt                >     0. Ut S marginal     utility at t. mt/at is the mortality hazard

rate, which increases approximately exponentiallyat ages over, say 60.                      If p > r, marginal utility will
increase with age, which implies, under the usual assnmption about the concavity of                         o(.) (o" C 0),
that consumption will fall with             age.    If p < r, the     age   at which marginal utility will begin to rise and

consumption fall is found from



                  mt
                  =r-p.
For example,      if r =         0.03 and   pw    0, consumption will begin to fall at about age 66      for males and age
74     fnr females.        If   consumption declines with age, wealth must also decline: if dwt/dt were positive

and dc/dt negative,



                  d2w5               dw -     dc5
                                =   r--               >0


which implies that              dw/dt   would remain positive for all future ages, violating the terminal condition

that    wN    =       0.    Therefore, the LCH makes the strong prediction that, in the absence of                 a   bequest

motive for saving, wealth should begin to fall at some age and that                    it will continue to fall at all greater
ages.     A reasonable          guess would be that the wealth of retired single men would begin to              fall by their
60's or possibly earlier, and of retired single women by their early 70's or earlier.

          Many studies, however, have found that wealth seems to increase with age in cross-section
(Lydall, 1955; Projector aod Weiss, 1966; Mirer, 1979; Blinder1 Gordon and Wise, 1983; Menchik
and David, 1983). These results have been interpreted to         he particularly damaging   to the LCH. For

example, "Perhaps the most decisive attack oo the life-cycle theory of savings came from the direct

examination of the wealth-age profile itself." (Kurz, 1985).

         The cross-section findings have stimulated interest    in the bequest motive fur saving. A common

formulation is that lifetime utility depends on consumption and on a bequest (Yaari, 1965). The

consumer chooses {ct) to maximize


                N         -t           N           -t
(2)             5u(cz)e a5dt± JV(wt)e mdt
                0             0




in which V(.) is the utility from a bequest. The first-order conditions imply


                                                   t+h
(1)                 es            ii eh@9)     +          (s-t)(r-p)       ds
               ut        ut+h


in which V5 (>0) is the marginal utility of a bequest. Comparison of (3) and (1) shows that for given

ur+t ,   ut will be larger with   a bequest   motive for saving than without a bequest motive, so that the

path of marginal utility will be flatter. Therefore, the bequest motive will flatten the consumption

path and could cern cause it to rise. A flatter consumption path leads to a flatter wealth path, and,

depending on the form of the bequest utility function and the initial conditions, wealth could increase

with age (Hurd, 1989). Of course, because the bequest motive means that wealth enters the utility

function (2). it follows almost directly that more wealth      will he held.

       Altlinsgh the observation that wealth seeuis to iscrease with age in cross-section was an

important motivation for interest in the bequest motive, as an empirical matter it appears that the
observation was itself incorrect.      Table 1 has cross-section wealth profiles from four data sets,
normalized so that wealth is 1.0 at ages 55-64 (llurd, 1990). The table shows that in cross-section

wealth falls wilh age as required by the LCD. Just why these results differ from previous results is not

clear. One explasatios is that the results is the earlier papers had too much age aggregation(Wolff,

1988):    combining the older age intervals into one interval 65+ can cause wealth to seem to increase

with age in some of the data sets.

         However, whether wealth seems to increase in cross-section is practically irrelevant         for assessing

the LCD because of the difficulties in recovering the wealth paths of individuals (or cohorts) from the

cross-section age-wealth relationship: I.        Because the poor die earlier than the well-to-do, wealth can

rise in cross-section even though the wealth holdings of all individuals fall as they age; 2. Each cohort

has different lifetime earnings and historical saving experience which are difficult to account for; 3.           In

cross-section,   it in   difficult to establish whether individuals are retired. Apparently these problems with

cross-section data have empirical content.          In panel data     the differences between the cross-section

wealth paths and the individual wealth paths can be studied: in the NLS "There does not appear to be

auy systematic differences between cross-section and cohort age-wealthprofiles which could he used to

correct the cross-sectional profiles," (Jianakoplos,Menchik and Irvine (1989).

         In the lIDS     I found annual rates of dissaving    of retired individuals and couples of about 3% per

year excluding housing and about 1.5% per year including housing (Hurd, 1987).                      Diamond and

Haunman (1984) found in the NLS of older men rates of dissaving after retirement of about 5% per

year. Mirer (1980) used a one-year panel from the 1963 and 1964 Federal Reserve wealth surveys to

find median rates of dissaving of 1.2% per year. These findings are good evidence that the elderly do

dinsave after retirement as required by the LCD, but           in view of   the high and variable rate   of inflation

during the lOb's we need stsdies based on data front the 1980's before we can be confident of the

empirical facts.

         Dissaving by the elderly is consistent with the LCH, but             it   is also consistent with the LCD




                                                          5
augmented by a bequest motive, which does not rule out disaaving. However, many have argued that
even though the elderly may dissave, the rate of dissaving is so low that               a bequest motive must be
important (Bernheim, 1987; Modigliani, 1986, 1988; Kotlikoff, 1988; Kotlokoff and Sommers, 1988).
I    find   it   difficult to assess what the appropriate rate of dissaving should be in the LCH model with

mortality risk aversion. Suppose for example that the instantaneous utility fonction is



                    u(C) = -—      C
Then


                    dc5   1                mr
                     dt   c —— I7 tr   P   at


If y, the        risk aversion parameter, is large, coosomption will be practically flat. Take that extreme

case, and assume a real interest rate of 3% and a maximum age of 105. Then, wealth at age 85 would

be    about 65% of wealth at age 65, an average rate of dissaving of about 2% per year. This is certainly

consistentwith observed rates of dissaving.2

            Because the rate of wealth decumolation dnes not by itself provide any evidence about the

importance of a bequest motive for saving, additional information needs to be used to identify its

importance. It is reasonable to soppose that parents                will have   a   stronger bequest motive than

nonparents (V5 will be larger in (3)).            Then, cet. par., they will dissave     at a   lower rate, and the

difference in the rates of dissavisg will be      a measure of the bequest motive.
            In the PAlS, the ratcs of dissaving of parents and nonparentsare practically the same whether

measured in         a way that   is almost free of functional form restrictions or in   a way that imposes a good
deal of functional form (Ilurd, 1987, 1989). I take this           to be   good evidence   that either the   bequest
motive is weak for most people or that it is not operable.3



3. Consumption Paths.



          Consumption data offer     a more promising      way to estimate parameters associated with the LCB

and to test for the presence of a bequest motive than wealth data: the rate of change of consumption

depends directly on current mortality rates and the degree of risk aversion, whereas the rate of change

of wcaltli ilcpcnds on the lcvcl of consaniption, which dcpcsds on the entire time path of mortality

rates.    The importance of annuities (mainly Social Security) further complicates estimatr based on

wealth:     they enter the utility maximization problem as a flow, not a stock of wealth. Because the

optimal level of the consumption path depends on the entire path of annuities, the rate of change of
wraith depends on the entire time path of annuities. Ilowever, the rate of change of consumption does

not depend on annuities as long as a boundary condition on wealth is not binding. Thi8 greatly

simplifies estimation.

         Consider the utility maximization problem of (2) but with the modified equation of motion of

wealth:



                                 —
                dw/dt    = rwt       ct -f Ac




wt is bequeathable wealth, and At is the flow of annuity income. Annuities are important for the

elderly: in 1986 57% of the elderly (age 65 and over) received more than half of their money income

from Social Security.

          If wt > 0, the solution to the utility maximization problem is given in (3); if wt = 0, ct = At.

Therefore, the LCH predicts that if wc          >   0, consumption will eventually decline with age.   The bequest
motive predicts that individuals with a strong bequest motive will have a more slowly declining

consumption path than individuals with     a weak bequest motive.


4. Consumption Data in the RIIS.



       The HitS has direct measures of the following categories of consumption: food purchased in

grocery stores, food from vendors and home delivery, food purchased away from home, nonfood items

purchased in grocery stores,     gifts and donations, recreation and membership fees, and gasoline and

other transportation expenses (but excluding automobile purchases).           I   estimate that the covered

categories comprise about 34% of total consumption by the elderly.4 To avoid ambiguity I will refer

to the sum of the covered categories as RHS consumption.

       Table 2 has some food consumption statistics from the six years of the RHS. These numbers are

supposed   to show     measures of weekly food consumption in current dollars, but they are not

interpretable and appear to be of no value for analysis. Case-by-case stndy of the household data,

however, showed systematic coding errors. Detection and correction of the errors wss          a considerable

part of the effort of this paper.
       Table 3 has some typical examples of the consumption data. Three households in the RHS

(Households   1,   85 and 89), were chosen to illustrate the source of the data problemsfound in the food

consumption data.        The top panel for Household 1 has missing values in 1969-1973 because the

household did no retire until after 1973. The RHS has three measures of food consumption: "usual"

(amount usually spent in grocery stores, and on food from vendors and deliveries in a week), "general"

(amount spend on food including nonfood items         in general stores   last week, excluding vendors and

deliveries), and "foodentr" (amount actually spent on food last week including vendors and deliveries;

in 1969 "foodentr" is missing for    all bouseholds). I developed an algorithm for choosing among them;
the algorithm aimed at selecting the measure closest to "normal" food consumption. In 1975 "usual"

consumption was missing (9999998) so 'general" was used with the appropriate adjustment for

differences   in   coverage.    Total consumption of Household           1   was estimated to be $4319. In 1977,

"gastran" was missing so total Consumption was missing. In 1979, "usual" was again missing; total

consumption was estimated to be $90.

       Obviously there are several data problems. Data are missing in some consumption categories

such as "gastran" (amount spent on gasoline and transportation not including automobile purchases)

for Ilousehold     1,   "donation," "meinberfee," "recreation," and 'gift" for llousehold 85 in 1973, and all

the data in 1973 for household 89.              A more serious data problem is        the extreme variation in some

consumptioncategories, and the incredible consumption levels                 in some years.   For example, Household

I appears to   have consumed $4319 per week in 1975 and $90 per week in 1979. Close examination of

the panel data      at the    household level revealed that the following categories were recorded in cents,

rather than in dollars, as was called for in the cede book:



                 1971: purchased from grocery stores and general stores last week;

                          food from    a grocery store last week;
                           nonfood from a grocery store last week;

                           food from   a vendor last week;
                           food from   a   delivery last week;

                 1975: usually spent on food in a week;

                           purchased from grocery stores and general stores last week;

                           food from a grocery store fast week;

                           nonfood from     a grocery store last week;
                           food from   a   vendor last week;
                      food from a delirery Isat week;



        These coding errors were systematic, common to alt households. In addition in 1973 the food

consumption data of some ohservations (but not all observations) were entered in cents.            This is

apparent from the maximumfood consumption entry for 1973 (3500) given ahove.

        Missing values in the small categories of consumption were imputed by grometric interpolation

hetween adjacent years or hy backcaating or forecasting for end-point years. An example is the

imputation of $12 for "gastran" for household    1 in 1977.   Because food consumption is about 60% of

RilE consumption, no imputation in a particular year was made if food consumption was missing in all

of its three forms in that year: RHS consumption for that household was entered as missing. The

second panel shows the results of imputation, and the third panel the results of both
                                                                                      imputation and of
reucaling the categories
                    that were recorded in cents. Household 89 illustrates that no imputation is
made when food consumption is missing. At this point the data are recorded in current dollars pee

week.

        Panel four has consumption measured in real dollars when the deflator is the CPI. The

consumption by Household 1 is at reasonable levels, but has considerable year-to-year variation due to

low consumptionin 1977. Examination of the individual components, however, does not reveal
                                                                                           any

components that ace obviously in error. Household 85 has fairly smooth consumption except for 1971

and 1979. Between 1977 and 1979 one of the spouses died, so the 1079 data will not entec any data sets

based on coostant household composition over two year periods. For
                                                                   1971,        it   is   not obvious from

inspection of the components wl,ich, if any, are eecneded with error.      llouuehold 89 has declining

consumption except in 1975. It secnns probable that "diosnack" (dinners and snacks purchased outside

the home) is observed with considerable error, although it is certainly possible that in the month

surveyed the household had some dinners in expensive restaurants. In any event, there is no systematic




                                                   10
error   in 'djnsnack" common to all observations in   1975   that could be identified and corrected.
         Some of the components of consumption were observed in the week preceding the survey, some

are monthly averages (converted to weekly amounts) and some are annual averages.                  Prices were

changing rapidly during some years of the RIIS: if all the components of consumption were deflated by
the CF'! considerable mismeasurement could arise simply from the timing of the measurement.

Furthermore, the relative prices of some of the   R1!S components changed over the ten years.             These

considerations    led to the use of monthly or annual deflators of the individual components of

consumptiondepending on the time period over which the consumption component is defined. Table 4
shows the deflators and the time period of measurement. For example, 'food at home" was measured

for the week preceding the survey (in April) so the April food index was used as the deflator.

'Gasoline" was measured on a monthly basis in 1973, so the March deflator was used; but in 1977

annual expenditure was measured so the annual (1978) deflator was used.

        These deflators can be used to define a Laspayres price index for the consumption components of
the RHS that can be compared with the CPI. Table           5   has the ratio of the CPI to the RHS deflator.

The ratio of indices was roughly constant between 1969 and 1973, and again between 1975 and 1979,

but at a different level. This was due to higher inflation rates in food and gasoline than in the other

components of the CPI. For example, between 1973 and 1975 the food price index increased by 26%

whereas the CPI increased by just 21%. Between 1973 and 1979 the gasoline price index increased by

137%;      the CPI increased by 61%.     The ratio shows that deflating by the CPI could introduce

mismeasurementof the changes in consumption that are systematicallyas large as any actual average

changes. Therefore, to find the changes in real consumption of the components in the RUS,              I deflated
each component by the detailedprice indices given in Table 4.

         Estimated consumption of Households 1, 85 and 89 are shown in the last panel of Table 3.

Comparison of panels four and five shows that in most years the consumption levels do not depend




                                                      11
greatly on the deflator. However, year-to-year consumptinn changes can he rather different: in panel
four of Household     89, consumption   fell by 2% between 1973 and 1975 according to CPI-deflated

consumption, but by 10% according to the fillS-index-deflated consumption measure.

       Thc composition of RHS consumption deflated by the CPI is given in Table 6, and deflated hy

the detailed price indices in Table 7. Although the fractions in most categories are stable over time,

the fractions spent on gasoline and food varied substantially regardless of which deflator was used. I

imagine this is at least partly caused by the difficulty of measuring real consumption during periods of

high and varying inflation. Certainly   I would   have more confidence that the variation in consumption

in the 1IIIS is a good indicator of variation in total consumption if the components of consumption in

Tables 6 and 7 had more stability.

       The composition of consumption in Tables 6 and 7 gives little guidance in choosing between the

two deflators. For most of the rest of the paper I use the detailed indices, but the basic results of the

paper are unchanged if the CPI is used as the deflator.
       An independent assessment of the reasonableness of the consumption measure can be found as

follows. In the 1972-73 Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) about 17.4% of total expenditures were

for food at home among the elderly in the relevant age range. If this percentage of income were spent

by the 1978 RHS households (excluding earnings), weekly food consumption at home would have been

about $29.5.     This compares with the cross-section average (1977 and 1979) of measured food

consumption    at home of $31.3.


5. Changes in Consumption.



      If the   measured components of consumption are normal goods, the components will fall when

total consumption falls. Under that s.ssumption, the direction of the change   in   total consumption can




                                                    12
be found by studying changes in measured consumption.5 Table 8 has average coosumption (in 1969$)

by marital status for each of the inital two-year periods    in   the RHS. An observation is used in the

calculation for a particular year if it has complete data for that year and for the second following year,

and if household composition remains constant over the two years. Thus, there is no control for

composition: at retirement,households may rnter the sample, yet leave the sample in some other year

because of missing values or change in marital status.6 The table shows generally falling consumption

rach year which indicates that in cross-section consumption falls with age. As would be expected

consumption by couples is greater than by singles, about 77% greater on average. In this comparison,

therr is no control for economic resources which are much larger among couples.

       Table 9 has consumption changes that hold composition cnnstant. An observation enters one of
the two-year data sets if household composition did not change during the two-year period, if the

huuscholds was retired (defined to he no earnings during the remainder of the panel), and if tbere were

no missing values.7 Other conditions are given at the bottom of the table. The entries are


                      —
              E (C2       C0)



which is robust against random observation error. The table shows declining consumption in each two-

year period for both couples and singles. The declines are not at all constant, especially between 1973
and 1975.   1 imagine   this is due to the difficulty of accurately measure gasoline and food consumption

during those years. This view is supported by the budget shares in Tables 6 and 7. The lsst line of
Table 9 gises the estimated 10-year decline in consumption. It is just the sum of the two-year changes.

The rate of decline is about 4% per year foe couples and 3.5% for singles.

      The finding of falling consumption in the panel data holds if the CPI is used to deflate all the

components of consumption that are in RHS consumption:               the total decline in consumption is




                                                    13
estimated to be 31% for couples and 26% for singles.

        Detailed examination of the data at the individual level showed          a   number   of outliers. Table 10

has some examples.       Households 2577, and 3394 have exceptionallylarge gasoline expenditures            in   1975.

In that year actual weekly expenditureswere recorded. Those households showed no strong propensity

for substantial driving during the other years of the survey; the most plausible explanationis a ceding

error that recorded expenditures in cents rather than in dollars.8           Household 3093 apparently generally

spent $124 on groceries in 1975 whereas in other years        it generally   spent about one tenth as much.        In

that all entries of "general" in   1975 have already been divided     by 100 (under the assumptionthey were
recorded in cents rather than in dollars), the entry looks like a misplaced decimal point. Gasoline

consumption of Household 3539 in 1971 and of Household 3835 in 1969 appear to have been entered in

cents rather than in dollars.

          These are typical examples of 31 couples and 38 singles whose consumption changed by more

than $100 in absolute value over two adjacent years.9            Deleting the observations with a change in

consumption of more than $100 in absolute value peeduces the consumption changes in Table 11. In

line   with the previous diseussion of the arge price changes near       1975, the most observations(18) were

deleted    in   the 1973-1975 and 1975-1977 data sets.    Deleting the observationscauses the estimated 10-

year decline     in consumption to fall from   39% to 28% for couples, and from 35%             to   18% for singles.

The year-to-year pattern becomes more uneven, and in particular estimated consumption rose between

1971 and 1973, and between 1975 and 1977. Nonethelesa, the overall conclusion is that consumption

declined as the households aged, as required by the LCH.

          Imputing the small categories of consoxnptiov changes somewhatthe year-to-year pattern of the

change    in consumption, but    does not alter the overall conclusions of declining consumption. Consider

Table 12, which compares           consumption changes calculated over all observations with changes

calculated only over observations with no imputations. (Comparisons cannot be made for the years




                                                         14
1971-73 and 1973-75 because all observations had imputations in 1973.) About 33% of couples and

36% of singles had at least one imputed value.10 The total decline in consumption over the years in

the table is the same regardless of whether observations with imputed values are included or not, even

though there is some year-to-year variation in the rate of decline.

         I have   been writing of consumption as measured in the 11115 as if           it   were total consumption.

The conclusion that consumption declines with age            is based on the observation       that the total of the
components in the      RITS declines with age.   But   if, as people age,   they change the composition of their

consumption, RIIS consumption could decline even though total consumption was stable or even

rising.11    A way to test for taste changes associated with aging               is   to    compare the change in

consumption of households who have bequeathable wealth with households who have no hequeathable

wealth.      A condition of utility maximization          is   that   consumption equals annuity income if

bequeathsble wealth is zero. Therefore, households who have no bequeathable wealth and constant

annuity income should have constant rnnsumption. Then if there is no age effect on the components of
consumption, the RUS measure of consumption should be constant.

         Table 13 shows consumption by singles and cnsples classified according to whether they had any

bequeathable wealth (excluding housing wealth). Those with no wealth were further restricted to those

whose only annuity is Social Security, which is taken to be constant. The change in consumption holds

composition constant in that it is the average over five two-year perieds in each of which composition

is   constant. As would be expected, those households with no bequeathable wealth consumed less than

hnnseholds with beqncathable wcalth. Singles both with and without bequeathable wealth reduced

conssmption as they aged bst the average rate of rednction was about 4% for both.                         The null

hypothesis that Ac     = 0 cannot be rejected for singles whose bequeathable          wealth is zero, but it can be

for singles whose beqseathable wealth is not zero. Of course, because of the small sample size the first

test has low power, so this is very weak evidence for no age effect on tastes. Among couples, the




                                                        15
sample size is even smaller. Couples whn had no bequeathable wealth increased consumption slightly

whereas couples with bequeathable wealth decreased consumption by about 6% over           a   two-period on

average.   This again offers mild evidence in support nf the view that taste changes associated with

aging are not the cause of the fall in RHS consumption.

        Tests based on the fraction of hnnseholds with falling consumption produce about the same

cnnclusion as shown by Table 14.        More households who had bequeathable wealth had           a fall in

consumption than households who did not have bequeathable wealth. The null hypothesis that the

probability of a decline in consumption is 0.5 cannot be rejected for households with no bequeathable

wealth, but it can be for households with bequeathable wealth. Again this is mild support for no taste

changes with age.12

        The LCH with a bequest motive implies that a strong bequest motive will flatten the

consumption path.       Under the assumption      that    parenta have   a stronger   bequest motive than

nonparenta, parents should have cnnsumption paths that decline more slowly than nonparents. Table

15   has average consumption of singles and couples according to whether the household had children.13

No children lived in the households. Singles both with and without children had declining consumption

un average, but the consumption of single parents declined somewhat less. This supports a bequest

motive. Couples also had declining cnnsnmptiun, but the parents had the greater decline, which offers

no support to the bequest motive. Table       16 gives the differesce between   the consumption change of

nonparents (Csr) and the consumption change of parents (Cc), and summarizes this test of the bequest
motive. Under the null hypothesis of no bequest motive the differences should be zero; under the

hypothesis of   a bequest motive the    differences should be negative. Fur singles, the null hypothesis

cannot be rejected, and for couples the statistic has the wrung sign for rejection.

        An alternative test is baaed on the fraction of households with declining consumption.         If a

bequest motive is important, a smaller fraction of parents than uf nuuparents should have falling




                                                     16
consumption. As shown in the first two columns of Table 17, this holds among singles but not among

couples.       The third column has the differences in the fractions and the standard errors of the

differences.     Under the null hypothesis of no bequest motive, the differences in the fractions should be

zero;   under    a   bequest motive they should be positive. Although             for singles the sign of the   difference

supports the bequest motive, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. For couples the statistic has the

wrong sign for rejection.



6. Conclusion.



        When the date of death is unknown, the LCB implies that consumption by individuals of

sufficient age will decline with age.        If consumptionis observed          to increase with age, it may simply be

that the individuals       are not old enough     to   be on the downward sloping          part of their consumption
trajectories. However,       it   is likely that, at least by the end      of the panel,    the RHS cohorts were old

enough to have declining consumption.           If consumption is falling,       bequeathable wealth should     fall:   if it
does not, a terminal condition on wealth               will    be   violated.    In the RHS, observations on botb

consumption and wealth are consistent with the LCH in that both are observed to decline after

retirement.

        While the findings that consumption and wealth decline with age are consistent with the LCII,

they are not inconsistent with       a   bequest motive for saving:       the bequest motive     (if it is operable)    will

change the shape and level        of the consumption and wealth paths, but they will not necessarily              rise. A

teat for the importance of the bequest motive is based on the assumption that the marginal utility of

bsqucnts of a parent is greater      thaii the iriarginal utility of bequests of a nonparent. This assumption

implies that cci. par. the wealth and consumption paths of a parent should decline more slowly than

the wealth and consumption paths of a nonparent.                   In the RHS the wealth paths decline at the same




                                                              17
rate. The consumption paths of singles show some support for the bequest motive; but, possibly due

to low power, the difference   in   the paths   is not statistically significant.   The consumption paths of

couples show no support for the bequest motive: the rate of decline is about 6% over        a two-year   period

for parents and 5% for nonparents.

      The RHS data on wealth and consumption are consistent with the life cycle hypothesis of

consumption.   They offer no support for a bequest motive for saving as an important determinentof

consumptionbehavior.

1. In this paper, the life cycle hypothesis of consumption generally allows that the date of death is

unknown. No utility is derived from   a bequest.
2. The rate of wealth decumulation increases with age. With less risk aversion than the extreme case,

the rate of decumulationpredicted by the LCH could be rather small at the younger ages observed          in
the RIIS and NLS.

3. See Able, 1987 for a discussion of the difference between an operable and an inoperable bequest

motive.

4.    This estimate comes from the consumption distribution by the elderly in the 1972-1973 CES

(Boskin and Hurd, 1985).        The covered catagories would be        a   larger fraction of out-of-pocket

expenditures because the CES data include an imputed value of owner-occupied housing consumption,

which is about 20% of total consumption.

5.    If, in addition, the indifference curves are homothetic and relative prices are constant, the

percentage change in the components of consumption gives the percentage change in total consumption.

This is the implicit assumption of Hall and Mishkin (1982) and Bernanke (1984).

 6. In addition 69 observations were deleted because consumption changed by more than $100 over

two years. The effects of excluding these outliers will be discussed below in connection with Tables 10

and   11.

7. Except for f00d consumption, some of the other consumption values may have been
                                                                                   imputed.
8. At $1.00 per gallon (1969 prices) and 15 miles per gallon, household 2577 would have driven 6570

miles in    a week.
9. One household can account for two observations on large changes. For example, household 3394

has a positive change of $531 from 1973 to 1975 and a negative change of $541 from 1975 to 1977,

accounting for two of the outliers.

10. Again, food consumption is never imputed:      if it is missing the observation is dropped.
11.   Of course, the   allocation of consumption could change due        to price aod/or wealth changes.
                                                                                               research.
