             More on the Speed of Adjustment in Inventory Models




                                  ABSTRACT


     When empirical stock-adjustment models of' manufacturers'

inventories of finished goods are estimated, there appear to be
two local minima in the sum of squared residuals functions. t
one local minimum, the estimated adjustment speed is typically

quite high; at the other, it is typically quite low.
Furthermore, finding two sets of estimates that fit the data
almost equally well does not appear to be a quirk of this

particular application. Rather, it stems from a fundamental
identification problem that afflicts partial adjustment models of
all kinds.

    In the specific context of manufacturers' inventories of

finished goods, the estimation procedure employed by Maccini and
Rossana seems to pick out the solution with rapid adjustment (and
high serial correlation in the disturbances) whereas the solution
with slow adjustment (and little serial correlation) is more
often the global minimum.

I. INTRODUCTION

       pplied econometricians estimating stock adjustment models
of inventory investment have long bemoaned the fact that
estimated adjustment speeds turn out to be "implausibly slow."1

Other applications of stock adjustment models, such as the
demands for money and for consumer durables, also turn up slow

adjustment speeds.2 In a thought-provoking recent paper in this
Journal, however, Louis Maccini and Robert Rossana (1984) claim
that the slow adjustment is an artifact of inappropriate
estimation orocedures which fail to correct for autocorrelation.

Using a two—step procedure due to Hatanaka (1974), they obtain
econometric inventory equations for finished goods with very fast
adjustment speeds.
        While Maccini and Rossana are correct that failure to
correct for autocorrelation can bias estimated adjustment speeds

downward, their application to manufacturers' investment in
finished goods inventories produces estimates that are
inappropriate in a very subtle sense. In particular, I show
below that the types of models estimated by Maccini and Rossana
—-   and perhaps most stock adjustment models —— have two local
minima in the sum of squared residuals (henceforth SSR) function,

and that the Hatanaka technique that they use typically picks out
the "wrong" local minimum.

       This short paper has two purposes. The first is
                                                    Page 2



methodological. Since partial adjustment models are commonly
estimated for all kinds of economic variables, it seems important

to reemphasize the potential identification problem first pointed
out by Criliches (1967): that it may be quite difficult to
distinguish between partial adjustment and serial correlation.
This is done in Section 2, where I explain why the existence of'

two local minima should be expected to be the norm, not the

exception.
     The second purpose is substantive. The empirical work
reported in Section 3 strongly suggests that the estimates
obtained by Maccini and Rossana -— which feature high serial

correlation and rapid adjustment —- are not, in fact, the global
minima of the SSR functions. Instead the global minima for most
manufacturing industries are characterized by little
autocorrelation but slow adjustment. Thus, if the partial
adjustment model is accepted as the maintained hypothesis, the

best estimates of the speed of adjustment in inventory models
remain   "implausibly slow.

2. THE DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFYING THE SPEED OF 1D3USTMENT
     To make the point as starkly as possible, I start with a
stripped-down model far simpler than those estimated either by
Maccini and Rossana or by myself. The model is a special case of
the one dealt with by Betancourt ad Kelejian (1981). Let Nt
                                                                           Page 3
denote the inventory stock (or any other stock) at the beginning
of the period, and suppose that desired inventories, N*, are

constant. Then the stock adjustment model is simply:
           Nt+i —    Nt =     !3(N*     —   Nt) +           ut,                 (1)

If the error term follows an R(l) process:

          Ut   = Put_i        +
                                    et ,                                        (2)


the natural procedure is to quasi—difference (1) before
estimating to get:
     Nti = (l_P)N*                + (P —    /3        +l)N — P(l—B )Ntl ÷ et.   (3)




          This is an ,qR(2) model for the stock of inventories.4 But
notice the fundamental identification problem. Suppose the
econometric estimate of (3) is:

      Ntl =           +     (J1Nt +                                             (L)

where     the p's are the estimated coefficients. We find the
implied estimates for P               and        /3    by   solving:
      = P÷ I — /3                                                               (5)


  p2
      = -P(l-13)                                                                (6)
which yields:
  P
      2
                -
Clearly,       equation (7) offers two solutions for p :
                            /2
               p =
                          I1i
                                    2                                           (8)
                                                                                       Page 4



and two corresponding solutions for 13

           n example that is germane to the inventory problem is                                where
P    and        /3     are      approximately equal.                   Then the two coefficients in
(3)     are approximately I and 13( 13—1).                                Hence, we cannot tell 13    from

1— 13      .         For example, if either p= (3=.9 or p = 13=.l, then the
coefficients in (3) are respectively 1.0 and —.09. Exact
equality between p and                                 /3   is not necessary, of course. If (4) is:

           N
               t-i-l
                       =   1.IN t       —        .1425 N t—l    +   constant,
which is pretty typical in the inventory application, the two
solutions of (8) are:

           (a)P= .95                ,       13     =   .85
               (b)p=           .15 ,13             =   .05.
Hereafter,                 I   will refer to solutions like (a) as the "high Pr,

solution               and solutions like (b) as the "low p" solution. The

general point is that, as Criliches pointed out years ago, any

estimation technique will have trouble distinguishing between a
model with strong serial correlation and fast adjustment and one

    with   little serial correlation but slow adjustment.5
           In the simple example of (1) and (2), both parameters are

    literally unidentified. /lctual empirical models such as those of'

    Maccini and Rossana, or the regressions presented in the next
    section, include a variety of other regressors and hence are

    identified in the formal sense.                                 But identification hinges

    orecariously on regressors which are often of minor empirical
                                                        Paoe 5.

importance. Hence, while it is not impossible to distinguish
between a "high P, high 13 " model and a "low P , low        (3" model, it

is difficult.

     ll the equations reported in the next section were fit by
nonlinear least squares under the assumption that the error term

was I1R(l).6    If    the disturbances are normal, this is a' maximum

likelihood procedure. In many cases, two local minima of the sum
of squared residuals function were found.          In such cases, one of
the minima always had high           P and rapid adjustment while the
other had low        P and slow adjustment, precisely as suggested by
this simple argument. This point is important because the

extremely high adjustment speeds found by Maccini and Rossana
(1984 ) result from an estimation technique that settles on the
local minimum with high P        .    (They report estimated values of p
from the two—step Hatanaka procedure ranging from 0.67 to 0.97. )

The nonlinear estimation method used here shows, however, that
the low p      solution is typically the global minimum.



3. ECONOMETRIC INVENTORY EQUI1TIONS



     This section presents econometric estimates of
stock—adjustment models for inventory investment in finished
goods. I concentrate on finished goods because that is the only
type of inventory for which we have a coherent and operational

theory.
     The data are monthly, real, and seasonally adjusted, and
                                                      Page 6.

(after allowing for lags) span the period December 1960 — March
1981.8 Each two-digit industry is treated separately. However,
for direct comparison with Maccini and Rossana, I also present
results for all manufacturing and for the durable and nondurable

sectors. The theoretical stock adjustment model was made

operational as follows.
      Demand disturbances were proxied by two variables: expected
sales, X, is the one—period—ahead forecast from a l2—th order
autoregression fit to each industry's actual data on shipments;
and unexpected sales, X, is the residual from this
autoregression. Thus expectations are assumed to be "rational,"

albeit in a limited sense. Experimentation with other
expectational proxies led to substantially identical results. In
13 of the 20 industries, data on new orders are available. For
these industries, the collinearity between the two sales measures

is   almost always too great to include both, so two      versions of

the regressions      were run. Normally,   a better fit was   obtained
using   shipments.
        Cost disturbances were treated by including both the real
product wage, w, and the real cost of raw materials, c, in each

regression.     The nominal wage series is the average hourly

earnings series specific to that industry or sector. The nominal
materials cost series is the PPI for Crude Materials for Further

Processing (and is the same for every industry).         Each nominal

 factor price is deflated by an industry— specific price index.
        In addition, the interest rate is included as a potentially
                                                            Page 7.

important determinant of' the desired steady-state level of

inventories. For reasons described in Blinder (1981), the
nominal interest rate, R (bank prime rate), and the expected rate

of inflation, r         (generated by an autoregression), are entered as
separate variables rather than combined into a real interest

rate.

        The theoretical model in Blinder (forthcoming) recognizes
the existence of' only one type of inventory. But, in fact,             there
are three types and Maccini and Rossana have convincingly
demonstrated the importance of stock interactions. Many
industries also have backlogs of unfilled orders. Preliminary

regressions showed clearly that investment in finished goods
inventories reacts differently to the initial stock of each kind

of inventory, so Table 1 presents estimates of' the            following
flexible accelerator model of finished goods inventories:
        =       Ft÷ 2 w ÷ 3M + U÷                +      +       ÷
                                                                      2t+
                                               + u. '
where
            = stock of' finished goods (beginning of' period)
            = stock of work in process
         Mt =   stock   of materials and supplies

         Ut =   stock   of' unfi'lled orders

and the error term, Ut, is assumed to be generated by (2).                  The

model is similar to that of' Maccini and Rossana. (In the table,

t—ratios are in parentheses.)
        First, note that the opening stock of finished goods always
                                                    Page 8.

enters with a significant negative coefficient, indicative of'

partial    adjustment. However, in accord with much previous work,
but in contradiction to Maccini and Rossana, most of the
estimated speeds of adjustment are rather slow. Ilmong the 17
industries for which the "low p "   solution   was the global minimum,
the speeds of adjustment range from 5% to 38% per month. These

speeds    are slightly faster than, but not out of line   with,   those
typically found in work at a more aggregative level.9 But they
are much slower than those reported by Maccini and Rossana (1984)
usinQ very similar data and a similar specification. The
difference between my results and theirs is entirely attributable
to the estimation method. In the three industries in which the

"high P " solution is the global minimum (instruments, food, and
textiles), I get extremely rapid adjustment (104 percent, 79
percent,    and 100 percent per month, respectively)J0
     It    is worth noting that aggregation seems to bias the
estimated speed of adjustment downward. The adjustment speeds for
durables and nondurables as a whole are lower than those of most

of the constituent industries. This helps explain why more highly
aggregated studies find slower adjustment.

     The cross—adjustment coefficients,          and B3, are more
novel and display a rather consistent pattern across industries.
High opening stocks of either works in progress (Wt) or raw
materials (Mt) usually are associated with higher investment in

finished goods inventories, that is, with higher production.
V/heher    or not this empirical regularity implies causation, of
                                                      Page 9.

course, is another matter entirely. For example, hioher planned
production could induce stockpiling of works in progress and
materials.

        Studies that merge all three types of inventory into a

sinqle stock necessarily produce an estimated "adjustment speed"
that is an amalgam of the three adjustment coefficients, 13.
Since  one of these is negative and the other two are positi ye, we
would exoect this procedure to understate the speed of adjustment
if the three types of inventories covary positively. To test this
idea, a version of (9) was run in which all three types of
inventory were lumped together into a single aggregate. The
results were as expected: estimated adjustment speeds generally
declined, sometimes dramatically.
        Turning to specifics, the coefficient of works in progress

is positive in 17 of 20 industries, though significantly positive
in only four of these. The petroleum refining industry is the

only important exception; here, high stocks of work in progress

apparently      lead to lower levels of output.
        The   coefficient of the opening stock of   materials and
supplies inventory is positive in 18 of 20 industries, and
significantly positive in ten of these.       The only exceptions are

the primary metals and transportation equipment industries, where

hiQh    levels   of raw materials apparently lead to cutbacks in
production. Maccini and Rossana also found significant effects
of raw    materials   inventories, thouoh not in nondurables.

        In contrast to these rather good results, the stock of
                                                  Page 10.

unfilled orders performs poorly. /lmong the 13 industries
reporting data on unfilled orders, the estimated coefficient is
positive seven times (the "correct" sign, it seems to me) and

negative six times. Only three coefficients are significant; and

they are all negative.
     s noted already, sales are measured alternatively by
shipments and, in those industries offering such data, unfilled

orders. Fortunately, the estimated equations proved quite
insensitive to the choice of a sales measure. Since shipments
perform slightly better than new orders, and are available for

all industries, Table I reports only the results with shipments.
     In general, results for the sales variables are

disapaointing and not always in line with a priori expectations.

For example, many of the coefficients are insignificantly
different from zero, suggesting either that production reacts
virtually one—for—one to sales (whether expected or unexpected)
or that the difference between production and sales shows up
mostly in works in progress rather than in finished    goodS.
    Specifically, the coefficient of expected sales X, is
normally quite small (values of .05 or less are typical) and
insignificantly different from zero. Its sign is positive in 14

cases and negative in six, and only eight of the 20 industries

 (all in durables) display significant coefficients.
      The unexpected sales variable is significant in only 7

industries.     positive coefficient for this variable is

impossible    to interpret in the context of the model; taken
                                                Page 11.

literally, it implies that inventories of finished goods rise
when there is an unexpected surge in sales. Presumably, a

positive coefficient means that the sales fluctuations which we

label "unexoected" are really expected by firms, in accord with
the discussion in Blinder (forthcoming). Yet the point estimate
is positive in 11 of 20 industries. There is evidence of a strong
negative effect of X on AFt in only six industries.

     Interest rates, represented here by the (monthly) nominal
interest rate (Rt) and the (monthly) industry-specific expected
rate of inflation (     do not perform as the theory suggests.

The expected signs are negative for Rt and positive for       but

only four of 20 industries display this pattern. Taking the two

variables individually, we see that Rt gets the expected negative
coefficent in only 10 of 20 cases and    gets the expected
positive coefficient in only nine of 20 cases. Only five of the
19 correctly—signed coefficients are significant; as are five of
the 21 incorrectly—signed coefficients. This is not much better
than what you would expect if the coefficients were randomly
distributed around zero, so the overall conclusion seems to be
that interest rates do not matter. This finding is consistent
with older empirical work on inventory investment, and with
Maccini and Rossana, but contradictory to some other work in
which significant inventory effects have been found.12
     The wage rate is probably the least successful variable of

all. Of the 20 industries, only 4 estimates get the expected
negative sign. Of the 16 positive coefficients, 9 are
                                                  Page 12.

significantly different from zero. The results here strongly

suggest reverse causation running from higher production to
higher wages, Derhaps due to overtime premia. Thus, I conclude
that wage rates are not good representations of cost shocks.
      Raw materials costs are far more successful in this role.

The estimated coefficient of   ct is negative in 15 of 20 cases,
and is significant in about half the industries. ,qnd many of' the
coefficients are of an economically meaningful size.    For

example, the coefficient for all manufacturing indicates that a

1OZ rise in raw materials prices (tfr variable ct is an index
number with January 1972=100) will lower the desired stock of

finished goods inventories by $2 billion (in 1972 dollars), or
about 5Z of the mean inventory stock. The strong estimated
effect of raw materials orices echoes the finding of Maccini and

Rossana (1984).
      Finally, I note in passing that the fits of' the regressions
-    as measured by R2 —- are modest at best. Time series
analysis of noisy, virtually trendless series like LFt encourages

humility.
       One objection to the standard stock adjustment model is that

itassumes that all the righthand variables enter only
contemporaneously. But if there are lags in adjustment, lagged
values of variables like interest rates and raw materials costs
may also matter. In fact, Irvine (1981c) argued that omission of'
such variables may bias estimated adjustment speeds downward, and
Maccini and Rossana's equations include distributed lags.
                                                              Page 13.
        There are so many possible combinations of distributed lags
that might be added    to   (9)   that   I   adopted a sequential search
procedure to economize on computing costs.             The reader is spared
the laborious details of the many regressions that were run.13

Suffice it to say that, while distributed lags of at least one
variable were found to      be significant      in most industries, the
basic   findings on adjustment speeds were not changed. However,
it is worth reemphasizing that, because of the two local minima
in the sum of squared residuals, our ability to pin down the
speed of adjustment is not nearly so good as the t-statistic
            14
suggests.


4. CONCLUSION

        When empirical stock—adjustment models of manufacturers'
inventories of finished goods are estimated, there appear to be
two local minima in the sum of squared residuals functions. t
one local minimum, the estimated adjustment speed is typically

quite high; at the other, it is typically quite low. That, in
itself, means that we have precious little ability to pin down
the speed of adjustment empirically ——            certainly    far less than
indicated by the standard errors of the estimated coefficients.
        Furthermore, finding two sets of estimates that fit the data
almost equally well does not appear to be a quirk of this

particular application. Rather, it stems from a fundamental
identification problem that afflicts partial adjustment models of
all kinds. For example, it has become common to use the
                                                Page 14.



partial—adjustment specification in studies of the demand for

money, and the estimated equations typically have surprisingly
slow adjustment speeds.15 It may be that money demand equations
also have two local maxima.16
     Hence this paper stands as a generic warning to users of
stock adjustment models to use estimation methods that do not

mechanically select a particular local maximum. There appears to

be no better procedure than to search thoroughly over alternative
values of p and to select the maximum maximorum. If there is

more than one local maximum, standard errors estimated in the

usual way will certainly overstate the precision of the point
estimates, but by an amount that will remain unknown until some

basic econometric theory relevant to such problems is developed.

     In the specific context of explaining changes in
manufacturers' inventories of finished goods, the two—step
procedure employed by Maccini and Rossana (1984) seems to pick

out the solution with rapid adjustment (and high serial
correlation in the disturbances) whereas the solution with slow
adjustment (and little serial correlation) is more often the
global minimum. Thus I am afraid that Maccini and Rossana
(1984), despite admirable efforts and a number of'   interesting
innovations, have not succeeded in explaining why estimated
adjustment speeds in stock-adjustment models of inventory
behavior are "implausibly slow."

                          FOOTNOTES



*1 am indebted to Douglas Holtz—Eakin for extensive and superb
     research assistance, to the   National   Science Foundation and
     lfred P. Sloan for financial support, and to 3ohn Carlson,

     t4ichael Lovell, Louis t4accini, Ilngelo Melino, and Kenneth
     West for useful comments on an earlier draft.


1.   This problem has been emphasized by, e.g, Carlson and Wehrs
     (1974) and Feldstein and 1uerbach (1976).


2. Regarding demand for money c.f. Coldfeld (1976). Regarding
     consumer durables, c.f. Bernanke (1985). There are numerous
     other examples.


3. Of course, it is possible to question the validity of the
     stock adjustment model for inventories. See, for example,

     Blinder (forthcoming).


4. Lovell (1976) shows that an ,R(2) model can be derived in

     other ways, e.g., from adaptive expectations.


5. Betancourt and Kelejian (1981) pointed out the      possibility     of
                                                                F2



     multiple roots in a more general setting and argue that it
     can lead the standard Cochran—Orcutt procedure astray.


6.   Experiments with more complicated error structures bore
     little fruit.



7.   For a derivation and discussion, see Blinder (forthcoming).
8.   Had they been available, I would have preferred to use data
     that were not seasonally adjusted, since the production

     smoothing model presumably applies to seasonal fluctuations
     in sales. However, such data are not available.


9. Feldstein and Iuerbach (1976), for example, reported

     adjustment speeds between 5% and 7% per quarter for finished
     goods inventories in durable manufacturing. Lovell's (1961)
     original adjustment speed for finished goods was 18%.
     /uerbach and Green (1980) got much faster adjustment speeds

     (from 12% to 85% per quarter) using data on four two—digit
     industries and a model that treated finished goods and work

     in progress separately. Blanchard's (1983) study of' the
     divisions of U.S. auto firms found adjustment speeds ranging
     from 0% to 35% per month.



10. Maccini and Rossana (1984, note 20) observe that ordinary

     least squares regressions (which constrain p   = 0)   produce
                                                              F3



    slow estimated adjustment speeds.




ii.. Because   -
                   X=     +AW, if Ft÷i    does not change when X
    rises, then either Yt must rise or Wt+l must fall.


12. The earlier literature, summarized, e.g., by Irvine (1981a)
    found little evidence for a significant effect of interest

    costs on inventory holdings. However recent work by Irvine
    (l981a, 1981b) has detected such effects for retailers and
    merchant wholesalers, while Rubin (1980) and /lkhtar
    (l983)have found aggregate   inventories to be interest

    sensitive. Only Lieberman (1980), using micro data on a
    small sample of firms and a specially-constructed cost of
    capital variable, has found any evidence for interest

    sensitivity in manufacturing.


13. Full details are available on request.


14. For example, if we constrain p =1 (by estimating the equation
    in first-difference form), estimated adjustment speeds are

    extremely high; indeed, many are above 100%.


15. Goldfeld's (1973) exhaustive empirical survey began with a
     "conventional equation" whose adjustment speed is 28% per
                                                                F4



   quarter. He observed that "while this is not dramatically

   rapid, it is certainly more plausible than the 0—10 percent

   estimates that some writers have reported" (p. 583).



16. Hafer and Hem (1984) reported quarterly adjustment speeds
   even slower than Goldfeld's. But, mindful of Betancourt and

   Kelejian   's (1981 )   warning, they establish these to be the

   global   maxima.
