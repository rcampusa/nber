                                         ABSTRACT

Ever since Keynes’ famous quote about animal spirits, there has been an interest in linking firms’
expectations and actions. However, empirical evidence has been limited due to a lack of firm-
level panel data on expectations and outcomes. In this paper, we build such a dataset by
combining a unique survey of Japanese firms’ GDP forecasts with company accounting data for
25 years for over 1,000 large Japanese firms. We find four main results. First, firms’ GDP
forecasts are positively associated with their employment, investment, and output growth in the
subsequent year. Second, both optimistic and pessimistic forecast errors lower profitability.
Third, while over-optimistic forecasts lower measured productivity, over-pessimistic forecasts do
not tend to have an effect on productivity. Overall, these results are stronger for firms whose
performance is more sensitive to the state of macroeconomy. We show that a simple model of
firm input choice under uncertainty and costly adjustment can rationalize there results. Finally,
larger and more cyclically sensitive firms make more accurate forecasts, presumably reflecting a
higher return to accuracy for these firms. More productive, older, and bank-owned firms also
make more accurate forecasts, suggesting that forecasting ability is also linked to management
ability, experience, and governance. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of firms’
forecasting ability for micro and macro performance.

1       Introduction

There has been a longstanding interest in the importance of firm expectations for business outcomes.
For example, Keynes (1936) talked about animal spirits to highlight the importance of (potentially
irrational) expectations, while Tobin’s Q-theory of investment hinges on firms’ future expectations
of demand. More recently, almost all stochastic models of firm dynamics assume forward looking
agents who develop beliefs about future micro and macroeconomic conditions. Central – and still
outstanding – questions in this literature include: how much do these forecasts ultimately matter
for economic outcomes, under what circumstances, and to what extent does their level and accuracy
vary across firms?1
    This paper investigates these questions by matching data on firms’ forecasts of GDP growth
from the Japanese Annual Survey of Corporate Behavior (ASCB) to company accounting data.
This survey was run by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) within the Cabinet
Office over the period 1989–2015 and achieved a response rate of about 40% from all publicly
listed firms in Japan, generating a panel sample of around 1,000 firms. The survey asks firms for
a quantitative estimate of future GDP growth and appears to be of relatively high quality - for
example, the typical respondent was in management, planning or strategy departments.
    Analyzing these data, we find four main results. First, firms’ GDP forecasts are positively and
significantly associated with their subsequent input choices, such as investment and employment, as
well as sales growth, even after controlling for year and firm fixed effects. Second, forecast accuracy
appears to be tightly related to profitability. Prior year forecast accuracy has significant predictive
power for profits, even after controlling for time fixed effects, longer-run forecast accuracy, and firm
fixed effects. This is true both for over-optimistic firms (positive forecast errors) as well as over-
pessimistic ones (negative forecast errors). Third, measured productivity (TFPR) is negatively
affected by excessively optimistic forecasts, but excessively pessimistic forecasts do not seem to
affect productivity. For all of these results, the effects are strongest in firms whose performance
is more sensitive to the state of the business cycle. We provide a simple model of firm input
choice in the face of uncertainty and costly adjustment that rationalizes each of these findings –
larger forecast errors lead to a greater over/under accumulation of inputs and lower profitability,
    1
    See, for example, classic works including Nickell (1978), Abel and Blanchard (1986), Caballero (1997), Chirinko
(1993) or Dixit and Pindyck (1994).




                                                        2
and the interaction of pricing effects with costs of adjustment can generate asymmetric effects of
optimism/pessimism (e.g., positive/negative forecast errors) on measured productivity.
   Finally, we find significant variation in forecast accuracy across firms. Larger and more cyclically
sensitive firms have the most accurate forecasts, presumably because their returns from accuracy
are largest. Interestingly, we also see that more productive, older, and bank-owned firms tend to
be more accurate, suggesting that experience, management ability, and governance may also play
an important role in forecast accuracy. The results are similar when we measure firms’ forecast
accuracy alternatively by the distance to professionals’ forecasts.
   Our work connects to several branches of literature. First is the literature on macroeconomics
and firm forecasts. Macroeconomic theories have long shown that explicitly incorporating heteroge-
neous beliefs can help explain important features of economic dynamics (for example, Lucas 1972;
Mankiw and Reis 2002). More recently, David, Hopenhayn, and Venkateswaran (2016) provide and
estimate a model in which imperfect information at the firm-level lowers aggregate productivity
through resource misallocation. In addition, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that
forecasts of economic agents have a key role in driving business cycles (Beaudry and Portier 2004;
Schmitt- Grohé and Uribe 2012; Ilut and Schneider 2014).
   Second, this paper builds on a growing empirical literature investigating expectations forma-
tion. Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers (2003) analyze consumers’ inflation forecasts and find larger
disagreements among the general public compared to professional forecasters. Studies examining
the patterns of macroeconomic forecasts have found that they tend to be consistent with models
featuring information rigidity (Carroll 2003; Coibion and Gorodnichenko 2012, 2015). Coibion,
Gorodnichenko, and Kumar (2015) document substantial heterogeneity in firms’ macroeconomic
forecasts in a firm survey in New Zealand and find that firms with higher incentives to predict
(e.g. facing higher competition) are more accurate than others. Bachmann and Elstner (2015)
and Massenot and Pettinicchi (2018) use a German manufacturing survey that asked about pre-
dictions about own-firm performance and find that at most one third of firms systematically over-
or under-predict their performance, and that the degree of forecasting errors are smaller for larger
and older firms. Bloom et al. (2018) use US Census data and look at whether more productive and
better managed firms have improved forecast accuracy. Using the same firm survey in Japan as
in this study, Shiraki and Kaihatsu (2016) examine the heterogeneity of firms’ inflation forecasts,



                                                  3
and Koga and Kato (2017) document systematic pattern of optimism and pessimism of industry
demand forecasts by firms. We argue that our analysis of firms forecasts for a common important
outcome – GDP growth – is valuable for measuring forecasting ability across firms. Most datasets
collect forecast information about the manager’s own firm performance, which makes it hard to say
if, for example, larger firms are better at forecasting their own sales, or if their own sales are more
stable and so easier to forecast. Since we analyze the forecasts on a common object – GDP growth
– the second source of variation is not present.
    Third, some recent works provide evidence related to ours about the relationship between firms’
expectations and outcomes. Gennaioli, Ma, and Shleifer (2015) examine rationality of CFOs’ expec-
tations, and as a part of their exercises, they show that investment plans and realizations are well
explained by expectations of earning growth. In a related effort, Massenot and Pettinicchi (2018)
use a German survey data containing firms’ qualitative assessment of their business conditions
and show that over–optimistic firms subsequently report lower profits and that over–pessimistic
firms report higher profits. Overall, our study is unique in that we use a long panel data of firms’
quantitative GDP forecasts matched with their accounting data, which enables us to quantitatively
examine the effects of firms’ forecasts on their input choices and performance.
    Finally, our study is closely related to the literature on management and productivity. Growing
empirical evidence suggests that managers’ abilities and practices are important determinants of
firm productivity and other measures of performance (for example, Bertrand and Schoar 2003
and Bloom and Van Reenen 2007). In this paper, we view forecast ability as one component of
management ability.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out a simple theory of firm dynamics in the face
of uncertainty to guide our empirical investigation. Section 3 explains the data, section 4 discusses
our main results on firm forecasts and performance, and section 5 reports results on forecast quality
by firm characteristics. Section 6 provides concluding remarks.


2    The model

This section outlines a parsimonious model of firm input choice under uncertainty. The framework
provides sharp guidance on the relationship between firm expectations, i.e., optimism/pessimism,
input choices, and outcomes, e.g., measured TFP and profitability. We use these results to guide


                                                   4
our empirical investigations below. All derivations not explicitly shown are in the Appendix.


2.1      Predictions under imperfect information

A continuum of firms, indexed by i, produce differentiated goods using capital (Kit ) and labor (Nit )
according to a constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas production function:


                                                   Yit = Kitα Nit1−α .


Demand for each good takes a standard constant elasticity of substitution form


                                                    Qit = Aσit Pit−σ ,


where Ait represents a demand shifter, Pit is the price of the good, and σ>1 denotes the elasticity
of substitution across goods. Firm revenues are then given by


                                                Pit Yit = Ait Kitα̂1 N α̂2 ,


where
                                      σ−1                 σ−1               σ−1
                            α̂1 = α       , α̂2 = (1 − α)     , α̂1 + α̂2 =     .
                                       σ                   σ                 σ

   Input markets work as follows. The firm accumulates capital internally. In each period, the firm
can purchase capital at a price normalized to one and hires labor in a competitive labor market at
wage Wt . The firm produces, accrues revenues and sells its undepreciated capital at the end of the
period. Capital depreciates at rate δ. The firm discounts time at rate β.
   We assume, first, that the firm chooses capital and labor to maximize profits under imperfect
information regarding the fundamental Ait and that there is no further adjustment of inputs after
the realization of the fundamental. Specifically, the firm solves


                               max Eit [Πit ] = Eit [Ait ] Kitα̂1 Nitα̂2 − RKit − Wt Nit .                          (1)
                              Kit ,Nit


where R = 1 − β(1 − δ) is the user cost of capital.2 Fundamentals and expectations are distributed
   2
       Notice that the setup is equivalent to one with a rental market for capital where the rental rate is equal to R.

jointly log-normal. Without loss of generality, we normalize the unconditional mean of Ait to one.
   We can derive the following expressions for the optimal choices of capital and labor


                                       Kit = C1t Eit [Ait ]σ                                       (2)

                                       Nit = C2t Eit [Ait ]σ ,


where C1t and C2t are time varying terms that are common across firms, which reflect the wage
and cost of capital. Expression (2) shows that the firm’s input choices are monotonically increasing
in its expectations of fundamentals. Revenues and profits are given by


                        Pit Yit = C3t Ait Eit [Ait ]σ−1                                            (3)
                                                                 σ−1
                                                                                  
                          Πit = C3t Ait Eit [Ait ]σ−1 −              Eit [Ait ]σ       ,           (4)
                                                                  σ

where C3t is constant across firms. Expression (3) shows that, conditional on the realization of
fundamentals, the firm’s revenues are increasing in its expectations. We can use expression (4)
to prove that profits are decreasing in the absolute value of the forecast error. In other words,
profits are maximized where Eit [Ait ] = Ait and are declining in the difference between actual and
realized fundamentals. Finally, measured productivity is calculated as revenues divided by inputs
taken to the powers of their respective elasticities in production. Importantly, this is a measure of
revenue-based productivity, i.e., TFPR, rather than quantity-based productivity (TFPQ). We can
derive TFPR as
                                                                      −1
                                                         Eit [Ait ]
                                                     
                                   T F P Rit = C4t                          ,                      (5)
                                                           Ait

where C4t is again a constant across firms. In other words, TFPR varies inversely with the firm’s
forecast error, which is the term in parentheses (the ratio of expected fundamentals to actual).
Intuitively, when the firm is overly optimistic, it over-accumulates inputs relative to its true funda-
mental, reducing the marginal revenue productivity of those inputs. The opposite occurs when the
firm is overly pessimistic. We can summarize the key predictions of this simple framework as follows:


   Prediction 1: Input choices are increasing in the firm’s expectations.




                                                     6
    Prediction 2: Revenues are increasing in the firm’s expectations.


    Prediction 3: Profits are decreasing in the absolute value of the forecast error.


    Prediction 4: TFPR is decreasing in the forecast error.


2.2     Predictions with additional adjustment and disruption costs

Next, we extend the environment to allow the firm to further adjust its input choices after the
realization of the fundamental, but where these latter adjustments are subject to disruption costs.
These costs directly reduce output. To obtain clear analytical results, we focus on a special case
with only one input, which we call capital, but can alternatively be thought of as a composite input.
The key result from this extension is that TFPR is no longer monotonic in the forecast error for
pessimistic firms – while optimistic firms always have lower TFPR, because of the disruption cost,
the relationship is ambiguous for pessimistic firms.3
    There are two stages within each period. In the first, the firm forms expectations and chooses
a level of capital, Kit0 , paying only the explicit cost of new capital. In the second stage, the firm
observes the realization of the fundamental and can re-adjust its stock of capital. To perform
this additional adjustment, the firm must pay the explicit cost of any new capital as well as the
additional disruption costs. We assume that these costs take the form

                                                                      !2
                                                        ξ   Kit
                               Φ       Kit , Kit0       =          −1      Kit0 ,   ξ ∈ (0, ∞) ,
                                                          2   Kit0

where Kit denotes the final amount of capital used in production and ξ expresses the degree of the
disruption costs. Similar specifications are commonly used to describe settings where firms find it
harder to work efficiently with excessive or inadequate inputs.4
    3
      In the Appendix, we show that the logic of this case extends to a setting where we explicitly model labor
separately from capital. Specifically, we show that when capital and labor are chosen simultaneously and subject to
the same cost functions, labor is linear in capital, i.e, Nit = ηt Kit , where ηt is a function of period t wages, and can
be substituted out, leading to a production function that is linear in capital, which is the example here. For other
cases, we can no longer analytically characterize the sign of the derivative of TFPR with respect to the forecast error,
but simulations show generally similar patterns to the ones here.
    4
      One reason may be fixed costs of operations and diminishing returns to scale - see, for example, Bartelsman,
Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta (2013).




                                                                  7
   With these assumptions, the output of the firm is given by:

                                                                       
                                            Yit = Kit − Φ Kit , Kit0        .


   We set up and solve the firm’s problem in the Appendix. The firm’s final choice of capital is
given by
                                           Kit = C5t Aφit1 Eit [Ait ]σφ2 ,

where
                                                  σ                     σξ
                                         φ1 =          ,       φ2 =          .
                                                1 + σξ                1 + σξ

Capital now depends both on the firm’s initial expectations, as well as the realization of the funda-
mental, with weights determined by the exponents φ1 and φ2 . If the disruption cost, ξ, approaches
infinity, φ1 approaches zero and φ2 one, i.e., the firm will not adjust to the realization of the
shock and capital is only determined by initial expectations, as in the simpler model above. If ξ
approaches zero, the firm can respond fully to the true fundamental, e.g., φ2 goes to zero.
   We can then derive the following expression for TFPR:

                                                                                                 σ−1
                                         − σ (1−φ1 )−φ1     ξ − σ (1−φ1 )−2φ1 ξ − σ−1
                                                                                   σ
                               
                                                                                      (1−φ1 )     σ
        T F P Rit = C6t (1 +         ξ) Zit σ−1            − Zit σ−1         − Zit                      ,   (6)
                                                            2                 2

              Eit [Ait ]
where Zit ∝     Ait        captures the firm’s forecast error. Similar to equation (5), expression (6) shows
that even in this more complicated setting, TFPR depends only on the firm’s forecast error. We
can use expression (6) to prove that TFPR is strictly decreasing in the forecast error when Zit > 1,
i.e., when the firm is overly optimistic. However, there is a value of Zit , Ẑ < 1 such that TFPR is
increasing in Zit when Zit < Ẑ. Thus, the effect of expectational errors on TFPR is ambiguous for
pessimistic firms.
   Intuitively, there are two effects of forecast errors on TFPR: the first is the same as in the
simpler environment above – optimistic firms over-accumulate inputs relative to actual fundamen-
tals, reducing the measured productivity of those inputs. The opposite occurs for pessimistic firms,
which together lead to a universal negative relationship between TFPR and forecast errors. The
second effect comes from the disruption costs – the larger the firm’s forecast error, the greater
will be its within period adjustment and so the larger the disruption cost to output. These costs


                                                           8
will reduce measured TFPR, since output will be lower for the same level of inputs. This holds
whether the firm is optimistic or pessimistic. Notice that for optimistic firms, the two effects work
in the same direction, i.e., they both serve to reduce measured TFPR. Thus, for these firms, TFPR
is unambiguously decreasing in the forecast error. For pessimistic firms, the two effects work in
opposite directions – the first increases TFPR, the second reduces it. Thus, for these firms, the
relationship between TFPR and forecast error is ambiguous. We summarize this result in the fol-
lowing prediction:


    Prediction 5: When the firm can adjust its input choices upon realization of the fundamental
but subject to disruption costs, TFPR is decreasing in the forecast error for optimistic firms but
the effect is ambiguous for pessimistic firms.


3        Data

The survey data we use is the “Annual Survey of Corporate Behavior” (ASCB hereafter) conducted
by the Economic and Social Research Institute, in the Cabinet Office of Japan. We use data during
the period from 1989 to 2015, as individual firm identifies are available only after 1989. In each year,
the survey questionnaire was sent to all listed firms at the Tokyo and Nagoya Stock Exchange that
consist of approximately 2500 firms. Among them around 40% of firms respond to the survey (see
Appendix Figure A.1 for the number of responses in each year). The survey is conducted annually
between mid-December and mid-January. Respondents are required to answer business outlook
for GDP and industry demand, and their business plans regarding investment, employment, and
pricing. The items we use are forecasts of real GDP growth rate of Japan in the following fiscal
year that starts from April. The forecasts are made for three horizons: growth rate of upcoming
fiscal year; average growth rate over next three years; and average growth rate over next five years.
For example, the questions asked in December 2004 were phrased the following way5 :



             Please enter a figure up to one decimal place in each of the boxes below as your
         rough forecast of Japan’s nominal and real economic growth rates and the nominal and

       real growth rates of demand in your industry for FY 2005, the next 3 years (average of
       FY 2005-2007) and the next 5 years (average of FY 2005-2009).



The left hand side of Figure 1 shows the distribution of “firm i ’s forecasts for fiscal year t + 1 real
economic growth rate answered in fiscal year t" (denote by fi,t (t + 1) hereafter). The right hand
side of Figure 1 shows the distribution of the absolute value of forecast errors in each year, namely
|ei,t−1 (t)| ≡ |fi,t−1 (t) − g(t)|, where g(t) is the realized GDP growth rate of the year t.6
    A potential concern on this survey measure is whether the answers truly reflect the firms’
forecasts of future macro economic growth that are used for their decision making. We conduct
several checks for this issue. First, while the survey does not obtain positions of respondents, it
collects information on the respondent’s department since 2006. 66% of the respondents belong to
departments responsible for corporate planning and strategy, general management, and CEO office
(see Appendix Table A.1 for details). The rest of the answers are from departments of finance
(12%), general affairs (12 %) and IR and public relations (7%). Second, we find that annual sales
growth rates of the firms in our sample are strongly positively correlated with realized Japanese
GDP growth,7 suggesting that the sample of firms in this study, which consists of relatively larger
firms in Japan, would have incentive to obtain accurate GDP growth forecasts. Third, looking
at the autocorrelations of forecasts and forecast errors with and without firm fixed effects, it is
neither the case that the firms are repeating the same forecasts over and over, nor that they are
answering the current year GDP growth (for the results, see Appendix Table A.4). Fourth, on
average, the GDP forecasts provided by firms align well with that of professional forecasts overtime
(see Appendix Figure A.4). These observations suggest that most of the respondents are answering
some meaningful numbers that are on average following professionals’ forecasts. Even so, there
may be some outliers that answer unrealistic forecasts and affect our analysis. Therefore, in order
to reduce the effects of outliers, we exclude the observations with growth forecasts of more than
±3σ with ±3σ, where σ is the standard deviation, and also firms that answered the survey less
than three times within the sample period. These procedures drop about 8.8% of the original
observations. In the following section, we further test and confirm the firms’ input choices are
   6
    In this study, we assume that the survey respondents interpreted “the real economic growth rate” as the real
GDP growth rate.

    In the Appendix, Figure A.3 shows this by a binned scatter plot.

indeed significantly correlated with their macro forecasts even after controlling for firm fixed effects
and year fixed effects.
    As additional checks of the survey data, in Figure 2, we plot time-series of the mean of fi,t (t + 1)
and g(t) . The two lines roughly correspond in terms of ranges, implying that the forecasts for next
year tend to reflect the realization of the growth rates in the current year. Mean of the forecasts
tend to be correlated more with the contemporaneous GDP growth than with the targeted GDP
growth.8 In Figure 3, we show the yearly average of “absolute value of forecast errors in each year",
namely |ei,t−1 (t)| ≡ |fi,t−1 (t) − g(t)|. The same figure also plots annual daily stock volatility based
on TOPIX and the average of monthly Economic and Policy Uncertainty Index for Japan (see
Baker, Bloom, and Davis 2016) for each fiscal year.9 All time series are standardized by the year-
level observations. The three lines share the peaks around mid 1990s, 2000, and 2007, suggesting
the periods with larger forecast errors correspond to those with larger macro uncertainty.
    In addition to the forecasts on GDP growth rates, the survey asks about the firm’s forecasts of
its investment and employment growth over the next three years. The respondents were asked to
mark one of the bins with 5% intervals, for example, “5% to 10%”.10 We approximate continuous
variables of investment and employment growth forecasts by the middle values of these intervals.11
    We match the responses in the survey with other data at the firm level. We use the Develop-
ment Bank of Japan’s “Financial data of Listed Firms” (DBJ data hereafter) to capture financial
conditions of firms, and Nikkei Needs Financial Quest for information on stock price, firm age, and
ownership structure. In addition to firm data, we use “Consensus Forecasts” published by Consen-
sus Economics to compare firm forecasts with professional forecasts. In our baseline specification,
we use their forecasts made in December about Japan’s real GDP growth rate of the next calendar
year. As for actual values of Japan’s real GDP growth, we use the GDP estimates of FY 1990–FY
2015 from the Cabinet Office in June 2016. Appendix Table A.2 shows the basic sample statistics
for our main variables. To mitigate the effect of outliers, we winsorize 1 % of samples in each tail
in respect to investment, employment, and sales growth.
    It is possible that the response rates to the ASCB are correlated with certain firm characteristics.

     Figure A.5 in the Appendix shows this part of the questionnaire.
  11
     For the top codes, we use + or − 5% of the base value. For example, for investment growth forecast of “25% or
more”, we approximate the continuous version of forecast by 30%.




                                                       11
Indeed, a probit model estimation of response rates using the sample of DBJ data shows that firms
with higher TFP, larger employment size, and older firms were more likely to have responded to
the survey (see Appendix Table A.3 for the results). The magnitude of the response differences are
small - for example, a 10% increase in productivity or size induces a 2% and 0.2% increase in the
response rate respectively (on a 40% bases). Nevertheless, this sample selection might potentially
bias our results, so we also re-estimate our main equations by weighting samples by inverse of
response rates as robustness checks and find qualitatively the same results.
    On calculating firm-level TFP, we follow Syversson (2011) and assume Cobb-Douglas production
                                                                 L ln L − S K ln K − S M ln M ,

gross output measured by sales revenue, labor, capital, and other intermediate inputs of firm i in
year t, respectively.12 Cost shares are defined as the industry level to reduce the impact of firm-
level measurement error, as is standard in the literature. Cost share for each industry is obtained
from the “Japan Industrial Productivity Database 2015” (JIP database hereafter) published by
Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry. Gross output is defined as sales divided by
output industry-level deflator from JIP database. Labor input is calculated as a product of number
of workers and average hours worked in the industry. Capital is defined as tangible asset excluding
land, and computed using the perpetual inventory method. Data source for gross output and factors
is described in Appendix in detail.
    In order to measure cyclicality of firms with respect to Japanese macro economy, we estimate
the degree to which the firm’s stock prices react to a surprise in quarterly GDP announcements. In
each quarter, at pre-specified date and time, the Cabinet Office announces a quarterly real GDP
estimate for the preceding quarter for the first time. We estimate the following regression:

                                              3
                       !

             Ln            = βi LnGDPt +            φk LnGDPt−k + φq F Ct−1 + Fi + Fy + Fq + uit .                    (7)

after the announcement including the announcement date, respectively. LnGDPt is log of quarterly

      Investment hereafter refers to investment in physical assets such as machinery, vehicles, buildings, and structures.
Due to limited data availability, the data are on a non-consolidated basis. For calculating real investment and capital
stock, we first divide nominal gross investment by the corresponding price indices, and then apply the perpetual
inventory method to three types of capital stocks: buildings and structures; machinery and equipment; and vessels
and vehicles, following Hayashi and Inoue (1991). For price indices, we use the Bank of Japan’s Producer Price Index.


                                                           12
real GDP preliminary earliest announcement (seasonality unadjusted). The rest of the terms in
the equation control as much as possible for the pre-announcement information set that would
affect general trends of stock prices. This set includes log of GDP in preceding three quarters,
and the average of forecasts about GDP growth rate of the following calendar year by professional
forecasters made in the last 90 days before the announcement at t. The coefficient of the professional
forecast φq is allowed to differ by quarters due to the fact that the professional forecasts are always
made for the coming calendar year (so their forecast horizon varies by quarter). Firm fixed effects
Fi , fiscal year fixed effects Fy , and quarter fixed effects Fq (for q = 1, 2, 3) are also controlled.
Hence, βi is firm i specific response to the announced GDP, which is a measure of firm cyclicality
for our study.13 The estimated coefficients of βi is distributed around a mean of 0.12 with standard
deviation 0.14 (see Figure 4 for the resulting distribution), which means that, for example, the
average firm sees an 1.2% larger increase in stock prices when the announced quarterly GDP was
higher than the common expectation by 10%.


4     Forecasts and firm performance

In this section, we empirically investigate a possibility that firms’ GDP forecasts influence their
input choices and firm performance.


4.1     Firm input choices and sales

First, we estimate the following empirical equation:


                                            Yit = ρfi,t−1 (t) + γi + λt + ηit                                              (8)


where Yit is either growth of employment, investment, or sales of firm i in fiscal year t from fiscal
year t − 1 measured by the difference in logarithm.14 fi,t−1 (t) is the forecast of GDP growth rate
in fiscal year t answered by firm i in year t − 1. The growth rates are all measured in decimal
points. We include firm fixed effects (γi ) to control for unobserved time-invariant characteristics
    13
       For the possibility of outliers’ existence in the estimates of βi , we winsorized the variable by replacing observations
with the value of more than µ ± 3σ with µ ± 3σ, where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation, respectively.
    14
       Only 2% of the sample had 0 investment values, which were dropped when we estimate the equation for invest-
ment growth. As a robustness check, we employed an alternative measure of investment growth by adding value 1
(i.e. ln(investmentt + 1) − ln(investmentt−1 + 1)) and found that qualitative results were unchanged.



                                                              13
of the firms. We also control for realizations of macro economic shocks by controlling for year
fixed effects (λt ).15 Since some firms responded the survey sporadically within 25 years, making
the identification of within-effects harder, we further limit our samples to observations that have
non-missing GDP forecasts in the last two consecutive years (i.e. both fi,t−1 (t) and fi,t−2 (t − 1)
are observed).
    A primarily purpose of estimating equation (8) is to test the quality of the survey. Since the
survey targeted all stock listed firms, the firms in the sample are relatively large firms. Because of
this, there is a possibility that the respondent’s forecast does not reflect the forecast actually used
for the company’s decision making. If the firm’s survey response reflects a certain belief shared
among the firm’s organizers and actually used for its decision making, then we would expect to see
positive associations between in a firm’s forecasts and its input choice decisions such as investment
and employment.
    The specification of one-year lag between forecast and firm outcomes is considered to be rea-
sonable for the following reasons. First, Japanese firms commonly adjust their employment levels
by hiring fresh college graduates. Interviews and employment offers for hiring these workers in year
t are the most concentrated around the period from April to June of year t − 1 due to customs
of Japanese freshmen labor market. Similarly, it is natural to assume that firms need to make
arrangements (e.g. financing) at least in a year before for raising investment in year t.
    Panel A of Figure 5 graphically shows the relationship of equation (8) by binned scatterplots.
The horizontal axis shows residual values of fi,t−1 (t) after regressing on year fixed effects and firm
fixed effects. The residual values is grouped into equal-sized 15 bins, and for each bin, the vertical
axis shows the mean of residual values of Yit after regressing on year fixed effects and firm fixed
effects. The results suggest clear positive associations between firm’s reported forecasts and their
input choices and resulting outputs.
    Table 1 shows the estimates for the equation (8) by OLS. Columns (1) and (2) estimate the
equations for employment and investment growth including year fixed effect and firm fixed effects.
The estimated coefficients of forecast is positive and statistically significant. The estimates suggest
   15
     Interestingly, not controlling for year fixed effects result in the larger estimates of ρ for employment, investment,
and sales growth than the ones with baseline specification shown bellow. Assuming that forecasts and realizations
of aggregate shocks are positively correlated, this result is consistent with our second model in section 2.2 where
firms make costly readjustments of inputs after observing the realizations of the shocks. This point highlights the
importance of controlling for realizations of the shocks in order to separately examine the effect of forecasts.




                                                           14
that having 1 percent higher GDP growth rate forecast is associated with around 0.2 percentage
points higher employment growth rate and 2.5 percentage points higher investment growth rate on
average.16 Considering the fact that the average employment and investment growth rates in this
period were around -1.8 and -4.5 percentage points, respectively, the effects of forecast seems to
be economically large, presumably reflecting the importance of GDP growth for employment and
investment in large Japanese firms.
    Column (3) estimates the equation (8) for sales growth measured by changes in the log of
sales. The estimated coefficients suggest that having 1 percentage point higher GDP growth rate
forecast predicts an increase of sales growth rate by 0.3 percentage points. Overall, the results imply
that firm’s reported forecasts of GDP growth are significantly correlated with its input choice as
predicted by the baseline model (Prediction1). As a robustness check, we also estimate Table 1
controlling for the lagged forecast of GDP growth as this specification is more consistent with our
model, and confirm the results are qualitatively the same (for the results, see Table A.5 in the
Appendix).
    A natural conjecture is that macro forecasts affect firms’ realized inputs through affecting
their initial plans of employment and investment. Using the data on the firms’ forecasts of own
investment and employment, we find consistent evidence for this. Specifically, in columns (4) and
(5), we regress the firm’s forecast of investment or employment growth for the next three years on
its GDP growth forecast for the next year, which are all answered in year t − 1. The estimated
coefficients are large, positive, and significant at 1 percent level, implying that 1 percentage point
change in GDP growth rate forecast corresponds to 0.258 and 0.669 percentage points changes in
employment and investment growth forecasts. We then examine the relationship between forecasts
and realizations of employment and investment growths. In columns (6) and (7), the dependent
variables are realized growth of employment and investment over the corresponding three years
measured by the changes in log of employment and investment from year t − 1 to t + 2. The results
show that the input growth forecasts are highly significantly correlated with their realization even
after controlling for firm and year fixed effects.
  16
     If we look at R&D, we get similar significant results. For example, in a specification like column (4) with firm
fixed-effects the coefficient (and standard error) on the Ln(1+R&D) is 0.014 (0.060).




                                                         15
4.2    Profit and productivity

Next, we explore relationships between firms’ forecast errors and performance by estimating the
following equation:
                                     Vit = θ|ei,t−1 (t)| + γi + λt + ωit                             (9)

where Vit is either profit or TFP of firm i in year t. |ei,t−1 (t)| is the absolute value of firm i’s
GDP growth forecast error defined by ei,t−1 (t) = fi,t−1 (t) − gt , in which gt is the realized GDP
growth rate in fiscal year t. We control for time-invariant firm characteristics and realizations of
macro-level shocks by including firm fixed effect (γi ) and year fixed effect (λt ). As before, we limit
our samples to observations with non-missing forecasts in the last two consecutive years.
   Panel B of Figure 5 graphically illustrates the results by binned scatterplots. In the upper two
figures, the horizontal axis shows residual values of |ei,t−1 (t)| after regressing on year fixed effects
and firm fixed effects. As before, the residual values are grouped into equal-sized 15 bins, and
the vertical axis plots the mean of residual values of Vit in each bin, after regressing on year fixed
effects and firm fixed effects. The results show negative associations of forecast errors with profit
and productivity. In the lower two figures, we change only the horizontal axis to the raw value
of ei,t−1 (t) without taking absolute value nor residualizing this. The figures show higher values of
profit and TFP around the locations where the raw value of error is close to zero. In particular,
as for profit (left figure), the relationship appears to be symmetric around zero. As for TFP, the
positive forecast errors seem to be associated with lower TFP, while the relationship in the negative
side of forecast errors is less clear.
   Table 2 shows the estimates for regressions of the equation (9). Column (1) reports the results
for profit. The estimated coefficient is negative and statistically significant at 1 percent significance
level. The estimate implies sizable effect of forecast error on profit: having 1 percent higher or lower
GDP growth rate forecast error tends to lower the level of profit by around 8 percent. Column
(2) shows the result for TFP. The coefficient estimate of absolute forecast error is negative and
statistically significant at 5 percent level. The result implies that having 1 percent forecast error
is associated with 0.54 percent lower TFP. We also examined robustness against possible sampling
selection effects by estimating the equation (9) by weighting observations by inverse of response
rates and found similar results as in the main specification (Table A.6 in the Appendix show the



                                                     16
results).17 Also, we observe qualitatively the same results when we regress the growth rate of TFP
(i.e. the first difference in the logarithm of TFP) instead of the level of TFP on absolute forecast
errors (the estimated coefficient is -0.0037 and the standard error is 0.0012).
    Next, we estimate the same equation (9) by allowing the coefficients of under-forecast error
(|ei,t−1 (t)| · 1{ei,t−1 (t) < 0}) and over-forecast error (|ei,t−1 (t)| · 1{ei,t−1 (t) > 0}) to differ. Columns
(3) and (4) of Table 2 estimate such equations for profit and TFP. The results indicate that
both pessimistic and optimistic errors are negatively and significantly related with profit in the
subsequent year. For TFP, the coefficient estimate of optimistic errors is negative and significant,
while the coefficient of pessimistic error is estimated to be negative and insignificant.
    Our results on profit are consistent with Prediction 3 derived based on a standard dynamic
model of firms. That is, firms’ profit would be maximized when firms make investment with perfect
information about its future productivity. Profit declines because firms over- or under- invest by
mis-forecasting growth rate.
    The results on TFP are consistent with Prediction 5 obtained based on a model where firms
adjust input choices subject to disruption costs. In the model, this result arises in combination of
two effects. First, as depicted in the baseline model of section 2.1, if firms are over-optimistic and
expand, and thus lower prices, this will cut TFPR18 as in Prediction 4. The other mechanism is
“true TFP” effects, as described in the model of section 2.2, whereby having too few or too many
inputs reduces TFP through disruption costs. This would lead to lower TFP for both positive and
negative forecast errors.
    Another explanation is that over-optimistic firms excessively invest and hire, which reduces
capacity utilization (such as working hours and capital utilization), and so does measured TFP
because we do not observe capacity utilization at firm level. In reverse, over-pessimistic forecasts
lead to higher utilization and higher measured TFP. Therefore, this capacity utilization effect goes
to the same direction as the price effect. To examine this channel, we employ an alternative TFP
measure where labor input is measured by the total wage bill, which includes overtime pay, and
   17
       Additionally, we examined a different specification using a squared loss function (i.e. (ei,t−1 (t))2 ) in stead of
using the absolute loss function. The results are shown in the Table A.6 in the Appendix. We find that profit is
still negatively and significantly associated with the squared error, while the coefficient of squared error for TFP is
insignificantly estimated (possibly due to the offsetting two possible mechanisms for the influence of forecasts on TFP
discussed in the theory section).
    18
       We use industry level price deflators to calculate TFP, but not firm level prices. Thus, the measured TFP is
interpreted as TFPR.



                                                           17
thus would reflect total hours worked.19 The result for this TFP measure is shown in column (5).
The estimated coefficient of optimistic forecast errors is muted compared to that of column (4)
as expected, but it is still significant at 10 percent level. On the other hand, the coefficient of
pessimistic forecast errors is slightly lowered but remains insignificant.
    An alternative explanation of the results in the above is not that forecast errors shape perfor-
mance, but that both forecast errors and performance are correlated with some firm-level unobserv-
able like management quality. Firms with high-ability managers may be more capable of making
accurate forecasts, while such high-ability managers are more likely to employ high-performing
management practices. To explore this possibility, we add in the estimation equation a historical
average of firm’s forecast errors for five years preceding the year t − 1 (i.e. t − 2, ..., t − 6). Our
intuition behind this test is as follows. Manager’s ability and its effect on firm performance are
considered to persist for relatively long periods. Therefore, historical average of past forecast errors
are likely to be the more accurate proxy of firm’s managerial ability than the prior year forecast
error. Hence, if forecast errors proxy for managers’ ability, then its long-run effect of historical
average should dominate short-run effect. To test this hypothesis, columns (6) and (7) of Table 2
show the results of adding historical average of forecast errors. Overall, only the coefficients of 1
year lagged forecast errors are negative and significant. Finally, in columns (8) and (9), we also
estimate the specification where the forecast errors are those of the next year (|ei,t (t + 1)|) rather
than the current year (|ei,t−1 (t)|) and find insignificant results, ruling out basic reverse causality
mechanisms.20


4.3     Results by firm cyclicality and export status

Standard models of firms as in section 2 would also imply that firms whose performance are more
sensitive to the macro economy would be more responsive to their GDP growth rates forecasts.
We explore this possibility by dividing the sample into high and low cyclicality firms using the
firm cyclicality measure (as described in the data section). In addition, since firms selling in
foreign markets may be less influenced by Japanese GDP growth, we further divide the sample
   19
       A caution of this exercise is that the total wage bill also includes bonus payment, so this can be influenced by
firm performance.
    20
       We also examined similar specifications using forecast errors of 2–5 years ahead (|ei,t+1 (t + 2)|, |ei,t+2 (t + 3)|,
|ei,t+3 (t + 4)|, and, |ei,t+4 (t + 5)|) and find insignificant results.

into exporting and non-exporting firms.21 Table 3 shows the results. Columns (1), (4), (7), (10),
and (13) show the estimates for non-exporting firms with above median cyclicality index, the next
columns show the results for non-exporting firms with bellow median cyclicality index, and the
rest of the columns show the results for exporting firms. Overall, we find strong evidence that
non-exporting and more cyclical firms see a tighter correlation between GDP forecasts and firm
outcomes than the other firms.22


5        Forecast quality by firm characteristics

In this section, we identify the types of firms whose forecast errors tend to be more accurate.
Contrary to the analysis in the previous section where we employ within-firm variations in forecast
errors by including firm fixed effects, we focus on across-firm variations in firm characteristics in this
section. We examine determinants of firms’ forecasts quality that is measured in two alternative
ways.
     One measure of forecast quality is its difference from realization. As its natural counterpart
in data, we use |ei,t (t + 1)|, the absolute value of firm i’s forecast error made in year t defined
by |fi,t (t + 1) − gt+1 |, in which gt+1 is the realized GDP growth rate in fiscal year t + 1. Table 4
shows the results of regressing absolute forecast errors |ei,t (t + 1)| on various contemporaneous firm
characteristics in year t.23 All of the estimated equations include year fixed effects and 30 sector
fixed effects.
     First, the results show that the coefficients of the log of employment size are negative and
statistically significant, implying that firm size is a strong predictor of lower forecast errors. This
evidence is consistent with Bachmann and Elstner (2015) and Bloom et al. (2018) who find similar
evidence for firms’ forecasts and forecast uncertainty about own production performance in German
and US firm data.24 Secondly, we examine whether more productive firms make the more accurate
    21
      There is a question in ASCB asked only to exporting firms. We identify exporting companies based on whether
the firm answered this question.
   22
      We also test alternative specifications and find qualitatively similar results. One of these is to use only the
cyclicality measure to divide the sample by taking the stance that the cyclicality measure already takes into account
for the firm’s foreign operation that are less correlated with Japanese GDP growth. Another specification is to
include an interaction terms of cyclicality and forecasts. Table A.7 in the appendix shows these results, which are
qualitatively similar to the results in Table 3.
   23
      As a robustness check we also try restricting the sample to respondents in either management, strategy, or
planning departments, and the results remain qualitatively the same.
   24
      One important difference from their results is that in our case we are evaluating firms’ forecasts on a common



                                                         19
forecasts. Columns (2) and (3) show the results regressing forecast errors on the firm’s average
TFP in the preceding three years, measuring historical productivity of the firm. The estimated
coefficients of historical TFP are negative and statistically significant, and the coefficient remains
after controlling for the firm size. This result implies firm productivity is an important determinant
of forecast accuracy.
    Third, we test whether firm age matters for forecast errors. Columns (4) and (5) indicate that
older firms tend to make smaller absolute errors, even after controlling for the firm size. This result
suggest longer business experience may help firms make accurate forecasts.25 Fourth, we test the
hypothesis that firms whose performance are responsive to the macro economy have higher incentive
to predict accurately due to larger cost of misforecasting and make more accurate forecasts. The
results in columns (6) and (7) are consistent with this hypothesis: firms with higher cyclicality
index tend to make more accurate forecasts. The results are consistent with the evidence shown
by Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Kumar (2015) that firms with higher incentive to predict inflation
(due to facing higher competitions) make more accurate forecasts than the others.
    Finally, we examine differences in forecast accuracy by firms’ ownership types. We use the names
of the top 25 largest stock owners of each firm to construct the measures of stock share owned by
banks and financial institutions (“bank share”). As shown in columns (8) and (9), the coefficients
of bank share are negative and statistically significant. This result remains qualitatively the same
in the last column where we include all variables in one regression. These results suggest that
governance may also play an important role in forecast accuracy. Historically speaking, Japanese
banks tended to be heavily involved in management and business planing of their client firms in
the post-war period (Hoshi and Kashap 2001). Therefore, given that banks are likely to have
professional forecasters26 , it is not surprising that banks’ share predicts firms’ forecast accuracies.
    The other way to measure the forecast quality is to take its difference from the average forecasts
of professional forecasters. The idea behind construction of this measure is that professionals’
forecasts are likely to be the best available forecasts in each period of time.27 Hence, it should strip
outcome - GDP - rather than the firm’s own performance. Prior results may be because larger firms have more
predictable sales. In this sense, our result may be more striking since we find that larger firms are more accurate
even for the common outcome.
   25
      Another interpretation of this result is that firms that have ability make the more accurate forecasts tend to
survive longer.
   26
      Most of the professional forecasters in the Consensus Forecast are banks and financial institutions.
   27
      There is a large empirical literature on the accuracy of professional forecast. Among them, for example, Keane
and Runkle (1990) support the rationality of professional forecasts using panel data.


                                                        20
out unavoidable forecast errors - for example, due to disasters like the Tohoku earthquakes - and
try to measure firms deviations from best-practice forecasts.
     To start this analysis, we first examine whether professional forecasts from the Consensus Fore-
casts data are more accurate than firms’ forecast on average. Time-trends of professional forecasts’
mean and firm forecasts’ mean look quite similar (see Appendix Figure A.4). To see the differences,
we regressed forecasts and forecast errors on a dummy variable indicating professional forecasters
using dataset pooling both professional and firm forecasts.28 We find that professional forecasts
are on average marginally more optimistic and make smaller absolute error than firm forecasts,
although the difference is statistically insignificant. However, we find that squared forecast errors
(i.e. (ei,t (t + 1))2 ) are significantly smaller for professional forecasts. The results indicate that
professional forecasts tend to make fewer extreme forecast errors than firms.29
     Table 5 shows the results of regressing the absolute value of distance to the mean of professional
forecasts on firm characteristics. The results are similar to the ones before in terms of the signs
of the coefficients, although the levels of statistical significance vary when we control for firm size.
Overall, as before, firm size, productivity, age, cyclicality, and bank ownership share predict firms
having forecasts closer to professional forecasters. Interestingly, in column (8), if we split out the
non-bank share into family owned and non-family owned, we find family owned have significantly
larger gaps versus professional forecasters (point estimate and standard-errors are 0.336 and 0.130,
respectively).30 As another robustness check, we also tested an alternative specification using the
professional forecasts in November (rather than December in case firms had not examined the latest
professional forecasts), and the results are very similar (see Table A.8 in the Appendix).


6        Concluding remarks

Economists have long been interested in how firms’ expectations affect business outcomes. For
example, most recent stochastic models of firm dynamics assume forward looking firm managers.
Key questions are to what extent do these firms’ forecasts matter to their input choices and per-
formance and what are the factors that explain the heterogeneity of forecast accuracy across firms.
    28
      There were in total 635 professional forecasts in the observed period.
    29
      Distributions of the forecast errors by professionals and firms show that firms’ forecast errors have longer tails
(see Appendix Figure A.7 Panel B).
   30
      Family owned share is calculated as the total share owned by the top 25 shareholders whose family names are
the same as the firm’s representative.

However, micro-level evidence on these questions has been rarely provided due to lack of firm-level
panel data tracking both firms’ forecasts and performance.
   This paper matches panel data on firms’ forecasts of GDP growth from the Japanese Annual
Survey of Corporate Behavior (ASCB) to company accounting data to provide new evidence on
these questions. We find four main results. First, firms’ GDP forecasts are positively associated
with firms’ input choices such as investment, employment, and output. Second, forecast accuracy
is strongly related with profitability. A higher forecast error (of either sign) significantly predicts
lower profits. Third, we find that measured productivity is negatively associated with excessively
optimistic forecasts, while no effect was found for excessively pessimistic forecasts. For all of these
results, we find the strongest effects for firms whose performance is more sensitive to the state of
the business cycle. We show that a simple model of firm input choice under uncertainty and costly
adjustment can rationalize these results. Finally, we find that larger and more cyclically sensitive
firms have the most accurate forecasts, presumably because their returns from accuracy are largest.
We also see that more productive, older, and bank owned firms tend to be more accurate, suggesting
that experience, management ability, and governance may also play an important role in forecast
accuracy.

Notes: Panel A shows the relationship between forecasts and firms’ input choices by binned scatterplots. The x-axis shows residual
values of fi,t−1 (t) after regressing on year fixed effects and firm fixed effects. The residual value is grouped into equal-sized 15
bins, and for each bin, the y-axis plots the average of the residual value of Yi,t (either employment growth, investment growth, or
sales growth) after regressing it on year fixed effects and firm fixed effects. Panel B shows the relationship between forecast errors
and firm’s profit and TFP by binned scatterplots. In the upper figures, the x-axis shows residual values of |ei,t−1 (t)| after
regressing on year fixed effects and firm fixed effects. In the lower figures, the x-axis shows the raw value of ei,t−1 (t) without
residualizing this variable. In both upper and lower figures, the y-axis shows the average of the residual value of Vi,t (either profit
increase from t to t + 1 or TFP growth) for each equal-sized bins of x-axis. The number of bins is 15 for the upper figures and 30
for the lower figures. Sample is restricted to observations with non-missing GDP forecasts in the last two consecutive years (that
is, ft−1 (t) and ft−2 (t − 1) are observed).

       Notes: Standard errors are clustered at firm levels. The sample is divided into exporting and non-exporting firms and into high and low cyclicality firms. Cyclicality
       is measured by the index constructed based on stock price responses to quarterly GDP announcements as described in section 3. Firms in high cyclicality sample have
       cyclicality index above the median. fi,t−1 (t) is firm i’s forecast of GDP growth in fiscal year t answered in year t − 1. |ei,t−1 (t)| is a measure of forecast error defined by
       the absolute value of difference between firm’s forecast of GDP growth in fiscal year t answered in year t − 1 and the realized GDP growth in fiscal year t. D ln(Emp) =
       ln(employmentt ) – ln(employmentt−1 ), D ln(Inv) = ln(investmentt ) – ln(investmentt−1 ), and D ln(Sales) = ln(salest ) – ln(salest−1 ). Profit and TFP are the measures

       Notes: Standard errors are clustered at firm levels. TFP (past 3 years) is the average TFP of the firm in the preceding three years. Cyclicality is measured by the index
       constructed based on stock price responses to quarterly GDP announcements as described in section 3. Bank share is defined by the stock share owned banks and other
       financial institutions among the firm’s top 30 stock holders. |ei,t (t + 1)| is a measure of forecast error defined by the absolute value of difference between firm i’s forecast
       of GDP growth in fiscal year t + 1 answered in year t and the realized GDP growth in fiscal year t + 1. The unit of |ei,t (t + 1)| is percent (i.e. decimal points multiplied
       by 100).

        Notes: Standard errors are clustered at firm levels. TFP (past 3 years) is the average TFP of the firm in the preceding three years. Bank share is defined by the stock
        share owned banks and other financial institutions among the firm’s top 30 stock holders. |ept (t + 1)| is a measure of forecast error defined by the absolute value of
        difference between firm i’s forecast for GDP growth in fiscal year t + 1 answered in the December of year t and the average forecasts by professionals in the December of
        year t. The unit of |epi,t (t + 1)|is percent (i.e. decimal points multiplied by 100).

   Predictions 1, 2 and 4 are immediate. Turning to prediction 3, the first derivative of expression (4) can
be shown to be positive if Eit [Ait ] < Ait and otherwise is negative. Then, since the profit function is globally
concave in the expectation of Ait , it is maximized at Eit [Ait ] = Ait . This proves prediction 3.

Predictions with additional adjustment and disruption costs. We work with a more general version
of the framework than in the text that explicitly includes both capital and labor. We then specialize to the case
described in the text to prove prediction 5. This case is always nested where α = 1. For purposes of tractability,
we assume that the disruption costs due to labor adjustments are denominated in labor units with the same




                                                                       34
cost parameter, ξ. With these assumptions, the output of the firm is given by:
                                                                                                    

In this setup, the firm makes a one-time payment to hire incremental labor so the cost of labor, Wt should
interpreted as the present discounted value of wages. A related setup is in David and Venkateswaran (2017).

Second stage. In the second stage of time t, the firm observes the realization of the fundamental and chooses
inputs for production, Kit and Nit , taking as given its initial choices, Kit0 and Nit0 in the first stage of period t.
The firm’s second stage problem takes the form:

In this setup, the firm makes a one-time payment to hire incremental labor so the cost of labor Wt should be

where, as in the text, R = 1 − β (1 − δ).
   To simplify the problem, we prove that there exists an ηt such that Nit = ηt Kit and Nit0 = ηt Kit0 , i.e., the
labor choice is proportional to the the capital choice. The factor of proportionality is common across firms
within a period, but is potentially time-varying.
   Under this conjecture, we can rewrite the firm’s problem in (10) as

The first order condition gives:
                                                                                       !!

Now, substitute the conjecture that Nit = ηt Kit and Nit0 = ηt Kit0 into the labor first order condition from the
original problem and rearrange to get:
                                                                                            !!

   If ηt satisfies:
                                                 1       1−α          1−α 1

then (11) is identical to (12), so that the solution under our conjecture satisfies the optimality condition for

                                                                       35
labor from the original problem. It is straightforward to verify that the capital choice under our conjecture also
satisfies the optimality condition for capital from the original problem.
    To obtain an analytic expression for the choice of Kit , we log-linearize the first order condition (11) around
the non-stochastic steady state, where Kit = Kit0 = K̄ solves
                                                           σ − 1 (1−α) σ−1 − 1

                                                     q
                                 σ + φ1 (σ − 1) +      σ 2 + 2φ21 (σ 2 − σ) + φ21 (σ − 1)2 − σ 2 (1 − φ1 )2
                  Z2φ1       =                                                                                   ,
                                                                     σ (1 − φ1 )

where the expression in the square root is non-negative.
   The properties of the roots depend on φ1 , which can be greater or less than one. Assume first that φ1 > 1.
Then Z2φ1 is negative and we can ignore it. We can prove Z1φ1 < 1:

           Z1φ1   <      1
                                           q
                  ⇒ σ + φ1 (σ − 1) −           σ 2 + 2φ21 (σ 2 − σ) + φ21 (σ − 1)2 − σ 2 (1 − φ1 )2 > σ (1 − φ1 ) ,

and rearranging, squaring both sides and simplifying shows that this condition holds whenever φ1 > 1, which
was our original assumption. Since φ1 > 1, this also implies Z1 < 1.
   Now assume φ1 < 1. Then Z2 is positive, but it is very large, e.g., it is greater than
                                                                                    1
                                                   1     σ − 1 φ1
                                                                             
                                                                                   φ1
                                                       +
                                                1 − φ1     σ 1 − φ1
This clearly goes to infinity as φ1 goes to one from below. Ignoring the second term, Z2 is greater than
                                                                 1            n
                                                      1                   1
                                                                       
                                                                φ1
                                                                     = 1+
                                                   1 − φ1                 n

where n = − φ11 . This term approaches e ≈ 2.72 as φ1 goes to zero, so the firm would have to be more than
172% overoptimistic, which we will assume is outside the relevant range. Thus, Z2 is safely ignored. Following
the same steps as above, we can show Z1 < 1 whenever φ1 < 1.
    Finally, evaluating the quadratic at Zit = 1 shows it is strictly negative, (equal to −σφ1 ). So we know the
derivative is negative when Zit > 1 and when Zit > Z1 and is positive for Zit < Z1 . This proves prediction 5.
    Similar logic should go through in the general case when α 6= 1; deriving the quadratic equation, (20), did
not depend on this assumption.

Notes on TFP calculation
    Output is measured by the firm’s sales from DBJ data divided by the industry-level output deflator from JIP
database. Labor input is measured by the number of workers from DBJ data multiplied by the industry-level
average hours worked from JIP database. As for capital input measure, we use the book value of tangible asset
excluding land from DBJ data deflated by corresponding item-level deflator from Corporate Goods Price Index
of the Bank of Japan. Intermediary input cost is measured by the sum of total production cost and cost of


                                                                     40
sales and general management subtracting wages and depreciation. We use industry-level intermediate goods
deflator from JIP database to deflate the intermediary input cost. As for the cost share parameters, we use
industry-level labor cost share, capital input share, and intermediate input shares from JIP database.

  Notes: Standard errors are clustered at firm levels. In columns (1) and (2), the regressions weigh responses by inverse of estimated
  firm’s response probability. We estimate the probability of survey response by estimating a probit model using information of
  DBJ data on log of sales, employment, and capital, firm age, a dummy of non-missing information on firm age, sector fixed
  effects, and year fixe effects. The firm’s response probability is estimated as an average of the predicted response probability
  within each firm. In columns (3) and (4), (et−1 (t))2 is a measure of forecast error defined by the square of difference between
  firm’s forecast of GDP growth in fiscal year t answered in year t − 1 and the realized GDP growth in fiscal year t. Sample is
  restricted to observations with non-missing GDP forecasts in the last two consecutive years (that is, ft−1 (t) and ft−2 (t − 1) are
  observed).
