              TAX EXPORTING, FEDERAL DEDUCTIBILITY.
                     AND STATE TAX STRUCTURE



                            ABSTRACT


     This paper studies the interaction between the federal and

state tax systems during the 1980s and in particular considers

how the Tax Reform Act of 1986 affected state tax structure.

Using a panel data set on state governments over a nine year
period, I estimate tax share equations for six categories of

taxes.
     I find that the state personal income tax is sensitive to

changes in its tax price but find   a   much smaller sensitivity to

changes in tax prices for the general sales tax.     I then consider

various reasons for why the sales tax does not exhibit a

sensitivity to changes in tax price and consider the implications
of these results for policy makers.

     A by-product of the debate leading up to the Tax Reform Act of 1986

(TRA86) was       a   sharpened   focus on the interrelationshipbetween taxation at the

federal level and at the state and local level.                               The particular issue

sharpening the focus was the proposed elimination of federal deductibility for

all state and local taxes.                       Governors expressed grave concern over             the

possibility that ending federal deductibility would create pressure on state

officials        to    lower     taxes.          One   could hear      regular forecasts     of    dire

consequences for state              and municipal programs as taxes would have                    to be

lowered.          After    considerable political              maneuvering,     the   deduction     was

eliminated only for general sales taxes                      when the 1986 tax law was        finally

enacted.        Economists and many state officials predicted a decteased reliance

on the general         sales    tax as a result.

     To the surprise of many analysts, it appears that states have not reduced

their reliance on the sales tax; the tax continues to be an important source

of revenue for         states    and in many states is actually increasing in importance.

Why were the predictions so far from the mark?                        Were the economists and their

models wrong?          Or have state legislators and governors responded incorrectly

to the new economic environment resulting from TRA86?

     On a broader level, how do state governments alter state tax policy when

federal tax policy changes?                 How should these          governments respond?   In this

paper,     I   review economic      models of state tax structure             which incorporate the

exporting of state taxes                  both    to   the   federal government through federal

deductibility and to non-residents through non-resident consumption, labor

supply,        and business activity in the state.                    Economic models of state tax

structure can be helpful on two levels.                      First,    they can provide predictions

for how stare tax policy will change in response ro changes in federal tax

policy.         These predictions may be helpful to stare                    policy makers as they


                                                        1
adjust their tax structure        to maintain balanced budgets in response to changes

in federal tax policy.         The predictions may also be useful to federal policy

makets.        Changes in federal tax policy clearly have effects on state and local

governments; empirical         work such as        is     presented in this paper helps          to

quantify the magnitudes of these              effects.      In effect,   empirical   results may

provide a benchmark estimate of how large a response in tax structure                        may be

expected as a result of changes in the economic environment facing the state.

Second, models can provide guidelines for how state policy makers would

respond to changes in federal tax policy if they maximized the welfare of

residents of their states.            The guidelines suggest how state officials should

take into account the degree of exporting of state taxes, the distribution of

income        within a state and other factors as they attempt to construct an

optimal mix of taxes for their own state.

       After reviewing models,         I then analyze data on state tax structure for

fiscal    yeats 19g0 through      l9B    to answer some of the questions posed above.

Specifically, I investigate how state tax structures respond to changes in

federal tax policy and other economic variables.                 I   then consider the response

of   the sales tax in mote detail.            Is the sales tax different from other taxes?

Can we extrapolate from the experience of ending deductibility for this tax to

what we would expect if deductibility were eliminated for all taxes?                           This

last question is of particular importance as the federal government looks for

ways     to    reduce the   federal    deficit during a period when many states ate

experiencing severe fiscal distress.

                                        II.    Background

       Economists hsve long recognized that the ability to export taxes                      to out

of state taxpayers should sffect the choice of tax instruments.                      For example,

Timothy Hogan        and Robert Shelton          (1973)    present a model where         a    local

government attempts to maximize tax collections from out of state taxpayers.


                                                  2
Similarly, Richard Arnotr and Ronald Grieson (1981) present a model of optimal

tax policy when interatate tax exporting is possible.                   Neithet of these papers

considers the opportunities for exporting taxes                   to    the federal          government

through federal tax deductibility1. With the proposals                    in Ttemsuty          I   and II

to    eliminate    the   federal      deduction for       state   and    local         tax     payments,

economists shifted their           attention to measuring how altering deductibility

would     affect   atate    and     local   government       spending     and         choice       of   tmx

instruments2.

      Based on the research described above,                  most     economists predicted a

decreasing reliance on the general sales tax after TRA86 as this was the only

tax Lot which deductibility was removed.                  In Metcalf     (1990)   ,    I   discusa the

predictions by economists and note that                  there does not appear to be any

perceptible movement away from the use of sales taxation.                       Paul Courant and

Edward Ctamlich (1990) also note this in a review of the impact of TR.A86 on

state and local fiscsl behavior.

      Thete are two competing theories for why the sales tax share did not fall

as expected.       The first theory follows from the average tex price literature

of the    1980s   and will be termed the "incomplete deductibility" theory.3                            The

aecond theoty follows from a theory of tax distribution and political interesç

groups.    In the next     section,    I describe those two models in some detail.

      Before turning to a closer consideration of the two models, it may be

useful to consider how the collection of revenues                      at the state level has

changed over the past decade.           Figures    1   and 2 show the relative importance of

the   Live major tax instruments that ate used by state                    governments for the

years 1978 through       l988.        The graphs       show that personal income taxes and

general    sales taxes     became more important as sources of revenue over this

petiod.    This teflects     a longer term trend in which these sources of revenue

became more important as selective sales and corporate income tax collections
declined in importance.          In addition,     Figute    1    illustrates the importance of

the Tax Reform Act of l98i on personal income                   tax collections in fiscal yeat

1987.      Theta is a one time         increase        of over 1% of personal income tax

collections due to the windfall affect                   with a corresponding .4% drop in

general sales tax collections as a fraction                of the total.       In constructing a

theory of how TRA86 affected state          tax structure,         it is important to keep in

mind the trend toward greater use of personal income and general sales taxes

during the 1980a.        That general sales tax collections increased as a fraction

of taxes and currant charges after Tax Reform may perhaps ha explained quite

simply by the explanation that they would have grown even faster in the

absence of reform.

                     III.    A Model of the     Choice    of State Tax Rates

        In this   section,    I describe a basic tax price model of the choice of

state tax rates which takes into account exporting both to the                           federal

government through deductibility and to non-residents who either work or make

purchases within the state.5          The model posits a state government maximizing

the utility       of a      representative individual (resident).                There   is   also

consumption and labor supply by non-resident individuals about whom the state

is not concerned (except for their tax revenue potential)                  .   Individuals take
prices as given and maximize utility over labor supply,                    a taxable commodity

and a non-taxable commodity.          The government maximizes the indirect utility

function of the resident          subject to       a     government budget constraint that

expenditures not exceed taxes           collected from residents and non-residenta.

Choice variables for the government are the two tax rates, one on wage income

and the other a sales tax rate on the taxable commodity.

        A key concept in      this model is that        of a "tax price".       An example will

illustrate the concept.          Consider a taxpayer in a 50%              federal   tax bracket

living in    a   state with a state income tax.           Let us assume that she pays $1000
in state personal income taxes.              She can then take this $1000 in state taxes

as a deduction on her federal return.             The $1000 deduction reduces her federal

tax liability by $500 (.50 x $1000).              Thus her   rg.fl   state tax liability after

taking federal deductibility into account is only $500.                   Put differently, the

price of a dollar of state taxes             is one minus her federal marginal tax rate

and in this example equals so.6

        The model provides the nut surprising result that increasing the federal

tax price for the state sales (income)                tax induces the state to decrease

(increase)       its    sales   tax rate and inctease (decrease) its income tax tate.

The result is not surprising assuming that state policy makers are attempting

to maximize the welfare of residents. Whether policy makers maximize resident

welfare or not,          comments by many state       lawmakers and governors during the

debate leading up to TRA86 suggested that they well understood the sensitivity

of tax structure to changes in tax prices.              This inverse relationship between

tax price and tax share provides the                 formal motivation for the tax price

literature of the mid l980s in which researchers estimated demand equations

for state and local tax shares as functions of the tax price of these state

and local level taxes.

        Next,   I consider the effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 on the choice

of tax rates.          There were two major changes in TRAS6 which affected tax prices

for state and local taxes: fitst, marginal tax rates were lowered for most tax

payers.      This rate reduction had the effect of reducing the value              of federal

deductions, including deductions for state and local taxes.

        Above,    I    considered an example of a taxpayer in a 50%               federal tax

bracket.        Now consider a tax reform which reduces her federal marginal tax

tate    to 28%.        She   still   pays $1000 in state   income taxes and still takes a

$1000    deduction on her federal return.            But now the reduction in her federal

tax liability is only $280 (.28 x $1000)               and her net state tax liability is



                                                 5
now $720.       her tax price for state income tmxes has increased from .50 to            .72.


     Lower marginal tax rates           redoce the value of all deductions; in our

example,     the   tax price of a dollar of state taxes has been increased.               But

TRA86    also   eliminated the deduction for the sales tax (thereby            increasing its

tax price to 1:      A dollar of    sales     tax now costs      the taxpayer a full dollar).


However,     for most taxpayers,    the general sales tax deduction is generated from

tables based on data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (Feenberg                 and Rosen

(1986)     describe the IRS methodology in more detail).              While there is no hard

evidence    on this matter,   there   is widespread belief among tax experts that rhe

tables     significantly underestimate the general sales tax liability actually

incurred by individuals7.

        If there is incomplete deductibility of sales taxes prior to 1986,                then

it is no longer        clear that the sales tax rate will fall after 198g.                    The

intuition is straightforward.          Take a polar case where the sales tax tables

essentially give no deduction fur state sales taxes.                    Then the federal tax

price for state sales taxes equals une prior to and after Tax Reform and the

only price change is an increase in the tax price for income taxes as federal

marginal tax rates fall.8

        The interaction between exporting            to    the    federal government   through

deductibility and to non-residents is slightly more complicated.                    Analyzing

the two polar exporting cases provides the clearest insight.                  If there   is   no

exporting of taxes at all (either of the sales tax or the personal income tax)

then the sales tax rate can increase             or decrease      depending on the degree of

incomplete deductibility.          However,    in the case of complete exporting of the

sales tax and no exporting of the incoae                  tax,   then the sales tax rate is

unambiguously reduced after TRABS.              This is perhaps surprising as one might

have imagined that the increase in the income tax price would have induced a

shifting away free the income tax and toward the sales tax.                 The intuition for



                                                 g
the   result is quite     straightforward however.        In the     case     of complete

exporting, the state acts as a monopolist in setting           its   sales tax rate to

maximize tax revenue from non-residents.        An increase in the gross price of

the taxable commodity to non-residents requires      an offsetting decrease in           the


sales tax rate to maintain the gross price at its revenue maximizing level.

The degree to which the income tax rate falls relative to the sales tax rate

depends on several factors.      In particular, it   falls    by a greater amount        the


larger the sales tax base is relative to the income           tax base and the larger

labor supply elasticities are relative to demand elasticities.

      Summarizing,   it is quite possible that sales tax rates might increase

after TRA8G.   In addition,   states with a high degree   of sales tax exporting may

be    jg   likely to increase the sales tax rate.         This runs counter to the

intuition of many economists who would have expected exporting to act as a

"safety valve" for states.     However, this model suggests      that states must take

care not to jeopardize their non-resident revenues.

      The virtue of the model sketohed out shove is that it integrates for the

first time the two types of exporting of state snd local taxes.               Many of the

results    are not   surprising upon a hit of reflection,            particularly that

incomplete deductibility of sales taxes at the federal level might in fact

have reduced substantially the degree to which the price for general sales

taxes increased after TRAB6.       However the complicated interaction between the

two types of exporting has not been well understood nor has it been adequately

treated in the literature.

      The model described above is an "average"       tax price aodel as it models

state tax structure      policy as a function    of one particular tax price, the

average tax price of all residents in the            state.      It is       a variant    on

"decisive" voter models of tax policy which identify a particular resident

(median,   typically).   An alternative   model recognizes    that   state    tax policies
reflect a balancing of interests among different income groups.                  Robert Inman

(1989) provides an explanation of the increase in the reliance on sales tsxes

since TRA86 based on such s model.              The elimination of federal deductibility

of sny tax    increases   the tax burden on weslthier taxpayers more since this

group is more likely to itemize deductions on their federal return.                  Assuming

that state tax structure was constructed to achieve a distributional balance

among different income groups prior to TRA86, states will wish to shift taxes

from wealthier tax payers to lower income             tax payers after TRA86.        Assuming

that sales taxes fall more heavily on the poor and income taxes more heavily

on the   tich,   increasing the      share of taxes coming from sales taxes and

decreasing the share from income taxes             will help regain the disttibutionsl

balance upset by TRA86.9        In the empirical work that follows,          I   will try and

shed some light on which          of these competing theories best explains the

continued importance of state sales taxes.

               IV.   Measurinc Tax Prices for State and Local Taxes

     As noted shove,      if   taxpayers   itemize their deductions on their federal

income tax and take state (and local) rsxes as a deduction, the net cost of a

dollar of the state tax is reduced from              1   to l-r, where   r   is the federal

marginal tax rate on income for the taxpayer.              Measuring the sppropriste tax

rate is not      straightforward however.           For example,   additional state       tax

deductions could reduce taxable income sufficiently that the taxpayer is

pushed into a lower tax bracket.           In this case,    the mmrginal tax rate is not

the rate     that she faced prior          to    an increase in state        tax   liability.

Alternatively, s taxpayer may not have sufficient deductions to make it worth

her while to itemize on her return.             In this case her tax price would appear

to be one.    Mowever,    the additional state        taxes might be sufficient to make

itemizing worthwhile in which case the tax price is less than one.                  These two

examples illustrate the important sources of feedback from tax collections to
determination of the tax prices.                 In the presence of this feedback, ordinary

least squares        estimates of tax price coefficients in tax share regressions

will be biased.           I will use an instrumental variable approach to control for

this simultaneity. These examples also highlight the advantages of using the

NBER TAXSIM tax calculator to compute individual tax prices.                          TAXSIM is a set

of Fortran routines          which uses detailed data from the                     IRS Individual Tax

Model1° to compute           the federal tax liability for individual tax returns.

TAXSIM      can be programmed to compute marginal tax rates by computing the
additional        tax liability on an individual's tax return resulting from an

additional dollar of income.                For the purposes of this study, I impute to each

return an additional dollar of state tax deductions (for any given tax) and

measure the reduction         in federal and state tax liability. The tax price
                                                                                (P1)

equals one minus the reduction in tax liability.                            The resulting tax price

measure for returns within a state can be averaged to estimate a state wide

average marginal tax price for particular taxes.
        There are three       additional significant advantagea to using TAXSIM to

measure tax prices.          First,                                   along
                                        state tax codes are programmed into TAXSIM

with the federal tax code. While the discussion in section III assumed that
only    state taxes were deducted from federal taxes,                       in actuality, 12 states

allow a deduction for federal taxes on the incoae tax11.                            If federal income

taxes    can be deducted at the state level,                    then the taxprice for an itemizer

becomes
                                                        +   r   (1-v F)
(1)                            F'   —   1   -
                                                    )
                                                                          • 1-v*
where r      is   the appropriate federal marginal tax rate and r                     the appropriate
state    tax rate.     Again, TAXSIM would simply look at the change in the overall

tax liability (r      )to determine the tax price.
        A   second advantage of using TAXSIM is that I can construct different tax
prices      for different     state taxes.        Tax prices may differ because of either


                                                    9
changes in federal deductibility rules (e.g. the less of deductibility for the

general sales    tax in 1986)     or differences in state         deductibility.    With

respect to the lstter, some states allow deductibility of state              income taxes

but not state general sales taxes and vice versa.12

     A final advantage     of the TAXSIM program is that I can construct tax

prices for different taxpayers in the income distribution for each state.             One

of the recurring controversies in the tax price literature is over whose tax

price matters.    Is it the Median Voter? The Mean Voter? The Rich Voter?             One

problem with the median voter approach is that the taxpayer with median income

doesn't typically itemize at the federal level.          In this    case,    altering the

deductibility rules should have no impact on state tax structure.               Feldstein

and Metcalf (1987)      argued that the mean voter is more appropriate due to

possibilities of log rolling and coalition formation.          I   have used TAXSIM to

construct a panel of tax prices for the various states for different points

along the income dfstribution.          In the regression work, I use tax price

measures for different taxpayers in various income groups to determine whose

tax price matters in the final analysis.13

                   V.   An Empirical Analysis    g      State Level

     In this     section I consider three questions:         1)    How are tax shares

affected by changes in tax prices?       2)     Do changes in tax prices affect sales

tax rates and the sales tax base differently? 3)          Whose tax price matters?

     Table 1 gives summary information on the data used in the analysis.              The

first six rows in table 1 show information on different taxes as fractions of

personal income across      the   48   continental states   from fiscal years        1980

through 1988.14     As noted above, personal income taxes and general males tax

revenue are the two biggest tax revenue sources,            followed by charges and

licenses and selective males      tax revenue.       The next two variables are tax

prices for state personal income taxem end general males            taxes.     These were



                                           10
      constructed from TAXSIM as described above and ere net of federal end state

      taxes.     Across   the sample,     the   correlation barween these two tax prices is

      0,57.15 The mean price for both is slightly more than 91, meaning that a $100

      increase    in state sales      tax collections has a coat net of taxes to taxpayers

      on average of    $91.

              In addition to the tax price variables, I include             other demographic

      variables in the regressions.             As a measure of the degree of exporting of

      stare general sales taxes, I use the Sales Activity Index as computed by

            Marketing Management Mazazine.          This index measures the frattion of sales

      within a state relative to the aggregate             sales nationally and scales this

      fraction by the fraction of national population within a state.             Hence a high

      measure of the index indicates            a high degree of spending within the state

      relative to the population of the state.               I   use this variable to measure

      non-resident consumption within the state.16           In addition to these variables   I


      include an indicator variable equaling one if the state collects taxes from a

      severance tax, age demographic variables (fraction of population between ages

      18 and 44 and fraction aged 65 and over),              and changes in the unemployment

      rate.     The severance    tax variable measures the degree to which the state can

      rely on severance tax collections. To the extent that residents perceive that

      severance taxes are exported to non-residents, this should lead to a reduced

II!
      reliance    on other taxes.      Residents between ages 18 and 44 and older than 65

      are likely to have a high consumption to income ratio and should prefer lower

      reliance on sales       taxation.      Shocks to the state's economy (as measured by

      changes in the unemployment rate)             will result in a fall in tax collections

      whether collections fall faster or slower than income is not clear a priori.

      I add a trend variable and fixed effects in the share regressions and dummies

      for     census   regions   in    the   rare    and base    regressions to   control   for

      macroeconomic effects and regional specific differences in reliance on sales

taxes.17

        Table 2 reports regression results           for six categories of taxes as a

fraction of personal income.            The first two regressions accord with theory

with respect to the tax prices.            In the personal income regression, the income

tax price effect is negative and strongly significant while the                           sales tax

effect is positive and significant. In the general sales tax regression, the

sales tax price effect is negative;            however the income tax price effect is

also     negative.       Note     though    rhat    neither   estimate        is     statistically

significant.        Moreover, the price effect in the sales tax regression is

economically insignificant. Eliminating the federal deduction for either the

state personal income or general sales tax would increase either tax price by

roughly    g   percentage points (from 92 to 100)      .   An eight   point        increase     in the

sales tax price would imply a drop in sales tax collections of .%.                            An eight

point    increase   in the   income   tax price, on the other hand, would imply a drop

in personal income tax collections of 34%.                 This very different response

merits further consideration; one possible explanation is that the use of the

sales tax tables by most itemizers blunts the marginal effect to a great

extent.

        The average export effect for five out of six regressions is positive

(the exception being selective sales taxes);               moreover it is statistically

significant in three of the six regressions. The age group between 18 and 44

in general would like to see less              taxes collected (except              for the other

category) with the point estimate highest for the two most visible taxes                                 -


personal       income and general     sales.    The elderly on the        other hand prefer

general and selective sales            taxes   along with charges and               licenses,      and

corporate taxes to personal income and other taxes.                    These results don't

accord with priors;      I   would have expected both these groups to prefer income

to sales taxes.       Increases    in unemployment lead to a fall in tax collections



                                               12
relative to income         in all categoriea suggesting that the tax revenues fall

more sharply than does income.

        Overall, rhese regressions suggest that own            price   effects are important

for the income tax but not for the aalea tax.           This concluaion is supported by

the price effects        on other taxes.    One would think that increases in income or

sales    tax prices would lead to an increased reliance on some of the other

taxes.        This effect is found for the income tax price in 3 of the 5 taxes

(with positive estimates        statistically significant in iwo cases).          However the

sales    tax effect on other taxes is very            small,     more often negative than

positive and only significant in one regression (a case where the effect is

negative).

        Why   is   there such a small and often insignificant effect of the sales tax

price in the general sales tax regressions? One possibility is that the sales

tax look up tables are perceived to have no effect at the margin.                    Another

(and not incompatible) possibility is that state policy makers can react in

different dimensions to changes in the tax price (or perceived tax price) in

ways that offset each other.            To consider that possibility,      I   decomposed the

sales    tax regressions into rate and base coverage regressions.               For the rate

measure,      I    used a weighted average of the sales tax rate at the beginning of

the year and at the end, weighted by the month during the year in which the

rate changed.         The base coverage    measure is constructed in two steps.        First,

I construct a measure          of the     tax base as the ratio of general sales tax

revenues to the sales tax rate.              I then divide this base measure by gross

state product (GIP) in the state.18             This variable measures the fraction of

economic activity in the state            included in the sales tax base.         It averages

44% with a standard deviation of 10 percentage points.                 I have not explicitly

controlled for the sample selection bias in the rate and base regressions as I

simply ignore states with no general sales tax.                 Given the small number of



                                               13
continental statea without a general aales                tax    sample selection bias is not

likely to be a significant problem.              Those results       are reported in Table 3.

As expected,     the income tax price coefficient is positive and significant in

the rate regression and the             sales tax price coefficient is negative and

significant. Exporting appears to have no effect on rates.

      The surprising result is that the sales tax price coefficient is positive

and very significant in the base                regression while       the income tax price

coefficient is negative and significant.              A possible reason for           this    result

follows from the fact        that businesses pay a considerable amount of sales

taxes.19     Stephen Pollock (1991) has noted that businesses contribute as much

as 45% to sales tax collections.           One possible response to an increase in the

sales tax price is for states to broaden the base so as to tax more purchases

made by businesses.       While some of those             taxes will ultimately be paid by

residents, either through higher prices or lower factor prices,                  much of these

tsxes will likely be exported to non-residents.

      Finally,   I   turn to the question, "Whose tax price matters?"                   Feldstein

and   Metcalf (1987)     argued that        an average marginal tax price was                    the

appropriate price        reflecting       coalition       building    and    other    complicated

interactions in the political arena at the state level.                      One might take an

interest group approach (viz Inman (1989)) and allow for prices of different

income     groups to enter.       Tables 4 and 5 present two different sets of

regressions to shed some          light     on this       issue.     In table    4,    I     present

regression estimates     for the personal income            tax share and general sales tax

share regressions along the             lines    of   the       results in   table    2.       These

regressions differ      frots   those     in table    2     by substituting tax prices for

returns in different adjusted gross income                  percentiles for the average tax

price (presented in the last column for comparison purposes). Whose tax price

matters?      One crude way to answer the question is to see which estimated



                                                14
own-price effect coefficient has the highest t statistic.             By this    standard,

the average marginal tax price wins for the income tax regression and the

percentile wins for the general sales tax regression.             Limiting ourselves to

the percentile regressions, the            percentile (along with the 90n1) is most

important for the personal income tax regressions and the             75th   (and perhaps

the 50th) percentile for the general sales         tax regressions.    The cross price

elasticities are less informatiw;          however it is interesting that the one

significant cross price elasticity occurs          in the   75th percentile       for the

general sales tsx regression and has the correct sign.           This approach suggests

that high income groups are influential with respect to the income tax and

upper middle income groups with respect to the general sales tax.

       The personal income   regressions also provide support for the large own

price elasticities implied by the income tax regressions reported here and

also   reported by Feldstein and Metcalf (1987).            For example,        the price

elasticity for the income     tax regression in table 2 is -3.92.            Feldstein and

Metcalf    argue   that   average    tax   price   elasticities are      likely     to   be

substantially greater than          elasticities of   decisive     voters due      to    the

combining of itemizers and non-itemizers in the average tax price.                       The

estimated elasticities for the income tax regression support that story: in

all cases,   the estimated elasticities are substantially smaller than that

derived from the average tax price           regression.    If the 95" percentile

taxpayer is decisive,     the appropriate elasticity is      -   .74, about 20% of       the

elasticity from the average tax price regression. The two different estimates

lead to roughly the same     drop in income tax share in response to eliminating

deductibility. The mean personal income tax share in my sample is 18.3 while

the average tax price for all taxpayers is 91.9 and for the                    percentile

taxpayer is 69.7.    Eliminating deductibility of the income tax would mean an

increase in the tax price of the average taxpayer of 8.1 points



                                            15
(100-91.9)    and 30.3 points for the                    percentile taxpayer.        The average tax

price coefficient of         -   .781 implies a drop       in income tax collections relative

to personal income       of .781 x 8.1 or 6.33 (a 34% drop)                   while the estimated

coefficient ftom        the            percentile regression (- .194) implies               a drop of

.194   x   30.3   or 5.88 (32%).         As this example shows,          large elasticities ftoa

average tax price regresaions are consistent with more modest (and plausiblo)

elasticities from decisive voter tax price regressions.

       As a second cot at this question, table 5 presents regressions in which I

included      tax   prices       for     the             the   50th,   and    thm    95th   percentile

taxpayers.20 The story for the personal income and general sales taxes remains

unchanged.        In the personal income tax regression, the own-price coefficient

is negative and strongly aignificant for the                   95 percentile.        The coefficient

ia statistically insignificant for the                2S percentile and         significant but the

wrong sign for the 50th percentile.                      Moreover,     the   sales   tax coefficient

(cross price effect)         ia only positive (though statistically insignificant) for

the    95t percentile.             For    the     general males        tax   regression, the      50tk

percentile has the correct sign and is statistically significant for the sales

tax price coefficient and is positive and significant for the income tax

(cross     price)   coefficient.          Both the       2S    and 95t       percentile coefficient

estimates in this regression have the wrong sign and are not statistically

significant.        The results of these regressions support the findings of table.

4: Tax prices of high incoae groups seem relevant for the income tax while tax

prices of middle income groups seem relevant for the sales tax.

                                               VI. Conclusion

       Policy makers at the federal level might point to the continuing strong

reliance by states on the sales                    tax and argue that eliminating federal

deductibility for state and local taxes will have no consequences for the

state and local sector.            Results froa this analysis           suggest otherwise.       While



                                                    16
there is not    a   strong response ci sales tax share to changes in its tax price,

there is a very strong (and statistically significant) response of the income

tax to changes in its tax price.          Eliminating deductibility would likely cause

a large shift in tax structure           away from taxes which had been deductible to

taxes which continue to be deductible by businesses.

     How then should we explain the insignificant response of sales tax share

to changes in its tax price?              In the end,    I     think both the "incomplete

deductibility" story and the disttibutional" story play a role.                There is a

degree of responsiveness of rates to changes in sales tax price (table 3) and

some responsiveness of sales tax share              to changes in tax prices of upper

middle income groups (table 4).             These results suggest that the deduction

generated from "look up" tables is not entirely lump sum.               However, exporting

concerns likely dampen any desired reductions in sales tax share in response

to increases in sales tax price.

     However,       the regression results also lend some indirect support for the

distributional story of Inman and others.             Different income groups appear to

be concerned with different taxes: upper income groups for the income tax and

middle to upper middle income groups for                 the    sales   tax.   Given   this

differential set of concerns,           policy makers may have chosen to rely more

heavily on the sales       tax after     TRA    lo offset some of the gains to lower

income groups resulting from tax reform.

     That different income groupa ate concerned about different taxes suggest

a possible benefit tax       approach    as states struggle to raise money for a wide

variety of important        services.       Linking income      tax revenues to services

benefiting high income       groups     and sales   tax revenues to services benefiting

lower and middle income       groups     may provide additional political support foc

state tax systems which increasingly ere under attack from residents in many

states.



                                               17
                                               Appendix

       The model described in section III                 essuises   that   individuals maximize

utiliry over two consumption goods,               one of which is taxable           at the state

level,    and leisure.       From the utility maximization at the individual level,

demand functions      for the two goods can be constructed along with a labor

supply function.         I then assume that the state maximizes individual utility

conditional on these demand snd supply functions.                     In other words,    the state

maximizes the indirect utility function of the individual.                      I assume that the

gross wage and the net price of the commodities (gross and net of taxes)                         are

fixed but that the net wage and gross price sre affected by 1) state taxation

and 2) federal deductibility. For example,                  if the gross wsge equals 1, then

the net wage, w, will equal

(2)                                       w—     P(l-r)
where r     is the state marginal tax rate             on wage     income, and P   is the federal

tax price for state income taxes.                If the taxpayer       does not itemize on the

federal return, then the cost of a dollar of stste taxes equals one dollar and

P equals 1.      If the taxpayer itemizes and deducts the tax, then the net cost

of a dollar of       taxes   paid to the stare government is 1-c                 where      is   the

federal marginal tax rate en wage income.                 In this case, the net wage (net of

federal and state         taxes   and accounting for federal                deductibility) equals

(l-r)(l-r )21

         In s similar vein, the gross price of the taxable commodity equals its

net price (assumed equal to 1) plus the net sales tax paid to the state (net

of    the amount deductible       on the federal        return).     If   Pis   the tax price for

general sales taxes, and          t   the general sales       tax rate,     then the gross price

(q) is given    by

sales    tax rate (t) to maximize individual utility.                    From the   first order

conditions for the utility maximization problem, I derive functions                            and

t,    the   state's choice of tax rates as functions of the parameters of the

model.         The critical parameters that I consider in the                text   are the tax

exporting rates and the federal tax ptices.

        The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated deductibility for general sales

tax rates and lowered marginal tax rates for most taxpayers.                        This latter

change had the effect                of raising the federal tax price for state income

taxes.      Algebraically,           I characterize the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as

(4)                                            dl'   >0
(5)                                            dl'   —   dP
where 5 can be either positive or negative.                      One might first assume that

O<       <1,    i.e.     that the tax price for state income taxes increased but by

less than the increase for state sales taxes.                       For example,    if prior to

TRA86,    P—P          — .60    then dP — .40 and dP          is a number like   .25, say,    and*
— .625.         As   I   noted in Section ITI, the sales tax look up tables likely

underestimate the marginal impact of a sales tax payment.                        If for example,

only half the sales tax payments are allowed as a deduction using the tables,

then P prior to TRA86            equals .80 rather than .60.         In this case    dP   —   .20 <

dl' — .25 and            —   1.25.

For each regression, the dependent variable is tax collections as a fraction
of aggregate personal income.    The regressions are for the 48 continental
states for the 9 year period from fiscal year 1980 to 198g.     There are 432
observations. Regressions include fixed effects for the 48 stares.   CFE is a
Chi-Square statistic (6 d.f.) testing for correlated fixed effects.

The dependent variable is the effective sales tax tate or the ratio of the
implicit tax base to Gross State Product. The regressions are for the
44 continental states with a general sales tax for the 9 year petiod from
1980 to 1988.   There are 396 observations. All regressions have indicator
variables for nine Census regions and use instrumental variables for the tax
price variables.

   Conceptually, there is no reason to treat the two types of exporting
differently. It ia useful to do so though to emphasize the influence of
federal tax policy on atate and local tax policies.

    See, for example, Martin Feldatein and Gilbert Metcalf (1987), Douglas
Holtz-Eakin and Harvey Rosen (l98i) , Lawrence Lindsey (1988) , Robert Inman
(1989) and Mary Cede and Lee Adkins (1990).


   Examples of the average tax price literature include many of the papers
cited in footnote 2.
   For the purposes cf this analysis, I include charges and licenses in tax
collections. These data come from the U.S Bureau of the Census Stare Tax
Collections and are adjusted using the methodology of John Due and John
Mikesell (1983).    In particular, various states include cerrain business
raxes in the general sales rex figures prepared by the Census Bureau.     I
include those in the "other" category. Taxes on motor vehicle sales as well
as hotel and meal raxes are added to the general sales tax category.  Other
minor changes ere made ro create a consistent set of series.

   The model is elaborated more fully in an appendix.   Complere details and
derivarions are available upon request from rhe author.

    Measuring rhe tax price for individual stare taxes is slighrly more
complicated in practice.   I describe some of the complications end rhe
methodology I used for constructing tax prices in the next section of this
paper.
     See for example rhe discussion on page 140 of Reschovsky and Chernick
(1989)

   Roberr Ehel (1992) argues that rhis is in facr whar happened.
   Presumably, direct policy instruments would be m more efficienr device for
carrying out redistribution than this indirect approach.            Polirical
constraints may preclude such a direct approach however.

    This date set contains derailed information from federal rax returns for
anywhere from 85,000 to 160,000 filers per year.

     See ACIR (1990).   Also see footnote 12 below.

     In 1989, six arares allowed deductions for stare income taxes but not for
stare general sales raxes while one stare (Kentucky) allowed a deduction for
srare general sales taxes bur not for state income taxes (ACIR, 1990)   .  The
greater   number of states   showing a preference   for the srate income tax
reflects rhe tendency of state income taxes to define their tax base
according to federal definirions.

    An additional benafit of using TAXSIM is tha ability to construct
instrumental variables to control for the endogeneity in the tax price
variable noted above.      Higher levels of state taxation increase the
probability of itemtzing which in turn reduces the tax price for that
particular tax. This leads to a negative correlation between rhe residual in
a tax regression and the tax price variable.     Second, higher levels of a
particular tax taken as a deduction may push the taxpayer into a lower tax
bracket which increases the tax price and leads to a positive correlation
between tax share residuals and the measured tax price.     I construct three
instruments for the tax price using TAXSIM. A "first dollar" tax price can be
constructed by zeroing out the deductions reported by taxpayers and computing
a marginal tax rate on wage income.        Call this r.      I then impute a

probability of itemizing to each taxpayer based on national itemization rates
conditional on the returns adjusted gross income and number of dependents.
Call this p. Then the first dollar measure of tax price would equal
                                    P
                                     5
                                         —1-pr
                                             55
     A   "last dollar" tax price instrument is constructed as follows.
                                                                    Instead of
zeroing out tax deductions, I replace the reported deductions with the average
amount reported nationally by a taxpayer of the conditioning variables and
compute the marginal tax rate on wage income.  Call this r. The last dollar
tax price then is
                                  — 1 -
                                        p5r5.
The third instrument is p. Note that I need at least two tax prices, one for
the income tax price and the other for the sales tax price. The advantage of
these instruments is that they control for both forms of endogeneity and can
be constructed mt the micro level (i.e. for each tax payer)and aggregated to a
statewide level.

14
     Alaska and Hawaii are eliminated from the study to be consistent with
previous research in this area. Hawaii has a unique state-local relationship
which may make it more similar to large cities than to other states.

15
    The correlation is 0.69 over the sample period during which the general
sales tax is fully deductible.
16
    The retail sales measure also includes sales to industrial, retail, and
other business firas so long as the sale is a final sale.       Therefore, a
high sales activity index may also reflect exporting to non-residents through
business sales taxes which may in large part be exported.
17
    Previous research by Holtz-Eakin and Rosen (1988) as well as research on
municipal debt supply by Metcalf (1991) suggest the importance of correlated
individual effects in models of state or local revenue structure. State sales
tax rates change slowly over time and removing the across state variation
through the use of firsr difference or fixed effects estimation removes most
of the information in the data. Adding dummies for Census region in those
regressions seems a reasonable compromise.      I test for correlated fixed
effects in all the fixed effects regressions and generally reject zero
correlation between explanatory variables (and instruments) and fixed effects.

    Gross State Product data are conatructed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA)  and provide a good measure of economic activity within the state.
However,  the series is only available up through 1986.    Pot the missing two
years, 1987 and 1988, I extrapolate CS? for each of the SO states by fitting a
regression for each state of CS? on personal income and lagged CS?.        This
simple approach has the virtue of fitting the data very well as well as
picking up major turning points in the data for the vast majority of the
states.

     I   am indebted to Helen Ladd for

                                         this idea.

    These percentile prices are not highly correlated. For the income tax
price, the                    from .005 to .433 with the maximum correlation
           corje1ationsange
between the 90  and 95   percentile. The average correlation is .288.

21
    This measure is complicated by the fact that aome states allow a deduction
for federal income taxes on the state income tax.    In this case the net wage
equals 1 - (m(l-r)+r(l-m))/(l-mr).
