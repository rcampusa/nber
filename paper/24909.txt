The Human Side of Austerity: Health Spending and Outcomes During the Greek Crisis
Roberto Perotti
NBER Working Paper No. 24909

JEL No. E62,H51,I18

                                          ABSTRACT

The Greek crisis was the most severe in postwar Europe; its budget cuts were the deepest. Among
the components of the budget, health spending was hit particularly hard, declining by more than
one third in just five years. This paper has two goals: establish the facts about health inputs,
outputs and outcomes during the Greek crisis, and explore the connection between budget cuts
and health outcomes. Health spending and inputs were very high in Greece before the crisis: in
several dimensions, even after the budget cuts were implemented health spending and inputs
were still at or near the top of the European countries; in other cases they merely went back to the
European average. Nevertheless, budget cuts so deep and so sudden are unlikely to merely cut
into inefficiencies and overcapacities. I highlight several areas in which a comparative
quantitative analysis suggests that budget cuts might have had an appreciable effects on the health
of the population.

1 INTRODUCTION
The economic crisis of the last decade in Greece has been the deepest of post-war Europe. The recession
started in 2008, followed by a major fiscal retrenchment that started in 2010 and led, by 2014, to an increase
in the cyclically adjusted primary surplus of almost 20 percentage points of GDP. While the large academic
literature on “fiscal austerity” has focused on a variety of macroeconomic variables, during the Greek crisis
scores of articles in newspapers, periodicals, and internet blogs have focused on developments in several
socio-economic dimensions, foremost among them the health system and outcomes. There is a reason: by
2014 real health spending per capita in Greece had fallen by 44 percent relative to 2010, a decline that has
no comparison with any episode of fiscal austerity in post-war Europe: the next largest decline was in Portugal
in 2011-13, by 16 percent.
          Understandably given the depth of the crisis and of the budget cuts, the debate on health in Greece
has often assumed strongly partisan dimensions. In fact, in the context of this diverse literature on the Greek
crisis, it is not uncommon to encounter expressions like “tragedy”, “collapse”, “humanitarian crisis”,
“meltdown” when referring to the health system and health outcomes 1. The first goal of this paper is to
ascertain the basic facts on health policy and outcomes during the Greek crisis and the associated episode of
fiscal austerity.
          Systematic investigations on this issue are few and far between. 2 While informative, they also suffer
from several drawbacks. They are often selective in the indicators and in the time frame they use, typically
pointing out the deterioration of some conditions or cause of mortality over some periods of time. They rely
on partial, unofficial or journalistic figures when trying to reconstruct the budget of the health system, often
drawing attention to the reduction in outlays for some specific functions. They virtually never try to put the
events in Greece in a comparative perspective, the only method to gather an idea of the depth of the crisis
and its effects on health. When they do, they often cite the low levels of some health policy or outcome
indicator relative to other countries as an illustration of the effects of budget cuts.
          A quantitative, comparative approach is also the only method to make some progress on the issue
of causality: if indeed there was a deterioration in health outcomes, were the budget cuts responsible for this
or was it the result of the deep recession? Of course, recession and budget cuts are not necessarily unrelated:
a large literature makes the point that the latter caused the former. While with the available macro data it is
difficult to disentangle convincingly the role of the two factors, a comparative approach, coupled with fact
that the recession started two to three years before the budget cuts, can offer some tentative conclusions
on at least some issues. This is the second goal of this paper.

  I am not aware of any contribution in the economics literature. Among the contributions that come closest to a
systematic investigation, chapter 5 of the book by Stuckler and Basu (2014) and two papers in the medical literature,
Kentikelenis et al. (2011) and Kondilie et al. (2013). The latter are very short by the standard of the academic articles
in econoimics, two and eight pages respectively. One should also cite the meta-analysis of Simou and Koutsogeorgou
(2014), to which I will come back in section 10..

                                                            1
          I first show that, on many dimensions, before the crisis health spending and inputs were very high in
Greece relative to the rest of Europe. At the outset of the crisis Greece had the highest spending on
pharmaceuticals per capita of all European countries (and by far the highest rate of antimicrobial resistance),
the highest density of hospital and of specialist doctors, and the highest number of surgical procedure in
about half the procedures tracked; it had a density of medical equipment and of examinations with imaging
techniques (CT and MRI scans) that was well above the European average, in some cases by a multiple of
three; and it had above average rates of vaccinations against tetanus, measles, diphtheria, Hepatitis B, and
of many surgical procedures.
          In many cases the budget cuts merely brought spending back to the levels at the beginning of the
century, and often Greece remained above the European average or even close to the top. Pharmaceutical
spending declined by about one third, back to the level of the beginning of the century and still at the
European average. This however was due to a substantial increase in private spending, as public spending
per capita became the third lowest in Europe. The density of hospital doctors also reversed to the level of
2000, and to the European average. The density of specialist doctors kept increasing, and remained well at
the top of all European countries. The density of medical equipment remained mostly above the European
average, and in some cases it increased further. The number of surgical procedures declined slightly but
remained at the top in about half of the cases, and was slightly below average in just two. The coverage of
vaccination remained above the European average and increased. Screenings (breast examination and
cervical smear tests) also increased, and more than in Europe.
          This summary would seem to indicate that there is little evidence of a dramatic decline in inputs that
suddenly brought Greece below the European average, with two possible exceptions: the large decline in
government spending on pharmaceuticals, which conceivably could have affected the poorest individuals;
and the 15 percent decline in hospital employment. On might reply that for most inputs including
pharmaceuticals and hospital employment the starting point was the highest or among the highest in Europe.
Still, even though the initial condition probably included considerable waste and inefficiencies, one might
expect that such deep and sudden budget cuts affected the health of the population.
          Starting with self-perceived health, I show that among the poorest two quintiles of the population
it displayed a surprising improvement during the crisis and the austerity years. This was only in part the
consequence of a change in composition of these quintiles, away from retirees and towards younger,
healthier unemployed and low-paid employed: self-perceived health improved even within each age class,
and among the unemployed and the retirees. A more objective measure of health outcomes, the
standardized mortality rate, declined significantly during the crisis, and although the rate of decline slowed
relative to the pre-crisis period, it slowed even more in the rest of Europe. Similarly, amenable deaths, i.e.
those deaths that “in the light of medical and technology [ ….] could be avoided through good quality
healthcare”, also declined in Greece but less than in Europe; in contrast to standardized deaths, the rates of
decline slowed down in Greece more than in the other countries.
          I then move to an analysis of four outbreaks of transmissible diseases that have been identified by a
meta-analysis of the literature and have been widely discussed in relation to the Greek crisis: HIV, malaria,
influenza and West Nile virus. The HIV outbreak was, in percentage terms, the fifth largest in Europe, although
starting from one of the lowest infection rates in Europe. It was the only such outbreak to have ended after
three years. There were very limited budget cuts in HIV prevention and treatment policy; they occurred after

                                                       2
the beginning of the outbreak, and were revered very quickly. 76 locally acquired cases of malaria were
reported in Greece between 2009 and 2013; little evidence exists that they were due to budget cuts limiting
the spraying of areas at risk I estimate that the 2010 A(N1H1) influenza outbreak was responsible for 141
deaths according to the lab test method, the fourth highest mortality rate in Europe; finally, the West Nile
virus outbreak was probably responsible for about 90 deaths, by far the highest toll in European Union
countries.
          Two objective indicators do point to a worsening of health conditions. First, low-weight births and
infant mortality rates, already the highest in the European Union, increase. Second, the year 2012 displays
an increase in the standardized death rate by 12 deaths per 100,000 population, the only year in the century
together with 2016 to display a rise in the rate. This might be in part the consequence of the policies
implemented by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding, which restricted access to health insurance and
to free examinations and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, there is no evidence of a decline in the
utilization of hospital resources in 2011 or 2012, either at the extensive or the intensive margin; and in 2012
the standardized death rate fell by 60 deaths per 100,000 population, and by 4 percentage points relative to
Europe. Finally, the suicide rate in Greece before the crisis was the lowest in Europe after Cyprus; like in all
recessions, it rose during the crisis and the austerity period. Whether it increased more than predicted by
the large decline in GDP depends on the method to estimate the relation between GDP and suicides.
          Particularly in an area like health and in a rapidly changing environment like the Greek crisis, it is
however difficult to capture all aspects of the phenomena with the available macro data. Therefore, the
contribution of the present paper is no substitute for the knowledge and experience accumulated by those
who operated in the midst of the Greek health system, or that were its clients. In particular, one should
certainly not discount anecdotal accounts by practitioners, of which the following are but two examples
among many: “As the head of Greece’s largest oncology department, Dr. Kostas Syrigos thought he had seen
everything. But nothing prepared him for Elena, an unemployed woman whose breast cancer had been
diagnosed a year before she came to him. By that time, her cancer had grown to the size of an orange and
broken through the skin, leaving a wound that she was draining with paper napkins. ‘When we saw her we
were speechless,’ said Dr. Syrigos, the chief of oncology at Sotiria General Hospital in central Athens. ‘Everyone
was crying. Things like that are described in textbooks, but you never see them because until now, anybody
who got sick in this country could always get help.’” (Alderman 2012).
          “Konstantinos Syrigos, the head of the oncology wing at Sotiria [hospital] and the man responsible
for the volunteer initiative, became aware at the beginning of 2012 of the growing number of cancer patients
who had no access to care, either in the form of exams, treatment or necessary medicine. ‘People started
coming to us saying “I am sick, please do what you can, I have no insurance”, and my hands were tied […] We
also had patients who had started treatment and that would then disappear. When we called them they told
us that their insurance booklets were no longer valid.’ Most among the fifty or so cancer patients benefiting
from the initiative at ‘Sotiria’ […] were men and women who fifty years ago had belonged squarely to the
middle class. ”(Palaiologos 2012, p. 56)
          Rather, this paper should be interpreted as offering a complementary perspective, focusing on a
quantitative evaluation of the inputs and outputs of the health system in its entirety and on a comparative
approach.



                                                        3
         The plan of the paper is as follows. Chapter 2 discusses briefly the methodology of the comparative
analysis. Chapter 3 gives a short presentation of the institutional features of the Greek health system and its
recent developments. Chapters 4 to 6 discuss inputs to the health system: chapters 4 and 5 study the
evolution of health spending and pharmaceutical spending, while chapter 6 discusses the supply and usage
of resources, like hospital capacity and employment, exams, screenings, and surgical procedures. The
following chapters study outcomes, starting with some surprising results on measures of self-reported health
in chapter 7. Chapter 8 deals with measures of mortality, including a measure that is particularly interesting
from the perspective of the present paper: “amenable mortality”, i.e. mortality that would be preventable
with existing medical knowledge and technology and given “good quality healthcare”. The chapter also
relates mortality to indicators of health resources, namely bed-days per capita and the average health of
stay. Two important real time indicators of deteriorating health conditions, low weight births and infant
mortality, are discussed in chapter 9. Chapter 10 discusses specific issues selected by a meta-analysis of the
literature, namely four outbreaks of transmissible conditions: HIV, malaria, influenza, and West-Nile virus.
Chapter 11 presents the evidence on a frequently noted rise in suicides during the crisis, and places it in a
comparative perspective. Chapter 12 concludes.




2 METHODOLOGY
The Greek crisis was not a natural experiment. Changes in health outcomes depend on policy inputs,
particularly the health budget and access to healthcare, but also on medical technology and practices, and
on culture, health habits, genes, and external factors like pollution. For all these reasons, changes over time
in resource allocation and utilization and in health outcomes are more informative when compared to the
same movements in a reference group. Under the joint assumptions that medical technology and practices
spread rapidly, that some behavioral patterns affecting incidence and prevalence (like smoking) have
common trends across countries, and that the confounding factors are little influenced in the short run by
changes in budget resources and allocations, this difference-in-difference approach partials out at least some
of the confounding factors. The cut-off date for this comparison is 2010, the year when the cyclically adjusted
deficit, total government spending, and health government spending, all started to decline in Greece. In
this paper, I will call the years 2010 to 2016 the “austerity period” for short. 3
         In certain cases, I will make use of the equivalent of a diff-in-diff-in diff approach: I will subtract the
change in a certain policy or outcome in Greece during the austerity period from the change during the pre-
austerity period 2000 - 2009, and will compare that to the same difference of differences in the comparison
group. Because policies and outcomes might have country specific trends, this approach sheds light on how
to interpret a given change in outcomes during the austerity period.

    In 2015 health spending increased very slightly relative to 2014, to fall back to approximately the 2014 level in 2016.

                                                              4
         I will use two comparison groups: a set of 27 European Union countries, for which most of the
variables I will display are available at least from the year 2000; 4 and the CIIPS countries (Cyprus, Ireland,
Italy, Portugal, and Spain), that are often grouped together as they were all hit severely during the post-2008
crisis. Also, with the possible exception of Ireland they are probably closer to Greece than most other
European countries in terms of institutional arrangements, culture, and politics. In most cases, results using
the CIIPS countries as comparison group are very similar to those that use the larger set of European
countries; hence, for brevity I will only display the latter, unless otherwise useful.




3 BACKGROUND: INSTITUTIONS AND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE
This section provides the essentials on the key aspects of the Greek health system. Until 2011, hence well
into the period of the budget cuts, the Greek health system had three key features: coverage was universal;
exams, prescriptions and treatments were basically free; and there was no gatekeeping system, whereby
primary care physicians operate a referral system to secondary care physicians. In fact, Greece was one of
only six European countries where any individual could go directly to a specialist doctor. 5
         The Memoranda of Understanding signed in the course of the two major bailouts, and their many
updates, contained many detailed prescriptions on the health system, although not all were fully
implemented. For the sake of brevity, I will focus on the main changes, all of them introduced in 2011. First,
the four main government insurance funds, covering about 90 percent of the insured population, were
merged into a single large fund, the EOPYY. As a result, theoretically all the insured individuals of the four
pre-existing funds had equal access to the best hospitals of the best insurance fund, regardless of their past
contributions to their original fund. However, EOPYY was plagued by severe administrative problems. 6
Second, a list of exams that were no longer free was introduced. Third, the copayment on many healthcare
services was raised from 3 to 5 euros.
     Fourth, from 2011 coverage was no longer universal: the long-term unemployed lost access to free
healthcare. Specifically, after the first year of unemployment individuals older than 55 would be insured
provided they could show they had contributed for at least 3000 daily wages; individuals between 29 and 55
were covered for two years provided they could prove contributions for at least 600 daily wages; and
individuals younger than 29 could get an additional six months of coverage if they had been unemployed for
at least six months. After this, the only way for an unemployed to obtain coverage was to obtain a certificate
of indigent status (a “poverty booklet”, introduced in 2006), that guarantees free access to hospitals and

  Palaiologos (2014), p.66 cites a report by the Inspector General for Public Administration on a regional EOPPY office
that, as of the summer 2013, “had no way of directly knowing if an individual insured by one of the funds merged into
it was up to date on his contributions”.

medicines. Those self-employed that were in arrears with their contributions to their insurance funds, or
workers in the informal sector, or the unemployed that had any property to their name (including the house
they lived in) could not get a certificate of indigent status. 7 No official estimate of the number of uninsured
individuals exists, although in September 2013 the head of EOPYY put the number at 3 millions. 8 In June 2014
the “Atlas plan” was introduced, that essentially reinstated coverage for hospital expenses and medicines for
the unemployed and their families. 9




4 HEALTH SPENDING
Table 1 displays several indicators of fiscal policy outcomes in Greece since 2006. All point to the same result:
government spending (whether in nominal or volume terms, whether cyclically adjusted or not, whether in
absolute terms or as a share of GDP) increased until 2009, then declined until 2014, when it stabilized. The
cyclically adjusted primary surplus as a share of potential GDP (last row) also turned around in 2010, and kept
increasing until 2016: the change between the two years, more than 20 percentage points of GDP, is truly
dramatic, and unprecedented in post-war Europe.

EUROSTAT series shows a larger decline in 2010, while the OECD series declines quite dramatically in 2011
by 13 percent. In both series, by 2014 real health spending per capita had fallen by about one third of its 2008
value, and was back to its level at the beginning of the century.

            Notes: Base year is 2010. Only the OECD dataset provides the deflator for health spending. Hence, the Eurostat series
            on nominal health spending is converted to real values using the OECD health deflator. The average of the absolute
            value of the percentage difference between the nominal OECD and Eurostat figures is 2.6 percent. Starting in 2009, the
            OECD figures are identical to the System of Health Account figures from EUROSTAT used here and in several tables of
            the rest of this paper. The EUROSTAT data for Greece from the System of Health Accounts start in 2009; data from a
            previous version of the System of Health Accounts are used by the OECD for the pre-2009 period.


         Figure 2 shows the decomposition into public and private spending. 10 Of the latter, about 90 percent
was out-of-pocket expenditure, the rest spending by private insurance schemes. 11 The initial decline in 2009
was driven entirely by a collapse of private spending: public spending continued to increase, and declined
only slightly even in 2010. The decline in public spending started in earnest in 2011, following the signing of
the Memorandum of Understanding outlined in the previous section. By 2014, both private and public
spending had declined by the same proportion, more than one third.




10
   This decomposition is available only for the OECD series.
11
   Although for obvious reasons no hard data are available, it is widely believed that informal payments were a
considerable part of out-of-pocket expenditure: “informal payments, represent a significant part of out-of-pocket
payments (approximately 30%) [….] In a previous study it was shown that more than 36% of people who were treated
in a public hospital reported at least one informal payment to a doctor mostly in order to have access or faster access
to public inpatient health care services.” (see Economou et al. 2014, p. 103).

         Figure 3 displays health spending per capita in Greece relative to the average of the 27 European
Union countries. All figures are expressed in purchasing power euros for health 12, with the European Union
countries as reference group for the construction of the purchasing power parity (as it is well known, PPP
spending is the appropriate measure for comparisons between countries at a point in time, while is less well
suited for comparisons over time). The figure also shows the first and third quartile of the distribution of
spending per capita in each year. Until 2009 Greece’s per capita spending on health in PPP euros was about
20 percent higher than the European average and at or above the third quartile. At the peak in 2008 it was
15 percent higher than in Ireland, 20 percent higher than in Italy, 25 percent higher than in Spain, and 30
percent higher than in Portugal; it was also above health spending per capita in Finland and Sweden. By
2014, it had fallen to 60 percent of the European average, and well below the first quartile; only Cyprus and
Latvia had lower health spending. 13
         The decline in the Greek government spending on health after 2009 is extraordinary by any standard.
Table 2 displays the changes in government health spending per capita during the large fiscal consolidations
in European countries over the period 1975-2015. “Large” consolidations are defined as increases in the

   One PPP health euro in Greece buys the same bundle of health services, at Greek prices, as one euro does in the
weighted average of the reference group of 28 EU countries in the sample. Thus, countries with lower health prices
than the reference group will display an aggregate health spending in PPP health euros that is higher than their
spending in euros.
13
   As a reference, in 2009 Greece’s GDP per capita in PPP euros was 95 percent of the GDP per capita of the EU.

                                                                   8
cyclically adjusted primary surplus as a share of potential GDP by at least 4 percentage points over four years,
or more than that over longer periods of time. The precise definition is in Appendix 1.
         The 44 percent decline in real health spending during the 2010-2014 Greek consolidation was by far
the largest decline recorded in the sample; the second largest decline was in Portugal 2011-2013, by 16
percent. If one regressed the change in health spending on the change in the primary surplus in the sample
of large fiscal consolidations of the table (except the last Greek consolidation of 2010-14), the predicted
decline in health spending during the Greek consolidation of 2010-14 would be 4.7 percent, against an actual
decline of 44 percent (see the last row of Table 2).

           Notes: Units are percentages of the European average, all in PPP health euros. The aggregate “Health spending” in
           this figure includes private and public spending. The list of items included in this aggregate in this figure is in the
           “Eurostat-OECD Methodological Manual on Purchasing Power Parities”, at pp. 346-49. The total for Greece does not
           coincide exactly with the total expenditure on health from the System of Health Accounts, utilized below. The
           difference in 2009 was about 7 percent: 22,053 million euros in this table against 23,553 million euros in the System
           of Health Accounts.


        A similar exercise can be performed on the sample of large recessions, defined similarly to large
consolidations (again see Appendix 1 for a precise definition), and displayed in Table 3. Again, the Greek
recession of 2008-13, with a cumulative loss of 25 percent of GDP, was the largest in the sample; during that
recession, health spending declined by 38.5 percent. The next largest recessions, in Estonia 2008-9 (18.1
percent GDP loss) and Latvia 2008-2010 (16.6 percent GDP loss), were associated with an increase in health
spending by 8.5 percent and a decline by 8 percent, respectively. An OLS regression would predict a decline
in health spending in Greece by 2.3 percent, against 38.5 percent in actuality (see last row of Table 3). Of all
the cases in the sample, the Greek recession was the only one in which the percentage change in health


                                                                      9
spending was smaller, in algebraic terms, than the percentage change in GDP. Thus, there is no doubt that,
within an already unprecedented fiscal consolidation, the health sector was hit particularly hard.

5 PHARMACEUTICAL SPENDING
Until 2012 every Greek citizen had access to virtually free medicines without co-payments or with minimal
ones. That year, a list of non-reimbursable medicines was introduced, under the terms of the Memorandum
of Understanding. In 2013 the government introduced a 10 percent copayment on medicines for some
conditions, and raised it from 10 percent to 25 percent for other conditions. 14 As a result, between February
2010 and February 2013 the average co-payment rate rose from 13.3% to 18% (see Economou (2014) p. 106).
On the other hand, a cap on drug prices was introduced. In this section, I show that before the crisis


14
  A copayment was introduced for Alzheimer, Dementia, Epilepsy, Diabetes II; it was increased for Coronary Heart

pharmaceutical spending in Greece was much higher than in the rest of Europe, and was still high even after
the spending cuts were enacted.
          In 2007 (the last year for which figures for total sales were available) total pharmaceutical sales per
capita in Greece were 65 percent higher than the European average in PPP terms. Expressed in euros, the
difference was about 230 euros: in other words, pharmaceutical spending explained all of the the difference
in health expenditure between Greece and the other European countries. 15 After 2007, only disaggregated
data on sales for nine Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) groups are available for Greece. Figure 4 displays
these data, together with their sum (in 2007, the sum of these nine ATCs in Greece was about two thirds of
the overall total). I also reduce conservatively the Greek figures by 20 percent to take into account parallel
exports. 16
          Even after this arbitrary reduction, the first panel of Figure 4 shows that in 2009 pharmaceutical sales
per capita in Greece were 60 percent higher than the European average. The other panels show that Greece
was the top spender in eight of the nine ATC groups. By 2014, Greece’s pharmaceutical spending had
declines by exactly one third. However, Greece was still the third spender in the sample after Belgium and
Italy. 17

   In 2007, PPP spending per capita on health in the European Union was 2000 euros, in Greece it was 2240 euros.
16
   Because drug prices tended to be lower in Greece throughout this period, there was an incentive to re-export
medicines, particularly to the UK and to Germany. Scheuermann (2006) p. 22 estimates the size of parallel exports in
Greece in 2002 at about 20 percent of the total Greek market. As relative prices grew, this share probably fell over
time, to increase anew when the government imposed rigid price ceilings on pharmacies, to reduce the expenditure
for reimbursements of pharmaceuticals. In February 2013, the Greek health ministry estimated that over 25 percent
of the drugs imported into Greece were then re-exported (see “‘Medical stocks are down by 90 percent’: Greece
accuses pharma giants of slashing imports”, RT, February 23 2013). A ban on the re-export of certain medicines was
imposed in 2013.
17
   It was still the top spender before the across the board 20 percent reduction of its figures.

Notes: 1. Data in PPP dollars. Because these are OECD and not EUROSTAT data, the reference group of countries is made of the OECD countries, instead
of the 28 EU countries. However, by agreement between the OECD and EUROSTAT, the relative PPPs between EU countries are the same in the OECD and
in the EUROSTAT datasets (see EUROSTAT – OECD (2012), p. 241).



                                                                    13
 2. The Greek figures on pharmaceutical sales include (i) drugs dispended in hospitals, (ii) non-reimbursed drugs, and (iii) over-the-counter drugs. Only
 eleven other European countries include all these three items. These countries are: Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Slovak
 Republic, and Sweden (France and the United Kingdom have too many missing data to be useful). Therefore, the sample in this figure includes these
 countries only.
 3. The first panel, on “Total”, displays the sum of the seven pharmaceuticals displayed in the other panels. It does not include all pharmaceuticals, because
 the figure for actual overall total pharmaceutical sales in Greece in the original dataset stops in 2007. In that year, in Greece the overall total was about
 50 percent higher than the sum of the seven pharmaceuticals of this figure, displayed in the first panel.
 4. The original Greek figures are reduced by 20 percent to take into account re-exports of pharmaceuticals from Greece (see text)


        A similar picture emerges from data based on the National System of Health Accounts, displayed in
Figure 5. This data starts in 2009; on the other hand, total spending on pharmaceuticals can now be broken
down into public and private spending (the latter includes out-of-pocket expenditure, about nine tenth of
the total, and private insurance). Total pharmaceutical spending in Greece starts 40 percent higher than in
Europe in 2009, and 20 percent higher than the next highest spender, but ends 10 percent lower in 2014,
with the bulk of the decline occurring in 2012 and 2013. In particular, the decline of public spending on
pharmaceuticals is dramatic: from 150 percent of the European average to 65 percent. This is partly made up
by private spending that increased by 50 percent in absolute terms.

               Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden.


         An alternative approach consists of studying pharmaceutical consumption rather than sales. 18 For
Greece, this data stops in 2004 to start anew in 2014. Table 4 shows that in 2004 Greece already had a
higher consumption per capita than the average country of the comparison group in all the nine ATC groups;
it had the highest level of consumption in four groups, and the second level in the remaining five. By 2014,
Greece was below the European average in all but two groups, and was not among the top three consumers
in any of the groups, except two. This suggests a stronger decline than in Figure 4, which was based on sales
rather than consumption.




18
  In this case, the Greek data do not include any of the three items listed in note 2 of Figure 4: the comparison group
of European countries with this type of data is therefore in a sense the complement of the previous one, and includes
only four countries. These countries are: Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, and Spain.

 Notes: 1. Units of measurement: defined daily doses per 100,000 inhabitants
 2. The Greek figures on pharmaceutical consumption do not include (i) drugs dispended in hospitals, (ii) non-reimbursed drugs, and (iii) over-the-counter
 drugs. Only five other European countries present data without these three items: Austria, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, and Spain; the data for Austria,
 however, start only in 2010; hence the European group includes only the last four countries.


              The Memoranda of Understanding also made several provisions for expanding the use of generics
     (until then, there was no incentive in Greece to use generics). Table 5 presents data on the use of generics in
     the reimbursed pharmaceutical market. This data starts in 2012, hence no comparison is possible with the
     pre-crisis period. In value terms, Greece is 25 percent below the European average. However while in the
     rest of Europe the share of generics in volume terms is more than double the share in value terms, in Greece
     the two shares are nearly identical. This suggests that, unlike in the other countries, the price of generics in
     Greece is nearly identical to the price of branded pharmaceuticals.

Perhaps not surprisingly given the high level of spending on pharmaceuticals, by 2009 Greece was by far the
European country with the most serious problem of antimicrobial resistance. For the seven microorganisms
of major public health importance tracked by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, in
2009 or the first available year after 2009, Greece had an above average resistance in all cases, and only in 4
cases out of a total of 96 possible cases was there a country with a higher resistance.

6 HEALTH RESOURCES

        HOSPITAL CAPACITY
Despite the high level of spending on health before the crisis, there was no prima facie evidence of an excess
capacity of health institutions. In a regression of hospital beds per capita on PPP GDP per capita in 2009,
Greece was below the OLS line of the European sample, as shown in Figure 6 (the result for public hospitals
only, not shown, is similar).

                                                                       17

              Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania




        Since 2009 the number of hospital beds per capita in Greece declined by about 12 percent, but this
is a common trend in all countries; as a result, in relative terms the decline was limited, from 83 percent of
the European average in 2009 to 77 percent in 2015. Neither does hospital employment provide prima facie
evidence of any obvious excess capacity of the Greek system. Total hospital employment in Greece in 2009
was about 30 percent lower than in the average European country, and well below the OLS line (see Figure
7). 19




19
   Hospital employment for Greece is not available for public and private hospitals separately. In 2009 there were 142
public hospital with 38115 beds, 5 private hospitals with 1465 beds, and 166 private clinics with 15124 beds (see the
Hellenic Statistical Authority.) Although the EUROSTAT and OECD manuals do not state whether the Greek data on
hospital employment refer to public or all institutions, the ELSTAT (Hellenic Statistical Institute) reference manual of
the Single Integrated Metadata Structure (SIMS) states that “The purpose of the census is to collect non – financial
data that refer to all Hospitals of the country (Legal Entities of Public Law, Legal Entities of Private Law and private
clinics).“ See also here.

        EMPLOYMENT AND DOCTORS
By 2015, the absolute number of hospital employment had declined by 16,800 units, or 15 percent, well
below the level at the beginning of the century. Relative to the EU average it had declined from 71 to 62
percent (see Table 7). 20 Note that these numbers contrast with widely circulating statements at the time,
like the following: “[…..] the government’s austerity budget cut the jobs of 35,000 clinicians, doctors and public
health workers.” (Stuckler and Basu 2014, p.85).

                                        Table 7: Hospital employment, Greece

However, these averages mask a remarkable difference in the shares of different types of workers. At the
beginning of the crisis, Greece had a much larger density of hospital doctors per capita: about 30 percent

20
  In 2011, the Greek government imposed a near-freeze on new hirings of medical personnel in hospitals: only one
out of five retiring doctors would be replaced. The freeze, however, was not enforced rigidly, and there were
numerous slippages.

                                                                    19
more than the average European country (see Figure 8). Looking at doctors in general, including those
outside hospitals, further highlights the distinguishing features of the Greek system. In 2009 Greece had a
large density of doctors licensed to practice 21, 20 percent more than the average European country (see
Figure 9, first panel). In fact, this number hides an even more fundamental difference with European
countries. As we have seen, Greece does not have an effective primary care system acting as a gatekeeper
to secondary care specialists. In essence, an individual covered by the national health system (virtually any
individual, as the coverage ratio was 100 percent until 2011) could go directly to the specialist of their
choice for free. The consequence of this institutional arrangement is clear from the data. In 2009 Greece
had only 23 percent of the density of generalist doctors of the average European country, with the lowest
density of all (Figure 9, second panel); but almost 80 percent more specialist doctors (Figure 9, third panel),
with by far the highest density of all. Its ratio of specialists to generalists was more than 5 times that of the
average European country. With the crisis the density of hospital doctors declined to the European average
(see Figure 8); but the density of specialist doctors licensed to practice increased further, both in absolute
terms (by more than 25 percent) and relative to the European average (see Figure 9).

   Greece does not have data on practicing doctors, hence for comparability across countries the density of doctors
licensed to practice is used for all countries.

             MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
The large number of specialists was naturally associated with a high density of medical equipment. Out of
the eight types of equipment tracked, in 2009 Greece had an above-European average density in five cases
(Table 8), with ratios to the European average ranging from 111 percent in Angiography units to 246 percent
in Mammographs. 22 It was below the average in the two types of equipment used for treatment as opposed
to diagnosis: Radiation therapy equipment and Lithotriptors, and in one imaging instrument, PET scanners.
With the crisis, the relative density of medical technology equipment initially declined only slightly, and in
fact it rose in two cases, Gamma cameras and Mammographs: by 2016 it was higher in four technologies out
of six with available data, and in the case of Mammographs it had risen to almost 5 times the European
average..

  Gamma cameras were developed in the 1950s to detect tumours. PET scanners were developed in the 1960s,
medical MRI equipment and CT scanners in the 1970s. Two types of equipment recorded here are used for treatment
as opposed to diagnosis: radiation therapy equipment (also used for diagnosis), and lithotriptors. The latter were
developed in the 1980s and use acoustic shocks to break up kidney stones and gallstones.

        EXAMS AND SCREENINGS
What changed during the crisis was the utilization of this equipment. For Greece, data are available for two
types of exams, and in 2008 and 2012 only. In 2008 Greece had 3.4 times the number of CT exams per capita
than the average European country, and 1.9 times the number of MRI exams; 23 by 2012 these ratios had
fallen to 1.4 and 0.9, respectively (see Table 9).

                     Notes: Exams per 100,000 inhabitants


         There has been a large echo on the sharp worsening of indicators of self-reported “unmet needs for
medical examination”. Figure 10 presents the data. As we have seen, in 2011 several measures restricting
access to healthcare were introduced; that year, the percentage of Greeks who declared unmet needs of
medical examinations due to economic reasons (by far the most important motive for unmet needs) 24 rose
sharply, from 4 to 6 percent, and it kept rising to 12 percent in 2016. This translated into a sharp increase
also relative to the European average. The first quintile exhibited a dramatic increase, from 8 percent in 2009
to 35 percent in 2016; after a blip in 2011, the fifth quintile returned to its pre-crisis level, which is equal to
the European average.
         It is not clear how to interpret a self-assessment that an individual has unmet needs for medical
examinations; in addition, the reference point for this assessment might be influenced by the fact that until
the onset of the crisis and beyond, Greek citizens had virtually universal and free access to specialists. During
the crisis there was a widespread perception of a retrenchment in screening efforts for early detection of
certain types of cancer. For instance, Tsounis, A., P. Sarafis and E. Alexopoulos (2014), p. 2010 write: “[t]he
population in Greece receiving screening services compared with that recommended by the European Union
is already low [….] In countries with organised screening programmes, participation rates in Pap testing are
up to 80% (eg, Sweden, Finland, and the UK), whereas in Greece, participation is less than 60%.” 25 This
perception is not supported by the data. Table 10 shows that between 2008 and 2014 (the latest two years



23
   Comparative data are available also for PET scans, but not for Greece.
24
   Waiting times as a cause of unmet needs have always played a very marginal role in Greece, due to the institutional
structure that we have seen
25
   It should be noted that these numbers for Greece, in an article published in 2014, are in turn based on an article
published in 2009 (Dimitrakaki et al. 2009), and referring to a survey taken in 2006.

in which the survey was taken) the coverage of the two types of screening tracked by official data, for breast
and cervical cancer, increased both in absolute terms and relative to the European average. 26

        SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND IMMUNIZATIONS
As Figure 11 shows, of the seven surgical procedures tracked by EUROSTAT in 2008 Greece had an above
average density in five and the highest density in four (with a density close to or higher than twice the
European average); the remaining two were just below the average. 27 Greece stopped collecting this type
of data (or at least providing them to EUROSTAT and the OECD) in 2012; by that year, the density of
operations had declined relative to 2009 in all cases except one, but Greece still had an above average
density in five procedures out of seven, and the highest density in three.

  I do not report data on kidney transplants because for Greece they stop in 2010. In that year Greece was well below
the European average. This procedure is heavily influenced by cultural factors, namely the availability of donors.

Immunization rates against diphteria, tetanus, and pertussis have remained at 99 percent throughout the
crisis (see Table 11); that against measles has declined slightly, from 99 to 97 percent, but it is still among
the highest in the sample. A similar decline by 2-3 percentage points is not uncommon over the same
period, and has been experienced also by Italy and Spain – perhaps as a result of immigration. 28
          More indicative of the utilization of health resources are less routine types of immunizations. That
against Hepatitis B increased from 95 percent in 2009 to 98 percent in 2012 and 2013, during the largest
spending cuts, to fall back to 96 percent in 2015; all these numbers are higher than the European average.
Data on influenza vaccination in Greece are available only for 2009 and 2014: the coverage increased from
42 percent to 49 percent, while it fell in the average European country. As a result, the coverage rate in
Greece increased from 72 percent of the European average in 2009 to 1.03 percent in 2014.




28
  It is indicative that the immunization rate against measles declined below 99 percent only in 2014, after the large
inflow of refugees in Greece of 2013.

7 SELF-PERCEIVED HEALTH
Ultimately, what matters is health outcomes. I start from indicators of self-perceived health, with the obvious
caveat that differences over time and especially across countries in self-perceived health are difficult to
interpret, as cultural and psychological factors play a large and poorly understood role.
          As shown in Figure 12, Greece has always had a higher percentage of individuals who report “Good
or very good health” than the average European country. This share declined by just over one percentage
point during the austerity years, from 75.5 percent in 2009 to 74.0 percent in 2016, about the same
proportional decline as in the rest of Europe. However, Figure 12 also shows clearly that, while in Greece the
decline between 2009 and 2016 continues a pre-existing trend decline, in Europe the 2009-16 decline
interrupts a marked improvement in health over the previous period. Slightly more marked is the change in
the share of the Greek population who report ”Bad or very bad health”: the second panel of Figure 12 shows
that it increased from 9.6 percent in 2009 to a peak of 10.7 percent in 2014, a more than 20 percent increase,
and a change from 101 percent to 111 percent of the European average.


                                                                          28
        If this change were due to a worsening of the actual health or of the effectiveness of the health
system, one would expect self-perceived health to decline more markedly for poorer individuals. In fact, the
opposite is the case. The share of the Greek population in the first (poorest) quintile that report “Good or
very good health” increased dramatically over the austerity years, from 67 to 75 percent, which once again
represents a striking improvement in the trend relative to the previous period. In Europe the opposite is
true: the share of the first quintile reporting “Good or very good health” declined after 2008, also an
inversion of the trend over the previous period. The picture for the “Bad or very bad health” responses
(second panel of Figure 12) is symmetrical to that of “Good or very bad health” responses.
        Roughly the same pattern, with smaller changes, can be detected in the second quintile. Starting
with the third quintile, the pattern reverses itself: the share of “Good or very good” responses declines during
the austerity years, and the share of “Bad or very bad” responses increases.

         The improvement in the self-reported health of the first quintile may be due to a composition effect.
As shown in Figure 13, retirees have a much worse health than the employed and the unemployed, simply
because they are older on average; during the crisis, the income of the retirees was much better protected
than that of the unemployed and of the less paid of the employed. Table 12 displays the percentage change,
relative to 2010, of the median income of individuals, by labor market status and by age. The median income
of retirees suffered a smaller loss than that of any other category; and within each category the median
income of individuals over 65 held better than that of individuals up to 65 years of age. Hence, the
composition of the first quintile shifted from retirees to unemployed and low-paid employed.

         However, although a composition effect may explain some of the improvement in the self-perceived
health of the first quintile, this is unlikely to be the whole explanation. Figure 13 shows that starting in 2011
there is indeed a genuine improvement in self-reported health even within the categories of the retirees and
the unemployed; interestingly, in both categories this improvement represents a reversal of a decline up to
2010; in contrast, self-reported health appears stable among the employed, and worsening among the “other
inactive”. 29

  In 2011, the composition of the Greek population according to the SILC database classification was as follows (in
parentheses the 2010 percentage): employed, 44.6 percent (49.5); unemployed: 10 percent (5.9); retired, 24.5
percent (22.1); other inactive, 20.7 percent (22.1).

         To further appreciate this point, Table 13 displays the share of “good or very good” responses broken
down by income quintile and by age. For the first quintile, in all three age classes (16-64, 65-74, and 75+)
there is a decline until 2010, especially among the 75+; in 2011 self-perceived health starts improving, both
absolutely and relative to Europe, although for the oldest cohort there is a relapse in 2012 and 2013. In all
cases, however, by 2014 self-perceived health was better in 2014 than in 2009. The fifth quintile presents a
different pattern: self-perceived health keeps worsening even after 2009 for the first two age classes, and
improves only for the oldest one.

        A similar pattern is displayed by the share of individuals who report a long standing illness or health
problem (not shown). On average it increased slightly during the crisis, roughly in line with the European
average, 30 but it declined significantly in the first quintile, against a stable European average; it was stable in
the second quintile; and it increased in the top three quintiles, more than in the European average.




8 MORTALITY

           CRUDE AND STANDARDIZED MORTALITY RATES
Mortality is an immediate, objective indicator of the health status of the population, and perhaps the most
easily measurable. Table 14 presents the data. The first three columns of the first panel display the average
crude death rates in the 2000-2009 and 2010-2015 periods, and their percentage change, for Greece and


30
     The increase in Greece, however, started well before 2007.

                                                                    32
Europe. The average crude death rate during the austerity years increased by 7.2 percent in Greece relative
to the pre-austerity period, while it remained constant in Europe. The last three columns display the rates of
change of the crude death rates in the two periods, and their difference. The rate of change of the crude
death rate increased substantially in the second period in Greece, and more than in the rest of Europe. These
results seem to indicate a considerable increases in mortality in Greece, and of its rate of change, during the
austerity period.
         The next two panels however show that the crude death rate in Greece declined both in the age
group below and above 65 years. This suggests that the increase in the overall crude death rate in Greece is
purely the result of a composition effect: the Greek population was getting older at a fast pace during this
period, and of course the crude overall death rate is highly influenced by the oldest cohorts, which exhibit by
far the highest death rates.
         A compact way to isolate the effects of aging on mortality is to calculate standardized death rates,
i.e. the death rates that would have prevailed in Greece and in Europe if the age structure of the population
had remained constant, and equal to that of a benchmark group of countries in a given year. I use the
European Union countries and 2009 as benchmarks. 31 The fourth panel of Table 14 presents the results.
Now the average death rate in the austerity period declines by as much as 11 percent relative to the previous
period, slightly less than in the average European country.
         Laliotis, AIoannidis, and Stavropoulou (2016) argue that, even though it is true that the standardized
death rate fell in Greece during the crisis, the rate of decline was lower than before the crisis. This depends
on how the two periods are broken down: the last three columns of the fourth panel of Table 14 show that
indeed rate of decline of the standardized death rate slowed by 2.6 percentage points in the austerity period
2010-2015, relative to the previous period; however, it accelerated by 2.2 percentage points in the crisis
period 2008-2015 (not shown). In any case, regardless of the breakdown the rate of decline of the
standardized death rate slowed in Europe more than in Greece (see the last columns of the fourth panel of
Table 14).
      The same pattern emerges if one looks at disaggregated causes of mortality. The World Health
Organisation (WHO) classifies diseases and mortality in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems (ICD), which is currently in its tenth version (ICD10). EUROSTAT groups the
ICD10’s causes of death into 86 categories (see the "European shortlist 2012"), which in turn are grouped
into 15 main categories. Of these main categories, four – “Diseases of the circulatory system”, “Neoplasms”,
“Diseases of the respiratory system”, and “Symptoms, abnormal clinical and laboratory findings” - accounted
for about 75 percent of total standardized deaths (37 percent, 22 percent, 9 percent, and 8 percent,
respectively) in Greece in 2009.
      The last four panels of Table 14 display the standardized mortality rates for these four conditions. With
one exception (“Diseases of the respiratory system”) the average standardized death rate in Greece was
lower in the austerity period than in the previous period,32 although proportionally it declined more in

31
   The construction of the standardized mortality rate displayed here is slightly different from that applied by
EUROSTAT. The latter uses a “European standard population” based on projections for 2011-2030, I use the actual
population in 2009.
32
   A decline in mortality during to cardiovascular factors is a standard result in the literature on health and the
business cycle: see e.g. Ruhm (2000) and (2012).

Europe than in Greece. However, in all four cases the rate of change declined, sometimes substantially, in
Greece in the second period relative to the first, while with exception (where it remained stable) it increased
in Europe.

        AMENABLE MORTALITY
A better indicator for the purpose of comparing the performance of health systems is that of amenable
deaths, first developed by Nolte and M. McKee M (2004). According to the definition used by the Office for
National Statistics (2011), and adopted also by EUROSTAT (2017), a “death is amenable if, in the light of
medical and technology at the time of death, all or most deaths from that cause could be avoided through
good quality healthcare.” 33 The complete list of amenable causes of deaths included in the definition was
prepared by a task force of experts set up by EUROSTAT and is reproduced in Appendix 2. Note that with
three exceptions, the age limit considered in the construction of the indicator of amenable deaths is 74 years.
         I have computed standardized amenable death rates using the procedure outlined above. In some
cases the correspondence between the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems (ICD) of the diseases in the original definition of amenable death and the classification of n the
EUROSTAT database used here is not perfect. Appendix 2 lists also the ICD conditions included in my
definition of amenable deaths. The results are in
         Table 15, which has the same structure of the previous table and includes also the CIIPS countries.
The amenable death rate declined substantially in Greece, Europe, and the CIIPS countries, but proportionally
more in the latter two groups.
         The next three columns display the trends of the two periods and their differences. In both periods
there was a trend decline in amenable deaths; the rate of decline slowed down by similar percentage points
in Greece and Europe. The slowdown was much less marked in the CIIPS countries. Overall, amenable
deaths do paint a clear pattern: the levels declined in Greece but less than in Europe and in CIIPS countries;
the rates of decline slowed down in Greece more than in the other countries. Thus, like standardized death
rates, standardized amenable death rates declined in the austerity period, and also relative to the rest of
Europe, both in levels and in rates of change. In contrast, standardized death rates worsen relative to the
rest of Europe only in rates of change.

  Note that, as stated by EUROSTAT (2017): “The concept of preventable deaths is broader and includes deaths which
could have been avoided by public health interventions focusing on wider determinants of public health, such as
behaviour and lifestyle factors, socioeconomic status and environmental factors.”

         MORTALITY AND RESOURCES
In 2000, the Greek standardized mortality rate was 92 percent of the European average; in 2015, it was 97
percent (see Table 16 ). This was the result of two jumps: before the crisis, in 2006 and 2007, by a total of 7
percentage points relative to Europe; and in 2012, the only year of the crisis period when standardized
mortality increased, by 1 percentage points relative to Europe and by 12 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.
         Vlachadis (2014) p. 691 writes that “[t]he 2011–12 increased mortality in people older than 55 years
(about 2200 excess deaths) probably constitutes the first evident short term consequence of austerity on
mortality in Greece.” Although he does not specify how he defines “excess deaths” nor how he gets this
number, in 2012 the crude death rate of individuals aged 55 or more in Greece increased by 130 deaths per
100,000 inhabitants, against an average increase of 58 in Europe. In 2012 the Greek population 55 years or
older was about 3.5 millions. (130-58) times 35 (where 35 is 3.5 millions divided by 100,000) gives 2,500 extra
deaths (relative to the European average) per 100,000 individuals.
         Might the temporary spike in mortality in 2012 be attributed to the budget cuts? We have seen that
2011 was the year when government spending on health started to decline in earnest. In addition, in that
year curbs on the free availability of medicines were introduced, and the unemployed were no longer insured.
Thus, on a purely temporal basis, there are reasons to attribute the 2012 spike in mortality to the austerity
policies. This conclusion is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the 2012 increase in mortality was followed
by a dramatic decline in 2013, by 60 standardized deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and 4 percentage points
relative to Europe, which brought the mortality rate to a new historical minimum for Greece (see Table 16).
         Still, it is interesting to look at two variables that are good indicators of the effort of the health
system: total hospital bed-days per 100,000 population, and the average length of hospital stays, as shown
in the next panels of Table 16 (the data are available only from 2007 to 2012). Because obviously a change in
hospital resources could have a delayed effect on mortality, I ask a simple question: is there evidence that
one or both of these variables declined in 2011 or in 2012?
         Total bed-days per capita in Greece increased both in 2011 and especially 2102, by a cumulative 4
percentage points; in contrast, they decreased substantially in Europe, so that relative to the latter, in Greece

                                                                36
they increased by more than 4 percentage points each year, from 100 percent in 2010 to 109 percent in 2012.
This could suggest that contemporaneous budget cuts were not the reason for the increase in mortality in
2012. However, and quite obviously, bed-days are endogenous, and negatively correlated with health
conditions ceteris paribus. Still, if the budget cuts were binding one would also expect at the same time a
decline in the average length of stay, to save resources at the intensive margin. The next panel of Table 16
shows that the average length of stay too increased substantially in Greece in 2011 and 2012, while it again
declined in Europe.
         The same exercise can be carried out for the individual causes of the death (not shown). The 12 point
increase in the standardized death rate and the 53 point increase in the crude death rate in 2012 can be
explained entirely by three of the four causes of death, “Diseases of the respiratory system” (+5 percentage
points), “Neoplasms” (+ 3 pps), and ““Symptoms, abnormal clinical and laboratory findings” (+3 pps). In the
first two cases, total bed days per capita increased in 2011, both in absolute terms and relative to Europe;
they kept increasing in 2012 in the case of “Neoplasms”, while remaining stable in the case of “Diseases of
the respiratory system”. The average length of stay follows the same pattern. Only in the case of “Symptoms,
abnormal clinical and laboratory findings” do both bed-days and average length of stay fall, both in absolute
and in relative terms.

9 LOW-WEIGHT BIRTHS AND INFANT MORTALITY
Low weight births typically track closely sudden and marked deteriorations in health conditions.
Figure 14 shows that in 2000 Greece already had one of the highest low-weight birth rates in Europe; in 2008
it increased suddenly and substantially, from 8.4 percent to 10 percent in 2010, and remained above the
pre-2008 level during all the austerity years; as a result, between 2008 and 2013 it was well above the next
highest in Europe.

              Kingdom.




       Infant mortality also shows a clear deterioration. As shown in Figure 15, after a steady decline
between 2000 and 2009, all three measures – infant mortality, neonatal mortality, and perinatal mortality –
show an increase in rates starting in 2009, also relative to the other countries. As a result, while all three
measures started below the European average, by 2016 they were at or slightly above the average.

10 META-ANALYSIS
Simou and Koutsogeorgou (2014) performed a review of the peer-reviewed literature in English published
from January 2009 to March 2013, searching for the following terms and keywords in the title and the
abstract: “financial”, “economic”, “crisis”, “troika”, “IMF”, “debt”, “bailout”, “austerity”,
“measures”,“Greece”, “Greek”, “health”, and “healthcare”. 34 The goal was to identify the effects of the crisis
on health and healthcare. I have already dealt extensively with the latter; thus, in what follows I will
concentrate on the effects on health. Five types of effects are identified in the paper: Epidemics, Suicides,
Self-rated health, Mental health, Otorhinolaryngologic disorders.
         I will focus on the first two. I have already dealt with self-rated health. Evidence on deterioration of
mental health in Greece during this period is based on telephone interviews, and there are no comparative
data across Europe. An increase in the diagnoses of vertigo and tinnitus was reported by one publication,
which tentatively related it to the stress caused by the economic crisis.
         Reports on epidemics have been much more widespread, and have frequently been the object of the
larger debate on the crisis. Four types of epidemics have been discussed: HIV infection among injecting drug
users in 2011; Autochthonous Plasmodium Vivax malaria in 2009–2011; Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in
2009; and West Nile Virus (WNV) infections in 2010 and 2011. In this section, I will deal with each of these in
turn.


        HIV
“ [….] an HIV outbreak— the only one to occur in Europe in decades— emerged in the center of Athens.”
(Stuckler and Basu 2014, p. 86). Starting in late 2010 or the beginning of 2011, there was a large surge in new
HIV diagnoses in Greece; by 2012, these had increased by almost 80 percent relative to 2010 (see Table 17).
In the literature on the Greek crisis, it is frequent to attribute the increase in HIV infections to the budget
cuts (see e.g. Paraskevis et al. 2013 and Scaturro 2013).

     There is no official definition of an “HIV outbreak”. Table 18 lists all the country-years in the EU-EEA
countries (with more than 50 HIV infections) in which new HIV infections increased by at least 50 percent
with respect to the average of the previous two years, starting in 2006. The outbreak so defined lasts until
new infections fall back to the value of the year before the outbreak, plus at most 25 percent. Greece was
not unique during this period. Between 2007 and 2015, there were 6 such outbreaks according to this
definition; the Greek one was the second smallest in terms of percentage increase, and the only one to have
ended by 2015, when new HIV diagnoses had fallen dramatically relative to the 2012 peak, and had returned
to just above the level of 2008.

         To gather evidence on the causal effects of budget cuts in HIV programs, it is important to establish
first the modes of transmission of the Greek HIV outbreak. Table 19 shows that virtually all of the increase
in new HIV diagnoses in Greece between 2009 and 2012 can be accounted for by drug injection as probable
source of transmission.

      Over the 2010-15 period, on average infections by injection were about 15 times higher than in 2009:
Table 20 shows that only Romania experienced anything comparable. However, the starting point in Greece
was extremely small, 25 new infections.

       Research by molecular epidemiologists also confirms that the origin of the HIV outbreak in Greece was
injecting behavior. HIV-1 sequences taken from samples of injecting drug users were genetically similar,
“suggesting the recent nature of the HIV-1 epidemic among them” (see Paraskevis et al. 2013 p. 8). In
addition, there was a change in the role of clustered transmission: it was rare in the 2009 samples, with less
than 5 percent of IDU infections being clustered; in the 2011 and 2012 samples about 95 percent of IDU




                                                                   42
infections were clustered. 35 Clustered transmission is important because it suggests prevalence of
transmission via needle sharing as opposed to sexual transmission. 36
         The key question for the purposes of the present paper is: can this change in behavior be attributed
to the budget cuts in health services? I address this question in two steps: first, I look at evidence on the
timing of the causes of the transmission of HIV via drug use; second, I reconstruct the accounts of the drug
treatment services to establish the timing of cuts in their budgets, if any.
        The Greek authorities estimate each year the number of “Problem drug users” (“PDUs”, now called
“High-risk drug users”) using heroin as their primary substance. These are the individuals most likely to
transmit an HIV infection via drug use. 37 These estimates are based on the “capture-recapture” method,
which in turn is based on drug users applying for treatment with KETHEA, 18 ANO and other treatment
services. The method is meant to account also for the “hidden population” of problem drug users, i.e. those
that do not transit through the services collecting the information. For obvious reasons, these estimates are
subject to substantial uncertainty.
        Row 1 of Table 21 displays the central estimates of the number of PDUs. This number peaked in 2009
and then declined in 2010 (hence one year before the start of the outbreak) and 2011. Current injectors, i.e.
those PDUs that used injection of the substance in the last 30 days, also peaked in 2009. The estimated share
of PDUs currently sharing needles also peaked in 2009 and then dropped off sharply (see row 3) to levels well
below that recorded in 2004. Thus, the change in behavior of drug users towards injection and needle sharing
occurred in 2009.

       Early detection of an increased risk of infection via drug injection can be obtained by looking at the
prevalence of the Hepatitis C virus. 38 Table 22 displays prevalence of HCV antibody (the data come mostly
from Attica, where the HIV outbreak of 2011 among IDUs was concentrated). There is a dramatic increase

35
   See Paraskevis et al. 2013, Table 2, p.5 and Fotiou et al. 2012, Table 5 p. 47.
36
   The two largest identified clusters (sub-outbreaks) of HIV-1 in the 2011-12 sample, with 75 percent of all IDUs in the
sample, originated in Western Europe outside Greece and in Iran-Afghanistan, respectively. The nationality of the
potential founder was Bulgaria and Iran, respectively (see Paraskevis et al. 2013, Table 3 p.5). This suggests a potential
disproportionate role for recent immigrants in the HIV outbreak.
37
   “Problem drug use is defined by the EMCDDA as ‘injecting drug use or long duration or regular use of opioids,
cocaine and/or amphetamines’. This definition specifically includes regular or long-term use of prescribed opioids such
as methadone but does not include their rare or irregular use nor the use of ecstasy or cannabis. Existing estimates of
problem drug use are often limited to opioid and poly-drug use.” (see the EMCDDA website).
38
    “[D]ata on prevalence of hepatitis C infection can form a valuable indicator of injecting risk in populations where
HIV has not yet expanded, especially among young or new injectors “ (EMCDDA and ECDC 2012, p. 3). See also
Vickerman et al. (2010) and Reintjes et al. (2007).

between 2008 and 2010, especially among recent IDUs (i.e. IDUs who started injecting in the last two years).
Among the latter, in Athens there is a further big jump in 2011, although not outside Athens.

         Having established that the change in behavior occurred by 2010 at the latest, I now look at the yearly
evolution of the budget of the health programs for drug users. There is a widespread belief that budget cuts
in health programs were among the causes of the 2011 HIV outbreak. “A significant increase in HIV infections
occurred in late 2010 [….] Budget cuts in 2009 and 2010 have resulted in the loss of a third of the country’s
street-work programmes; one survey of 275 drug users in Athens in October, 2010, found that 85% were not
on a drug-rehabilitation programme.” (Kentikelenis et al. 2011, p. 1458).
         The two most important types of drug treatment providers in Greece are “drug free programmes “
and “opium substitution centers (OST)”. 39 The former provide inpatient and outpatient services also to
inmates and to adolescents; the latter only outpatient services. There are four main officially recognized
providers of drug treatment: ΟΚΑΝΑ (mostly OST), ΚΕTHΕΑ (mostly drug free treatment), 18 ΑΝO (Attica
Psychiatric Hospital), and the Thessaloniki Psychiatric Hospital.
         Table 23 displays the expenditure of the four programs between 2004 and 2013, the last year for
which the data is publicly available. Total spending increased continuously up to 2010, by almost 80 percent
relative to 2004. Then it started falling, and in 2013 it was about 30 percent below its 2010 peak, at about
the 2006 level.




39
  “The main objectives of drug-free treatment programs include total abstinence from drug use, improvement of
personal and social skills, health condition and family and social relations, decrease in deviant behavior, vocational
training. The therapeutic process may be multi-phased (counselling, main treatment, social reintegration) and may be
developed in a single or a network of affiliated units. The main goal of the OST programme is to achieve reduction in
drug use and drug-related social and health problems, as well as to protect public health from the spread of infectious
diseases.” (EMCDDA 2012 p. 57)

        The majority of clients of treatment programs was in OST programs. Table 24, row 1, shows that in
2010 one OST center was added, and in 2013 17 more. The capacity of OST programs increased steadily,
including in 2009, with a bigger jump in 2011 and then again in 2012 due to the opening of several programs.
The total staff of OST programs increased steadily up to 2009, declined in 2010 by just 4 percent, and then
increased further in 2011 by 25 percent. The number of individuals treated also increased steadily.

       Thus, spending on HIV programs kept increasing until 2010 included, well after the increase in
problem drug users, in current injectors, and in users currently sharing needles. The number of centers, their

capacity, and the number of treated individuals kept increasing throughout this period, both before and after
the HIV outbreak. The number of applicants on waiting list for OST treatment in Athens was stable between
2009 and 2011, and declined sharply after that. 40
         Cuts in the budget for free needle distribution have also been mentioned as a possible concurring
factor in the HIV outbreak. Table 25 displays the number of syringes distributed yearly, and the number per
PDU. The coverage remained stable at a very low level, about 6 per PDU (the lowest among European
countries) until 2009, then increased to 15 in 2011 and 81 in 2013. These are still low numbers, but given
that these programs are concentrated in Athens, the coverage of syringe distribution in Athens in 2013 was
estimated to be 216 per PDU. 41 As a reference, in 2007 in the twelve European countries for which data were
available, Wiessing et al. (2009) estimate an average number of syringes distributes through needle exchange
programs of 50 per injecting drug user, with a maximum of 325 in Norway (see European Monitoring Center
for Drugs and Drug Addictions 2010).

     Overall the evidence does not seem to be consistent with the view that the budget cuts in drug
treatment services caused the HIV outbreak among drug users. The budget cuts were limited, they did not
seem to have affected the capacity of treatment centers and the numbers of clients they treated, and
occurred after the increase in drug use and in the frequency of injectors and needle sharers. In addition, the
cuts in drug treatment services were small, and were more than reversed in 2011 in response to the outbreak.



         MALARIA
Locally acquired malaria is not unknown in Europe, but it is extremely rare. In recent years, there were two
probable cases in Italy, in 2009 and 2011 respectively, and one Spain in 2010. In 1974, Greece was declared
malaria-free. A few cases of locally acquired malaria were reported in 1975, 1999 and 2000. 42 In 2009, seven
cases were reported, followed by 4 in 2010 and 42 in 2011, 20 in 2012, and 3 in 2013. After this, no more
cases of malaria have been reported.



40
   The benefits of being on a waiting list are debatable, however. Reported waiting time for entry in an OST center in
Athens in 2011 was 88 months.
41
   See EMCDDA (2014) p. 74.
42
   Locally-acquired malaria is defined as malaria in individuals that are not migrants from areas were malaria is
endemic nor individuals who have travelled to an area were malaria is endemic in the last five years.

                                                                   46
          75 percent of the cases reported in Greece occurred in or in the vicinity of Evrotas, in the Prefecture
of Laconia, in the Peloponnese region in Southern Greece, an area which is mainly farm land covered with
citrus trees and with a strong presence of immigrants from countries with endemic malaria. 43 The association
has been made between the increase in malaria cases and less intense spraying in areas at risk, due to the
local government budget cuts (see e.g. the individuals cited or interviewed in Scaturro 2013), although no
evidence has been put forward.

          INFLUENZA
It has been widely claimed that Greece suffered disproportionately from the A(N1H1) influenza pandemic of
2009 (the first cases in Europe were reported in May 2009). Several commentators have attributed the high
mortality rate in Greece to the debilitating effects of the recession and to the budget cuts of the health system
(see e.g. Bonovas and Nikolopoulos 2012).
         Gathering comparable cross-country data on mortality attributable to influenza is difficult. There are
essentially two methods by which countries estimate influenza mortality. The first is statistical: various
models of “normal” mortality are fitted, and deviations from this are attributed to the pandemic. This
method is highly country-specific, and I am not aware of comparable data that have been collected based on
it


43
  European Center for Disease Prevention and Control: Rapid risk assessment: Update on autochthonous Plasmodium
vivax malaria in Greece – 11 October 2011, p. 2 writes: “The vast majority of farm workers are migrants from malaria-
endemic areas of Asia and the Indian subcontinent, especially during the cropping season. It is reported that
approximately 2 000–4 000 migrants currently live and work in the area of Skala, Lakonia and that there is a rapid
turnover in their population.”

                                                                    47
         The second method is death certificates and laboratory tests. Organic samples of individuals who are
suspected of having dies of influenza are sent to a lab; if tested positive for the virus, the death is attributed
to influenza. This method provides the lower bound to the true influenza mortality: since influenza manifests
itself through various symptoms, not always a lab test is requested and carried out. For this reason,
underestimation is likely to be particularly severe in older people. On the other hand, at the peak of the
pandemic, a lab test might be considered unnecessary.
         The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has collected data from national sources on
laboratory confirmed death from A(N1H1). The results are in Table 27, which displays the absolute number
of deaths and the number of deaths per million population as of April 2010 (the pandemic was over by that
time). Mortality in Greece was the fourth highest in Europe, and similar to that of countries like Hungary and
Portugal.

        Influenza mortality is highly age-specific: it tends to be higher in the very young and in the elderly.
Data on influenza A(N1H1) mortality by age are sparse: for the four countries I was able to find data, Table
28 shows that mortality in Greece mortality was below that of the Netherlands and the UK up to age 45, and
then increased dramatically: for individuals over 65 it was eight times that of Germany, four times that of
the Netherlands, and three times that of the UK.

           WEST NILE VIRUS
West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus. It is spread by mosquitoes and wild and captive birds. “Most
humans infected with WNV remain asymptomatic. Approximately 20–40% of infected humans develop
symptoms, the vast majority of which range from a mild flu-like syndrome, West Nile fever (WNF), to severe
West Nile encephalitic disease (WNED). This severe condition involves less than 1% of the infected patients.
The neurological disease usually encompasses three different syndromes: meningitis, encephalitis, and acute
flaccid paralysis.” (see Sambri et al. 2013).
         Up to the mid-1990s, there were only sporadic cases in Europe. The first outbreak occurred in 1996
in Romania, with about 400 cases (see Calistri et al. 2010), followed by several outbreaks in three regions of
Russia until 2010. In 2010, there were autochthonous human cases of West Nile virus infection in Romania,
Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece among EU countries (see European Center for Disease Prevention and
Control 2012), in addition to Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, and
Serbia (see Sambri et al. 2013). Only in Greece, however, did this characterize as an “outbreak” according to
the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (2012). The cases recorded in Greece in 2010 were
the first ever reported in the country.
         The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control started collecting data in 2011. Table 29
displays the number of cases recorded in the European Union countries that ever recorded more than 5 cases
in at least 1 year (in parentheses the incidence per 100,000 population, where the denominator is the sum
of the population of the provinces where cases were detected). 44 The source does not distinguish between

     I have added data for 2010 for Greece from Danis et al. (2011) and European Center for Disease Control (2012).

individuals that developed WNED and those that did not. However, most individuals discover to be affected
by WNV by being hospitalized after developing these symptoms: for instance, of the 262 individuals reported
in Greece in 2010, 197 had WNED (see Danis et al. 2011).
        In the years from 2010 to 2013, Greece did indeed have by far the highest incidence recorded in this
dataset in European Union countries. Part of the difference can be explained by the age structure of the
Greek population: the incidence of neurological disorders caused by WNV increases dramatically with age
(see Table 30).

         The second to last row of Table 29 displays the estimated number of individuals who developed
WNED, using the proportion 197/262 discussed above. Fatality rates (number of deaths over number of
cases) are available only in few cases. The fatality rate among individuals with neurological disorders from
WNV in the Greek 2010 and 2011 outbreak was 15 percent (see Papa 2013), against a 16 percent fatality rate
for the same category of individuals between 2008 and 2011 in Italy (see Rizzo et al. 2012). Applying a factor
of .15 to the second to last row of Table 29, the last row displays the estimated total number of deaths from
WNV. The estimated number fo deaths due to the WNV outbreak in Greece was 90, over the period 2010-
2014.




11 SUICIDES AND TRANSPORTATION ACCIDENTS
Since at least Ruhm (2000) suicides have been found to be countercyclical, although more recent evidence
questions the strength of this relationship (see e.g. Ruhm 2012). In 2007, the year before the start of the
recession, the standardized suicide rate in Greece was 2.9, the lowest in Europe after Cyprus. In 2013, the
last year of the recession as defined in this paper, it was 4.8, an increase by 64 percent; over the same period
the European average had remained stable. During the austerity period 2010-2014, the suicide rate in Greece
increased from 3.3 percent to 5 percent, while it declined in Europe from 11.8 to 11.2 percent. At least one
academic paper, Antonakakis and Collins (2014), explicitly speaks of a causal relationship between budget
cuts and the increase in suicides, attributing an extra 275 male suicides per year solely to the budget cuts.
         Was Greece exceptional in the response of suicides? Rows 1 and 2 of Table 31 displays actual and
predicted average yearly number of suicides during the Greek recession (columns 1 and 2) and during the
Greek consolidation (columns 3 and 4), where the predicted number is obtained from a OLS regression of the
change in suicides on the change in GDP per capita or the change in the cyclically adjusted surplus,

respectively, in both cases using two different definitions of the regressor. 45 The OLS regressions themselves
give insignificant coefficients, hence the results have to be interpreted with care.
         Using the first definition of the regressor, the predicted average yearly suicide rate for the 2008-13
recession in Greece is 387 against an actual yearly average during the same period of 443, implying an excess
suicide rate of about 56 per year during in the Greek recession. However, the same exercise but with the
alternative definition of the regressor gives an estimated negative excess deaths by suicide during the Greek
recession of -91.
         The same exercise, performed on the sample of consolidations, give a similar results: a negative
excess death toll by suicides during the Greek consolidation of 2010-2014 using the first definition and a
positive one using the second definition.
         A standard result for developed countries is that recessions are typically associated with a lower
mortality rate, in part because of lower transportation accidents due to less intense traffic (see again Ruhm
2000 and the survey of the intervening literature in Ruhm 2012). Using the same methods as in the previous
table, Table 32 shows that Greece had an excess deaths from transportation accidents of between 800 and
900 during the recession and about half that during the consolidation. The reason is intuitive from a look at
Table 2 and Table 3: the Greek recession was about triple the average recession of the sample, and the Greek
consolidation was about double the average. It is implausible to expect such a large drop in traffic intensity
so as to compensate for these enormous differences in the change in GDP and in the cyclically adjusted
budget surplus.

12 CONCLUSIONS
The Greek crisis was the most severe in postwar Europe; its budget cuts were the deepest. Among the
components of the budget, health spending was hit particularly hard, declining by more than one third in
just five years. On the other hand, health spending was high in Greece before the crisis: in several dimensions,
even after the budget cuts both spending and inputs in Greece were still at or near the top of the European
countries, and in some cases continued to increase; in other cases the budget cuts merely brought spending
and inputs back to the levels of the beginning of the century, and close to the European average. However,
budget cuts so deep and so sudden are unlikely to merely cut into inefficiencies and overcapacities; most
likely they do bite at some levels. Rather than replicating the main results of the paper, in these conclusions
I summarize the areas where some evidence exists of a substantial impact on the inputs and outputs of the
health system, and on the health of the population.
           First, the dramatic decline in government spending on pharmaceuticals (the highest in Europe before
the crisis), although compensated by a large increase in private spending, was presumably not neutral for
the different income classes. At the moment, I am not aware of data that could shed light on this issue.
           Second, standardized mortality increased in 2012. This has been attributed by some to the measures
implemented by the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding, restricting access to health insurance and to
free examinations and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, there is no evidence of a decline in the utilization
of hospital resources in 2011 or 2012, either at the extensive or the intensive margin; in addition, in 2012 the
standardized death rate fell by five times its increase in 2011, and by 4 percentage points relative to Europe.
           Third, amenable deaths kept decreasing, but at a lower rate than before the austerity period. This in
itself is not surprising, because they had fallen very fast before the crisis; but the slowdown was more marked
than in the rest of Europe.


                                                                   53
        Fourth, at least two outbreaks of transmissible diseases during the crisis, West Nile fever and are
A(NiH1) influenza, are exceptional by contemporaneous European standards and are responsible for at least
230 deaths.
        Fifth, low-weight births and infant mortality rose significantly.
        Sixth, there was a large decline in medical examinations (CT scans and MRI), although the former
remained well above the European average.
        Finally, the suicide rate increased significantly during the crisis, albeit from the lowest level in Europe
after Cyprus. Whether it increased more than predicted by the large decline in GDP depends on the method
to estimate the relation between GDP and suicides.

A large fiscal consolidation is defined as follows: Define CAS(t) as the cyclical adjusted surplus at time t, and
∆CAS(t) = CAS(t)-CAS(t-1). A period of large fiscal consolidation occurs if the following conditions occur:

             ∆CAS(t-1) + ∆CAS(t-2) + ∆CAS(t-3) + ∆CAS(t-4) > 0.05, or
             ∆CAS(t) + ∆CAS(t-1) + ∆CAS(t-2) + ∆CAS(t-3) + ∆CAS(t-4) + ∆CAS(t-5) > 0.06, or

             0.08.
             Define tmin and tmax as the first and the last years of the intervals thus defined.
         2. All ∆CAS(t), tmin ≤ t ≤ tmax, are positive except two, and neither of these two is smaller than -
             0.005; or except one, which is not smaller than -.01.
         3. ∆CAS(tmin) > 0.005, ∆CAS(tmax)> 0.005 (the first and last years of the consolidation the primary
             surplus increases by at least 0.5 percent of potential output).
         4. CAS(tmax) > CAS(t), t ≠ tmax (the last year of the consolidation has the highest primary surplus of
             the consolidation period).
         5. If a longer consolidation period as defined above contains all the years of a shorter one, obviously
             only the longer period is considered.
         6. If two consolidation periods as defined above overlap for some years, they are joined in one
             consolidation period (this never occurs in the sample used in this paper).

A recession is defined the same way, with Y(t) replacing CAS(t), where Y is the log of real per capita GDP in
year t, and all the inequality signs are reversed, and all the thresholds become negative. Hence, a large
recession occurs if the following conditions occur:
        1. Real per capita GDP falls by at least 4 percent as follows
            ∆Y(t) + ∆Y(t-1) < -0.04 (recession from t-1 to t), or
            ∆Y(t) + ∆Y(t-1) + ∆Y(t-2) < -0.04 (recession from t-2 to t), or
            ∆Y(t) + ∆Y(t-1) + ∆Y(t-2) + ∆Y(t-3) < -0.04 (recession from t-3 to t),
            or ∆Y(t) + ∆Y(t-1) + ∆Y(t-2) + ∆Y(t-3) + ∆Y(t-4) < -0.05, or
            ∆Y(t) + ∆Y(t-1) + ∆Y(t-2) + ∆Y(t-3) + ∆Y(t-4) + ∆Y(t-5) < -0.06, or
            ∆Y(t) + ∆Y(t-1) + ∆Y(t-2) + ∆Y(t-3) + ∆Y(t-4) + ∆Y(t-5) + ∆Y(t-6) < -0.07,        or
            ∆Y(t) + ∆Y(t-1) + ∆Y(t-2) + ∆Y(t-3) + ∆Y(t-4) + ∆Y(t-5) + ∆Y(t-6) + ∆Y(t-7) < -0.08.
            Define t min and tmax as the first and the last years of the intervals thus defined.



                                                       58
2. All ∆Y(t), tmin ≤ t ≤ tmax, are negative except two, and neither of these two is larger than 0.005;
   or except one, which is not larger than .01.
3. ∆Y(tmin) < -0.005, ∆Y(tmax) < -0.005 (the first and last years of the recession real per capita GDP
   increases by at least 0.5 percent).
4. Y(tmax) < Y(t), t ≠ tmax (the last year of the recession has the lowest real GDP per capita of the
   recession period).
5. If a longer recession period as defined above contains all the years of a shorter one, obviously
   only the longer period is considered.
6. If two recession periods as defined above overlap for some years, they are joined in one recession
   period.
