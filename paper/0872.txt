                                    ABSTRACT



     Currently U.S. Federal Income Tax schedules do not maintain marriage

neutrality, that is, tax liabilities depend upon marital status. This

paper shows the extent and distribution of the departure from neutrality

both under current law and the new (1981) tax act. The new tax law estab-

lishes a secondary earner's deduction of 10% of secondary earner's wages

(up to 3000 dollars). The child—care credit is also liberalized. Analyses

of the revenue, welfare and labor supply effects of these provisions are

also given.

I. Introduction

           Since the personal income tax was introduced into the United States

in 1913, the selection of the taxable unit has been a source of controversy.

The tax schedule has been applied to the individual, to the couple, and tothe

couple with income splitting. The choice has fluctuated over time and place,

and even now there is no strong societal consensus.1

           The income tax law of 1913 specified separate filing on a. single rate

schedule. Separate filing has the advantage of marriage neutrality, that is,

tax   liabilities   are not affected by the mere fact of marital status. In corn-

inity property states,      however, the wife   had a   strong legal   claim to   one—half

of her   husband's income (and vice versa) and couples in such states took to

filing two identical tax returns, each with one—half of the couple's income and

deductions. Under a progressive tax, this tactic resulted in a lower tax liabi-

lity. In 1930, the Supreme Court endorsed this procedure, and the geographic

discrimination persisted until 1918.

            By 1918, the tax was nn.ich heavier and much more progressive. States

had begun to adopt comiin.inity property legislation merely to secure for their

residents the favorable treatment of income—splitting on the federal tax

return. In that year, Congress provided that married couples would continue to

be taxed on the single schedule, but that they would pay "twice the tax on one—

half the combined income." This rule      persists      today in several state income tax

laws, and it is equivalent to the income splitting practiced by residents of

community property states.

            Income splitting represented a substantial subsidy to marriage for

one earner couples, and was so regarded. By 1969, the differential seemed

 excessive to Congress, which enacted a new schedule for single taxpayers which
                                          —2--



limited   their tax to 120% of that for a married couple with the same taxable

income. It was this law which established the current tax treatment of the

married couple relative to single individuals.

           Currently, single and married people face different tax schedules,

with the tax liability of married individuals being based upon the couple's

joint income. Consequently, tax burdens change with marital status, although

one cannot predict a priori whether tax liabilities will increase or decrease

when an individual marries. The answer depends In part upon the closeness of

the incomes of the spouses. The general tendency is that the closer the

income,   the   more likely that the "marriage tax" will be positive.

           This    state   of affairs has been criticized for a number of reasons.

Some observers, noting that the tax system often provides financial disincen-

tives for marriage, have argued that the current regime encourages immorality.

(See Rich (1979], Washington Post (19791.) Economists have tended to focus on

possible inefficiencies induced when tax liability is based upon family income

("joint filing"). As Boskin and Sheshinski [19791 note, since the labor supply

elasticities     of husbands and wives differ, economic efficiency would be
enhanced   if their earned incomes were taxed at different rates. Yet, under a.

system of joint filing, spouses face the same marginal tax rate on the last

dollar. A closely—related criticism is that the current tax regime tends to

discourage married women from entering the marketplace. This is because under

joint filing the wife's tax rate is a function of the husband's earnings.2

            An excellent polemic against current law is provided by

Moerschbraecher [19811, from which the following quotation is taken:

            The marriage penalty...serves as a disincentive to marriage,
            and an incentive to cohabitation, an incentive to divorce
                                       —3-


            and a disincentive to reentry of the second spouse into
            the labor market. There is no reason for a tax provision
            which is not only arbitrary, but inconsistent and unintended.

This author surely overstates her case. In fact, the selection of a taxable

unit is controversial precisely because it is difficult. The case for marriage

neutrality is admittedly compelling, but the case for horizontal equity

(couples with equal fairLily incomes should pay equal taxes) is also appealing,

as is the case for progressivity in the tax schedule. Yet, these three prin-

ciples are incoiipatible. There is, in fact, no non—negative income tax which

could provide marriage neutrality, horizontal equity and progressivity (Rosen

[1977], Munnell 11978].)3

            In a tax system with itemized deductions, separate filing does not

even achieve marriage neutrality unless the "correct" allocation of deductions

between the spouses can be determined. In coxnxron   law   states before 19148 deduc-

tions were allocated to the spouse making payment. For well—organized taxpayers

this allowed deductions to be assigned in a tax—minimizing way, and it repre-

sented a departure from marriage neutrality as great as any present under the
1969 law. Deductions might plausibly be allocated in proportion to income, or
split    evenly, but without knowledge of the "correct" distribution substantial

non—neutrality is inevitable. An identical set of concerns relates to the

disposition of dependent exemptions.

             In the search for a principle to violate, the recent literature

emphasizes horizontal equity as the weakest link in the paradox. The trend

towards a temporary and casual style of marriage militates against the assump-

tion of the family as an integrated consumption unit. Furthermore, the conk-

parison between couples of equal incomes is disingenuous. They are not really

equal if one couple xaist work twice as many hours to achieve that income. Yet
 it does not follow that individual filing is an equitable (or efficient) alter-

native. The most salient characteristic of all known tax systems is the

 failure to tax non—market goods. If all the contributions of each spouse toa

marriage, both physical and spiritual, were taxed, and if marriages were made

between equals in the broad sense of the term, then joint and individual filing

would be the same. The failure to tax non—market goods is the source of the

difficulty, and    It   is not alleviated by individual filing. The case for joint

filing (since it may now be seen to fail to achieve horizontal equity) is

weakened, however.

             The 1981 tax law does respond to the apparent inequity of the marriage

tax. 1ihen it takes full effect in 1983, the bill provides that 10 percent of

the secondary worker's earnings (up to $30,000) shall be exempt from taxation.

The    child care credit is expanded to 20   percent of the first $2I00 in   child or
dependent    care expenses for each of   the taxpayers first two dependents. The
credit    is increased by one point for each $2000 that the taxpayer's income falls

short    of $30,000, with a maxiimun credit of 30   percent of expenses) Together
with   the general rate reduction of 23 percent     (only 19 percent in 1983), these

charges   will substantially enhance marriage neutrality at the expense of both

horizontal equity and progressivity. It cannot be expected, therefore, to be

the last legislative initiative on this subject.

            It is the purpose of this paper to show the magnitude and distribution

  of the marriage tax under both the current and the new tax laws, and to

show careful estimates of the effect on revenues, labor supply, and welfare of

the introduction of the secondary earner's exemption, and the liberalization of

the child—care credit.
                                      —5-.



           Section II of this paper shows how the distribution and magnitude of

the marriage tax burden (or benefit) is chaaged by the new tax law, under the

assumption of no behavioral response. Static simulations showing the distri-

bution of burden for the marriage tax are provided in Sunley 119801, but the

document does not indicate the source of the data. The labor force behavior of

married women is quite responsive to the net wage (see e.g. Rosen [1976] or

Hall 11973]). Thus, ignoring the labor supply responses of married women is

likely to lead to biased estimates of the effects of tax reform proposals. The

simulations reported in part V explicitly incorporate endogenous work deci-

sions for wives.

           Unfortunately, even a rather complete set of variables relating to a

household's tax situation does not include all of the information needed to

predict the effects of taxes on labor supply. For example, standard theoreti-

cal considerations suggest that an important determinant of labor supply is the

wage rate, but it is not available on any of our data sets. Section III of

this paper outlines our approach to the problem of imputing such missing data,

a more detailed discussion is given by Feenberg and Rosen [1980].

           Section IV describes the behavioral assumptions (specified in a

utility—theoretic format) for the simulations presented in section V. The

trusting reader may proceed directly from section II to section V without con-

 fusion.

II. Static Simulations

    As noted above, the distribution and size of the marriage tax depend largely

upon the distribution of income between spouses, the degree of progressivity of

the tax schedules, the personal exemption, and the difference between the single

and joint schedules. A host of other provisions in the law also play at least a

minimum role.

    The most important of these other provisions, and the oni.y one which the CPS

data allow us to account for, is the earned income credit (EIC). The EIC pro-

vides a refundable credit of 10% of wages and salaries, but not more than $500,

and only to individuals or couples with dependents. The credit vanishes gra-

dually as income exceeds $5000 and vanishes completely at $10,000. Because the

income   limits for   the take—back are independent   of   marital   status, the EIC is
the major source of marriage tax burden in low to moderate income households.
    Other sources of non—neutrality in       1979 include the capital loss limits

($3000 single or joint), the zero—bracket amount ($2300 for single returns but

only $31W0 for joint returns), the child—care credit ($960 maximum for

everyone), the minimum     tax   on preferences (a $10,000 offset is independent of

marital status) and the alternative minimum       tax on   preferences,   which is a
progressive tax (rates from 0.1      to   0.25) on which income   splitting is   not
allowed.

A. Data

    The March 1980 Current Population Survey serves as the basic data source for

the static (no behavioral response) simulations in this section. It is a good

source because it is fairly recent, reflecting 1979 income levels, it is repre—
                                      —7--




sentative of the entire U.S. population and it includes separate income infor-

mation for husbands and wives. Other possible surveys include husband's and.

wives labor income separately, but not their property income. Even here there

is some ambiguity over the intra—family distribution of' property income. The

CPS data does not pretend to represent what individual property income would

have been had the couple not married, or even what it would be if' the couple

divorced. It is nrely the subjective allocation made by the respondent under a

tax law which is neutral with respect to distribution. Under a non—neutral tax

the distribution might be quite different.

    The chief disadvantage of the CPS is the lack of any information on itemized

deductions, but it is also true that CPS property income corresponds poorly with

tax return data. Lastly, income items are truncated at $50,000, which affects

the top 3% of husbands, but essentially no wives. No adjustment has been made

to the income data, but an imputed value of deductible expense has been

assumed.5 More sophisticated procedures for imputing data are suggested in

Section III of this paper, and are applied in Section V to a tax return data set.

    Where 1983 income levels are required, they are obtained from a projected

nominal per capita income growth factor of l.49 for 1979 to 1983. This

corresponds closely with both Administration and Congressional Budget Office

projections, the disagreement among forecastors applies mostly to the decom-

position of income growth into real and price—level components.

B. The Distribution of the Marriage Tax

    In table 11.1, the average marriage tax is given for each of several com-

binations of spouses' adjusted gross income. The law applied is that current in

1979—81 and the income   levels   are for 1979.6   The marriage tax is defined by the
difference   between the tax due on separate filings using the individual income
items, and the tax due on a joint return. Deductions and exemptions are allo-
cated in proportion to income. This allocation is fairly crucial in determining
the results, it a tax—minimizing distribution of deductions is allowed the esti-
mated penalties are substantially larger.
    The table clearly shows the tendency of the penalty to increase with joint
income and to decrease with income inequality. The relative rarity of high
income women is the source of sufficient inequality to make the preponderant
marraige   tax negative, as   will be seen in a later table.
    In   figure 11.1, an alternate mode of presentation is shown. The contours

show lines of equal marriage penalty in spouse's income space. The same law as

for table 11.1 is applied. However, to produce a three—dinnsional plot several

additional assumptions must    be made. There are assumed to be no children (this
includes 17 million of the 1 million couples) deductions are assumed to be 20%

of AGI and   income is assumed to be   labor income for the purpose of maximum tax.

The same pattern as in table 11.1 emerges but with perhaps greater clarity.

Each contour is labelled with the percentage of childless couples who would fall
                                         -.9-.




into that region, given the assumed deductions. Table 11.2 provides cumulative

distributions of the marriage penalty and bonus for 1979. From column two we

see that substantial penalties are not unusual, being present in 15% of the

cases, but   that   a bonus of that size is somewhat more likely and goes to 23 of

couples in the sample.

    The secondary earner's deduction enacted in 198]. takes full effect in 1983,

when it provides for a deduction of 10% of the secondary worker's earnings, but

not over $3000. By 1983, a general tax cut of 19% will also be in effect, and

changes in nominal income will also substantially affect real tax liabilities.

Table 11.3 repeats table 11.1, but at 1983 income levels, and with 1983 tax

rates without (second line) the secondary earner's deduction and (third line)

with it. The top row and the left—hand column show little change, but the

marriage penalty in most of the other cells is substantially reduced. Figure

11.3 shows the contours of equal marriage tax amelioration, and figure    11.14


shows the final situation, including the SED.

    Figures 11.5 and ii.6 repeat figure 11.3 and 11.14 but with contours of equal

fractions of income paid' in marriage penalty. On 11.2 we see that a non—trivial

(ii%) fraction of 1983 households would pay a penalty of 2% or more of family

income without the SED, but that this would happen only among rather well off

couples. The next figure shows the situation with the enacted law, only 2% of

couples are so abused, and so on. It should be clear from these figures that

     The contour plot shows lines of equal marriage penalty.

Each line is labelled at the far right with the amount of

penalty (negative values for a marriage bonus). For example,

if the wife's income is $30,000 and the husband's income is

$140,000 to $60,000 the penalty is about $3,000. The contours

are symmetric about a 145% line through the origin so the

husband's and wive's incomes may be interchanged. Each con-

nected region of the graph is labelled with the percentage of

childless couples whose incomes place them in that region.

For example, 1% pay a penalty of $3,000 or more. Some of the

regions are disconnected, for example 23% (= 19% + 4%) of the

joint returns show a benefit of zero to $500.

any   reduction     in marriage penalties is obtained at the expense of progressivity.

While this paper makes no attempt to balance these competing virtues, it does

seek to emphasize the competition among them.

      Table II.! shows the cumulative distribution of penalty and bonus for 1983

with and without the secondary earner's deduction. The final two columns of the

table show the amount of penalty or bonus and the mean change in tax revenue due

to the deduction for those couple in the indicated brackets without the

tion,   the other columns          have the   conventional structure. Without the deduction
there is     a slight reduction in marriage bonus from 113.5 billion dollars in 1979

to 13.0 billion in 1983. Gross marriage penalty, however, increases slightly

from 9.      to   9.3   billion.   The overall reduction in absolute deviations is 1.2

billion. The introduction of a BED reduces the marriage penalty by 2 billion to

7.3 billion, but it increases the marriage bonus by 1.1 billion to 113.7 billion.

The net improvement in absolute deviations of .3 billion is small relative to

the improvement associated with the 1981 law's general reduction in progres—

S   ivity.
      The last two columns show that this generally poor showing occurs in spite

of the fact that 3.2 billion dollars in reduction go to couples who would other-

wise be paying a penalty and only .13             billion   dollars go to those receiving a

bonus. The S1D's greatest effect is the movement of couples from the penalty

category to the bonus category, it does not succeed at reducing the extent of

the non—neutrality.

III. Methodological Issues in Behavioral Simulation

             A behavioral simulation requires data on individual's tax situations

and   on their economic   and demographic characteristics. The tax information is

required to make tarefu.l predictions of the revenue implications of alternative

tax regimes. The economic and demographic information is needed to estimate

the impact of tax changes upon economic behavior.

             The fundamental methodological problems of this study are consequen-

ces of the fact that no publicafly available data set has all this information.

The Marhc CPS, whilel rich in income data, lacks the wage rate, which is asked

in May. It also lacks any suitable hours—last-year variable, although hours—

last—year is available.       The data sources typically used by economists to esti-

mate behavioral equations have virtually no federal income tax data. (See, for

example, Institute for Social Research [197141.) On the other hand, data sets

that are rich in tax information tend to tell us little else about members of

the sample. For example, because individuals do not report wage rates and hours

of work on their federal income tax returns, TAXSIM has no information on these

crucial magnitudes. Clearly, then, one must bring together information from (at

least) two different data sources in order to perform tax simulations with endo—

genous labor supply responses.

             A popular technique for combining information is statistical

matching7.      The first step in this procedure is to isolate a set of variables

that is common to both data sets. Then a search is made to determine which

observations    of each data set are "close" on the basis of these variables8.
The close observations are pooled in order to forui a "synthetic" observation,
which is then treated as if it were generated by a single behavioral unit.

            In   this section we outline as an alternative an inexpensive imputation

procedure which provides the promise of consistent estimates of revenue

effects.



A. Predicting Tax Revenues

            Let y be a vector of variables endogenous to the tax system.

Included are items such as taxable income, which depends directly upon provi-

sions of the tax code, as well as variables like pre—tax earnings, which depend

upon   the tax system only to the extent that the latter influences economic
behavior.        Let x be a vector of exogenous variables such as age or (in this

study) property income. If the tax code at a given time is represented by the

parameter B, then we can think of the tax system as a function t(x,y,b) which

 determines the amount of taxes owed by an individual given both the relevant

                                             Our problem is to determine how revenues
 exogenous and endogenous variables.

 change when there is a change from the current tax regime, denoted B', to some

 new tax regime, B".
                                                                        variables in the
             Call the distribution of the exogenous and endogenouS

 population f(x,y        B'). Then total tax revenue under the current regime B' is

 (iii.i)             T(B') =    N   ix Jy t(x,y,B')f(x,Y B')dydx

 where   N is the total number of tax—paying units.
                 The analytic integration implied by (iii.i) cannot in practice be per—

 formed. An obvious alternative to (iii.i) is its discrete analogue,


  (111.2)             T(B') =   N       t(xj,yj, B')Pj


  whereyi and xj (i=l,...,I) are I sample
                                                  observations from the universe of N
tax—paying units, and Pj is one over the probability of the observation being

included in the sample.

           Under tax regime B" tax revenues are



(111.3)         T(B") =          fx   Jy t(x,y,B")f(x,y B")dydx.


Unfortunately, even'knowledge of f(x,y-I B') does not in general give us

f(x,yI B"), the joint distribution of x andy under the new regime. Only with

the restrictive assumption that y is inelastic with respect to the change in

tax regimes can we estimate new tax revenues as



(111.14)        T(B") =               t(x,y,B")p1

For changes in tax regimes of the sort being analyzed in this paper, the exoge-.

neity assumption is too strong.

           If y is known to be some stochastic function of the x's, then one is

tempted to replace the y's with their predicted values.

    If y is known to be some stochastic function of the x's, then one is tempted

to replace the y's with their predicted values:
                           I
(111.5)       T(B")   =
                                 t(x,y(x,B"),B") Pj
                          i= 1


but a nn.ich better procedure adds the prediction error under the known regime

back to the new predicted y, i.e.,
                       I
(111.6)       T(B") =  L t(x,y(x,B")) + (y—y(x,B'),B") P
                          1=1
           Of course, the discussion so far has ignored the possibility that

some variables in the x ory vectors may             be   missing from the TAXSIM file.

B.   Imputing Baseline Data

             Most plausible theories of labor supply suggest that it is necessary

to know something about individuals' wage rates and hours of work In order to

predict how alternative tax regimes affect revenues.          But federal tax returns

                                                                                  In this
include     only the   product of hours and the wage rate, that is, earnings.

section we show how external information concerning the joint distribution of

earning     hours from the University of Michigan Panel Survey of Income Lnamics
can be used in conjunction with tax return data to impute the missing data.
The PSID was chosen because it       is the only data set we could locate which inclu-

des both wage rate and annual income data for a sample of the U.S. population.

The major disadvantage of the PSID is the sparsity of families in higher income

brackets.

              The first step in the imputation procedure is to estimate with the
1975 survey     year data (giving 19V4 income and hours) a regression of the wife's
wage   as   some function of those variables that are common to the PSID and TAXSIM.

The set of common variables consists of: wife's earnings, husband's earnings, a

 dumxrry to indicate if the    wife is over 65   and   the number of exemptions. A
                                                                              Since earn-
 regression of      the wife's wage on her own earnings may seem strange.

 ings is the product of hours and the wage rate, it is an endogenous variable.

 This observation, though correct, is quite beside the point.          The purpose of the

 equation is not to estimate a structural equation, but merely to describe the

 conditional distribution of the wage rate on the common variables.

               The actual imputation applies the coefficient from the extraneous

 regression to the data in the TAXSIM       model.     To the conditional mean wage


 implied     by the regression is added a random selection from the set of residuals.
                                          —26-


                The
                key assumption for this procedure to be correct is that con-
 ditional on the common variables the wife's wage rate imist be linearly indepen-
 dent   of the other variables in the model. This seems quite reasonable in that

 once we know earnings, etc., knowledge of the wage probably contributes little

 to predicting taxable income. The independence assumption is not necessarily

 true. It may be that extensive deductions are associated with high reservation

wages, ceteris paribus. This would generate conditional dependence between the

true    value   of the imputed variable and another variable In the model which would

not be reflected in the imputation. Note that the presence of such dependence

cannot be tested. Any data set with which
                                                 the assumption might be tested would
be a candidate for the simulation itself, and would obviate the need for the

imputation procedure. In the absence of such dependence the synthetic data set

will display the correct variance—covariance structure and the simulations will

not be biased by the presence of error in the imputed variable. A ire detailed

justification and a complete specification for the imputation is contained in

Feenberg and Rosen [19801.

            Of
                 course, for non—working wives this procedure could not be iniple—
mented because of the need for a wage variable to
                                                  serve as a a regressand.

Instead, a procedure was followed similar to that suggested by Hall [1973J. We

estimated for the sample of working wives a regression of the wage rate on

husband's income, number of dependents and an over 65 dunirr' variable, and used

the results to impute wages to the non—workers.       As is well—known, this proce-
dure does not correct for the possible
                                           effects of selectivity bias. (See, e.g.,
Heckman [19791.) Given our paucity of explanatory variables, it seemed to us
                                        - 2—


pretentious     to attempt this rather subtle correction. ?oreover, Hausman [1980,

                has pointed out that in cases like ours, the correction usually

makes rio practical difference anyway.

IV:   Behavioral   Assumptions

      We now turn to the question of how, given our figures on wages, rates and

hours of work, we can simulate the effects of various tax changes on work effort

and the distribution of family income. In effect, our task is to specify the

function that relates hours of work to exogenous variables and the tax code.

The   framework used is the standard microeconoinic theory of the leisure—income
choice9. The theory views the hours of' work decision as an outcome when the
individual ximizes a utility      function   ubjCct to a budget constraint. ifl   part

A of   this section we discuss the budget constraint generated by the personal

income tax system, and in part B we explain how preferences are modelled.


A. The Budget Constraint

      Consider first the budget constraint faced by an untaxed individual with a

wage w and unearned income I. The constraint can be represented graphically on

a diagram with income plotted on the vertical axis, and hours of leisure on the

horizontal. In figure IV.l, if the individual's time endowment      is OT hours,
then   the budget constraint is a straight line MN with slope —w and vertical

intercept I(=TN). Behind the linear budget constraint are the assumptions that

the fixed costs associated with working are negligible, and that the gross wage

does not vary with hours of work. These assumptions are common to most studies

of labor supply. Although the consequences of relaxing them have been

discussed10, there is no agreement on whether they     are important empirically.
In    this study, we retain the conventional assumption that the pretax budget

constraint can be represented as a straight line.

      Assume now that the individual is subjected to a proportional tax on both

earned and unearned income. Then the effective budget constraint facing the

individual in figure IV.l is PQ, with the tax rate being NP/NT. Note that even

with such a simple tax system, one would have to know both the uncompensated

elasticity of hours with respect to the wage and the income elasticity in order

to predict the impact of taxes upon hours of work.

      Of course, the U.S. tax system is progressive with respect to taxable

income, not proportional. As an individual's income bracket changes, she

generally faces a discrete increase in the marginal tax rate. This leads to a

kinked budget constraint like RSUVW in figure IV.2. Observe that if the

individual's optimum is along (say) segment US, then she behaves exactly as if

optimizing along a linear budget constraint with the same slope as US, but with

intercept W'. This fact, which has been observed by Hall [19731 and others is

extremely   useful, because it allows us to characterize the individual's       oppor-

tunities as a series of straight lines. The distance TR' will be referred to as

"effective" non—labor income.

      Included in the tax code are a complicated set of exemptions, deductions,

and   credits. Conceptually, it is not difficult to      include their effects in the

budget   constraint ——   all that is required is that we be able to compute net
income at any     given number of hours of   work. It   should   be noted, however, that
some tax provisions actually lead to non—convexities in that there may be

several points at which indifference curves are tangent to the budget constraint

in order to find a global maximum. The specification of a complete utility

function    ——   not just a labor supply curve —— thus becomes a necessity.

i.     Functional   Form
       The standard static theory of labor supply behavior starts with a family
           function   which depends upon family income and the amounts of leisure
utility

time    consumed by each spouse. The labor supply of each spouse depends upon the
net wages of    both spouses and effective unearned income. Using several fairly
reasonable    assumptions, however, one can specify a family utility function with


only    two arguments: wife's leisure, and net family income. This simplification

is permi.ssable if the husband's labor supply is perfectly inelastic. In fact,
                                                                     have tended
many econometric studies of the labor supply behavior of married men

to show that both wage11 and income effects are small in absolute value12 We

therefore adopt the simpler model as a reasonable first approximation to

 reality.

        Now that we have decided upon the arguments for the utility function, we

 turn to the question of its      functional   form. In making a selection, two cri-

 terion are    important: Ci) It should be simple, both to limit computational
 costs    and to facilitate intuitive understanding of the results; and (ii) It
                                                   econometric estimates of labor supply.
 should be fairly broadly consistent with

        Recently, Hausman   [19801 has   suggested that one way   to   satisfy these cri-


 teria is to start with a labor supply function that fits the data fairly well,
 and then take advantage of duality theory to find the underlying (indirect) uti-
                                           Hausman observes that the linear labor supply
     lity function. More specifically,

     function has proved very useful in explaining labor supply behavior:


     (iv.i) H=aw+bA+S
                                                        —32-



where H is annual hours of work, v is the net wage, A is effective income, and
a, b, and s are parameters. Using Roy's Identity, which relates various deriva-

tives of the indirect utility function to H, Hausman shows that the indirect

utility function, v(v,A), underlying (iv.i) is


(IV.2)     v(w,A)     A +          w   —
                                           b2   +   b   e.
    Given the ranges over which a particular individual's v and A will vary in

our simulations, equations (Iv.i) and (Iv.2) seem to be adequate approximations,

and they are adapted for use in this paper. We assign each family a set of uti-

lity   function parameters calculated so that current behavior is perfectly pre-
dicted    by equation (111.1) Specifically, assume that the hours elasticity with

respect to the wage for the th family is A1. Then aj, bi and 5j      are   the solu-

tions to the system13:



                         Wi
(IV.3a)              =        ai
                         Hj
                         Ui
(Iv.3b)            A =   H


(IV.3c)            s =   H    — ajwi — bA1


2. Elasticity Estimates

       In order to solve equations (Iv.3), estimates of' wage and unearned income

elasticities for married women are required. The literature suggests fairly

high values for the wage elasticity. The studies reviewed by Heckman et al

119791    report   values between 0.2 and 1.35 (pp. 11.28, IV.3) and some investiga—
tars have proposed even larger estimates (see e.g. Block 119731 or Rosen

[19761). There is virtually no guidance with respect to how the wage elasticity

varies with income level. Indeed, due to the thinness of all statistical

samples in very high income groups (i,. family
                                                       income greater than $35,000 in

                            is known about the labor supply response of the women
l974) essentially

at the top end of the scale. Nor is anything knowr        about   the effect of the

number of dependents on the price or income elasticities, although the presence

of small children is known to reduce mean labor supply dramatically. We use a

conservative value of .5 in this paper.

    With respect to      we find that here also the literature provides less than

firm   guidance.   This is due in part   to   the problems involved in measuring


correctly   family unearned income. (Difficulties arise due to under_reporting,
estimating   imputed income from durable goods, etc.) In       addition, unearned
                                                    in hours equations, although
 income is usually treated as an exogenous variable
 in a life cycle context, it would be endogenouS.         Heckman and Killingsworth

                                                                       between —0.002
 [19791 report that most investigators have found values of

 and —2.    We use —0.1 in our simulations.
       The demand side of the labor market is not modeled, that is, it is assumed
 that the wage rate offered to married women will not be affected by the increase
 in supply. Given the small change in hours induced by the tax change relative
 to total hours in the econon, this is appropriate.


 3. Welfare Effects

       Given the explicit indirect utility function (IV.2) it is relatively
                                                                   variation for the
 straightforward to calculate a compensating or equivalent

  change in tax rates. ie choose the equivalent variation as our nasure of
                                              —3 4—



welfare    loss; it is defined as the sum of money necessary to restore an indivi-

dual to his original utility level, evaluated at the original prices. That is,

EN is defined by the implicit equation:


            v(w0, A1 +    Ev) = v(w1,   Al)


which evaluates to:




       The difference between the EN and the revenue loss of the change is an exact

measure of deadweight loss (Hausman [19811). The use of the Marshallian measure

(the area under the labor supply curve          between w and w0 minus the revenue loss)
would   not be justified.     Though the Marshallian consumer surplus measure is

ordinarily   an excellent approximation to the        compensating or equivalent

variation    (willig [1976]),   the same result does not hold for the corresponding

measure    of deadweight loss (Small and Rosen [1979], Hausman       [19811).   The abso-
lute   error inherent in Marshall's       measure of deadweight loss is the same   as the

error in his measure of consumer surplus, but relative to the smaller base the

percentage    error may   be iatch larger.

V. Results
    There are, of course, an essentially unlimited number of ways in which the

tax treatment of the family could be modified. The effects of a number of

alternatives, including voluntary or compulsory separate filing and a secondary

earner's credit are evaluated in Feenberg and Rosen 119801. In this paper only

the reforms enacted in the 1981 tax law are discussed.

    Each tax regime naturally induces a change in revenue collections. It is

possible that in practice legislators might   want   to introduce additional taxes

                                           finance a tax reduction with bonds or
to keep revenues constant, or they might

money. However, one cannot know in advance what form these adjustments might

take or what effects they might have. In the light of this ambiguity we have

 not attempted any equal revenue comparisons.

     The baseline data in table V.1 is taken from a stratified, random sample of

 tax returns taken from the U.S. Treasury l914 Tax Model. The subsample includes

 one in forty returns with non—working wives and one in twenty for couples with

 working wives. The data are extrapolated to reflect l9791 totals, and the 1979
                                                            federal income tax
 tax law is applied. The table shows adjusted gross income,

 liability, marginal tax rates on earned income, and the imputed hours of work
                                                                      that
 per year for the wives. As to the general trend of the table, we see
                                                                         worked
 average and marginal tax rates rise with AGI class. The number of hours

 tends to rise with income, but the relationship is not strictly increasing. As

 other family income increases there is an income effect which would decrease the

 number of hours that wives work if, as expected, leisure is a normal good.
                                      —36—



However, there is also a tendency for the wife's pretax wage to be positively

correlated with other family   income, which encourages work in the market
(assuming a positively sloped supply of hours schedule). One cannot say a

priori which effect will dominate.


 A. Secondary Earners Deduction

    Table IV.2 shows the effects of allowing the family   to deduct   10% of the

first $30,000 of secondary worker's earnings from taxable Income. A wage

elasticity of hours with respect to the net wage of 0.5 is assumed. In order to

maintain comparability with table IV.l, the adjusted gross income classes are

those associated with the status

   The deduction has a modest effect on labor supply. As a comparison with

table V.1 shows, On average wives supply 15 more hours per year. The increase

is most marked in the $30—$50,000 range, where the combination of a relatively

high marginal tax rate and labor force participation rate increase the effect.

    On the average, tax collections fall by about $72 (out of $16O2), and the

fall is greater in the higher brackets. For the sake of conparison we have

noted in the second column of table IV.2 what the revenue predictions would have

been had we postulated perfectly inelastic labor supplies for wives. The table

suggest that about one—third of the revenue loss is restored by the increased

tax base associated with the higher labor supply. Although this is considerably

short of the claims of some that reductions in rates will be self—financing, it

is significant enough to demonstrate the importance of incorporating endogenous

behavior response in revenue predictions. The final column shows the deadweight

loss of the deduction, evaluated according to the procedure given in 111.3.

Because all marginal rates are driven toward zero by the change, the deadweight

loss is always negative. The reader may note the relatively high ratio of dead-

weight loss to revenue at high income levels, reaching ten to one at the highest

 level.


 B. Child—Care Credit

     The child—care credit started as a deduction, but was converted to a credit

 in 1976. The current rule allows 20% of dependent care expenses to be taken as

 a credit against tax due. Expenses are limited by the secondary earner's actual

 earnings, and by $2000 for each dependent up to two such dependents. The 1981

law raises the dollar limit to $21400, but also introduces a sliding scale for
the       credit which increases the rate by 1% for each $2000 that the taxpayer's

income falls short of $30,000 with a maximum        rate   of 30%.

          The effect of the child—care credit on the wife's marginal after—tax wage

rate is quite a bit more complicated and less exactly modelled than the secon-

dary earner' a deduction. There are three paths for the credit to affect the
after tax wage. First, the expenses subject to the credit are limited by the
aunt of earnings         for the secondary worker (or $166/month for a full—time

student).        Second, changes   in earnings will affect AGI which in turn will affect

the       percentage credit allowed for individuals with AGI between $10,000 and
$30,0001. Thirdly, changes in hours presumably affect the actual expenditures
required for child care. The exact specification of           this   last relationship is
obviously not possible, we make the         simplifying assumption that marginal expen-

diture on child—care equals average expenditure on child—care.             That is,   expen-

ses       will be proportional to hours of work supplied. Of the three effects, it is

the first that Is most affected by the liberalization of the credit.


      !
             single parents are eligible for the credit, only married couples
          Although
are included in the simulation, chiefly because little is known about the labor
supply response of single men and women15. The same wage and income elastici-
 ties are used as for the secondary earner deduction simulation, in the absence
 of       evidenceto the contrary)-6
           Table V.24 shows the effects of liberalizing the child—care credit. For
moderate incomes the feedback of the secondary earner's wages into the credit

rate acts to raise the marginal tax rate. This lowers the after—tax wage rate,

and when combined with the reduction in tax liability caused by the increased

size of the credit results in a substantial decline in hours worked. Below

$10,000, only   the   income effect is present, but the ten point increase in the

amount of the credit leads to a similar effect. The       overall effect is a four
hour   reduction in annual work effort. The $29 loss of revenue is accompanied by

a $1_5 increase in deadweight loss. While the credit may have been intended to

encourage mothers to enter the labor force, because it is keyed to expenses but

not to earnings it cannot have that effect. An exception to that rule would be

the    rare case where child—care expenses exceeded earnings, in which case the
after—tax wage rate is     raised by 20 to 30 percent   of the pretax level. This
applies   to only 2% of our sample.

       Because marginal rates are raised, the deadweight loss of this tax reduction

is positive, a remarkable event, although not without precedent.

 VI.   Concluding Remarks

       The departure froia marriage neutrality under the current U.S. income tax

 system is quite substantial. The average amount of penalty paid by the 18.7

 million couples whose tax liability would be lower if they were allowed to file

 as single individuals is $1481 and the corresponding gain for each of the 20.3

 million couples who benefit from joint filing is a startling $113. Only six

 percent of couples are not affected.

       We have seen that no positive income tax system can achieve the simultan-

eous goals of marriage neutrality, horizontal equity, and progressivity, and

that    it   might be expected that a device such as the secondary earner's deduction

might enhance the first goal at the expense of the latter.      However, the success

of the SED in reducing the marriage penalty is more than matched by its success

in increasing the marriage benefit for those couples who benefit, and by the

transfer of many couples from the penalty to bonus categories. The net result

is a slight increase in the average deviation from neutrality.

       The SED also leads to a slight increase in labor supply by married women ——

perhaps 15 hours per woman per year. The behavioral response has a significant

effect on the estimated revenue cost of the deduction, reducing that estimate by

about one—third to $72 per joint return. The reduction in deadweight loss

(relative to a non—distorting distribution of the same reduction in revenue) is

about twice the revenue loss.

       While popular literature has emphasized the equity argument for a special

treat.inent   of secondary earners, we have seen that the deduction can be recom-
mended only for its positive efficiency effect.

   A similar examination of the liberalized child—care credit leads to the

conclusion that it is a tax reduction which lowers after—tax wage rates. The

average recepient of the credit gains about $29 in tax reductions but works

about 4 hours less. There is a net increase in deadweight loss of $4—S.

       1. A corehensive history of the controversy is given in Munnell [1978].

Also see June O'Neill's paper in this volume.


       2. This argument implicitly assumes that a husband's labor supply is not

sensitive to tax rate changes generated by his wife's earnings.


       3. Peter Mi.eszkovski and John Shoven have both pointed out that a propor-

tional income tax could be combined with a uniform lump sum capitation grant to

each individual. The resulting tax and transfer system could be quite

progressive, at least at low to moderate income levels, if the lump       sum grant
were   sufficient],y generous, and the system would clearly be neutral with respect
to marriage. In 19T9 aggregate adjusted gross income was 1,464 billion, which

yielded revenues of 211e billion. Given the population (220 million) and

assuming   static behavior a simple arithmetic   identity   yields the marginal   tax

rate necessary to raise the same revenue. That rate is 0.15 for a lump sum
grant of zero, and increases by 0.015 for each $100 of the grant. While a
system of this kind has many attractions, surely marriage neutrality is among
the least of them.

       4. Because the credit is available to married or single individuals,

changes in   the child—care credit do not strictly affect the marriage tax. It is
included here   because marriage and children are still intimately related for

xxst   Americans.

      5.        In part III the issue of data—imputation is taken more seriously, but

the imputation of deduction is a peripheral issue in this section and the

description Of the procedure is relegated to this note. Each couple on the CPS

tape was assigned an amount of deductable expense chosen randomly from those

joint returns on the 1977 Tux Model with the same income and number of children.

Returns were grouped in brackets $1500 wide and families with more than four

children are grouped together.



       6. In order to bring all figures to 1979 levels, we increase all dollar

aunts by the proportional change in taxable income from 197k or 1977 to 1979,

and   increase the number of returns according to the      growth of the population.



           7.   It has been used, for example, to create the Brookings MERGE file. See

Pechman and Okner (19714].


           8. Criteria for doing the matching are discussed by Kadane [19781 and   Barr

and   Turner [19781.


       9.       For a comprehensive discussion of the theory the reader is referred to

Heckman, et al, [19791.


       10. Hausman [1980] analyzes a model with fixed costs of work, and Rosen

 (19761 discusses a model in which full and part time workers receive different

 hourly wages.


       11.       This includes own and cross wage effects. For households in which the

 wife is the primary earner, i.e., her earnings exceed her husband's, the wife's

 labor supply is assumed to be perfectly inelastic.

    12. See, for example, Heckinan et al [19T9, pp. 11.28, 11.341. Hausrnan

119801    also   finds a small wage effect, but a fairly substantial income effect.


    13.     Clearly, this   procedure cannot be implemented for non—workers. For

these individuals, the following ad hoc procedure is used: calculate the average

H, w, and A for members of the individual's group who work between zero and one

hundred hours. Substitute these means into system (Iv.3),      and   use the implied

values of a, b, and s for non—workers.


    13.    The extrapolation to 1983 seemed too extreme.


    15. This included T0% of returns claiming the credit in 1977.


    16. In the secondary earner's deduction simulation inelastic response was

assumed for the primary earner, and elastic response only for the female secon-
dary earner. With the 1977 data the sex of taxpayers is unknown and a few male
secondary earners are inevitably given an elastic labor supply response.
