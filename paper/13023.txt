Regionalization, Changes in Home Bias, and the Growth of World Trade

JEL No. F1

                                                ABSTRACT

In this paper we use numerical modeling methods to quantitatively assess the impacts of changes in
home bias within regions on the growth of world trade among major blocs over the last three decades.
Existing work focuses on the impacts of trade barrier, transport cost and income changes on trade growth,
rather than preferences. Removing changes in home bias over the last three decades from our global
general equilibrium model reduces world trade by 27% compared to actual world trade in 2004 in
our central case scenario. These results support the view that world trade among major blocs has became
more regionalized rather than internationalized which we suggest may be due to a proliferation of
free trade agreements. We calibrate a simple global trade model of inter bloc trade to both 1975 and
2004 data and substitute different calibrated parameters from the two data sets between model parameterizations.
Our results suggest that if changes over time in home bias involving different regionally sourced goods
in a multi-region multi product model are removed, substantial effects follow for the growth of world
trade in the last three decades. Home bias changes in developed and developing economies reduce
world trade by 8% and 19% respectively, suggesting that regionalization is more pronounced in developing
country trade. Our results also indicate that income growth, income convergence, and falling trade
costs explain 76%, 4%, and 7% respectively of the growth of world trade over the last three decades.

    1. Introduction




     In this paper we analyze the impacts of changing preferences for different regionally

sourced goods over the last 3 decades in a global Armington model of trade and production

involving major trading blocs which is calibrated to both 1975 and 2004 data. Contrary to the

conventional view that globalization is fuelling world trade growth, we find a trend of

international trade regionalization among blocs. Our results suggest that pro region product

preference changes in the last three decades may have reduced world trade by 27% relative to

2004 levels (US$ 1.7 trillion), with separate preference changes in developed and developing

economies reducing world trade by 8% and 19%, respectively. We interpret these results as

indicating that regionalization, perhaps due to a growing role for regional trade agreements, is

growing in importance in the global economy. Results also indicate that income growth

(modeled by allowing regional endowments to grow at the same rate), income convergence, and

falling trade costs explain 76%, 4%, and 7% of the growth of world trade in the last three

decades, respectively.




    We generate these results using a numerical general equilibrium model of the global

economy. We use a pure exchange model to allow us to concentrate on demand side effects. In

this model we group the world into 8 regions, the EU (25), developed North America (the U.S.



                                               3
and Canada), Japan, developed Oceania (Australia and New Zealand), developing America,

developing Africa, developing Asia and Oceania, other Europe and CIS. We use 3-level nested

CES (constant elasticity of substitution) preferences to represent each region’s preference

structure. We then assess the impacts of various changes in preferences on the growth of world

trade.




    Classical trade theory typically focuses on the determinants of international trade in a

variety of models; Ricardian, specific factors, Heckscher-Ohlin, and monopolistically

competitive (market structure). World trade has increased by 10 times (in nominal terms) over

the last three decades and a growing literature attempts to explain this rapid growth (Deardorff

(1984), Leamer and Levinsohn (1995), Krugman (1995)). Trade liberalization (reduction of

trade barriers), transportation cost reductions, income convergence and economic growth are

the four most cited factors in this literature. (Helpman (1987), Hummels and Levinsohn

(1995)) .More recently, Yi (2003), Feenstra (1998), Hummels, Rapoport and Yi (1998) have also

stressed the role of outsourcing (vertical specialization, or disintegration of production) in

surging international trade flows. Baier and Bergstrand (2001) decompose international trade

growth in OECD countries using a gravity model. Their results show that income convergence

explains little of the world trade growth, while income growth, reductions in tariffs and

transportation costs explain 67%, 26%, and 8% respectively of the growth. These three factors


                                               4
also collectively explain around 40% of the variation in trade growth leaving the remaining 60%

unexplained.



   As noted by Leamer and Levinsohn (1995) conventional trade models largely concentrate

on production side sources of comparative advantage. Only a small number of studies,

originating with Linder (1961) and reflected in recent applications of the gravity model, attempt

to investigate the determinants of trade from the demand-side1 . Armington (1969) type

general equilibrium trade models assume that different country source goods are imperfect

substitutes in demand and that this gives rise to trade between countries.



   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model that we use to explore the

impacts of preference changes on world trade. The data we use in calibration of the numerical

model to 1975 and 2004 benchmarks are also reported. In section 3 counterfactual experiment

results assessing the impact of changing preferences on world trade growth are set out. Section

4 draws conclusions and briefly discusses further issues.

       Using a gravity model and econometric methods Baier and Bergstrand (2005) also find that free

trade agreements increase members’ trade but the effects of FTAs on members’ trade with nonmembers

and trade among nonmembers is not analyzed.

2. A Global Numerical General Equilibrium Model, Data, and Model Calibration


   Model Structure


   We use a numerical pure exchange global general equilibrium model of 8 blocs (or regions)

in which each region is endowed only with one good to explore the impact of preference

changes on the growth of world trade. These are the EU (25), the US and Canada, Japan,

Developed Oceania, Developing America, Developing Africa, Developing Asia Oceania, and

other Europe and US. The use of a pure exchange model of this simplified form allows us to

focus centrally on demand-side factors behind world trade growth. We incorporate 3 level

nested CES preferences in all regions. In the model prices and trade flows are endogenously

determined with regional endowments exogenously given.


   Each region is assumed to have representative consumer who maximizes utility by first

choosing among home and foreign goods as composites. Each region then chooses among two

different composite foreign country goods at a 2nd level, from developed and developing

economies. At the bottom level of the nesting structure, each region then chooses further

among individual developed and developing economy goods. The additional nesting among

developed and developing countries allows for a separate determination of home bias effects in

those two groups of regions.

where s is a typical region, and i ∈ (s, s*), where s* represents foreign goods for all other regions

than s represented as a single composite good. α si is the first-stage Armington share parameter,

xsi is region s’s consumption of goods supplied by region i; and σ s (=1/(1- ρ s )) is the elasticity

of substitution between home and foreign goods in region s.


    Each of the five regions faces a top level budget constraint involving home and foreign

goods, written as


                           ∑
                          i =1to 2

where X s is the endowment of region s own good, p s is the price of the region s own good,

I s is the income of region s (determined by the endowment of region specific goods, prices,

and inter-regional transfers, if any); pss* is the regional aggregate price index of foreign goods

consumed by s, which in turn is given by a true cost of living price index constructed using the

second and third level preferences for the region; and pss is the price of home goods.


    First order conditions yield top level consumption of home and foreign goods in region s,

once the price indices for composite goods are determined, as

    Equilibrium


    For this pure exchange economy, a global equilibrium involves endogenously determined

prices for region specific goods such that

where x s are the endowments of goods in region s.



    In a trade costless world,


                                                p ss ' = p s '                                   (9)


and as only relative prices are of any consequence, we can set the price of the U.S. good to one

as the numerare, ie.




                                                                  9

    If transportation costs and tariff revenue are included in the model, prices in each region

are linked and


                                         p ss ' = p s ' (1 + t ss ' )(1 + τ ss ' )                                                 (11)


where p s ' reflects the sellers price received by region s’ and p ss ' is the buying price of region

s’ good in region s for the representative consumer in g, and t ss ' is the proportional

transportation cost per unit from s ' to s , and τ ss ' is the tariff rate in s on the good imported

from s ' .


    Assuming the importing region fully bears transportation costs, the income of region s is

given by

where the final term is tariff revenues assumed redistributed in lump sum form to the

representative consumer in s. In equilibrium, in this case, if transportation costs are

denominated in terms of the good transported, demands equal endowments less transportation

costs, and government budgets in each region balance in terms of tariff revenues collected and

redistributed.

Handbook of Statistics (UNCTAD, 2006) and International Trade Statistics 2005 (WTO, 2006) and

are valued on a F.O.B. basis. We have also included in the trade data international service trade

flows which are also obtained from the Handbook of Statistics (Tables 5.1, UNCTAD, 2006).

Intra-region trade (largely within the EU 25) is not included in international trade flows in the

model data under this treatment. To calculate these, we decompose service trade flow data for

the regions weighted by their export and import shares in regional exports and imports

separately, and take the average of international trade flows in services. We use the shares in

1980 to represent the corresponding shares in 1975 since the data set starts from 1980. We treat

the EU (25) as a single regional bloc even though the EU was smaller in earlier years.


   Tariff and non-tariff data are from Whalley (1985) for 1975 and Anderson and van

Wincoop (2004) for 2004. Transportation cost data reflect differences between import data of

importing countries and export data of exporting regions as in the Handbook of Statistics

(UNCTAD, 2006).


   To calibrate share parameters in preferences for the model, we use the same elasticity

parameters employed by Whalley and Xin (2006) in a recent modeling evaluation of Canada US

home bias in a global model. We use an elasticity of substitution of 2.0 for the top level




                                               11
sub-utility function in each region, 2.5 for the second level sub-utility functions between the

foreign developed and developing country goods, and 3.0 for the bottom level preferences in

each region.


   Using these elasticity parameters and the 1975 and 2004 benchmark data we calibrate model

share parameters for all three levels of preferences using first order conditions for utility

maximizing behaviour. One way to evaluate whether the preferences of each region exhibit

home bias or not is to also calibrate share parameters using trade neutral data absent of trade

effects for the same year. The procedures to be employed in doing this involve keeping each

regions total imports constant but replacing actual bilateral trade flows by trade data which are

proportional to income allowing for trade costs and recalibrating the model (see Whalley and

Xin (2006)). The parameterizations generated both by using actual and synthetic trade neutral

data for both 1975 and 2004 are reported in Tables 1 and 2.


   These calibrated parameters not only suggest that preferences are not neutral within regions,

but that there have been changes in preference structure in most regions in the last three

decades. Comparing the differences between the share parameters calibrated to the observed

data and neutral trade data suggests that in all regions except developed North America,

developed Oceania, and developing America there is more bias in regional preferences for

home goods in 2004 than in 1975. There is almost no change in home bias in developed




                                               12
Oceania, while developed North America and developing America have become less home

biased over the last three decades. These comparisons imply that international trade might have

grown faster than otherwise if the 1975 preferences had persisted to 2004 and in this sense

regionalization in the global economy has become more intense. We quantitatively assess the

impacts of these changes in preferences on trade flows both jointly and separately in the next

section. These preference changes thus underline the importance of examining the causes of

growth of international trade from the demand side rather than the supply side only.

3. Using 1975 and 2004 Calibrated Models to Assess the Impacts of Preference Changes

on World Trade


    We have used our model calibrations for 1975 and 2004 to assess the impacts of preference

changes on the growth of world trade. To do this, we use counterfactual analyses in which we

jointly or separately substitute share parameters in preferences at different levels of the nesting

structure in different regions between calibrations for the two years. We can substitute the

parameters calibrated to 1975 data with parameters calibrated to 2004 data jointly or separately

to obtain counterfactual trade flows in 1975. We can also substitute the parameters calibrated

using 2004 data with parameters calibrated using 1975 data jointly or separately to obtain

counterfactual trade flows in 2004. The differences between counterfactual and actual trade

flows can then be attributed to changes in preferences.


    Counterfactual experiment results on 2004 trade flows in Table 3 show the impacts of

changes in preferences for different region source goods between 1975 and 2004. In these we

substitute 1975 preference shares into the model parameterization for 2004 and recompute an

equilibrium. We can do this for all or each level of nest separately, and / or for individual sub

groups, or all regions. These results show that preferences changes within these blocs have had

substantial negative effects on the growth of world trade over the period of evaluation. Results

imply that preference changes in the last three decades have reduced world trade by 27% (US$




                                                16
1.7 trillion). Changing preferences only in developed or developing economies reduces world

trade by 8% and 19%, respectively. Further decomposition results indicate that preference

changes in the EU and Developing Asia and Oceania reduce world trade by 12% (US$ 0.73

trillion) and 14% (US$ 0.910 trillion) of 2004 world trade, respectively. Preference changes in

Japan reduce world trade by 5%, developing Asia 2%, other Europe and CIS 2%. In contrast,

preference changes in developed America result in an increase of 8% (US$ 490 billion) in world

trade in 2004, and in developing America of 1%.


   Results also show that preference changes only at the top level in all regions reduce world

trade by 32% in 2004(US$ 2.04 trillion). For the developed economies the reduction is 12%

(US$ 0.75 trillion) and for the developing economies 19% (US$ 1.19 trillion). Preference

changes at the second level reduce world trade by a small amount (less than 1%) and at the

bottom level, and in contrast, increase world trade by around 5% (US$ 0.32 trillion). These

results imply that changes in preferences by level also have significant impacts on world trade.


   These results thus show that if the 1975 preference structure had persisted into 2004, world

trade in 2004 would have been 27% higher than actual world trade. If instead the 1975

preference structure had been replaced by that of 2004, parallel results (not reported in detail

here) suggest that world trade in 1975 would be 18% lower than actual world trade (Table 4).

These results thus support the position that in contrast to the conventional view of

globalization of the world economy fuelling world trade growth, international trade among


                                               17
major trade blocs has generally become more regionalized rather than globalized over the last

three decades.

   Our numerical model and calibrated parameters also allow us to assess the impacts of

changes in income levels, income convergence, and trade costs on world trade growth in a multi

region general equilibrium model in contrast to the gravity model used by Baier and Bergstrand

(2001). Results are reported in Table 4. They suggest that income growth (modelled as growth

in regional endowments) resulted in US$ 5.2 trillion world trade in 2004 and explains 76% of

the growth of world trade in the last three decades. Income convergence explains a further 4%

of the growth of world trade. Falling trade costs (tariffs, non-tariffs, and transportation costs)

collectively contribute around 7% of the growth of world trade in the last three decades.

4. Concluding Remarks


   Ignoring preference change can be misleading in any assessment of cause of global trade

growth. Here, we use a 3-level nested CES numerical model of a global pure exchange economy

composed of 8 bloc regions; the EU(25), developed North America, Japan, developed Oceania,

developing America, developing Africa, developing Asia and Oceania, other Europe and CIS

and calibrate our model to data for 1975 and 2004. We are then able to replace preferences of

one year by those of another allowing for an assessment of the contribution of preference

change to world trade. Model results suggest that changes in preferences for different regionally

sourced goods have had substantially negative effects on the growth of world trade among

major blocs over the last three decades. Thus, in contrast to the conventional view of

globalization of the world economy, we find a trend of international trade regionalization

among major blocs.


     In conclusion, we note that our analysis raises as well as resolves a number of issues. Why

preferences within blocs for own goods have changed in this way is not analyzed, and may well

reflect increased inter bloc trade from regional trade agreements (although this would not be the

case in Japan). Also, we have not analyzed whether regionalization is also occurring within blocs

due to the added detail involved in data. We leave these issues for further work.
