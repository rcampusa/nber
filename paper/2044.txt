     Empirical Structural Evidence on Wages, Prices and Employment in the US




                                     ABSTRACT



     In this paper, I investigate US post war price, wage and employment

dynamics by identifying and estimating a price and a wage equation. I reach

the following two main conclusions

     Nominal wages adjust faster to prices than prices do to nominal wages.

This may be taken as evidence that price inertia is more important

empirically than nominal wage inertia.

     The wage equation implies that the effect on wage inflation of a

permanent increase in unemployment, given prices, is largely temporary.

This can be interpreted in various ways. One is that, if the wage equation

is interpreted as a Phillips curve, both the rate of change and the level

of unemployment play an important role in wage determination.

     The methodology of the paper is somewhat different from the

traditional approach to the estimation of price and wage equations. Its

spirit is to impose on the reduced form a just identifying set of

restrictions. In this way, a structural interpretation is made possible,

while the data are left free to speak.

     In this paper, I investigate US post war price, wage and employment dynamics by

identifying and estimating a price and a wage equation. I reach the following two

main conclusions

     Nominal wages adjust faster to prices than prices do to nominal wages. This may

be taken as evidence that price inertia is more important empirically than nominal

wage inertia.

     The wage equation implies that the effect on wage inflation of a permanent

increase in unemployment, given prices, is largely temporary. This can be interpreted

in various ways. One is that, if the wage equation is interpreted as a Phillips

curve, both the rate of change and the level of unemployment play an important role

in wage determination.



     The methodology of the paper is somewhat different from the traditional approach

to the estimation of price and wage equations. Its spirit is to impose on the reduced

form a just identifying set of restrictions. In this way, a structural interpretation

is made possible, while the data are left free to speak. This methodology is an

extension of that introduced in Blanchard and Watson (1986). It is related to the

approaches of Hall (1979) ,   Taylor   (1984) and more recently Bernanke (1985) and Sims

 (1986).

      The paper is organized as follows

      Section 1 presents the model and the conceptual and econometric issues

associated with estimation. Section 2 gives the results of estimation of the reduced

 form. Section 3 discusses identification and presents estimates of the structural
                                       2

model under alternative identification restrictions. Section 4 studies the

characteristics of the wage and price equations. Section 5 concludes.




                               model



     I start by defining the structural model I want to recover and the associated

reduced form.

     Let P, W and N be the logarithms of the price level, nominal wage and

employment. Let Y be the vector [P W N]'. Let X be the vector of variables which

affect either price or wage decisions, or aggregate demand. Then the structural

model is defined as



     (1) A Y =   A(L) Y(—l) + B(L,) X +    e




     where A is a 3x3 matrix, normalized so that the diagonal elements are equal to

unity. A(L) and B(L) are matrix lag polynomials of order k, and e is a vector of iid

disturbances, with covariance matrix V.

     The three structural equations have the following interpretation. The first two

give the prices and wages as set by price and wage setters respectively, as a

function of current and lagged values of wages, prices and employment, of other

variables included in X, and of disturbance terms ep in the price equation, ew in the

wage equation. The third equation gives employment as the derived demand for labor

given the production function and aggregate demand, and may also depend on current

and lagged values of wages, prices and employment, other variables in X and a

disturbance term en.
                                          3

     It is useful to give two simple examples of such a system. Ignoring for

notational simplicity X variables and disturbances, the first one is given by

     P = V +     ai   N - a2   N(-l)
     V = P +     bi   N — bz N(—1)

     N =   -ci   P

     Firms set prices as a function of wages and the level and rate of change of

employment. This price equation can be rewritten with employment on the left, giving

employment as a function of the real wage and lagged employment. A similar

interpretation holds for the wage equation, which can be rewritten as a dynamic labor

supply function. The last equation gives the employment level given aggregate demand,

which is itself assumed to be a decreasing function of the price level. This system

is thoroughly classical, with employment and real wages being determined by the first

two equations, and the price level by the third. Apart from the treatment of

expectations (to which I return below), it is similar to the model developed by

Sargent (1979) and Kennan (1985).

     The second example is, in contrast, closer to the "wage price mechanism"

described by Tobin in 1972. It is given by, again ignoring X variables and

disturbances



     V = W(—l) +       a   (P(—l)—P(—2)) + az N

     N =   -ci   P

     Price setters mark up over wages. Wages are determined by a Phillips curve

relation. Aggregate demand is a decreasing function of the price level. In this case,

because of the dynamic relation between wages and prices, aggregate demand can affect

employment and affects the dynamics of prices, nominal wages and the real wage. This

model underlies much of the empirical work on prices and wages.
                                         4




    The r!4i_c&fcrn! associated with model (1) is given by

        '1 =   A-'A(L)   Y(—l) +   A-'B(L)   X + A-1e,

    or defining matrix polynomials C(L) and D(L) appropriately,

     (2) Y = C(L) Y(-l) + D(L) X + u         ,   E(uu')   S =   A'V   A''


     Assuming for the moment that X and u are uncorrelated, the reduced form (2) can

be estimated by OLS. To go from (2) to (1) requires knowledge of the matrix A, which

gives the contemporaneous interactions between Ii, P and N. The strategy of the paper

will be to use information from estimated 2, the covariance matrix of the reduced

form, as well as a priori restrictions on both V. the structural covariance matrix,

and A, to construct A and go from (2) to (1).

     Before estimation proceeds, I briefly discuss four issues.



     1. Is (1) a structural model ?



     It may be validly argued that the model given by (1) is not "structural".

Structural equations would treat expectations explicitly and distinguish between the

dynamic structure of the equation and the dynamic of the structural disturbance tern.

Model (1) can then be thought of as derived from a structural model, where

expectations have been solved out, and the equations have been transformed —

premultiplied   by the appropriate lag polynomial— to have white noise disturbance

terms. The reason for working with model (1) is clear : it is relatively easy to go

from (2) to (1). The shortcomings are equally clear and have been pointed out by

Lucas ; care must be used in the interpretation of the lag structures of the

estimated equations in (1). With this caveat in mind, I shall keep using the word
                                   5


"structural" to denote (1) and refer when needed to the underlying model with

expectations and serially correlated disturbances as "deep structural" (This

convenient expression was coined by Sargent).



     2. Are there restrictions on (2) ?



     The question arises of whether theory imposes any restriction on the reduced

form (2) which should be imposed in estimation. The answer is yes.

     Barring money illusion, all deep structural models must have an homogeneity

property, namely that a proportional increase of all nominal variables, including

expected and lagged nominal variables, leaves all real variables unchanged.

Equivalently, the sum of coefficients on nominal variables, actual, expected or

lagged, in each equation, must be equal to one if the left hand side variable is

nominal, to zero if it is real. The question is whether this property applies to (1)

and in turn to (2).

     The answer is that this property will apply if expectations of nominal variables

depend on nominal variables with sums of coefficients equal to one. This will in turn

hold, under rational expectations, if the equation characterizing the process

generating nominal money has sum of coefficients on nominal variables equal to one.

This is shown in appendix 1. If money is exogenous, this will be true if the process

generating nominal money has a unit root. All nominal variables appear empirically to

have unit roots in our sample and the condition is likely to have been satisfied. It

will therefore be imposed in estimation below.



     3. How to treat the X variables in (2) ?
                                      6




     The reduced form (2) includes a set of variables X which are left unexplained.

If such variables were not included, if for example we only estimated the trivariate

representation of V. P and N, it would be impossible to go from such an estimated

representation to a form like (1) ,   to   give a structural interpretation to the

results'

     The X variables may however be correlated with the white noise disturbances e.

They may a priori fall into three categories. They may be contemporaneously

uncorrelated with e. They may be contemporaneously correlated with e, but not affect

Y contemporaneously. They may be contemporaneously correlated with e and affect Y

contemporaneously. In the first case, current and lagged X can be included without

bias. In the second case, only lagged X's should included. In the third, the X

variable must be treated as an endogenous variable and the size of the Y vector

accordingly increased.

     The X variables I shall use fall in three categories (The exact list will be

given in the next section). The first are tax rates, which probably belong to the

first category above. The second are relative prices. These prices are partly

determined in commodity markets and thus are likely to respond within the quarter

 (which is the time unit we use) to unexpected movements in e ; but they are likely to

have a slow effect on aggregate prices, wages and employment. Treating them as

belonging to the second category above is likely to imply only a small bias. The

third category are policy variables such as nominal money. Like relative prices,

nominal money is likely to be affected contemporaneously by e, but not to affect much




A similar approach was advocated by Gordon and King (1982) , who call it
"hybrid VAR methodology".
                                            7

    p. w and n within the quarter2.

         Therefore, in estimation below, the maintained assumption —which is in effect a

    set of identification restrictions— will be that the X variables have no

    contemporaneous effect on W, P and N and only lagged values of X's will be used in

    (2). (An alternative assumption is to use current and lagged values of tax rates, and
*
    lagged values of the other variables. The results we emphasize below are robust to
    using this alternative assumption)



         4. Should variables be specified in levels or                   ?




         Technically, whether Y variables should be specified in levels or first

    differences depends on the number of unit roots in the polynomial (A—A(L)L), or

    equivalently (I—C(L)L), which characterizes the process followed by W, P and N

    conditional on X.

         If this polynomial has three unit roots, then taking first differences is

    appropriate and leads to consistent estimates of C(L) and D(L), and allows to use

    standard hypothesis tests, i.e. to do tests using standard distributional

    assumptions.

         As we shall see, the empirical evidence, although not clear cut, suggests that

     (I—C(L)L) has less than three unit roots. If this is the case, first differencing Y

    would yield inconsistent estimates. This leaves the following choice : One can either

    do cointegrated estimation of the system (2), or one can do estimation in levels.




    2    See for example Barro and Rush (1980) or )lishkin (1983), or the older evidence
    on the monetary mechanism. Much of this evidence is based on econometrics which do
    not pay full attention to the issue of simultaneity. The simultaneity bias works
    however in the direction of finding a contemporaneous effect of money on output where
    in fact there is none.
                                        8

Cointegrated estimation, conditional on the correct assumption as to the number of

roots, yields consistent estimates and allows to use standard hypothesis tests (see

Granger and Engle 1985, Stock 1985); if the assumption about the number of roots is

incorrect, estimates will be inconsistent. Estimation in levels yields consistent

estimates but the distribution of estimates is non standard, making standard

hypothesis testing potentially misleading (Phillips and Durlauf 1985). I shall in the

text report the results of estimation in levels, but report in appendix 2 the results

of cointegrated estimation. Results are, for the most part, similar.




     Section 2 Estimation of the reduced form



     1. The choice of variables




     I shall report results of estimation using the following variables for W, P and

N (all variables are quarterly):

     V is the logarithm of average hourly earnings in manufacturing

     P is the logarithm of the CPI for wage earners, excluding shelter

     N is the logarithm of civilian employment



     We know that a more detailed reduced form would include for example at least

two price indices, one relevant to workers such as the CPI, one to firms such as the

GNP deflator or the PPI. The choice here is to limit ourselves to only three

endogenous variables and thus to choose only one price index. One wants however to

know whether using one price index or another makes a difference to the main
                                         9


conclusions. Thus, I have also studied two alternative systems, one in which the GNP

deflator replaces the CPI and one in which unemployment replaces employment3. While

the three systems have somewhat different dynamics, the two main conclusions stated

in the introduction hold across alternative specifications. I shall indicate major

differences between the three systems in footnotes along the way.



     The vector X includes the following variables

     Xl is a linear time trend

     X2 is the logarithm of the crude materials PPI, minus p

     X3 is the logarithm of the crude fuel PPI, minus p

     X4 is the direct tax rate, from Poterba, Rotemberg Summers (1985)

     X5 is the indirect tax rate, same source

     X6 is the logarithm of Ml

     X7 is a set of 4 separate dummies for 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975

     X8 is a set of 4 seasonal dummies



     This list is based on a review of past empirical work and includes variables

which plausibly enter one or more of the structural equations and have been found to

be important by others. The separate dummies for 1972 to 1975 are introduced to

capture the effects of price and wage controls, following the work of Gordon t1983].




      The variables I use for the results reported in the paper are the same as those
 used by Sargent (1978). Empirical studies differ widely in the variables which are
 used : Altonji (1982) uses an overall wage index, the GNP deflator and manufacturing
 employment. Geary and Kennan (1984) use manufacturing average hourly earnings, the
 PPI for manufacturing and industrial production. Ashenfelter and Card (1982) use
 manufacturing hourly earning, the CPI and the unemployment rate. Poterba, Rotemberg
 and Summers (1985) use manufacturing average hourly earnings, the CPI and GNP.
                                        10




     2he_cicpfs ample and subsample stability


     Gordon has documented that the behavior of prices is quite different pre and

post 1954. Thus, I have chosen the period of estimation to be 1954—4 to 1984—4. Even

for this period, I find evidence of subsample instability, for each of the equations

and for the reduced form as a whole ; results are reported in appendix 34 There is

no clear break point, which suggests slowly changing coefficients rather than two

different regimes. Thus, rather than dividing the sample, I estimate the sample as a

whole, but with the caveat that reported coefficients may be means of coefficients

which have slowly changed during the sample'.



     3. The reduced form



     The results of estimation are presented in table l. tests indicate that three

lags on X and Y variables are sufficient to capture the dynamics of the reduced form.

The table has five parts

     The first part reports point estimates of the coefficients on the lagged

endogenous variables, obtained by OLS. The second reports the results of estimation




     The evidence presented by others is mixed. Gordon and King (1982) find stability
of their price equation, allowing however for a shift in the coefficient on lagged
prices after 1966. The increase over time in the coefficient on the proxy for
expected inflation in the Phillips curve is a matter of record. Englander and Los
(1983) however conclude, using a battery of tests, that the Phillips curve has been
approximately stable since 1961.
'    An alternative is to allow for random coefficients, as suggested by Sims (1982).
The specification of the randomness combined with the other constraints imposed in
estimation introduces additional conceptual and econometric issues, and this is left
to future research.

         As the reduced form equations are linear combinations of the structural

    equations, it makes little sense to examine the pattern of coefficients in table 1 in

    detail. I shall limit myself to the following remarks

         The unconstrained reduced form equations nearly satisfy the homogeneity

    restriction. Thus when imposed, the restriction changes the point estimates little

    and is easily accepted.

         The time trends play a quantitatively small role, especially when the

    homogeneity restriction is imposed.

         The X variables play a statistically significant role in all equations, so that

    the estimated reduced form is significantly different from a trivariate

    representation of P, W and N.

          The estimated correlation matrix of reduced form disturbances, has only one

    significant off diagonal element, the correlation between the reduced form price and

    employment disturbances7.




    6    As mentioned above, such tests have non standard distributions in the presence
•
    of unit roots, so that reported significance levels may be misleading. Test
    statistics, computed from cointegrated estimation under the assumption of the
    presence of one unit root, have however, if the assumption of one unit root is
    correct, standard asymptotic distributions and are reported in the appendix. The
    conclusions given in the text below hold also for the results obtained under
     cointegrat ion
          In the alternative system using the GNP deflator rather than the CPI, the
     correlation between the reduced form price and wage equation residuals is also
     positive and significant.

     Few variables other than the wage and the price level are significant in the

reduced form wage equation8. The sums of coefficients on wages and other variables

are not significantly different respectively from one and zero, suggesting that the

equation can be written in terms of first differences.

     By contrast, most variables are significant in the reduced form price equation.

This is true both of lagged employment and wages, as well as of most X variables. The

sums of coefficients on lagged prices and other variables are significantly different

from one and zero respectively.

     Lagged wages are significant in the reduced form employment equation but lagged

prices are not. Nominal money is highly significant.



     The task is now to go from these estimated equations to the structural wage,

price and employment equations. This is done in the next section.




     Section 3 Identification



     Let lower case w, p and n denote the reduced form disturbances of the wage,

price and employment equations respectively, so that the vector of reduced form

disturbances is given by u = [w p n ]   '. By   construction, w, p and n are the




8    This is in particular true of employment which has a significance level of .23.
In the alternative system using unemployment rather than employment, the significance
level is .54. These findings are consistent with the findings of non Granger
causality of wages by employment reported by Sargent (1978) and Net tci (1978)
                                           13

unexpected components of W, P and N, where expectations are conditional on lagged

values of Y and X variables. From equation (1), the relation of these disturbances to

the structural disturbances is given by

       (3) A u =   e,   E(ee') = V

      or, equivalently by the three equations

              w = ai p +a n + ew
       (3')   pblw+b2n+ep
              n = c p + c w + en



      To go from the reduced form (2) to the structural model (1), we need to obtain

A. In the absence of prior restrictions on the distributed lag structures A(L) and

B(L) in (1) (such as traditional exclusion restrictions), identification of A in (1)

is equivalent to identification of A in (3). I shall now discuss identification of A

in (3) and return later to the use of exclusion restrictions on lag polynomials.

       Sample information on (3) is summarized by the estimated covariance matrix of u,

E ,   reported   in table 1. This covariance matrix contains 6 separate variances and

covariances. A contains 6 unknown parameters and V contains 6 unknown covariances and

variances. Thus, in the absence of prior restrictions on either A or V1 we are 6

parameters short of identification. The strategy of this paper is to impose further

restrictions on both A and V to reduce the class of allowable A matrices, and to then

study the common characteristics of structural models for alternative allowable A

matrices. I now discuss the restrictions I impose on A and V.



       1. Restrictions on A
                                          14

       I use an agnostic approach to impose restrictions on the matrix A. It is simply

to specify what I believe to be plausible lower and upper bounds on the parameters of

A. I impose the following bounds

       I assume the contemporaneous effects of prices and employment on wages to be non

negative. I also assume the contemporaneous effects of wages and employment on prices

to be non negative. Thus ai, a2, bj and b2 are non negative. The upper bounds are

clearly more controversial. I assume that ai and bi are less than .4    as the

variables are in logarithms, the coefficients are elasticities, so that the

assumption implies that the effect within the quarter of a 1% unexpected increase in

prices increases wages by no more than .4% and similarly for the effect of wages on

prices. I also assume that bi and b2 to be less than .4.

       A standard assumption is that the main effect of nominal prices and wages on

aggregate demand is through real money balances. Thus I set cz equal to zero, and

assume ci to be non negative. Empirical evidence suggests the effect of real money on

output to be slow, and thus Ci to be small. Thus, I assume Ci to be between zero and

—.3.

       A possible approach would then be to look at each structural equation for all

allowable values of the parameters above and see what common characteristics hold

across such equations9. This approach however ignores information contained in E,

which is inappropriate if we think we know something about V. I now turn to

restrictions on V.



       2. Restrictions on V




     This was the approach used in the first draft of this paper. The two results
stated in the introduction hold across all such equations
                                             15




         A simple assumption would be to assume V to be a diagonal matrix'0. This

    assumption is however not acceptable here

         How should we think of the structural disturbances in (1) ? In Blanchard and

    Kiyotaki (1985) for example, I have derived a model of prices, wages and employment,

    based on monopolistically competitive price setters in the goods markets, and wage

    setting unions in the labor market, which has the same form as (1). In that model,

    the three structural disturbances have the following interpretation: ew is a taste or

    a union push disturbance, reflecting a shock to the utility function of suppliers of

    labor, or unions. ep is a productivity disturbance, affecting the pricing of firms

    given wages, employment and the prices of other inputs. The third disturbance en is

    however the sum of two disturbances, en =     oc   ep +   ed,   where ed is a disturbance to

    aggregate demand, and oc is positive and depends on the technology. This is because

    the third equation is derived by using the production function to obtain employment

    given aggregate demand. An adverse productivity shock will increase prices in the

    second equation but will also increase employment given output, given aggregate

    demand. Thus, even if one assumes that ew, ep and ei are uncorrelated, which I find a

    plausible assumption, this implies in general a positive correlation between ep and

    en


         While this specific interpretation of the shocks is model specific, the

    interpretation of disturbances will hold in other models. I shall assume that the

    wage, price and aggregate demand disturbances are uncorrelated. This implies that
•
    while the correlations between wage disturbances and either price or employment

    disturbances are equal to zero, the correlation o between price and employment

    disturbances may be positive.




    10    This   is the assumption made in Blanchard and Watson (1986).

    s_of parameters

    We now have 9 unknown parameters (4 in V and S in A) and 6 restrictions imposed

by E. The four parameters in V (the variances and the covariance Ori)              are   non

negative. The five parameters in A are subject to lower and upper bounds. We can now,

by doing a grid search, find the set of values of these parameters which satisfy the

6 constraints imposed by . To do this grid search, it is convenient to search over

the values of     (the correlation between ep and en), Ci and bi (by increments of

.1) and to solve for the implied values of the other parameters. The results are

summarized in table 2.

     The fact that the estimated E matrix has two off diagonal elements close to

zero, together with the a priori restriction that many elements of A be non negative

turns out to lead to a small set of allowable coefficients. In particular, the small

correlation between the reduced form price and wage disturbances together with the

constraint that both ai and bj be non negative implies little contemporaneous

interaction between wages and prices. Similarly, the small negative correlation

between the reduced form price and employment is consistent with only a small

positive effect of employment on prices, even when Ci is negative.

     I choose to work below with two sets of coefficients, which are

         = 0 ; ci = —.1 ; hi =   .0   ; b2 = .0   ; al =   .0   ; a2 =   .37 and

         = 0 ; ci = —.3 ; bi =   .0   ; b2 = .11 ; al =    .0   ; a2 = .37

     The first set has no contemporaneous effect of either current employment or

wages on prices. The second has a positive effect of employment on prices. Results

using Pn =.1 are very similar and not reported.

     Note that identification has been achieved here without recourse to exclusion

restrictions. The reason is not that these exclusion restrictions are necessarily

less credible than the restrictions imposed above. It is because the purpose of the

paper is to look at, and interpret, the unconstrained joint behavior of the Y

variables, given X.



     The two implied structural models are given in tables 3 and 4 respectively,

which give the sets of coefficients in each structural equation, as well as the

levels of significance of tests of sets or sums of coefficients. The next section

will be devoted to an examination of the wage and price equations. I limit myself

here to an examination of the dynamic effects of the structural disturbances on

wages, prices and employment. The results are reported in table 5 for both sets of

coefficients11. Figures 1 and 2 plot these dynamic effects, together with one

standard deviation bands   these are obtained by Monte Carlo simulations with 500

draws, assuming joint normality of the estimated coefficients.



       _yc!fkec.t s of structural disturbances



     Table 5 gives the dynamic effects of one time shocks to structural disturbances

on wages, prices and employment. The other variables X, including nominal money are

kept constant. For the two sets of coefficients we consider, structural disturbances

 are assumed uncorrelated, increasing one disturbance, keeping the others constant,




       These dynamic responses to one time shocks to disturbances correspond to
 impulse responses in the VAR methodology. Subject to our identification conditions
 being correct, they however have as simple structural interpretation, which standard
 impulse responses do not have. See Bernanke (1985) and Cooley and LeRoy (1985) for
 further discussion.

corresponds to a sample experiment. The plausibility of these dynamic responses

provides an informal test of the identification restrictions but is interesting in

its own right.

     A positive shock to nominal wages has long lasting effects on wages, prices and

employment. (The persistence, which is due to the presence of estimated roots close

to the unit circle implies that confidence intervals increase rather than decrease

with time, so that the reported long run responses are not reliable). Prices adjust

slowly over tine, while employment decreases. Thus, wage shocks imply a long period

of higher real wages and lower employment, a negative correlation between real waaes

(which are reported in the last column) and employment.

     A positive shock to prices, which reflects for example an adverse productivity

shock, leads to lasting effects on prices. Wages adjust over time and employment is

lower for a long period of time. Thus, price —productivity— shocks lead to sustained

lower wages and lower employment, to a positive correlation between real wages and

employment.

     A positive shock to employment, from an increase in aggregate demand for

example, leads to an increase in employment of roughly three years12. The effect on

wages and prices is however much more persistent, lasting for over 8 years. Wages

increase initially faster than prices, so that the real wage initially increases

prices eventually catch up, leading to a decrease in the real wage. Real wages and

employment both initially increase and later decrease, so that the correlation

between employment and real wages is again positive.




12    The main difference between these results and those obtained under
cointegration assuming one unit root is that the own effect of an employment shock is
much more persistent under cointegration. See Figures 5 and 6 in appendix 2.

     These three dynamic responses are very much consistent with the traditional

Keynesian view of the interaction between aggregate demand, employment, wages and

prices. Supply shocks, either to workers or firms lead to higher prices and wages and

lower employment. Demand shocks lead to higher prices, wages and employment. The

correlation between real wages and employment depends very much on the source of

disturbances, being negative for shocks to the wage equation, positive in the two

other cases. This may explain the difficulty of finding a significantly negative

effect of wages in neo classical demand for labor equations.

     To understand these dynamics better, one needs to look at each equation

individually. In the next section, I look at the price and wage equations.




     Section   4. Thpjcndwageequatjons.

     I first look at the dynamic cross effects of prices and wages, then at the
effects of employment on wages and prices. I finally consider sundry other issues,
such as the role of X variables and the relation of the wage equation to the Phillips

curve. As my interest is mainly in these two equations, I do not consider the

employment equation further.



     ]..The cross_fects of prices and   wag

     Consider the dynamic relation between two variables x and y

     a(L)x =   b(L)y   +   c(L)e
                                         20

     where a(L), b(L) and c(L) are lag polynomials and e is a white noise

disturbance. Suppose that our interest is in characterizing the dynamic effect of y

on x, or more precisely to learn about b(L)/a(L). Suppose that we have estimated this

dynamic relation by allowing for enough lags on x and y to obtain a white noise

residual. That is, we have estimated

     d(L)x=f(L)y +   e, where from above d(L)=c(L)'a(L) and f(L)=c(L)1b(L)
     From our estimated relation, we cannot recover b(L) and a(L) separately without

assumptions on c(L). We can however recover b(L)/a(L) easily by doing long division

of the lag polynomials on x and y as

     f(L)/d(L) =   c(L)'b(L)/c(L)'a(L)   =   b(L)/a(L)
     An easy and intuitive way of doing this long division is to trace the dynamic

effects of a one time shock in y on x. This is the approach I use to look at the

dynamic effects of, for example, wages on prices in the price equation.



     Table 6 gives the dynamic effects of wages on prices and prices on wages. There

are three pairs of columns. The first pair gives the dynamic effects of prices on

wages in the wage equation. The other two pairs give the dynamic effects of wages on

prices in the two price equations corresponding to the two alternative sets of

assumptions about contemporaneous effects. For each pair, the first column gives the

effect of a one tine increase of 1 of prices at time 1 ; the second column gives the

effect of a permanent increase of 1 in prices, and is simply the cumulated sum of

coefficients in the first column. Figure 3 plots the cumulative effects, together

with one standard deviation bands.

     The dynamic effect of prices on wages is fast. After three quarters, wages have

adjusted by two thirds of the increase in prices (although the first quarter effect

is assumed equal to zero). The adjustment thereafter is slow, with the numbers in the

first column being small and not significantly different from zero after quarter 4.

     By contrast, the dynamic effect of wages on prices is much slower. The increase

in prices to a permanent increase in wages is less than one fourth after a year, less

than two thirds after two years. The results are very similar under the two

alternative assumptions about contemporaneous effects'3.

     This asymmetry is somewhat at variance with the traditional view of prices

adjusting faster to wages than wages to prices, as well as with estimated equations

which support the traditional view. The equations differ from those mainly in two

ways. The first is the use of levels rather than first differences. The second is the

use of unconstrained lag structures'4. The second is probably the main source of

differences.

     What does this asymmetry imply ? This depends on whether the estimated lag

structures result from expectational lags, or from lags due to overlapping nominal

contracts or asynchronization in price setting. I have argued elsewhere (Blanchard

1983) that the large number of interrelated price decisions, together with

asynchronization, may lead to substantial price inertia even if the length of time




      The asymmetry between the effects of prices on wages and wages on prices also
holds for the two alternative systems in which either employment is replaced by
unemployment, or in which the CPI is replaced by the GNP deflator. It also remains
true even when the contemporaneous correlation between the GNP deflator and wages,
which is positive and significant, is attributed entirely to an effect of wages on
prices. The contemporaneous effect is then equal to .2, but increases slowly
therefter
14     A potential third difference was suggested to me by R. Gordon. It is that the
lag structure used here is too short to capture the full dynamic interactions of
prices and wages. I have looked at the effects of increasing lag length and found it
did not affect this result.
                                           22

between price changes is short for each price .   If   this is what this slow dynamic

response of prices reflects, this implies that a large portion of price level inertia

comes not from contracts in the labor market, but from price setting in goods

markets. In that case, indexation of nominal waaes for example may only partially

decrease price level inertia and leave substantial output effects of aggregate

demand. To distinguish between expectational and other lags clearly requires imposing

much more structure than I have imposed here'5.



     2. The effectoemp1oymeflt pg_dprices


     The dynamic effects of employment on wages in the wage equation and on prices in

the price equation are given in Table 7. Table 7 gives the effects of a one time and

of a permanent increase in employment. Figure 4 plots the cumulative responses with

one standard deviation bands.

     To interpret the dynamic effect of employment on wages, I find useful to think

of the relation implied by the Phillips curve. The following are three simple

versions of the Phillips curve

     W-W(—l) =   a(expected inflation) +   b N




      One can however look at the univariate processes for wages and prices and see
how they differ. Good univariate integrated autoregressive representations for wages
and prices for the sample we consider are (seasonal and wage price control Gordon
dummies are included but not reported):
     th = .15 W(—1) + .11 W(—2) + .19 w(—3) + .14 thl(—4) +       +
and       P=
           .55 P(—1) + .02 P(—2) + .29 P(—3) + Ip
The difference in these two processes implies that even if prices depended on
expectations of wages in the same way as wages depended on expectations of prices,
and  ifexpectations of wages and prices were formed by extrapolating optimally from
lagged own values, the observed dynamic effect of wages on prices would be slower
than the dynamic effect of prices on wages. Thus some of the difference between the
dynamic responses we have found may come from differences in expectation formation.
                                             23

             =   a(expected inflation) +   b N —   c(W(—l)—p(—l))
     W—W(—l) =   a(expected inflation) + b   N — c N(—l)

     The first is the standard Phillips
                                           curve relation, implying, given expected
inflation, a relation between the rate of wage inflation and the level of

unemployment (employment). The second allows for an effect of the lagged real wage on

wage inflation     it differs from the first is that it implies, in equilibrium, a

relation between the level of the real wage and the level of employment, a pseudo

labor supply curve. The third allows for an effect of current and lagged

unemployment. If c is positive, there is a positive effect of both the level and the

rate of change of unemployment on wage inflation ; if c is equal to b, it is the rate

of change, not the level of unemployment which affects nominal wage inflation.

     Each of these three versions has different implications for the dynamic effects

of a one time increase in employment on nominal wages. The first implies a permanent

increase in wages to a new higher level. The second implies an initial increase in

wages, with a return to the initial value at rate 1—c. The third implies an initial

increase, with a decrease to a new level, equal to the initial value if cb, higher

than the initial level if c is less than b.

     Table 7 is inconsistent with the first version and appears to be most consistent

with the third version. Wages increase in the first quarter, but decrease to a lower

value which appears to be roughly constant from then on. Put another way, a permanent

increase in employment leads to a large increase in wage inflation in the quarter in

which it happens, and to steady but lower wage inflation thereafter (given expected

price inflation) (Note however the large standard deviation bands in Figure 4 : we

should not have much confidence in the estimated
                                                      cumulative response). Thus, one
interpretation of this dynamic effect of employment on wages is that the rate of

change of unemployment (employment) plays a more important role than the level in
                                        24

determining wage inflation 16



     The dynamic effects of employment on prices are quite different. The effect of a

one time increase in employment affects prices slowly over time, the maximum effect

being obtained after a year. Equivalently, a permanent increase in employment leads

to a slow adjustment of prices to a new higher level. While, as indicated above, the

uncertainty associated with the long run response is large because of the presence of

non stationarity, price inflation appears to die out, in contrast to the results

obtained in the wage equation. One fourth of the adjustment is completed after a

year, three fourths after two years. This result is consistent with the traditional

view that, given wages, prices adjust slowly, if at all, to movements in demand.



     3. The effects of X variables on_wages and prices



     Traditional identification restrictions rely on exclusion restrictions on some

of the X variables in the wage and price equations. Such restrictions have been

criticized on the grounds that, even if the variables do not enter the equation

directly, they may do so indirectly by affecting expectations. Given that these

restrictions have not been used to identify the wage and price equations, I can look

at these two equations and see which variables enter significantly.

     Relative prices of non labor inputs, indirect taxes paid by firms and nominal

money are usually excluded from the wage equation. The significance level associated




'-
      This result also holds for the two alternative systems, using unemployment, or
the GNP deflator. The effect of the rate of change of employment is also present but
less strong when annual data is used (see Blanchard and Summers (1986). I have not
yet reconciled the two sets of results
                                         25

with the hypothesis that coefficients on x2, x3, x5 and x6 are all zero is .18. There

is indeed little evidence that these variables enter the wage equation.

     Direct taxes on individuals and nominal money are usually excluded from price

equations. The significance level associated with the hypothesis that coefficients on

x4 and x6 are all zero is equal to .05   under the first set of structural

parameters, equal to .03 under the second. This marginal rejection comes mostly, as

is clear from tables 4 and 5, from the significance of nominal money. This can be

interpreted in two ways. It means either that our identification restrictions are

incorrect, or that nominal money affects prices directly, either through expectations

or through other channels. The sun of coefficients on nominal money is however small,

negative and insignificant in one case, significant at the 5% level in the other.



                                              curve



     Does the estimated wage equation look like a Phillips curve ? Gathering results

from table 3 (or 4) and from the discussion above, the answer is mixed.

     From above, the restriction that relative prices, indirect taxes and nominal

money do not belong to the equation is easily accepted. From table 3 or 4, the

restriction that the sum of coefficients on wages is one and the sum of coefficients

on prices is equal to zero is easily accepted. The significance level associated with

this joint hypothesis is .78. Thus, the equation can be rewritten in terms of wage

inflation as a function of price inflation and unemployment. This is evidence in

favor of a Phillips curve interpretation of the wage equation.

     But table 3 also shows that the sum of coefficients on unemployment is not

significantly different from zero. The significance level associated with this

hypothesis that the sum of coefficients on wages is one, the sum of coefficients on
                                        26

prices is zero and the sum of coefficients on unemployment is zero is .84. This is

inconsistent with the standard specification, and implies, under the Phillips curve

interpretation, a strong effect of the rate of change of unemployment.

     The fact that the equation can be rewritten in terms of rates of change of

wages, prices and unemployment suggests another interpretation, that of a relation

between the level of the wage, the price level and employment, with a non stationary

disturbance term. This interpretation is however unappealing. The equation so

obtained violates the homogeneity restriction strongly, with the sum on coefficients

on nominal variables equal to .56, and significantly less than unity.




     Section 5. Conclusion



     In this paper, I have estimated the reduced form of a model of prices, wages and

employment. I have then made alternative assumptions on the contemporaneous

interaction between variables to go from the reduced to the structural form.

     I have reached the following main conclusions.

     The first is that the structural models so obtained are quite consistent with

the traditional Keynesian model of fluctuations. Demand shocks are associated with

higher employment, and an increase in wages and prices. Supply shocks, either from

suppliers of labor or from technology, lead to increases in prices and wages. The

correlation between real wages and employment depends very much on the source of the

 shocks, being negative for shocks to labor supply but positive in the two other

 cases.
                                        27

     The effect of prices on wages in the wage equation is faster than the effect of

wages on prices in the price equation. This result appears robust to the use of

alternative variables and is partly at odds with received wisdom.

     While the data partly support the interpretation of the wage equation as a

Phillips curve, they indicate a strong effect of the rate of change of unemployment

on wage inflation. The effect is stronger than in estimated Phillips curves which

have a tighter specification than the one allowed for in the paper.



     There are obvious extensions to the research presented here.

     The first follows from the strong evidence of subsample instability. To the

extent that the approach used here allows for a larger set of control variables in

each equation than the traditional equation by equation estimation, one may have

expected subsample instability to be less severe. This is not the case. I do not

believe that addition of other variables in X will lessen the problem. Estimation

using random coefficients is both appropriate and useful, as it can shed light on the

change in the dynamic relations between variables over time.

     The second is an investigation of the sources of non stationarity of Y given X.

It is often believed that the main source of non stationarity in real variables is

the presence of a unit root in the process for productivity. This can be interpreted

as the presence of a common factor (l—L) in the price equation ; a cursory

examination of the results of the paper do not support this hypothesis. Instead, non

stationarity appears to come from the wage equation.



     Finally, as discussed in the paper, the estimated model is not structural in the

sense of distinguishing between expectations and actual variables. The natural next

step is to build and estimate a model which does so. The results of this paper give
                                       28

clear leads as to which models might or might not explain the data.

       To avoid notational complexity, I shall consider the
                                                            following simple "deep
structural" model

(Al)       P =       a   P(—].) + b E(P(+l):') + (1—a—b) N + Up

where P is the price level, N is nominal
                                         money, and up is a white noise disturbance.

       The homogeneity property is assumed to hold for this model so that the sum of

coefficients on nominal variables on the right hand side is equal to one. The proof

given below is easily extended to allow for a more complex lag structure, or for P

and N to be vectors, or for the presence of real variables.

       The equation describing the behavior of nominal money is assumed to have the

following form

(A2)           N =   c    N(—1) +.     . .+ ci   M(-k) +   di P(1) +.. .+ dk P(—k)         +   Urn

where    Urn    is   white noise.



       I now show that, if the sum of the coefficients on the right hand side variables

of (A2) is equal to unity, then the structural and reduced forms of the above model

will satisfy the homogeneity property.

       If money follows the above process, and if the sum of coefficients is equal to

unity, the equation for money can be rewritten as

(A3)           M—M(—l) =       iL) (M(—l)—       M(—2)) +   s(L)   (P(—1)—M(—l)) +   urn

where

                k                  k
          — E        (ci+di)   —
                                       (ci+dj)L...— (ck+dk) L2
                2                  3
and
s(L)      hi +.      . .÷   bk Li-i
Substracting N from both sides of (Al) gives

(A4)      P—N = a(P(—l)—M) + b(E(P(+l) )N) + Up

Using (A3) to express N(—l) and E(M(+l)       )   as functions of N and replacing in (A4)

gives

(A5)      P—N = a(P(—l)—M(—l)) +   b(E(P(+l)—N(+l))     )   +a (L) (N(—l)—N(—2))

                +   a &(L)   (P(—l)—M(—l)) —b (L) (M—N(—l)) —b s(L) (P—N)

                +   a Urn + Up




       The system composed of (A3) and (AS) is a dynamic rational expectation system in

(P—N) and (M-N(—l)) which can be solved using standard techniques of solution. The

solution will express (P—N) as a distributed lag of itself, of (N—N(—l)) and of

disturbances. Because all variables are differences of nominal variables, the

solution will satisfy the homogeneity property.

         The first step is to determine the number of unit roots.

     Computing the eigenvalues associated with the reduced form reported in table 1, with

     homogeneity imposed, gives the following three largest roots : .97   ,   .9l+.081   and

     .9l—.08i (modulus .91). (The next root is .52). This suggests the presence of either

     one or three unit roots. (These are the roots of (I—C(L)L), the roots of the system

     characterizing the behavior of Y given X).

         As these roots are obtained from conditional VAR estimation, the distribution

     theory needed to know whether these roots are significantly different from unity is

     not yet available'. I have proceeded on the assumption of one unit root. The Durbin

     Watson statistics of the first step regressions for cointegration provide some

     supportive informal evidence.

         Assuming one unit root, I proceed in two steps (see Granger and Engle 1985). In

     the first, I obtain two cointeating_vectors, by regressing current W on current N

     and the conditioning vector X (with the same lag structure as in Table 1) and W on P

     and X. The results are as follows

        W = .33 P (+ A(L) X)   DW = .85

        W = .24 N (+ B(L) X)   DW = .64

         The second step is to use the two implied cointegrating vectors to estimate

     equation (1). I do so imposing also homogeneity, so the results reported below are

     derived under the maintained assumptions of one unit root and homogeneity. I report

     the results in the same way as in table 1.

      Stock and Watson (1986) derive the distribution of eigenvalues for the
case of unconditional VAR estimation. I have computed their qd statistic. The
estimated statistic does not shed light on whether there is one or more unit
roots : significance levels associated with the hypothesis that there is one,
two or three roots are very similar.
    Given that time is in the conditioning vector, one can also look at Fuller
 (1976) who has derived distributions of the root for the case where time
appears as a regressor in a univariate first order regression. Using his
distribution as the correct distribution, the significance level associated
with the test that the first root is a unit root is 4%.

e) significance level of the F test that the sum of coefficients on a given variable

        A comparison of this results to those in table 1 suggests minor differences

only. The coefficients on lagged own values are more significant under cointegration.

        To compare the results in another way, the next two tables give the dynamic

impulse responses associated with a one standard deviation shock to each of the

reduced form disturbances, both for the system estimated in levels and the system

estimated with cointegration. As is emphasized in the text, these dynamic responses

have no structural interpretation. They however provide a simple way of

characterizing the differences in the dynamic behavior of both estimated systems. (As

the two estimated covariance matrices of reduced form disturbances are similar,

similarity of these dynamic responses implies similarity of dynamic responses to

structural disturbances). Figures 5 and 6 plot these responses together with one

standard deviation bands, using 500 Monte Carlo simulations assuming normality of the

estimates.

    The dynamic responses are qualitatively the same in both cases. The own effects
of n shocks are more persistent under cointegration. Cross effects are also stronger
under co—integrated estimation.
