                                   CROSS-BORDER BANKING

                                            ABSTRACT


        The banking systems of some countries export intermediation services to the rest of the
 world, while many other countries are net exporters of deposits to banks abroad and net importers
 of loans from banks abroad. Banking center countries typically have lower inflation, deeper
financial systems, earn less government revenue from seigniorage, and have lowerreserve money
relative to bank assets than nonbanking-center countries. This paper develops a stylized model

of regulated bank intermediation to examine the role of national monetary policy in determining
the international competitiveness of a national banking system. Monetary policy takes the form

of controlling the supply of reserve money and imposing restrictions on banks that generate a
demand for reserve money (reserve requirements). The international competitiveness of a
banking system is enhanced by having a monetary authority who places greater weight on the
interests of existing creditors relative to debtors in its constituency, and who has less need to
raise revenue from seigniorage. With complete integration of deposit and loan markets the
location of intermediation can be indeterminate. Countries that receive more deposits can
generate a given amount of seigniorage with less inflation. Monetary authorities in countries that

experience deposit outflows may be tempted to impose capital controls in order to maintain their
seigniorage base. One implication of the analysis is that integration of monetary policies can
facilitate financial integration by reducing the incentive to relocate deposits to avoid the inflation
tax.

 1. Introduction

     A number of multilateral, bilateral, and unilateral initiatives are seeking
to increase international financial integration: Liberalization of trade in fi-
nancial services was a large item in the Uruguay Round; financial integration
is a major component of such regional integration arrangements as the Eu-
ropean Community and NAFTA; a number of countries, such as Australia
and Indonesia, have taken steps to open their domestic financial markets to
foreign banks.
     The prospect of increased international competition in banking services
raises fundamental questions about sources of comparative advantage and the
potential gains from trade in banking services. Since trade in banking services
can take several fundamental forms, the issues are complex and multifaceted.
    At least three forms of international competition in banking services are
worth distinguishing: (i) competition between banks in different countries,
(ii) competition between the currencies of different countries as the unit of
account for loans and deposits, and (iii) competition between the financial
regulatory environment of different 'ountries.

Firm Competition

    One type of international competition is the entry of foreign banks into
domestic banking. In its pure form such competition is between foreign
banks and domestic banks in accepting domestic deposits and making loans
domestically on the domestic banks' home turf. Foreign-owned banks are
subject to the same reserve requirements and other regulatory constraints
as domestically-owned banks, with deposits and loans denominated in local
currency (so that banks are not engaged in any "currency transformation"
between deposits and loans). At issue here, then, is the relative productivity
of individual banks, all operating in the same regulatory environment with


                                      1
   the same currencies, in providing banking services to a domestic clientele.'
   Hence international competition of this type does not involve direct compe-
   tition between different regulatory systems, since customers continue to be
  served by banks that are subject to the same regulations. Nor is there any
  competition among different currencies. Competition of this form does not
  require significant flows of capital between the home and host countries of
  the banks in question.

  Currency Competition

     A second form competition is between alternative currencies of denomi-
 nation. Banks may offer loans or accept deposits denominated in foreign cur-
 rencies. Examples are the dollar-denominated deposits introduced at various
 points in Mexico and Peru, and the array of deposit and loan denominations
 provided by banks in the Eurodollar market. The banks offering these de-
posits and loans may be foreign or domestically-owned, and activity might be
subject to the same regulations regardless of the currency of denomination.
If the banks subject to the same regulations may offer loans and deposits
in different currencies, the relative efficiencies of individual banks or of al-
ternative regulatory systems is not at issue. What is at issue is the relative
attractiveness of different currencies as units of denomination, which might
derive, for example, from their stability of value or their use as currencies of
denomination in international trade.
    Unless individual banks exactly balance the composition of their assets
and liabilities by denomination, currency competition, unlike foreign entry,
does put banks in the role of "currency transformers." It does not, however,
necessarily imply any cross-country capital flows, or "country transformation."2
     'Several countries, such as Australia and Indonesia, have undertaken financial liberal-
 izations with the hope of attracting entry by foreign banks. Market penetration by foreign
 banks has remained small, and largely limited to serving the financial needs of multima-
tional clients based in the home countries of the banks in question. See, for example, the
discussions in Lewis and Davis (1987) and Garber and Weisbrod (1993).
    2Lewis and Davis (1987) distinguish among three types of "transformation" that in-
ternational banks can engage in. One, which is the usual focus of the domestic banking
literature, is "maturity transformation," since bank assets and liabilities can be of different
maturities. A second is "currency transformation," since the composition of the curren-
cies of denomination of a bank's assets may differ from that of its liabilities. A third is
"country transformation," since a bank's liabilities and claims may not match by country.


                                             2
 Cross-Border Competition

     A third form of international competition in banking is between banks
 operating in different regulatory environments: Banks subject to different
 regulations might compete to attract deposits, to make loans, or both. Since
 regulatory environments typically correspond to geographical regions, com-
 petition of this form is likely to create significant cross-border flows of bank
 deposits and liabilities. Moreover, competition of this sort can give rise coun-
 tries that are "banking centers," that act as net intermediaries for the rest of
the world. To the extent that banks subject to different national regulatory
systems have distinct ownership, an element of competition of this type also
concerns the competitiveness of individual banks. For example, a reason why
Switzerland might be a banking center is that Swiss banks are, by their very
nature, efficient intermediaries. Another source of comparative advantage,
however, is the regulatory environment itself. Cross-border flows of deposits
and loans have involved banks that have branches in the client's home coun-
try, suggesting that at least an element of competition derives from the bank
regulations of the country where the banking activity occurs.

    These conceptual distinctions among different pure forms of international
bank competition help clarify the various determinants of comparative ad-
vantage in banking. But increased banking competition is likely to occur in
hybrid forms. For example, the establishment of U.S. branch banks abroad
(foreign entry) probably increased interbank loan activity (cross-border bank-
ing). Foreign entry may also occur precisely in order to provide loans and
deposits in different currencies (in Aliber's (1984) terms, to service a local
"currency clientele").
    Moreover, even though foreign entry in principle subjects foreign and
domestic banks to the same regulations, a foreign bank's ability to compete
may derive from its regulatory environment at home. A foreign bank may
benefit, for example, from an enhanced ability to raise funds abroad, or from
the lender-of-last resort function of the central bank in its home country.

   Recognizing that international bank competition can take various forms,
several of which may operate in any actual situation, in this paper I focus
more narrowly on competition of the second and third types. Banks located

                                       3
  in different countries compete worldwide for deposits and loans, but denomi-
  nate deposits and loans in domestic currency and are subject to local banking
 regulations. Since I treat all banks as identical, and the banking sector as
 perfectly competitive, the issue of international competition at the firm level
 does not come up. The nationality of the ownership of a bank is irrelevant
     In the next section I discuss some basic data on cross-border bank posi-
 tions, which I use to identify countries that serve as international banking
 centers. I then examine some key features of these countries that seem to
 distinguish them from non-banking centers.
     In section 3 1 develop a simple model of a national banking system to
 identify factors that might be associated with a nation's ability to attract
 deposits or to make foreign loans. The model focuses on two instruments of
 monetary policy, money growth and reserve requirements. A key assumption
 is that bank claims and liabilities are nominally' denominated in domestic
 currency. Monetary authorities undertake policy with multiple goals. One is
 to earn seigniorage. Another is to serve the competing interests of existing
 creditors and debtors, as well as those of new lenders and new borrowers, in
 its constituency.
    In section 4 I apply the model to examine some implications of cross-
 border banking, which can take the form of international integration of de-
 posit markets, loan markets, or both.
    Section 5 provides some concluding observations, discusses the limitations
of the analysis, and suggests some extensions.

2. Cross-Border Banking and International Banking Centers
     The ability of a national banking system to attract foreign deposits, and
 to make foreign loans, reflects its international competitiveness as an inter-
 mediary. Appendix Tables 1 and 2, based on data from the International
 Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics, report net cross-border
deposits of nonbanks and net cross-border credit to nonbanks, by residence
of the bank, for a sample of European, Asian and Western Hemisphere coun-
tries. Countries were selected on the basis of the availability of data. Data
are averages of the available annual data for 1981-1985 and 1986-1990. Col-
umn 3 reports net interbank liabilities. Data are in millions of current US
dollars. I distinguish between countries identified by the IMF as "industrial"
and "developing."

    Based on their net cross-border deposits from nonbanks and their net
-cross-border claims on nonbanks, countries fall into four categories. Table 1
 below assigns the countries for which I have data to the four categories.

1. Banking Centers

    Banking centers provide net intermediation services to the rest of the
world. These countries' banks are both net recipients of deposits from for-
eign nonbanks and net lenders to nonbanks abroad. Among industrial coun-
tries this group contains, for example, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom (in both periods), and Japan (in the earlier period, indi-
cated by "Japan I"). Among the developing countries this group includes the

                                      5
 Cayman Islands and Singapore both periods.

 2. The Di.sinterinedjated

   Opposite to this group are countries that are on net disintermediated.
 Nonbank residents of this group are net depositors in banks abroad and are
 net borrowers from foreign banks. Among industrial countries, membership
 in this group is more select and more unstable. Only Italy was disinterme-
 diated in both periods. Australia was disintermediated in the earlier period
 as was the United States in the later period.
     Among developing countries, however, this group includes all the South
 American countries for which data are available (in both periods), along with
 Mexico, Malaysia, and Jamaica (each in both periods) and Panama and the
 Philippines (each in the later period).

 3. Inward Transformers

   A third category of banking system receives net deposits from foreign
nonbanks, yet fails to supply all of the domestic demand for bank loans.
For countries in this group, the banking system transforms all (net) foreign
deposits into (net) domestic loans.
   Among the industrial countries, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Canada,
Greece, Ireland, and Spain fall into this category both periods, as does Ger-
many for the first period and Australia for the second. Among the developing
countries in the sample only Philippines, in the earlier period, belongs in this
group.

j. Outward Transformers

    Opposite to this group are countries whose nationals deposit more abroad
than their banks receive in deposits from abroad, and whose banks are net
suppliers of loans abroad. For this group of countries, banks transform (net)
domestic deposits into (net) foreign loans. This group includes the United
States and Panama in the earlier period and Germany and Japan in the later
one.

How Important are Cross-Border Positions?

                                      6
    To examine the importance of cross-border positions relative to the do-
mestic banking sector, in Appendix Tables 3 and 4 1 report net cross-border
deposits from nonbanks, net cross-border claims on nonbanks, and net inter-
bank claims as a share of domestic bank assets. Among the banking centers
cross-border banking is especially significant for Singapore, Belgium, and
Switzerland. For these countries net foreign deposits represent at least 30
per cent of domestic assets. Among disintermediated countries net cross-
border loans are especially large for Argentina and Panama. At the other
extreme, net cross-border positions for Germany and Japan are small.

Banks and Nonbanks: What are the Distinguishing Features?

    Among the four categories of countries, membership in the group of bank-
ing centers appears to be more stable than membership in other groups. Are
there financial characteristics of these countries that differ systematically
from noncenters? To address this question, columns 4 through 7 of Ap-
pendix Tables 3 and 4 report additional data on the financial systems of
these countries. Column 4 reports annual average seigniorage as a share of
GDP, defined as the increase in reserve money between consecutive years
relative to the GDP of the earlier year.3 Column 5 gives the average annual
ratio of quasi-money to gross domestic product. Column 6 indicates the av-
erage annual rate of inflation of the producer price index during the period.
Column 7 provides the ratio of the monetary base to quasi-money.
    Appendix Table 5 reports averages of relevant statistics broken down be-
tween industrial and developing countries and between banking center coun-
tries and other countries. (Unfortunately, Singapore is the only nonindustrial
banking center for which I have data.) The table indicates the following re-
lationships:

    1. Inflation rates are much lower in banking centers than elsewhere.
(Inflation also tends to be lower in industrial countries than in developed
countries.)

   2. Quasi-money as a fraction of GNP is much larger in banking centers
  31take this definition from Fischer's (1982) classic paper on seigniorage.


                                           7
 than in noncenters. (This ratio also tends to be larger in industrial countries
 than in developing countries.)

    3. Banking centers generate less revenue from seigniorage (relative to
 GDP) than noncenters (as do industrial countries compared with developing
 countries).

    4. The ratio of reserve money to quasi-money is lower in banking centers
 than in noncenters (and is lower in industrial countries than in developing
 countries).

   5. There does not seem to be a stable relationship between a country's
role as a banking center and net interbank deposits, at least among the
industrial countries.

    What determines why some countries become banking centers while oth-
ers experience international disintermediation? Section 3 develops a simple
model of a regulated intermediation system to identify some factors that
might be important, and to explain why banking centers have the features
that they do.4

3. A Model of Regulated Intermediation

    I adopt a variant of the Samuelson (1958) overlapping generations model.
The analysis is complicated. At the expense of realism I have tried to make
the simplest set of assumptions that allow an analysis of the issues at hand.

Endowments and Preferences

    I consider a national economy in which individuals live for two periods.
Some of these individuals (called lenders) receive an endowment while they
are young, while others (called borrowers) receive their incomes when they
   4Alworth and Andresen (1992) provide a systematic regression analysis of the determi-
nant.s of deposit inflows and outflows using a much more comprehensive data set propri-
etary to the Bank of International Settlements, which was not available to this author. One
result supportive of the argument here is that countries with higher reserve requirements
tend to have fewer foreign deposits.


                                            8
are old. I assume that there are equal numbers of each type, and normalize
their populations to one each. (To facilitate exposition I refer to lenders
as feminine and to borrowers as masculine.) I normalize a lender's (early)
endowment at two and set the borrower's (late) endowment at 2y.
    Both lenders and borrowers want to smooth their consumption across the
two periods of their lives. A simple way of introducing this motive is to
assign each of them a lifetime utility given by:

                               U=lnC+lnC°                                     (1)
where C is what the individual consumes in youth and C° is his or her
consumption in old age.
    This specification has two convenient implications for what follows: (1)
Regardless of the interest rate, a lender will want to invest exactly half her
income, or one, in her youth. (2) At any (finite) interest rate, a borrower will
want to borrow whatever will require a repayment of half of his endowment,
or y, in old age.
    Naturally, a motive arises for lenders to make loans to borrowers in youth
in exchange for repayment in old age. If contracts were automatically enforce-
able and intermediation costless, in competitive equilibrium lenders would
lend half their endowment to borrowers in their youth in exchange for half
the borrower's endowment in old age. The real interest rate in the economy
would be y. (It's convenient to specify interest rates in terms of repayment of
principal plus interest, or one plus the interest rate as conventionally defined.)

Financial Intermediation

   I assume, however, that these individuals are unable to enforce direct loan
contracts among themselves. Instead, they must lend and borrow through a
banking system. To invest lenders must make deposits in banks and borrow-
ers canonly borrow from banks. Banks can enforce loan contracts and will
honor deposit commitments.
    Intermediation would be inconsequential if banking were (1) perfectly
competitive, (2) costless, (3) not subject to reserve requirements or other
taxes, and (4) specified loan and deposit contracts in real terms. Competition
among banks would then push the interest rate to y and resources would be
allocated just as if lenders could deal directly with depositors.

                                       9
    The focus here is on banking policy, rather than on the competitiveness
of individual banks or on market structure. Hence I treat intermediation as
intrinsically costless and the banking system within each country as perfectly
competitive. But I assume that banks (1) must hold a fraction A of deposits
as reserves, which take the form of reserve money issued by the local gov-
ernment, and (2) specify loan and deposit contracts in terms of the currency
of denomination of that money. Each period t the government specifies a
reserve requirement Ag and the nominal supply of reserves Mg.
    In making both assumptions together I combine issues of "currency com-
petition" with "cross-border" competition. In principle, I could allow banks
to denominate loans or deposits in foreign currency, as they often do, even
while they hold reserves in local currency. It would be interesting to inves-
tigate the consequences, but the analysis would be much more complicated.
Banking systems do, however, tend to denominate loans and deposits in local
currency, and are sometimes required to. (The fact that the government is
usually the ultimate enforcer of loan contracts gives it a great deal of power
in determining what form contracts can take.)
    Under these assumptions, a lender in her youth at time 2 will invest
half of her endowment in bank deposits, which offer a nominal return R?.
The bank can lend a fraction (1 — A1) to borrowers, whom it will charge a
nominal interest rate Rf'. The remaining deposits must be held as reserves,
which I assume pay zero nominal interest. Denoting the ratio of the price
level in a previous period to that in the current period (one over one plus
the conventional inflation rate from last period to this) as H1, competition
among banks will drive the real return on a period 2 deposit to:

                         Rf = [(1 — A1)R + A1]fl1 =                       (2)
where fl7 is the period 2 expectation of llt.
   Whatever the interest rate, a borrower demands a loan amount that re-
quires a repayment of yin his old age. Since 1—A1 is the available loan amount
then equilibrium in the loan market implies that the nominal interest rate
on loans must satisfy:
                              (1 —   A1)RH7 = y.                        (3)
   The demand for reserves in period 1 is just A1, the reserve requirement
times the deposit level. The government sets the nominal supply each period


                                       10
at Mg. Hence the price level in period t is:

                                     P = M1/A,                                       (4)
so that:

                                            Ag_If Ag
    The government's choice of the reserve requirement and money supply
each period affects four important magnitudes: (1) Since deposits and loans
made in the previous period were denominated in nominal terms, current
monetary policy, by affecting the inflation rate, determines the cx post real
return on bank loans and deposits due that period. (2) Since reserves pay zero
nominal interest, monetary policy, through the inflation rate, determines the
real return on reserves held over from the previous period.5 (3) The current
reserve requirement determines how much will be available for new loans that
period. (4) Money growth and the reserve requirement determine how much
revenue the government earns from seigniorage that period, gg, which will be:

                                                 Ag_1Hg.                             (6)


Monetary Policy

    I take the government's need for seigniorage as exogenous and constant at
a level g. Taking into account its need for seigniorage revenue, the government
must set M and A each period to satisfy (6). Hence inflation in period t
will be:

                                     Hg =    Ag9
                                                                                     (7)
Given the government's need for seigniorage, monetary policy each period.
can be summarized by the reserve requirement A.
   5Together (1) and (2) determine bank revenues. Competition among banks for deposits
means that nominal deposit rates will leave banks zero anticipated profits. I assume that
lenders are also the owners of bank equity. Hence, cx post, lenders earn the total return
on bank loans either as interest on deposits or as bank profits (although in equilibrium
bank profits are zero).


                                            11
    Two factors constrain the government's choice of . First, since bank
reserves cannot exceed deposits,  cannot exceed one. Second, since the
price level cannot be negative, from (6), the reserve requirement must exceed
the need for seigniorage. At the lower bound = g inflation must be infinite
to finance the government's seigniorage requirement.
    As of period t, the nominal return on loans due is given, but the nominal
return on new loans will take into account expected inflation as implied by
(3), where the expectation will be consistent with anticipated future policy
through (7).
    Substituting these relationships into the expression for utility, the lifetime
welfare of lenders and borrowers in each living generation at time t, as a
function of monetary policy and predetermined variables, is:

                 UYB =ln(1 —g)+1ny
                 UYL = ln(y +       )i — g)
                       = ln[2, — (1   —

                      = ln[(l   —
                                               + )] + ln(i)
where U is the utility of individual of type i, where i = YB, YL, OB, OL for
young borrowers, young lenders, old borrowers, and old lenders, respectively.
    Setting a higher reserve requirement allows the government to achieve
its seigniorage objective with less monetary growth and hence less inflation.
Given the nominal interest rate set the previous period and the government's
current need for seigniorage, a higher reserve requirement, since it means
lower inflation, is good for old lenders but bad for old borrowers. Setting a
higher reserve requirement also harms young borrowers by restricting what
is lent them. Since the nominal interest rate satisfies (3), young lenders are
unaffected by current monetary policy, but they, of course, benefit from a
higher reserve requirement in the future, since it implies less inflation and a
higher real return on reserves.
    I assume that the government chooses the reserve requirement Xg each
period to maximize a weighted average of the utilities of each type of liv-
ing individual, taking the previous reserve requirement and nominal inter-
est rate as given, but anticipating how its current choice of monetary pol-
icy might influence the nominal interest rate and future monetary policy.
I denote the weight it places on individuals of type i as 6', where again
i = YB, YL, OB, OL for young borrowers, young lenders, old borrowers,
                                          12
and old lenders, respectively. Formally, then, each period t the government
chooses A to maximize:
                                    i = YB,YL,OB,OL.                      (8)
    The first-order condition for a maximum, assuming that the interest rate
set the previous period correctly anticipated subsequent monetary policy, is:
                   YB            YL           e       OL    OB
                        +                         +              =0.

Note that monetary policy in period 1—1 does not affect the optimal choice in
t.6 Hence I can treat dA+1/dA = 0. If exogenous parameters remain constant
over time then the government will choose the same reserve requirement and
inflation rate each period, so that individuals can reasonably expect that

   In characterizing the policy outcome one must consider two cases:
   If 50L < EOB then, to convey the maximum benefit to borrowers at the
expense of lenders, the government will simply set A at its lower bound of g
and impose an infinite inflation tax. In this case the deposit rate is y and
the loan rate y/(1-g).
   Alternatively, if 60L >       then the government will choose an interior
solution. Solving (9), the reserve requirement is then:
                                 (50L — SOB) + 5YB9
                                    5OL....5OB+t5YB
and the consequent (simple) inflation rate is:

                             = (5OL_öOB+5YB)g
                                   —     —
                                 (60L     6oB)(1
Expressions for the real return on deposits and loans are respectively:

                                        SYB(l —g)
  6The second-order condition for a maximum is satisfied.

                                         13
    Three factors determine monetary policy: (1) the seigniorage requirement
g, (2) the welfare weight placed on old lenders relative to that on old borrow-
ers      —
            80B, and (3) the welfare weight placed on young borrowers 5YB•
In addition, both interest rates are higher the larger the endowments of bor-
rowers relative to lenders. The following table shows how monetary policy
and the consequent interest rates respond to these variables:
                                  80L_60B         5YB

(The sign in each element of the matrix indicates how the first item in that
row responds to an increase in the top item in that column.)

    The categorization of individuals into these four groups is of course very
stylized, as is the characterization of monetary policy as an attempt to serve
their respective interests and to raise revenue. This description does, how-
ever, capture some essential impacts of monetary policy: First, monetary
policy can raise revenue for the government, and in some countries seignior-
age revenue is significant. Second, to the extent that preexisting nominal
contracts link individuals in the economy, inflation helps debtors at the ex-
pense of lenders. Third, more restrictive reserve requirements divert loanable
funds away from new borrowers toward government liabilities.
    An implication of the analysis is that governments with little need for
seigniorage and that place great weight on protecting the valueof outstand-
ing loan contracts (relative to the weight they place on debtors and new bor-
rowers) will tend to have low inflation and restrictive reserve requirements.
Countries with large seigniorage needs and that place great weight on the
interests of old and new borrowers will have higher inflation and less restric-
tive reserve requirements. Given its seigniorage needs, a country that places
more weight on maintaining the real value of existing loan contracts will
use monetary restrictions relatively more than inflation (monetary growth)
to raise seigniorage revenue. Even though lenders and borrowers establish
nominal interest rates that perfectly anticipate the inflation that actually
occurs, since some deposits are held in the form of reserves that pay a zero


                                     14
nominal return, inflation is not neutral in its distributional effects: Higher
inflation puts more of the burden of raising seigniorage revenue on lenders.

Implications for Cross-Border Banking Flows

    So far I have considered a single economy in isolation. In the next sec-
tion I extend the analysis to consider the implications of various forms of
integration. But the model of the closed economy foreshadows much of what
happens.
    Imagine a variety of countries that differ in terms of the four features
described at the top of the matrix above. A country is likely to attract
deposits from abroad if its deposit rate is higher than elsewhere, and to
borrow from abroad if its loan rate is higher than elsewhere.

   inward vs. outward transformation

    Not surprisingly, (as in a purely real model) countries where borrowers
(those with late endowments) have high endowments relative to lenders (with
early endowments), i.e., countries where y is relatively high, will attract cap-
ital from abroad, both in deposits and in loans (the case of inward transfor-
mation). These countries have good investment opportunities relative to the
domestic supply of loanable funds. Moreover, countries whose governments
weight the interests of (existing) lenders heavily relative to those of (existing
and new) borrowers are, other things equal, more likely to attract both de-
posits and loans. These countries impose higher reserve requirements both
to reduce the need for inflation to finance seigniorage and to raise the interest
rate on loans.7 Since more of domestic lenders' savings is diverted toward
holding reserves, less is available for borrowers. Conversely, countries where
lenders have high endowments relative to borrowers or whose governments
place greater weight on the interests of borrowers than of lenders are likely
to have lower interest rates on both deposits and loans, and to experience•
both deposit and loan outflows.

   7Under the assumptions here, a higher reserve requirement benefits depositors by im-
proving their terms of trade vis-a-vis borrowers. This result does not generalize to bor-
rowers' preferences that exhibit much more intertemporal substitutability, or, as shown
below, to situations where the loan market is internationally competitive.

                                          15
     banking centers vs. disintermediation

    Why do some countries become banking centers while others are disinter-
mediated? The analysis points to the government's need for seigniorage as
the determining factor. Countries whose governments seek to extract more
resources out of their financial systems will, other things equal, have lower
real deposit rates and higher real rates on loans. Deposits will tend to flow
out of these countries toward countries with lower seigniorage needs, and bor-
rowers will seek to borrow from these countries to take advantage of lower
loan rates. This result is consistent with the observation that banking cen-
ters in the sample of countries examined above earn much less seigniorage,
relative to their GDP's, than other countries, and have lower reserves relative
to deposits.

3. Market Integration

   Say that monetary policy remains a national concern, but that financial
markets become integrated internationally. Financial integration could mean
that deposits, bank claims, or both, become traded internationally.

    Deposit Trade

    Say that banks compete internationally for deposits, but that banks con-
tinue to lend only at home. This might be the outcome, for example, with
no legal restrictions at all on capital flows, if banks maintain a unique ability
to monitor the creditworthiness of local borrowers.8
    Opening a national economy to trade in deposits would mean that banks
and lenders in that economy would face a given world real deposit rate,
   8Comments by some observers suggest that this is the likely outcome of financial in-
tegration. Garber and Weisbrod (1993), for example, argue that financial integration
between the United States and Mexico will have little effect on U.S. bank lending to Mexi-
can nonbanks since U.S. banks lack familiarity with Mexican loan customers. Stiglitz and
Weiss (1981) formally model the role of informational advantages in lending. Equivalent
arguments with respect to deposit activity are less prevalent. In fact, cross-currency bank
claims and bank deposits are of roughly comparable magnitudes. This similarity may,
however, simply reflect artificial barriers to financial integration rather than the intrinsic
tradability of the two types of financial instruments.


                                            16
which I will denote RSD. I ignore possible inflation, exchange and default
risk and treat this rate as constant. In order to attract deposits, domestic
banks must offer a deposit rate competitive with the world rate. Competition
among domestic banks for deposits implies the zero profit condition:

                     RD = [(1    —
                                     ))R + )tJH÷1 = R*D;
that is, the anticipated real return on domestic loans and reserves, appropri-
ately weighted by the reserve requirement, must equal the world rate.
    To the extent that a country attracts or loses deposits, its seigniorage
base rises or falls. I use w to denote the ratio of period t deposits invested
locally to the total deposits of lenders that period. Hence a value of w1 above
one means that the country has attracted net deposits from the world that
period, and a value below one means that it has lost deposits to the world.
I also make the assumption, which turns out to have consequence, that net
and gross deposits positions coincide, i.e., that deposits flow only one way. I
discuss the significance of this assumption below.
    Taking into account potential deposit trade, the expression for the price
change needed to finance a given level of seigniorage revenue becomes:


                                             Wg   i                       (10)

Since young lenders can earn the world deposit rate by investing abroad, their
welfare is unaffected by domestic monetary policy. That is, if investors make
local deposits, they must expect the domestic return to match the foreign
return. The utility levels of the other factions in the economy now become:

               U = ln(1     —
                                A)+lnwt +lny

   Investors will choose to invest an amount wg that satisfies:

                          R.D                                             (11)
where the right-hand side of the inequality denotes the domestic return as a
function of current deposit investment Wt, y,g, and the reserve requirement

)7 and deposit investment w÷iexpected in the future. This expression
must hold with equality if Wj > 0. Note that current monetary policy does
not affect current portfolio investment. Note also that, at an interior equilib-
rium, investment rises with borrower's income, the expected future reserve
requirement, and future deposit investment, and falls with the seigniorage
requirement?
    I assume that monetary authorities set Ag each period before depositors
decide where to place their funds. Since monetary policy does not affect
current investment, however, I assume that monetary authorities correctly
anticipate the subsequent portfolio decisions. In order to satisfy the seignior-
age requirement authorities must set Ag at least at g/wg (at which point
generating the needed seigniorage requires infinite inflation).
    The first-order condition for the reserve requirement becomes:
                        —oLYE
                                    - LOL —uLOB
                                                           0.                          (12)

where . = max(wg_i, 1). The expression holds with equality if the conse-
quent A > g/wg.1°
   If the solution is interior, having more domesticdeposits raises the optimal
reserve requirement, and thereby lowers the inflation needed to meet the
seigniorage requirement.
    A steady-state equilibrium comprises a portfolio position w and a reserve
requirement A that jointly satisfy expressions (11) and (12), with Wg =
w,Ag = A =
    Since the analytic expressions for the equilibrium values of A and w are
complicated to the point of intractability, I rely on some numerical solutions
to illustrate the results. This model is too stylized for any of the parameter
values and solutions to be considered indicative o. any actual economy. The
only purpose is to suggest the direction of the effect of a change in circum-
stances and in government preferences on monetary policy and on deposit
flows.
  Appendix Table 6 presents steady-state values of A (the reserve require-
ment), w the share of domestic deposits held domestically, and the consequent
   9An interior investment allocation is locally stable, since, given expectations about the
future, the domestic real return decreases in the amount invested locally.
  '°Again, the second-order condition for a maximum is satisfied.

inflation rate for the values of 6YB and 50B indicated on the first and second
columns, (with 50L normalized at one) and for the values of y, g, and R'
indicated on the top row. I consider values of 8YB of .95, 1, and 1.05 and of
60B of .90 and .93.

   the base case

   As a base case I set y =   1 (meaning that borrowers and lenders have the
same endowment), a seigniorage requirement of .005 (or .25 per cent of the
aggregate endowment), and a world deposit rate of 7.5 per cent. Note that
the inflation rate is very sensitive to the weight placed on old borrowers. For
each value of 5YB, the inflation rate is between 5 and 6 per cent when 50B
is at its lower value and several hundred per cent when it is at its higher
value. Accompanying higher inflation is a lower reserve requirement. The
low inflation regime is associated with deposit inflow (w > 1) and the high
inflation regime with deposit outflow (w < 1).
    The simulations suggest, then, that countries that place relatively more
weight on maintaining the real value of loan contracts will attract more
deposits. Since the base of the inflation tax is higher, a given amount of
seigniorage revenue can then be raised with a lower inflation rate.
    Increasing the social weight on the interests of new borrowers affects these
magnitudes in the same direction as increasing the weight on existing debtors,
but the magnitudes involved are much smaller.

   future endowments

    Say that the endowment of borrowers is instead 1.01, meaning that bor-
rowers have higher endowments relative to lenders. For all the welfare weights
considered, the implication is more deposit inflow and lower inflation. Infla-
tion is negligibly lower in cases where existing creditors have a higher welfare
weight (when the country initially imports deposits) but dramatically lower
in cases where existing debtors have a heavier weight (and the country ini-
tially exports deposits). In two of these three cases raising the value of y
converts the country from a deposit exporter to a deposit importer.

   seigniorage


                                      19
    Doubling the seigniorage demands of the government approximately dou-
bles the consequent inflation rate. This change also increases the reserve
requirement. These two changes have offsetting effects on the net deposit
position, which is virtually unchanged.

    the world deposit rate

    Lowering the world deposit rate from 7.5 to 7 per cent acts like an increase
in y. Either change makes this country a more attractive place to invest
relative to the rest of the world, so the country attracts more deposits from
abroad. Hence., a lower world interest rate means more foreign deposits, lower
inflation and a lower reserve requirement. Again the effects are negligible
when existing debtors have a lower welfare weight (so that inflation is already
low in the base case), but they become significant when existing debtors have
more clout.

    Simulations in which higher weights were placed on the interests of bor-
rowérs lacked interior solutions. In these cases either the inflation rate was
infinite or else the country was unable to attract any demand deposits at all.

    net and gross deposit positions

    I have assumed that net and gross deposit positions coincide. In this
case the net deposit position determines how much national depositors suffer
from inflation. To the extent that deposits flow in two directions, national
deposits in local banks fall short of what the net position would imply. There
is consequently greater incentive for the government to use the inflation tax
as a source of revenue, since national lenders are less adversely affected.
If gross and net positions can differ, the model makes no prediction about
the magnitude of two-way flows. But what they turn out to be affects the
equilibrium net position: As more domestic depositors invest abroad, the
government has greater incentive to raise the inflation rate. Anticipating
higher inflation, fewer net deposits flow in.11
  '1This result suggests a reason why capital flight might be associated with high inflation.
The standard explanation is that capital flees to avoid the inflation tax. Another one
suggested here is that capital flight, by reducing the tax base, forces the government to
inflate at a higher rate to achieve its seigniorage objective.

                                             20
   Loan Trade
   A mirror exercise allows international trade in bank loans, but treats
deposits as nontraded. I do not undertake it here. A difference is that, since
new borrowers can tap loans from the world market, monetary policy has
no effect on their welfare. Lenders rather than borrowers thus bear the full
incidence of the reserve requirement and the inflation tax.

   Full Financial Integration
   Consider now a country that faces open competition in world markets
both for deposits and for loans. I continue to call (one plus) the world real
deposit rate R*D and call the world real loan rate (plus one) R*L. In order to
compete in international loan markets, the national banking system cannot
charge interest on loans that borrowers expect to exceed R*L in real terms
and must offer depositors interest rates that they expect to yield at least
R.D in real terms. Hence, to maintain an internationally competitive bank-
ing system, given public expectations about future inflation, the monetary
authority must impose a reserve requirement that satisfies:

                        R*D =    R' = )ttH7 + (1 — A)R*L.
The change in the price level as a function of the reserve requirement A,
seigniorage g, and the share of national deposits invested locally continues
to be given by expression (10). Hence ) must satisfy:

                     R*D RD =         A7+1wL+1    —g
                                                       +(1_A)R*L.                       (13)
Note that, given anticipated future magnitudes, the return on domestic de-
posits falls with the current amount of demand deposits invested locally and
with the current reserve requirement.'2
    Consider a steady-state situation in which the government expects to
receive the same in bank deposits in the future as now, so that wj =    = w.
In this case it will expect to pursue the same monetary policy in the future
as now, so that '7.H = A = A. The government will then have to set:
  '2The first relationship implies that an interior outcome, if it exists, is stable.

                                             21
                                   (R*L — R*D) — g/w
                                        R*L — I
in order to remain competitive in deposit and loan markets (which it must
be in order to attract deposits to earn any seigniorage whatsoever). In order
to earn an amount g in seigniorage the price change must be:
                                         —          —
                              = w(R'         R*D)       p.L9

   I continue to assume that the government chooses its current reserve
requirement each period before depositors decide where to invest, but that
the government anticipates the subsequent deposit allocation correctly.
    Depending on w, there are two cases to consider:

   1. If w                   —
                                 R*D) then the government can collect its entire
      seigniorage requirement and continue to offer competitive interest rates.
      Given g, the inflation rate will be lower (and the reserve requirement
      higher) the larger the deposit base w. As g rises, so does the inflation
      rate.
   2. If u.' < Rg/(R*f R*D) then the government cannot, even with
      infinite inflation, collect its entire seigniorage requirement and still
      offer competitive terms. The best that the government can do is
      to set X (R — R*D)/R*L, in which case it can collect at most
      (RSL — R*))w/R* in seigniorage. (In this case the reserve requirement
      is equivalent to an outright tax on deposits at rate )%.)13

    The value of w is itself not determined. Wherever depositors invest they
earn the same rate of return. If a country happens to receive a large amount
of deposits, then it can meet its seigniorage needs with a low inflation rate.
 '31f, instead, the government establishes the reserve requirement after depositors choose
where to put their funds, then the government would be able to offer a competitive return
and finance its seigrtiorage needs only if existing deposits met or surpassed the critical
minimum. Otherwise, any small number of depositors in the country would see that there
were not enough of them to allow the government to achieve its revenue objectives and
leave them with a competitive return. Presumably they would also then seek to invest
elsewhere. Hence there are two types of equilibrium for each country, one with deposits
above the threshold, and another with no deposits.

                                           22
Since it has more deposits it will have more funds available to lend, so is
more likely to become a net lender internationally. Countries that receive
fewer deposits will have to impose higher inflation in order to raise a given
amount of seigniorage and to impose a lower reserve requirement in order
to remain internationally competitive. If the level of deposits falls below
           —
              R*D) then the government cannot earn the seigniorage that it
wants even with infinite inflation.
  This result suggests a fundamental indeterminacy about what countries
emerge as banking centers. There may be myriad equilibria depending upon
where lenders decide to put their funds. Nevertheless, a country that is trying
to generate a lot of seigniorage revenue is going to need a larger level of
deposits in order to remain internationally competitive. This result suggests
why banking center countries as a group rely less on seigniorage revenue to
finance government expenditure than other countries do.
    The analysis of the closed economy case suggested the direction in which
deposits and loans would flow between countries whose financial systems
are initially closed if some trade were then allowed. However, once finan-
cial markets become totally open the allocation of deposits and loans may
be arbitrary. But monetary authorities concerned with maintaining their
seigniorage base may not be indifferent among alternative outcomes. This
result suggests why international financial markets might be as subject to re-
strictions on capital flows as they are: Countries experiencing large deposit
outflows might, for example, seek to prohibit them in order to maintain their
seigniorage base.

5. Conclusion
    Certain countries export the intermediation services of the banks subject
to their jurisdiction, receiving deposits from abroad and making loans abroad.
These countries typically have lower inflation, collect less seigniorage, and
have lower reserves relative to bank assets than other countries, particularly
those that are disintermediated internationally.
    This paper has developed a simple model of bank intermediation that
attempts to identify factors that might be important in determining what
countries become banking centers. The analysis points to the following fac-
tors as mattering:


                                      23
  1. A country is more likely to become a banking center if its political
     system is responsive to the interests of existing creditors relative to
     those of existing debtors. Such a country has less incentive to impose
     a high rate of inflation in order to transfer resources from creditors to
     debtors.
  2. Since seigniorage is a tax on financial intermediation, a country that
     is less reliant on revenue from seigniorage is more likely to become a
     financial center.
  3. An element of indeterminacy may be involved in that countries hap-
     pening to have more deposits can earn more in seigniorage with less
     inflation.

    The analysis is meant to suggest some fundamental relationships rather
than to identify all factors that are likely to be relevant Some particularly
critical omissions are the following:

   1. 1 have identified cross-border competition with currency competition,
      ignoring the fact that banking systems can and do issue deposits and
      make loans that are denominated in foreign currencies. In principle
      the analysis could be extended to allow for foreign currency loans and
      deposits.
   2. I have treated monetary policy as the outcome of the day-to-day in-
      centives of the monetary authority. The outcome may suffer from the
      well-known problem of time-inconsistency. For example, everyone in a
      country might benefit from a commitment to low inflation rate in the
      future even though the government might benefit from a high current
      level of inflation. I assume that the government responds only to its
      current incentives. Monetary institutions might exist, however, that
      make commitment to the long-run optimal policy credible.
   3. While it simplified the analysis enormously, the assumption of Cobb-
      Douglas preferences is special. A number of specific results would not
      generalize to arbitrary sets of preferences.
   4. I have ignored several other factors that play an important role in
      international competition for banking services.

                                     24
      (a) In assuming that banking services do not require resources I ig-
           nore the possibility that comparative advantage in intermediation,
           or factor abundance in resources used intensively in banking, is a
           reason for trade. Comparative advantage in my model is "artifi-
           cial," that is, determined by government policy, rather than the
           "natural" consequence of relative productivities and factor endow-
           men ts.
      (b) By assuming that banking is perfectly competitive I ignore the
           role of oligopolistic and monopolistic competition as a reason for
           international trade in banking services. Recent developments in
           international trade suggest how imperfect competition by itself
           can lead to cross-border trade)4
       (c) In considering a situation of perfect certainty I ignore international
            diversification as a reason for cross-border intermediation.
       (d) I have not considered the role of the central bank as a provider of
            deposit insurance and lender of last resort. Recent development
            in the theory of domestic banking have suggested the contribution
            of insurance mechanisms to banking efficiency.'5

    Some extensions to the analysis might prove fruitful. For example, one
extension would no longer treat countries as price takers in international
markets for deposits and bank loans, allowing for market power and strate-
gic interaction among the monetary authorities in different countries. The
framework might usefully address the effects of harmonization of monetary
policies or the integration of national monetary systems, as opposed simply
to international trade in bank assets and liabilities.
    The indeterminacy of the location of intermediation with fully-integrated
financial markets suggests how international trade in bank deposits and loans
might be harmful as long as the framing of monetary policy remains a na-
tional concern. The services that banks provide are inherently connected to
the policies of the monetary authorities who manage the currencies in which
bank assets and liabilities are denominated. Exploiting the potential gains
from international trade in financial services may require not only greater
