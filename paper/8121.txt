1.     Introduction.

       Many countries attempt to encourage exports by improving the after-tax margins earned by

their exporters. The United States offers one such attractive menu of export incentives through its

income tax. Of these incentives, the best known is the opportunity to exclude from U.S. tax

roughly 15 percent of profits earned by exporting products from the United States. For the years

1984-2000, this 15 percent income exclusion was available by routing exports through offshore

tax-avoidance devices known as Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs). On November 18, 1997, the

European Union brought a complaint before the World Trade Organization (WTO), in which it

alleged that the American policy of permitting exporters to use FSCs violated WTO rules that

prohibit members from subsidizing exports. The ensuing lengthy dispute culminated in a WTO

finding against the United States, and subsequent U.S. adoption in November 2000 of a new export

incentive regime in which a broad-based 15 percent export income exclusion replaced the FSC

system. This latest U.S. reform may not resolve the dispute with Europe, however, since the WTO

is currently (as of January 2001) reviewing the conformance of this American policy with WTO

guidelines.

       Controversies over export promotion policies rest on certain largely untested economic

premises concerning the ability of tax and other policies effectively to stimulate greater exports.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of tax incentives for U.S. exports by examining

exchange rate reactions to the announcement of the European complaint against the United States

on November 18, 1997. Filing of the European complaint introduced the possibility that the

existing 15 percent income exclusion would be eliminated or greatly reduced. To the extent that

real exchange rates are determined by purchasing power parity, it follows that removal of export

incentives that effectively stimulate American exports should be accompanied by a fall in the value
of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies. Furthermore, this exchange rate movement should

vary between countries, since the currencies of countries that import from the United States will

exhibit very different reactions than those of countries that are major exporters to the United States.

       The results presented in this paper are quite consistent with a major effect of tax provisions

on exchange rate movements and patterns of international trade. The U.S. dollar fell against

benchmark currencies on November 18, 1997, and on other days in the ensuing three years when

events suggested that the United States would be required to repeal its tax-based export incentives.

Further indication of a link between exchange rates and tax-based export incentives appears in the

pattern of exchange rate reactions on November 18, 1997, when 10 percent greater net trade

deficits with the United States were associated with currency appreciations of 0.2 percent against

the U.S. dollar. This evidence is consistent with a combination of trade-based exchange rate

determination and important effects of U.S. export promotion policies.

       Section 2 of the paper describes U.S. efforts to encourage exports by exempting certain

fractions of export profits from taxable income. Section 3 presents time series evidence of the

effect of the European FSC complaint on the value of the U.S. dollar, identifying the extent to

which dollar movements correspond to predicted effects of developments in the ongoing

controversy. Section 4 offers a cross-sectional analysis of exchange rate movements on November

18, 1997, in which foreign currencies react in a way that is consistent with the trade implications of

possible FSC repeal. Section 5 is the conclusion.



2.     Foreign Sales Corporations.

       Firms exporting goods from the United States during the years 1971 ‚Äì 2000 were entitled to

do so in legally roundabout fashions that enabled them to exempt a fraction of export profits from




                                                                                                  2
taxation. 1 While complying with the necessary rules was cumbersome, the tax advantages were

large enough to make it well worth the while of most large American exporters to take advantage

of this opportunity.

         In order to obtain this export subsidy from 1984 to 2000,2 it was necessary to establish an

FSC in an offshore location such as Guam, Barbados, or the Virgin Islands. For legal purposes,

exports might then travel from the United States to their ultimate foreign destinations via the FSC.

Hence, an American computer company selling a computer manufactured in Texas to a buyer in

northern Italy first sold the computer to its FSC located in Guam, which in turn sells the computer

to the buyer in Italy. The computer did not travel to Guam in the course of this sale, nor were the

FSC offices located in Guam typically very active; instead, these were largely paper transactions.

In the course of these transactions, the FSC located in Guam earned a profit; some of this profit

was immediately subject to U.S. taxation, but a fraction equal to 15/23 was forever exempt,

thereby providing a tax subsidy for exporters. 3

         For an American firm whose profits are fully taxed by the United States at the 35 percent

corporate tax rate, there was a benefit associated with making the FSC‚Äôs share of total export

profits as large as possible. 4 Consider the case in which the American computer manufacturer

produced its computer for $1,500 in the United States and sold the computer in Italy for $2,000.

Without the use of an FSC, all $500 of this profit was subject to U.S. taxation at the 35 percent

  Portions of the following brief description of FSCs and summary of the relevant literature are excerpted from Desai
and Hines (forthcoming).

  The phrase ‚Äúexport subsidy‚Äù appearing here and elsewhere refers only to the economic concept of export subsidy (as
used, for example, by Krugman and Obstfeld (1991, pp. 108-111)), and not the legal concept of ‚Äúexport subsidy‚Äù as
defined by WTO rules. A far more elaborate legal and textual analysis than that provided in this paper is necessary in
order to determine whether or not U.S. export tax incentives represent ‚Äúexport subsidies‚Äù for WTO purposes.

  Alternatively, the Guamanian FSC might not take title to the export property, but instead receive a commission for
facilitating the export sale. According to data reported by Belmonte (2000), 21% of FSCs in 1996 bought and sold
export property, while the remaining 79% simply received commissions for export sales.
4
  The tax benefits of exporting through FSCs were available to all corporations in the United States, including those
that are foreign-owned.


                                                                                                                 3
rate. With the FSC involved in the transaction, the FSC might have purchased the computer for

$1,885 and sold it in Italy for $2,000, thereby earning an export profit of $115. The American

exporting company therefore would owe taxes on the remaining $385 of export profits, and its FSC

would likewise owe U.S. taxes on (8/23)*$115, or $40. The remaining $75 [(15/23)*$115 = $75]

of FSC profit was exempt from U.S. taxation, and, since FSCs were located in offshore

jurisdictions that impose no taxes, the $75 was also exempt from foreign taxation. At a tax rate of

35 percent, this translates into a tax saving of $26.25. Since law fixes the 15/23 exclusion ratio, it

was therefore in the taxpayer‚Äôs interest to establish that the FSC export profits were as large as

possible. 5

         As a consequence, U.S. law also required taxpayers to calculate the profit of an FSC based

on methods that limited the exempt fraction of total export profits. Taxpayers were entitled to

choose among several different methods of distributing export profits between the exporter located

in the United States and its offshore FSC. The first, and most commonly used, method was simply

to assign the FSC a commission equal to 23 percent of export profits. In the previous example,

$115 of FSC profit was arrived at through the application of this method. It is on the basis of the

prevalence with which exporters assigned their FSCs 23 percent of export profits, together with the

15/23 exclusion ratio, that FSCs are typically described as having exempted 15 percent of export

profits from taxation. Other methods of determining FSC income are described in Desai and Hines

(forthcoming).

         There were restrictions on the kinds of export sales that could be routed through an FSC, as

well as restrictions on the details of FSC management. In order to be eligible for the tax benefits

offered by FSCs, export property could not have more than 50 percent of non-U.S. content and

  Taxpayers were not entitled to defer U.S. taxation of FSC profits. Corporations exporting through FSCs instead
receive tax benefits in the form of the exemption of 15/23 of FSC profits.


                                                                                                                   4
could not be intended for ultimate use in the United States. Qualifying export property was

required to be tangible; meaning that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and like property could not

receive FSC treatment. 6 Furthermore, certain specific items were ineligible for FSC treatment.

These included oil and gas products (other than petrochemicals), 50 percent of military equipment

sales, and various idiosyncratic commodities, including unprocessed softwood timber, western red

cedar, and horses for slaughter shipped by sea. FSCs were subject to strict administrative

requirements that could be daunting for small exporters. As a result, legislation establishing FSCs

also authorized the creation of entities known as ‚Äúsmall FSCs,‚Äù ‚Äúshared FSCs‚Äù and ‚ÄúIC-DISCs‚Äù

with similarly attractive tax attributes but reduced administrative requirements, that served to

facilitate the exports of small companies.

         An entirely separate type of export subsidy is available to American multinational firms

with excess foreign tax credits. The nature of the subsidy is that part or all of export profits can be

treated as foreign source income for the purpose of U.S. income taxation. This sales source rule is

more generous to qualifying firms than is the subsidy provided by the use of FSCs. Since many

American multinational firms have excess foreign tax credits, 7 and the parent companies of

American multinational firms account for 58 percent of all U.S. exports of goods, 8 it follows that

this export subsidy is potentially quite important. Notably, this export subsidy is not available to

American exporters that are not multinational firms. While official U.S. government figures

indicate that FSCs were responsible for roughly $4 billion of tax saving for American exporters by

6
  Exporters of intangible property such as patent rights are typically compensated in the form of royalties that are
treated as foreign-source income under U.S. law and therefore effectively untaxed if received by domestic taxpayers
with excess foreign tax credits. See Hines (1995) for an analysis of the economic impact of this treatment of royalty
income. Additionally, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 permitted computer software to receive FSC treatment starting
in 1998.
7
  Grubert et al. (1996) report that firms with excess foreign tax credits received 33 percent of the foreign income of
American corporations in 1984, and 66 percent in 1990, which follows the U.S. tax rate reduction in 1986. They also
note that the fraction of foreign income received by firms with excess foreign tax credits appears to be falling over
time, reaching 35 percent in 1992.



                                                                                                                 5
2000, Desai and Hines (forthcoming) conclude that the opportunity to allocate export income to

foreign source for U.S. tax purposes may be even more valuable to American multinational

exporters.

           Ongoing trade disputes between the United States and Europe took an interesting turn on

November 18, 1997, when the European Union lodged a complaint with the WTO alleging that the

American FSC program represented an illegal export subsidy. Contemporaneous observers noted

that the European complaint represented a retaliation for successful American claims that European

import regimes for bananas and hormone-treated beef violated WTO rules. The original FSC

complaint was followed by inconclusive consultations between the United States and the European

Union on December 17, 1997, and continued unfruitful consultations on February 10, 1998. On

July 23, 1999 the WTO‚Äôs Dispute Resolution Panel issued its interim report stating that the

American FSC program violated WTO rules. The July 23 report also indicated that the United

States would be required to rescind its FSC provisions by October 1, 2000 or else face retaliatory

penalties. Following the appearance of the interim report, the European Union and the United

States together requested on August 6, 1999 that the panel review the precise aspects of the interim

report. The WTO‚Äôs final ruling against the United States appeared on September 17, 1999.

           On October 28, 1999, the United States indicated its intention to appeal the WTO‚Äôs report,

and filed a formal notice of appeal. The U.S. appeal was withdrawn on November 2, 1999, but

refiled on November 26, 1999. Following rounds of submissions by all parties to the dispute, as

well as oral hearings, the WTO formally ruled on the legality of FSCs on February 24, 2000,

finding that the FSC program violates WTO rules and must be replaced by October 1, 2000.

           The American response came quickly. On February 28, 2000 American Treasury Secretary

Lawrence Summers said that the United States would not abandon its program of subsidizing

                                                                                                 6
exports, and would instead start consultations with the European Union to determine appropriate

compensation. On April 7, 2000, the United States informed the Dispute Resolution body of its

intention to implement its recommendations consistently with WTO obligations. On September

13, 2000, the House of Representatives voted in favor of legislation (H.R. 4986, the FSC Repeal

and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000) that would effectively retain current export

subsidies while also adding small subsidies for sales by foreign affiliates of American

multinational corporations. This legislation was signed into law on November 17, 2000 by

President Clinton who referred specifically to the WTO dispute at the signing of the legislation.



3.       Time series evidence of the impact of the WTO controversy.

         U.S. tax policies encourage exports by improving the after-tax margins received by

American exporters. As a result, the introduction of an export subsidy typically makes exporters

eager to expand their sales abroad, which in competitive markets results in reduced purchase prices

for foreign buyers and greater export volume. 9 Long-run trade balance then implies that the prices

of American goods must appreciate relative to the prices of foreign goods, since otherwise the

United States would become a net exporter. This price adjustment can be accomplished either by

greater inflation differentials between the United States and other countries, or, more likely, by an

appreciation of the value of the American dollar relative to the values of foreign currencies. 10 One

simple way to think about how this happens is to note that the export subsidy makes American

9
  Portions of this section are drawn from Desai and Hines (forthcoming). The situation is somewhat more complex
when firms export to their own foreign affiliates, since then the existence of export subsidies encourages exporters to
charge higher export prices. This incentive conflicts with regulations that require firms to charge arm‚Äôs-length prices
for exports to related parties, so the net effect on final prices is unclear. See Rangan and Lawrence (1993) and Clausing
(forthcoming).
10
   While the assumption of purchasing power parity (PPP) is commonly made, the available evidence (reviewed by
Froot and Rogoff (1995)) suggests that PPP is best understood as a long-run phenomenon. Recent attention in
international macroeconomics (see, for example, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000)) has identified distortions to international




                                                                                                                   7
goods more attractive to foreign buyers, which leads to dollar appreciation. The endogenous

change in the value of the dollar in turn serves to attenuate the effect of the export subsidy on

export volumes, since American goods become less attractive to foreign buyers as the dollar

appreciates. The net effect of the subsidy and the endogenous change in the value of the dollar is

to expand the volumes of both American exports and American imports. These expansions are of

course nonuniform, and in particular, exports of goods that are ineligible for the tax subsidy will

fall, even as exports of those that are eligible for the tax subsidy will rise.

         This section considers evidence of the impact of the FSC program on the value of the

American dollar relative to the values of foreign currencies. Over the course of November 1997‚Äì

April 2000 there were several twists and turns in the negotiations between the United States and

the World Trade Organization over the likelihood of the retention of American export subsidies.

By looking at changes in the value of the American dollar on those dates, it is possible to infer the

effect of the FSC program on proclivities to export from the United States. Since many other

factors also influence exchange rates, it is necessary to interpret this information carefully.

         The leftmost column of Table 1 identifies the dates of major events surrounding the FSC

controversy between the United States and the WTO. 11 Of these, two are prominent: November

18, 1997, when the EU complaint was first lodged with the WTO, and July 23, 1999, when the

WTO‚Äôs Dispute Resolution Panel issued its interim report stating that the American FSC program

violated WTO rules. The July 23 report also indicated that the United States would be required to

rescind its FSC provisions by October 1, 2000. Contemporaneous press accounts indicate that both

the November 18, 1997 and July 23, 1999 dates were considered momentous for the history of the

trade dispute; other dates are significant to differing degrees.


goods markets (such as those introduced by FSCs) as a possible explanation for a variety of puzzles in international
finance, including deviations from PPP.



                                                                                                                  8
        A simple way to identify the impact of the events surrounding the WTO controversy is to

regress daily changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against dummy variables for event dates,

controlling for other observable factors. Table 1 presents estimated coefficients from such

regressions. The sample for these regressions consists of foreign exchange trading days between

January 1, 1997 and June 13, 2000. The dependent variable is the daily percent change in the

value of the American dollar relative to the British pound sterling. 12 Since the dependent variable

is calculated as the percentage change in numbers of pounds to the dollar, it follows that a negative

value of the dependent variable corresponds to dollar weakening. Exchange rates are calculated as

of market closing in New York, so prices will reflect any impact of European news on the same

days.

        The results reported in the first column of Table 1 indicate that the dollar weakened on

November 18, 1997, falling by 0.1092 percent against the pound sterling. This decline is

statistically significant and quite consistent with the predicted effect of removing U.S. export

subsidies, since doing so shifts the supply schedule for American exports. Of course, the foreign

exchange market could not be confident, on the basis of the November 18, 1997 action, that the

United States would ultimately remove the FSC portion of its export tax subsidies. Nonetheless, it

was known at the time that the United States was vulnerable to charges such as those brought by

the European Union, given that the FSC‚Äôs predecessor program (in place from 1971 to 1984) had

been subject to a successful complaint under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1982.

All that was necessary was for a major complaintant to appear with charges against the United

States, and that happened on November 18, 1997.

  The British pound is chosen as the alternative to the U.S. dollar for these calculations because it is a common
benchmark currency, and one that was not buffeted either by events surrounding the European Monetary Union or the
economic crises in Japan and Asia.


                                                                                                             9
         Given uncertainty over the ultimate impact of any WTO action, an exchange rate response

of roughly 0.1 percent is quite in line with the effect of estimated supply and demand elasticities.

At an average profit margin of 10 percent, a 15 percent tax exclusion reduces taxable income by

1.5 percent of sales. At a tax rate of 35 percent, this generates a tax saving of 0.5 percent of sales ‚Äì

which, given the 35 percent tax rate, produces approximately a 0.75 percent reduction in prices at

which exporters would be willing to offer goods for foreign sale. Of course, elimination of the

FSC program would not necessarily entail elimination of export subsidies through the sales source

rules, so not all the value of FSCs is likely to be lost in the course of a successful dispute brought

by the European Union.

         Taking the aggregate price elasticity of U.S. exports to be roughly equal to -1.0, and the

aggregate price elasticity of U.S. imports to be roughly equal to ‚Äì0.5,13 it follows that an offsetting

exchange rate movement of two thirds the size of the lost export subsidy ‚Äì or 0.5 percent ‚Äì is

required to restore trade balance. 14 Then allowing for the incomplete use of FSCs, and the

backstop use of the sales source rules by firms currently electing FSC treatment of their exports,

together reduces this predicted effect, as does uncertainty over the final disposition of the FSC

program. So the likely impact of the European Union action is to reduce the value of the dollar by

perhaps 0.1 percent, which appears to be what happened on November 18, 1997.

         Subsequent events in the WTO controversy are also associated with changes in the value of

the dollar, though these events are likely to be less important from the standpoint of their direct

impact on dollar values. As reported in column one of Table 1, the failure of initial consultations

between the United States and the European Union on December 17, 1997 is associated with a fall

   Sawyer and Sprinkle (1996) suggest these estimates on the basis of their survey of empirical studies of aggregate
U.S. export and import elasticities. See also Hooper, Johnson, and Marquez (1998).
14
   Starting from trade balance, loss of FSC benefits reduces exports by (0.75 + e) percent and reduces imports by (-
0.5)e percent, in which e is the change in the dollar exchange rate. Trade balance then implies that e = -0.5.


                                                                                                                 10
of 0.7160 percent of dollar value, though other major news items of the day no doubt contributed

to the dollar‚Äôs fall in value. Most other event dates are associated with dollar movements whose

signs are consistent with the impact of FSC removal on foreign exchange values, though

magnitudes of estimated coefficients are significantly greater than what might be expected from

FSC removal alone. Thus the failed second consultations between the European Union and the

United States on February 10, 1998 were associated with a 0.5695 percent drop in the value of the

dollar, the (largely anticipated) July 23, 1999 interim report of the Dispute Resolution Panel with a

0.3004 percent drop in the dollar‚Äôs value. The attempted reconciliation of the United States and the

European Union on August 6, 1999 is associated with a 0.1050 percent strengthening of the dollar,

while the (anticipated) September 17, 1999 WTO ruling against the United States is associated

with a fall of 0.0078 percent of the dollar‚Äôs value. The American appeal on October 28, 1999

coincides with an appreciation of 0.3342 percent of the dollar‚Äôs value, and the withdrawal of this

appeal on November 2, 1999 coincides with a fall of 0.3922 percent of dollar value.

        The only anomalous sign appears on February 24, 2000, when the fully anticipated WTO

final ruling against the United States is associated with a rise in the value of the dollar of 0.4503

percent. The aggressive February 28 response by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is

associated with a dollar appreciation of 0.4981 percent, while the formal American reply to the

Dispute Resolution Board on April 7, 2000 is associated with an appreciation of 0.1320 percent.

        Since many events in the course of a day are likely to influence exchange rates, and the

expected impact of the FSC program is subtle, it is a mistake to overinterpret the results reported in

column one of Table 1. Columns 2-4 of the same table report estimated coefficients from

regressions that add daily measures of changes in stock market indices and short-term interest

rates. Specifically, the stock market variable is the daily difference in the performance (measured




                                                                                                  11
in percentage terms) of the U.S. S&P 500 index and the British FTSE 100 index. The benefit of

including such a variable in the regression is that stock market prices reflect the impact of omitted

news variables, such as economic news, inflation fears, and various political developments that

may be correlated with exchange rate movements and therefore impart a correlation between

exchange rates and equity prices. When included in the regression reported in column two of

Table 1, this variable takes the expected positive sign, while the absolute value of the coefficient

on the dummy variable for November 18, 1997 falls slightly to 0.1076. Column three introduces a

variable equal to the difference in the daily change in U.S. and British short-term (90 day)

government interest rates, which, when included, has little effect on daily event coefficients. The

regression reported in column four of Table 1 includes both the stock index and interest rate

differences, with results that are similar to those reported in column two.

        While the results reported in Table 1 appear to be robust to the inclusion of additional

explanatory variables that reflect the economic significance of daily events, it is inevitable that

important factors are omitted. November 18, 1997 differs from most others in being a very slow

news day, the main international trade-related nuggets being the (anticipated) failure of a large

Japanese bank and the lifting of the European ban on imports of Iranian pistachios. Hence, the

filing of a European complaint against the United States was a major development, and it is

reasonable to infer that the exchange rate movement on that day reflects the impact of that news.

While the consistency of the sign pattern for other event days, as reported in Table 1, is reassuring,

these coefficients reflect the cumulative impact of many factors unrelated to FSCs.

        The November 18, 1997 evidence indicates that the market reaction to news of the

European Union filing against the United States is consistent with other evidence of aggregate

trade demand and supply elasticities, and with an expectation that the inability to use FSCs would




                                                                                                   12
affect American exports. Hence this evidence serves the function of offering a market-based test

of previous conjectures as to the likely impact of FSCs on export patterns. 15



4.       Cross sectional evidence of the impact of the WTO controversy.

         The exchange rate regressions reported in the previous section correlate daily movements

in value of the U.S. dollar with events surrounding the European Union complaint about the U.S.

Foreign Sales Corporation program. This section takes a close look at daily exchange rate changes

on November 18, 1997, the day on which the European complaint was first aired. The purpose of

this analysis is to subject the theory that the European complaint is the source of dollar weakening

on that day to a more powerful test than that provided by examination of a single aggregate price

movement. This section develops a model that predicts cross-sectional differences in exchange

rate reactions as a function of proclivities to trade with the United States. The available evidence

indicates that relative currency movements on November 18, 1997 are indeed related to foreign

exposures to U.S. markets, providing further evidence of a link between exchange rate movements

and the WTO complaint, and suggesting an important impact of FSCs on trade patterns.



4.1.     A Model of Export Incentives and Exchange Rates.



15
   Most previous studies of U.S. export tax incentives use estimated export and import elasticities to predict the impact
of export promotion, rather than estimate actual impacts. Examples include reports by the U.S. Treasury (1993, 1997)
that estimate that FSC repeal would reduce U.S. exports by $1.5 billion in 1992; Horst and Pugel (1977), who estimate
that repeal of DISCs (a predecessor to FSCs ) would reduce U.S. exports by $2.1 billion in 1974; and Mutti and Grubert
(1984), who likewise find that DISC repeal would reduce U.S. exports by 3.1 percent in 1979. Rousslang and Tokarick
(1994) estimate that the FSC and sales source rules together have the same effect on trade volume as would reducing
American tariffs by more than one third. Kemsley (1998) differs from this literature in estimating the impact of tax
policy changes on export proclivities; he finds that firms with excess foreign tax credits (and therefore that are able to
benefit from the sales source rules) have higher ratios of exports to sales by foreign affiliates than do firms with deficit
foreign tax credits. Desai and Hines (forthcoming) estimate that the 1984 repeal of DISCs and introduction of the less
generous FSCs were responsible for a 3.1 percent decline in U.S. exports. Desai and Hines (2001) also report that the
European complaint on November 18, 1997 is associated with a 0.5 percent drop in market value for the average
American exporter.


                                                                                                                    13
        In order to predict the cross-sectional impact of potential FSC repeal, it is helpful to

consider country i‚Äôs trade balance, its net exports being denoted œà i and defined as the difference

between aggregate exports and aggregate imports:

                                n                  n
(1)                     œài ‚â°   ‚àë      S ij (e) ‚àí   ‚àë D ij (p) .
                               j =1                j =1


In equation (1), S ij (e) is the supply of country i‚Äôs exports to country j. This supply is a function of

the prices that country i exporters receive (as measured in units country i‚Äôs currency), which is in

turn a function of the vector of real exchange rates, denoted e. Dij (p) is country i‚Äôs demand for

imports from country j, which is a function of p, the vector of real prices (in units of country i‚Äôs

currency) paid by country i importers. The vector p differs from e due to export subsidies;

assuming that foreign markets are perfectly competitive, it follows that export subsidies are fully

passed through to buyers in the form of lower prices, so the elements of p are (1 ‚àí s k )ek , ‚àÄk , in

which ek is the real value of country k‚Äôs currency, and sk is the rate at which country k subsidizes

exports. Trade balance implies that œà i = 0 .

        Consider a small increase in the export subsidy provided by country one. This policy

change affects country i‚Äôs trade balance in four ways: first, by reducing i‚Äôs cost of importing from

country one; second, by strengthening the value of country one‚Äôs currency and therefore attracting

exports from country i; third, by influencing the value of country i‚Äôs currency; and fourth, by

influencing the values of all other currencies. Taking the fourth effect to be small enough (from

country i‚Äôs standpoint) safely to ignore, it is convenient to define starting units so that all exchange

rates are unity and initial export subsidies are zero. Imposing the trade balance condition, the first

three effects are captured by differentiating equation (1):




                                                                                                   14

Equation (2), in turn, implies:

                                                            ‚àÇœà i
The denominator of (3) contains the derivative                   that captures the effect of movements in

country i‚Äôs exchange rate on changes in its trade balance. Since exports contract and imports

expand as the value of country i‚Äôs currency appreciates, it follows that this derivative is negative.

Furthermore, its value is likely to be a function of the economic size of country i. If countries have

identical export and import elasticities, then the value of this derivative is simply a scalar multiple

of exports or imports (which are identical if trade is balanced):

                           ‚àÇœà i
(4)                             = ‚àíŒ≥S i = ‚àíŒ≥D i ,

imports.

        It is reasonable, as well as expedient, to assume that the supply of exports and the demand

for imports each takes constant elasticity form:

                 ‚àÇS ij          S ij
(5a)                     = Œ∑S          ‚àÄi , j

in which Œ∑ S is the elasticity of export supply and Œ∑ D is the elasticity of import demand. Then

starting from a situation in which export subsidies are zero and e j = p j = 1, ‚àÄj , equations (3), (4),

                     ds1

in which Œ± , Œ≤1 and Œ≤ 2 are parameters to be estimated, and ui is the residual. The theory predicts

that Œ≤1 < 0 and Œ≤ 2 > 0 , with magnitudes that depend on aggregate supply and demand elasticities,

as well as the extent to which the average value of country 1‚Äôs currency is affected by its own

export subsidies.



4.2        Data and Evidence.

           In order to test the implications of this model of the influence of tax policies on real

exchange rates, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between exchange rate reactions to the

potential removal of U.S. export subsidies through FSCs and proclivities to trade with the United

                                                               dei
States. For this purpose, the exchange rate reaction,              in equation (7), is taken to be the one-day
                                                               ds1



                                                                                                         16
percent change in the value of country i‚Äôs currency (relative to the U.S. dollar) on November 18,

1997. Country i‚Äôs export share, œÉ iE1 , is the share of its exports sold to the United States in 1997;

its import share, œÉ iI1 , is the share of its imports purchased from the United States in 1997. The

sample consists of 58 countries for which these data are available. Table 2 presents means and

standard deviations of the variables for the entire sample, as well as for a subsample of countries

for whom the United States is a ‚Äúmajor trading partner‚Äù (meaning that their U.S. export shares

exceed the median value for the entire sample).

        The results of estimating (7) for the whole sample are reported in column 1 of Table 3, in

which the coefficients on both the import and export shares have the predicted signs. The

coefficient of 1.36 on the import share implies that the currency of a country with one hundred

percent of its imports coming from the United States appreciates relative to the U.S. dollar by 1.36

percent more on November 18, 1997 than would the currency of a country with no imports from

the United States. While large relative to the mean for the entire sample, this predicted exchange

rate movement is consistent with the time series evidence presented in Table 1. Table 3 provides

OLS standard errors as well as heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors; levels of statistical

significance are notably higher with the OLS standard errors. In order to control directly for one

potential source of heteroskedasticity, the regression reported in column 3 is run on the major

trading partners subsample; the estimated coefficients are of similar magnitude and significance to

those obtained with the full sample.

        The specifications in columns 2 and 4 define the independent variable as the difference

between import and export shares. This specification effectively constrains the Œ≤1 and

Œ≤ 2 coefficients in (7) to be of equal magnitude and opposite sign. The coefficient on the difference

in column 2 is positive, as predicted, and on the borderline of being statistically significant. The



                                                                                                  17
estimated coefficient of 1.85 implies that ten percent differences in net trade shares are associated

with 0.185 percent differences in exchange rate reactions on the event day. Since the sample

standard deviation of the trade share difference (as reported in Table 2) is 8.2 percent, it follows

that a one standard deviation trade share difference is responsible for exchange rate reactions that

differ by 0.15 percent. This is of similar magnitude to the 0.11 percent daily reaction estimated in

the time series results reported in Table 1 and, in that sense, quite consistent with those results.

The specification reported in column two of Table 3 is used to estimate the model on the

subsample of data for major trading partners, again generating a coefficient of similar magnitude to

that obtained from estimating the model on the whole sample. This cross-country evidence of an

important association between trading patterns and magnitudes of exchange rate movements on

November 18, 1997 reinforces the time series evidence linking exchange rate movements and

developments in the WTO controversy.



5.      Conclusion.

        The practice of using tax incentives and other commercial policies to encourage exports

relies on the premise that such policies are likely to be effective at stimulating exports. To date,

this premise has had limited empirical foundation. This paper provides evidence on the effect of

U.S. tax-based export promotion policies on patterns of international trade by examining the

movement of exchange rates in response to developments surrounding the 1997 European

complaint before the WTO. The time series evidence demonstrates that significant developments

in the WTO dispute were associated with predicted changes in the value of the dollar versus a

benchmark currency. Purchasing power parity implies that cross-country differences in trade

relations with the United States should predict the magnitudes of relative currency movements.




                                                                                                   18
The cross-country evidence of exchange rate reactions to the filing of the European complaint on

November 18, 1997 conforms to these predictions, thereby reinforcing the link between exchange

rate movements and developments in the WTO dispute. Since exchange rate reactions should

materialize only if export incentives influence export propensities, this exchange rate evidence

illustrates the impact of tax-based export incentives on patterns of international trade.

Note: The sample consists of observations of foreign exchange trading days between January 1, 1997 ‚Äì June 13, 2000.
The columns report coefficients from OLS regressions in which the dependent variable equals the daily percent change
in the value of the American dollar relative to the British pound sterling. Since the dependent variable is calculated as the
percent change in numbers of pounds to the dollar, a negative value of the dependent variable corresponds to dollar
weakening. The table reports estimated coefficients for dummy variables for each of the eleven event dates; expected
signs are indicated in parentheses. "% change [S&P 500 (US) - FTSE 100 index (UK)]" is the daily difference in percentage
performance of the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 Indices. "Change (US-UK interest rate difference)" is the daily change in U.S.
and British 90-day government interest rates. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are in parentheses.

Note: "Daily % change in value of foreign currency" is the percentage change in the value of a country's currency
relative to the U.S. dollar on November 18, 1997. "Share of imports from U.S." is the ratio of a country's imports
from the U.S. to all imports for that country. "Share of exports to U.S." is the ratio of a country's exports to the
U.S. to all exports from that country. "(Import share - export share)" is the difference between "Share of imports
from U.S." and "Share of exports to U.S." The bottom panel restricts the sample to those countries which have
"Share of exports to U.S." above the median for the whole sample.

Note: The columns report coefficients from OLS regressions in which the dependent variable equals the percent
change in the value of a country's currency relative to the U.S. dollar on November 18, 1997. The regressions in
columns (1) and (2) employ the full sample of 58 countries; the regressions presented in columns (3) and (4)
restrict the sample to those countries which are major trading partners of the U.S.. "Share of imports from U.S."
is the ratio of a country's imports from the U.S. to all imports for that country. "Share of exports to U.S." is the
ratio of a country's exports to the U.S. to all exports from that country. "(Import share - export share)" is the
difference between "Share of imports from U.S." and "Share of exports to U.S." Heteroskedasticity-consistent
standard errors are in parentheses and OLS standard errors are in brackets. The dependent variable is defined so
that a value of 1.5 represents a 1.5 percent strengthening of the foreign currency against the U.S. dollar - i.e., a
a 1.5 percent reduction in the foreign currency/U.S. dollar exchange rate - on the event date.
