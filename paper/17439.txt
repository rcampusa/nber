                                             ABSTRACT

Studies using data from the early 1990s suggested that while the progressive Social Security benefit
formula succeeded in redistributing benefits from individuals with high earnings to individuals with
low earnings, it was much less successful in redistributing benefits from households with high earnings
to households with low earnings. Wives often earned much less than their husbands. As a result, much
of the redistribution at the individual level was effectively from high earning husbands to their own
lower earning wives. In addition, spouse and survivor benefits accrue disproportionately to women
from high income households. Both factors mitigate redistribution at the household level.

This paper compares outcomes for the earlier cohort with those of a cohort born twelve years later.
The aim of the study is to see whether, after the recent growth in two earner households, and the growth
in women's labor market activity and earnings, the Social Security system now fosters somewhat more
redistribution from high to low earning households. The analysis is based on data from the Health
and Retirement Study and includes members of households with at least one person age 51 to 56 in
either 1992 or in 2004.

As expected, women enjoyed a more rapid growth of labor force participation, hours of work and covered
earnings than men. This increased the redistribution of Social Security benefits among households.
Nevertheless, a considerable gap remains between the labor market activities and earnings of women
versus men. As a result, the Social Security system remains much less successful in redistributing
benefits from households with high covered earnings to those with lower covered earnings than in
redistributing benefits from individuals with high covered earnings to those with lower covered earnings.

       The Social Security benefit formula is designed to redistribute old age benefits in favor of

individuals with low lifetime earnings. Studies using data from the early 1990s for individuals

approaching retirement age found the Social Security old age and survivors program did meet

that goal. However, Social Security was much less successful in redistributing benefits to

families with low lifetime earnings. Three studies (Coronado, Fullerton and Glass, 2000;

Gustman and Steinmeier, 2001; Liebman, 2002) conducted at roughly the same time on three

different data sets found that, when lifetime benefit payments to households were weighed

against taxes paid, there was surprisingly little redistribution fostered by Social Security old age

and survivor benefits -- from families with high lifetime earnings to families with low lifetime

earnings.2

       Since 1992, the labor force participation rate and fraction of women working full time

has increased. As women's earnings increase, the relative value of their spouse and survivor

benefits decline, and they benefit less from the redistributive structure of the benefit formula.

Thus we expect that, at the family level, Social Security has become more redistributive over

time. The question is, how much more redistributive has it become? This study estimates the




2
  A study conducted by Harris and Sabelhaus (2005) for the Congressional Budget Office, using
a CBO dynamic simulation model (CBOLT), concluded there was a significant amount of
redistribution among families with different earnings levels. This conclusion was not strongly
influenced by differences in mortality rates by those with different lifetime earnings, and held for
the sample of households whether or not it included households where one of the members
qualified for disability benefits. Hurd (2011) discusses the differences between the CBO results
and those in other studies, including the three noted above, as well as Goda, Shoven and Slalov
(2011), which is similar in approach to the three earlier studies. He concludes that there are
unexplained differences between these sets of studies and the CBO results.

change in redistribution fostered by the Social Security benefit formula between two cohorts,

those who were 51 to 56 in 1992 and those 51 to 56 in 2004.3

       Of course, there are other changes affecting the value of benefits and taxes over that

twelve year period. Social Security rules have been altered, raising the age at which an individual

is entitled to full benefits, and thereby effectively reducing the value of Social Security benefits

for members of younger cohorts. Moreover, an earnings test is no longer imposed after an

individual reaches full retirement age. In addition, economic variables including interest rates,

wages and productivity, have also changed over time. As interest rates decline, the value of

benefits relative to taxes paid increases for members of cohorts nearing retirement age. Family

structure has also changed, especially influenced by the increasing frequency of divorce.

       It is difficult to standardize for all of these changes while maintaining a convincing

underlying benefit structure. For example, one would not want to impose the benefit formula

applicable to a 55 year old in 1992 on the real earnings of a 55 year old in 2004. Under the

formula applicable twelve years earlier, a person aged 55 with average earnings in 2004 would

be treated as having earnings well above the mean for the earlier period. Although one could

artificially grow earnings over the intervening period, it would greatly oversimplify matters to

use some average measure of annual earnings growth since the earnings structure has changed

over this period, not only changing occupational, educational and other differentials commonly

examined in the labor economics literature, but also between men and women, and among those

with different family types.

  This is the latest HRS cohort with matched Social Security earnings histories available at the
time of writing this paper. The next youngest HRS cohort, the Mid Boomers, includes those ages
51 to 56 in 2010. Survey data became available in the summer of 2011. Matched Social Security
earnings histories for the Mid Boomer cohort are not yet available at the time of writing.




                                                  2
       The simplest approach is to focus on the overall extent of redistribution relevant to each

cohort, using actual earnings and interest rates for each year in question. Measures of

redistribution will then be compared between cohorts both for individuals and families.

Sensitivity of the findings to certain changes, for example the increase in frequency of

households with a single, divorced person, will be examined. Thus we provide summary

measures of the difference in redistribution under the Social Security benefit formula applying in

each period, whatever the cause.

       In the present paper, we concentrate on the change in redistribution of old age benefits

experienced between the 1992 and 2004 cohorts from the Health and Retirement Study when

individuals and households are arrayed by household covered earnings. For reasons of space, we

do not duplicate all the steps taken in our earlier paper where we systematically examined the

reasons for differences in distributions at the individual and family levels, including the

correlation of earnings between husbands and wives by household income, and the relation of

low earnings for women to years worked. In our earlier paper, we also emphasized that once the

higher potential earnings of wives who chose not to spend much of their lifetime at work were

taken into account, there was virtually no redistribution of benefits among households. Here we

do not consider the earnings capacity of wives with limited commitment to the labor market over

the life cycle. In both papers we focus only on redistribution of old age and survivors benefits

and do not consider disability insurance.4



4
  In analyzing the redistribution of old age benefits fostered by the current system, we consider
the payroll tax, but not the income taxation of Social Security. In a paper written at the same time
as the present paper, Coe et al. (2011) do not find that income taxation of Social Security creates
large changes in the measured progressivity of Social Security at the household level.




                                                  3
       Section II sets the stage for the analysis. It reviews how Social Security rules work, and

the differences in labor market activities of cohorts of women in their early to mid-fifties in 1992

and 2004. Social Security measures are computed and compared between the two cohorts in

Section III, focusing on the present values of Social Security benefits and taxes paid. Section IV

then turns to the measures of distribution and redistribution fostered by the Social Security

system, contrasting these measures between individuals and families within each cohort, and also

between cohorts. In Section V we examine the robustness of the findings to changes in the

frequency of divorced households and to differences in the interest rate. Section VI concludes.

II. Framing the Problem

       The Social Security benefit formula determining an individual's own benefits from that

person's own earnings history is designed to be progressive. For example, as we will explain in

more detail below, for a person turning age 60 in 2004, on an annual basis the Primary Insurance

Amount (PIA), the monthly benefit an individual is entitled to at normal retirement age based on

own earnings, replaces 90 percent of the first $7,344 of average indexed earnings, 32 percent of

the next $36,924, and 15 percent of remaining earnings up to the covered maximum.

       These redistributive effects of the formula at the individual level are mitigated at the

family level. When wives have lower earnings than their husbands, by averaging over the two

spouses, a progressive benefit formula generates less redistribution between families than

individuals.5 For men, there is a close correlation between their own lifetime earnings and the

total of their own and their spouse's lifetime earnings. But for women the relationship is much

5
 When wives from high income families spend less time at work, they receive lower earnings
not only because they accumulate fewer hours of paid work, but also because by working fewer
hours or years, they are paid a lower wage rate than if they had been fully committed to the labor
market.




                                                 4
weaker (Gustman and Steinmeier, 2001, Table 1). Women from high income households are

often low earners. Thus when comparing men and women with the same level of own lifetime

earnings, family lifetime earnings are higher for women than for men. As a result, redistributing

benefits toward households where the woman's earnings are low subsidizes many households

where the sum of lifetime earnings for husbands and wives is quite high.

       In addition, as long as spouse and survivor benefits accrue disproportionately to

households with one high earner, the spouse and survivor benefits paid by Social Security

undermine the redistribution of benefits away from high income families. Both spouse and

survivor benefits are top-ups over own benefits. If the spouse has not accumulated ten years of

covered earnings, and thus is not eligible for own benefits, the spouse or survivor benefit will

account for the entire benefit check. When the lower earning spouse has accrued ten years of

covered earnings, but those earnings amount to less than about one third the earnings of the

higher earning spouse, the benefit check of the low earning spouse will be topped-up. The low

earning spouse who receives benefits based both on own earnings and a top-up for spouse or

survivor benefits is called a dual beneficiary. Only when both spouses have identical earnings

histories are there no spouse or survivor benefits.6 Moreover, in a household with high earnings,

the top-up is likely to have a higher value than in a household with low earnings (Steuerle and

Bakija, 1994).




6
  We are ignoring here new claiming strategies for boosting the total value of Social Security
benefits through manipulation of the claiming time of own and spouse benefits. For example,
with two earners over the full retirement age, one person in the household may first claim
benefits as a spouse, then claim own benefits at a higher annual rate because the initial claim date
for own benefits has been postponed.




                                                 5
       To be sure, there is an increasing tendency over time for women from higher income

families to participate more fully in the labor market. This led Smith, Toder and Iams (2003) and

others to predict that even if the benefit formula remained unchanged, the current Social Security

system would once again become more redistributive at the family level.7

       Table 1 shows the differences in labor force participation, full-time work and lifetime

covered earnings for a sample of individuals from the Health and Retirement Study. It includes

two cohorts, those age 51 to 56 in 1992 (the HRS cohort) and those 51 to 56 in 2004 (the Early

Boomer cohort). Over this period, women's labor market activity has increased substantially

relative to men's (see also Iams et al., 2008). What was a 19 percentage point gap between the

labor force participation rates of 51 to 56 year old men and women in 1992 declined to 8

percentage points in 2004. Similarly, what was a 25 percentage point gap between the fractions

of 51 to 56 year old men and women working full time in 1992 declined to 16 percentage points

in 2004. The third panel in Table 1 reports the annualized value of indexed monthly earnings

covered by Social Security, here indicated as Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) times

12.8 The ratio of AIME between men and women declined from 2.85 in 1992 to 1.98 in 2004.

Although the gaps in the measures of labor market activity between men and women are

considerably smaller for the 2004 cohort than for the cohort twelve years older, they remain

substantial.

7
  Note that Biggs, Sarney and Tamborini (2009) disagree with the predictions of Smith, Toder
and Iams (2003). A part of the disagreement results from the different treatment of those who
qualified for disability benefits at younger ages.
8
  AIME is computed from covered earnings and is increased by a wage index up to the year the
individual turns age 60. Earnings are no longer indexed once the person reaches age 60. The
AIME is averaged using the highest 35 years of covered, indexed earnings. Earnings after age 60
will enter into the AIME calculation if they exceed indexed earnings in the lowest of the 35 years
previously counted toward the AIME.

III. Comparing Social Security Benefits and Taxes Between Cohorts

       Before generating the rates of return to Social Security benefits over taxes, it is useful to

discuss in somewhat more detail how Social Security retirement benefits are determined at the

individual and family levels.9 The Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is the monthly Social

Security benefit that would be received if claimed by the individual at full retirement age. It is

calculated from Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). As noted above, for a person

turning age 60 in 2004, on an annual basis the PIA replaces 90 percent of the first $7,344 of

annual earnings, 32 percent of the next $36,924, and 15 percent remaining earnings through the

covered maximum. Within the same household, the ratio of own benefits to own covered

earnings will be greater for a lower earning spouse than for a higher earning spouse.

       For members of the Early Boomer cohort, ages 51 to 56 in 2004 (born 1948 to 1953), full

retirement age is 66. The full retirement age has been increased by 2 months for each year born

from 1955 through 1960 -- a fact that becomes relevant when we calculate benefits for

households where one member falls within the 51 to 56 age range, and the other is younger. For

those born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67. Similarly, the full retirement age may be

lower than 66 for those with a spouse born before 1943.

       Spouse benefits are calculated as half of the benefits that the primary earner would

receive at full retirement age. If the low earning spouse is entitled to own benefits that exceed

half the benefits of the high earning spouse, there are no spouse benefits. Survivor benefits are

calculated from the full benefit the primary earner would have been entitled to had he or she


       9
          This study considers retirement benefits for each spouse. It does not include disability
benefits, survivor benefits for young children or other such benefits provided by the Social
Security system.




                                                  8
survived. The formula for calculating full benefits may be adjusted to reduce the number of years

of earnings counted if the deceased spouse died before reaching full retirement age. Survivor

benefits are adjusted from the deceased spouse's Primary Insurance Amount, upward if the

primary earner had delayed claiming benefits after reaching the full retirement age, or downward

if the deceased spouse had claimed benefits early.

       A person receiving spouse or survivor benefits is considered a dual beneficiary if that

individual is also entitled to benefits based on own earnings that fall below the spouse or

survivor benefit. Benefits based on own earnings are "topped up" to reach the benefit the

individual is entitled to as a spouse or survivor. For example, if both spouses were the same age

and retired at their full retirement age, with the high earning spouse entitled to a PIA of $900,

and the low earning spouse entitled to $100 based on own earnings, the spouse benefit would

top-up the benefit of the low earner from $100 to $450. If the higher earner died at full

retirement age, the lower earning spouse would receive a total survivor benefit of $900,

including the top-up.

       All benefits are adjusted based on the age they are claimed. Own benefits are adjusted

downward when claimed early, and upward when benefit claiming is delayed beyond the full

retirement age. Spouse and survivor benefits are also adjusted for early claiming by the primary

earner and by the spouse.

       For this paper, we use the Social Security Administration's ANYPIA program to calculate

own benefits for members of the Health and Retirement Study.10 Because the ANYPIA program



       10
          In some cases, ANYPIA makes different assumptions from those we made in our
earlier paper (Gustman and Steinmeier, 2001). For example, in our earlier study, we rounded the




                                                 9
does not calculate spouse and survivor benefits, we calculate spouse and survivor benefits from

the own benefit calculations for each spouse. The ANYPIA program requires information on the

date of birth of each spouse, covered earnings history, and the expected date at which benefits

will be claimed. We provide the required information from the HRS survey and feed it into the

ANYPIA program in batch mode. In the course of projecting benefits, ANYPIA uses the

information from the HRS data to project earnings into the future, and to calculate the Primary

Insurance Amount based on that information.

       Table 2A reports the value of covered income and benefits of different types for

individuals from the Early Boomer cohort of the Health and Retirement Study, those 51 to 56 in

2004. Social Security earnings records are available for about three fourths of the respondents to

the HRS from Early Boomer households. Benefits and taxes are imputed for those in the cohort

without a matched record.11




full retirement age to the nearest year, whereas ANYPIA keeps track of the full retirement age to
the month.
11
  Imputations for those with a missing Social Security records are based on a nearest neighbor
technique using a regression with the following covariates: if U.S. born, job tenure for longest
job held, job tenure for current job, total number of years worked, number of jobs held, number
of divorces, number of widowhoods, number of marriages, length of longest marriage, number of
children, age, gender, education, race, union membership, earnings from current job, industry
and occupation of current job, if self employed, if public employee, if retired, veteran, disabled,
not in labor force, and employment status from 1992 to 2004. For households where one of the
spouses was not interviewed we used an index indicating the respondent's gender, age, race,
earnings, spouse's gender, age, race, earnings, and household assets.
        There are two groups of donors for missing spouses of divorced respondents. For those
who are not currently married, the donors are respondents, whether currently married or not, who
are or had been divorced. In the case of donors who are divorced and not remarried, their
marriage had to last at least 10 years. For missing spouses of widowed (widowered) respondents,
the donors are respondents, whether currently married or not, who are or had been widowed
(widowered).

       Column 1 reports the annual average for indexed earnings (AIME*12). Annual benefit

amounts based on the individual's own work are reported in column 2 assuming retirement at the

individual's expected retirement age.12 The present value of own benefits is reported in column 3.

The remaining columns in Table 2A pertain to spouse and survivor benefits, attributing them in

columns 4 and 5 to the person whose high earnings generated the top-ups for their spouse, and

attributing the top-ups to the person who receives them in columns 7 and 8. The rows in Table

2A first report results for all respondents, then separately for men by marital status, and then for

women by marital status.

       Looking across row 1, annual indexed earnings average $33,048 for each respondent,

with the yearly value of AIME $42,881 for men and $21,676 for women. Roughly speaking,

covered earnings for women are half those for men (the ratio of AIME of women to men is .505).

Moreover, the gap is even wider within married households. Annualized AIME for married men

is $46,433, while for married women it is $21,615, so that married women have 46.6 percent of

the covered earnings of married men. The Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) multiplied by 12,

$16,790, is reported in column 2.

       Column 3 shows the present value of benefits based only on own work, with benefits

beginning at the expected retirement age. Annual benefits are discounted to 2004 using interest

rates from The Trustee's Report.13 Benefits are weighted by survival probabilities using a life


12
   We also did the calculations in these tables assuming all individuals retired at their full
retirement age. Those results are similar to the results reported in Table 2A and 2B. If the
respondent reported an expected retirement age of less than 62, the benefits are calculated using
age 62 as the retirement age. If the respondent reported expected retirement at age 70 or later, or
never expecting to retire, benefits are calculated assuming a retirement age of 70.

table adjusted for variation in life expectancy with income and education. For individuals from

households with at least one member age 51 to 56 in 2004, the present value of benefits based on

own work is $135,358. At $119,865, the present value of benefits women will receive based on

own earnings is 80.6 percent of the present value men will receive based on own earnings

($148,753). With women enjoying four fifths of the benefits from own earnings as men, women

clearly benefit considerably from the redistributional benefit formula since, as noted above,

women had about half the covered earnings of men.

       For married men benefits are worth $157,770. Benefits for divorced, widowered or never

married men fall below those values. Divorced women living alone have benefits based on own

work that are about 8.4 percent more valuable than the benefits earned by married women, and

about one quarter more valuable than the benefits based on own earnings received by widows.

       Columns 4, 5 and 6 credit the spouse who is the primary earner with any spouse and

survivor benefits that will be paid as a result of the primary earner's covered income. Columns 4

and 5 report the values of the top-ups in benefits for qualifying spouses and for widowers or

widows of primary earners, all adjusted by the probability the individual will fall into that state.14

Spouse and survivor benefits paid to the wives and widows of primary male earners,

respectively, are seen in columns 4 and 5, row 2, to be worth $11,472 and $45,066, raising the

total value of benefits earned by men from their work from $148,753, the amount they would be

obligations issuable to the trust funds in each of the 12 months of the year. Historical values are
used until 2010 and projections from the intermediate cost assumptions are used thereafter.

   Since we begin the calculation of survival probabilities at age 21, Table 2A and subsequent
tables include imputations for taxes paid by deceased spouses. Divorced spouses are also
imputed. However, their benefits and taxes paid are not counted in the population totals since
their spouse is presumably included in the divorced or married (for a second time) population of
the other gender. Nevertheless, the benefits of the missing divorced spouse must be imputed to
calculate the spouse or survivor benefits of the divorced person who is included in the sample.

entitled to based on own earnings, to $205,291, or by about 38 percent.15 Total benefits reported

in column 6, amounting to $167,636, include own benefits plus any spouse or survivor benefits

due to own earnings.

       Comparing the values in columns 4 and 5, rows 2 and 7, it can be seen that the spouse

and survivor benefits generated by women's earnings are only a small fraction of the spouse and

survivor benefits due to the earnings of men. The basic reason is that, with most men having

higher earnings than their wives, they are not entitled to any spouse or survivor benefits. On the

other hand, wives with significant commitment to the labor market are entitled to a top-up as

long as their covered earnings fall below those of their husbands. Moreover, with the significant

degree of nonparticipation by wives shown in Table 1, adjustments for the timing of retirement

aside, wives who are not eligible for own benefits are nevertheless eligible for half the benefits

earned by their husband while both are still alive, and to their husband's full benefits should he

die.

       Columns 7, 8 and 9 report each individual's own earnings, plus spouse and survivor

benefits paid to the individual based on their spouse's earnings. Here the spouse that receives the

check from SSA is credited with spouse and survivor benefits even though their husband or wife

accounted for the earnings and paid the taxes that underlie their benefits. In contrast to the results

in columns 4 and 5, here men are credited with very little in the way of spouse and survivor

benefits. Specifically, as seen in row 2, columns 7, 8 and 9, for men the top-up to own benefits

from spouse benefits is $1,015, while the expected value of survivor benefits is $2,672.


15
  Ninety-two out of 1,344 married men have a positive spouse benefit. Average spouse benefit
for this group is $16,522. Out of 1,345 married women, 579 have a positive spouse benefit.
Average spouse benefit for this group is $30,302.




                                                 13
Together, the spouse and survivor benefits received by men are worth only about 2.5 percent of

the present value of the benefits they receive due to their own covered work.

       Table 2B presents indicators of annual earnings and benefits for members of HRS

households with at least one person aged 51 to 56 in 1992. To facilitate a comparison with Table

2A, the dollar amounts in Table 2B are reported in 2004 dollars.

       At $23,626, annual indexed covered earnings for the 1992 cohort are about 71 percent of

the $33,048 value reported for the 2004 cohort. A number of factors account for these

differences. Among them are differences in real earnings and the lower cap on covered earnings

for members of the 1992 cohort (Gustman, Steinmeier and Tabatabai, 2010). Another reason is

the lower earnings of women in the earlier cohort. While earnings of women were about half the

earnings of men in the 2004 cohort, AIME for the 1992 cohort is $35,881 for men and $12,608

for women, so that women from the 1992 cohort earned only about 35 percent of the covered

earnings of men.16 Within married households, the gap in earnings between men and women was

considerably wider for the 1992 cohort, with married women earning only 31 percent of the

covered earnings of married men. This compares to 46.6 percent when comparing the earnings of

married women and married men from the 2004 cohort.




       16
          In 2004, 60.0 percent (weighted) of women living in a household with at least one
person age 51 to 56 were married. In 1992, 70.4 percent of women were married. Most of the
difference is accounted for by divorces. In 2004, 28.3 percent of women in this age range lived in
a single person household and were divorced. The comparable number in 1992 is 16.4 percent.
With fewer women in married households in 2004, the distribution of benefits across households
is more unequal. This change in household structure is another reason for the observed
differences between the two cohorts. We explore the sensitivity of the findings to the change in
weight for divorced households below.

       For the 2004 cohort, we noted that based on own earnings, the present value of benefits

received by women amounts to about four fifths of the present value of benefits men receive

based on own earnings. For the 1992 cohort, the relevant amounts for women and men, again in

2004 dollars, were $74,135 and $132,066. Thus the 1992 cohort of women enjoyed only 56

percent of the benefits from own earnings as men. Again, the major growth in women's earnings

is plainly evident in the data, even between cohorts separated by only 12 years of age.

       In addition, for the 2004 cohort, we found that spouse and survivor benefits paid to the

wives and widows of primary male earners increased the total value of benefits earned by men

from the amount they would be entitled to based on own earnings by about 37 percent

(11,472+43,809)/148,753. For the 1992 cohort, spouse and survivor benefits were more

important, raising the total value of benefits by 46.5 percent (15,201+46,148)/132,066.

       It is also constructive to compare the relative importance of spouse and survivor benefits

to own benefits for women. From Table 2B, using data for the 1992 cohort, columns 7, 8 and 9,

row 7, spouse and survivor benefits accounted for 68.6 percent of the total benefits women

would receive from own earnings (12,468+38,398)/74,135. For the 2004 cohort, spouse and

survivor benefits accounted for 40.2 percent of the total benefits eventually to be received by

women (9,585+38,632)/119,865.

       In contrast to the results for individuals reported in Tables 2A and 2B, Table 3 reports

benefit values for households with at least one member age 51 to 56. The two rows compare

outcomes between the 2004 and 1992 cohorts evaluated in 2004 dollars. Household benefits

count the total of benefits received, from own earnings and from spouse and survivor benefits.

The number of households in the 2004 sample is 2,287. In the 1992 sample there are 7,611 households. Values are calculated

                                                                 18
        As seen in the next to last column of row 1, in 2004 the present value of total benefits in

each household averaged $271,093. Benefits from own earnings amounted to $220,040, with a

top-up for spouse benefits of $10,473, and for survivor benefits of $40,526. Thus benefits from

own earnings account for over four fifths of total benefits (81.2 percent), while as shown in the

last column of the table, the top-up for spouse and survivor benefits accounts for a little under

one fifth (18.8 percent) of total benefits.

        Row 2 reports comparable figures for those ages 51 to 56 in 1992. To facilitate

comparisons, present values are calculated in constant 2004 dollars. In 1992, 23.0 percent of total

benefits were in the form of spouse and survivor benefits ($11,560+ $36,574)/$208,890. Thus

with the increase in women's labor force participation and earnings, the share of total benefits

enjoyed by households from spouse and survivor benefits fell from 23.0 percent in 1992 to 18.8

percent of total benefits between 1992 and 2004.

        Table 4 provides a picture of the trends in benefits and taxes at the individual and family

levels.17 As seen in rows 1 and 2 of column 2, for members of the 1992 HRS cohort, the present

values of benefits and taxes based on own earnings were roughly equal at $106,000 and

$102,000 respectively. By 2004, benefits based on own work amounted to only 81 percent of

taxes paid. This decline in the returns to Social Security taxes reflects the changes in the benefit

structure implemented to help solve the financial problems of the Social Security system, and

shows itself in one form or another in all comparisons between the two cohorts.

  In calculating the tax rate, we include both the employer's and the worker's share of the tax.
Because this study focuses only on retirement benefits, the payroll tax rate we use does not
include the taxes that support disability benefits or Medicare benefits. For example, the relevant
payroll tax rate used in our calculations for the years after 2000 is 10.6 percent.




                                                 19
       It is instructive to consider the changes for men and women separately. Real taxes

increased by 37 percent for men, but reflecting the major changes in their lifetime participation

and resulting earnings, taxes increased by 86 percent for women. Own benefits increased by only

12.6 percent for men (132,066/148,753). On the other hand, for women, own benefits grew by

61.7 percent, reflecting the overwhelming trend in their participation and resulting positive

effects on earnings.

       As found in the data for own benefits and taxes, benefits grew more slowly than taxes at

the household level. The last column in the bottom panel of Table 4 shows that household Social

Security benefits rose by 30 percent between the 2004 and 1992 cohorts, while taxes paid at the

household level rose by 53 percent. (This result is partially affected by the change in the

composition of households between 1992 and 2004, an issue we will return to below.) In 2004 at

the household level, the present value of Social Security benefits, at $271,000, slightly exceeded

the present value of taxes paid, at $260,000, by four percent. In contrast, as seen in the last row

in column 2, in 1992, the initial year of the HRS, total benefits at the household level exceeded

taxes by about 23 percent. As a result of the slower relative growth of benefits, by 2004 the

benefit-tax ratio had fallen by 19 percent from its level in 1992.

IV. Comparing Measures of Distribution and Redistribution Between Cohorts

       A. Distribution and Redistribution of Own Benefits and Taxes

       Table 5 reports a variety of measures of benefit and tax distribution and redistribution for the

individuals in the Early Boomer Cohort in 2004, members of households with at least one person age 51

to 56 in 2004. The population is divided into deciles according to their annualized Average Indexed

Monthly Earnings and outcomes are reported separately by AIME decile. The first two rows report the

present values of taxes and benefits as of 2004. Values are weighted by survival probability, which

includes adjustments for income. The present values of taxes and benefits for the full sample of Early

Boomers is reported in the last column of the table.

       The first set of measures of redistribution involves a simple comparison of benefits and taxes for

members of each AIME decile. Row 3 reports the ratio of the present value of benefits to taxes paid over

the expected lifetime. In this comparison, benefits include only those due to own earnings. Although

there are positive benefits shown for members falling within the decile with the lowest ten percent of

covered earnings, there is no redistribution to individuals falling in that decile in the sense that their

benefits fall below taxes paid. Many falling into the bottom AIME decile have not worked for the

required ten years and thus do not qualify for Social Security benefits. Benefits do exceed taxes for those

falling in the second to fifth AIME deciles, then fall below taxes for those in the remaining deciles. For

those in the second, third and fourth deciles, there is significant redistribution. Own benefits exceed own

taxes by 53 percent, 59 percent and 23 percent respectively. The ratio of the present value of benefits to

taxes for the full cohort is .81 (135/166) as reported in the last column of row 3.

       Row 4 of Table 5 reports a second measure of the extent of redistribution fostered by the benefit

formula. The baseline is taken as the level of benefits that would be received by members of the decile




                                                  22
based on own earnings if their benefits amounted to 81 percent of the taxes they paid, the average ratio

for the Early Boomer Cohort. That is, the baseline asks what benefits would be if the benefit-tax ratio for

members of the decile were the same as the benefit-tax ratio for all members of the Early Boomer

cohort. For example, from column 3, row 4 of the table, members of the third AIME decile receive

benefits that are 84 percent higher than they would be if their benefits amounted to 81 percent of the

taxes they paid. Moving across the columns in row 4, those in the second to seventh deciles of AIME

receive benefits that exceed what they would have received at 81 percent of the taxes they paid. Those in

the last three deciles have had their benefits reduced by the progressive benefit formula. Members of the

decile with highest AIME have their benefits reduced by 32 percent below what they would have been

with an 81 percent replacement rate.

       Another measure of redistribution asks about the share of total benefits paid to members of the

cohort that is redistributed to the members of each decile. Specifically, the figures in row 5 divide the

benefits redistributed to the decile by the total value of benefits paid to members of the Early Boomer

cohort. Altogether, 11.39 percent of total benefits paid (-1.51 -3.50 -6.38) are redistributed from

members of the three highest AIME deciles to the remainder of the population. Those falling in the

lowest decile also receive benefits that fall slightly below the taxes they paid, with the shortfall

amounting to 0.3 percent of total benefits paid to members of the cohort.

                                                                        24
       The bottom panel of Table 5 reports real rates of return by AIME decile computed conditional on

survival. Looking at the last column, row 3 of the bottom panel, the median value for the real rate of

return is 1.8 percentage points. It would appear both from the declining amount of redistribution as

AIME increases across rows 3 and 4 of the top panel of Table 3A, and from the rapid decline in rate of

return with AIME, that there is considerable redistribution fostered by the progressive benefit formula

when evaluated considering own benefits and taxes at the level of the individual.

       Table 6 reports comparable results based on the distribution of own taxes and benefits for

members of the original HRS cohort, those ages 51 to 56 in 1992. Beginning with rows 1 through 3, the

simple comparison of benefits and taxes for members of each AIME decile suggests considerable

redistribution. Benefits substantially exceed taxes for those falling in the third to sixth AIME deciles. A

comparison with results in Table 5 suggests that redistribution extends to members with higher relative

incomes in 1992 than in 2004. For the 2004 cohort, those in the second, third and fourth deciles had own

benefits exceed own taxes by 53 percent, 59 percent and 23 percent respectively. For the 1992 cohort,

benefits exceeded taxes by 71 percent (48/28), 65 percent (79/48), 32 percent (98/74) and 15 percent

(117/102) for members of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth AIME deciles respectively. While these raw

numbers suggest there may have been more redistribution in 1992 than in 2004, the benefit reduction for

members of the top three AIME categories suggests otherwise. Looking at the last column of row 5 in

Tables 5 and 6, in 2004, 11.68 percent of total benefits paid to the cohort was redistributed from

members of the three highest earning deciles. This is a greater amount of redistribution than in 1992,

when 9.53 percent of total benefits paid was redistributed from members of the top AIME deciles.

        Comparing rates of return between the two cohorts, the real median rate of return fell from 2.6

percent in 1992 to 1.8 percent in 2004. Again, roughly speaking, the rate of return to those in the top

three deciles in 2004 is lower than in 1992. Although this might be taken to suggest there is more

redistribution in 2004 than in 1992, it should be remembered that the overall rate of return is lower in

2004.

        To be sure, the data in rows 3 and 4 of the top panel of Tables 5 and 6 do generate a bottom line

regarding the various measures of distribution and redistribution at the level of the individual. The

amount of redistribution of own benefits was somewhat, but not overwhelmingly higher for the 2004

cohort than for the 1992 cohort.

B. Differences in Redistribution Among Households by Cohort

        Table 7 turns to data on benefits and taxes for households, counting within benefits paid not only

benefits based on own work, but also including spouse and survivor benefits. Once households are

considered, the picture changes. Recall our finding in Table 5 that in 2004, 11.7 percent of benefits was

redistributed from individuals falling within the three top deciles of earners to those in lower deciles. In

the top panel of Table 7, which pertains to households in 2004, we find that 7.08 percent (-.42 - 2.17 -

.48) of benefits are redistributed from members of the top three deciles of household units. Remember

here that there are at least two major differences between redistribution among individuals and

households. First, although individual and household earnings are imperfectly but positively related for

men, the relationship is much weaker for women. Second, the data in Table 7 include the top-ups on

own benefits for spouse and survivor benefits.

        When these factors are taken into account, although there is redistribution, it is considerably less

at the level of the household than at the level of the individual. This bottom line from our earlier work




                                                 27
and those of other authors remains. Although the benefit formula is designed to be redistributive, and is

redistributive at the level of the individual, lower earnings of women and the presence of spouse and

survivor benefits at the household level continue to reduce the degree of redistribution fostered by the

Social Security benefit formula.

       On the other hand, there are important changes indicating that the redistribution fostered by the

Social Security benefit formula has increased over time. The differences between the top and bottom

panels of Table 7 show the extent of redistribution at the household level for the cohort of 2004.18 The

amount of redistribution at the household level is higher in 2004 than in 1992. Moreover, the increase in

redistribution through 2004 is greater at the household level than at the level of the individual.




18
   In our earlier study we found five percent of the total benefits accruing to households are
redistributed from households falling in the top three deciles of earners. The results from our
earlier study, which pertained to the full, original HRS cohort in 1992, are not comparable to the
findings for the Early Boomer cohort. There are a number of sources of difference. For one thing,
the 1992 cohort examined in our earlier paper is older (51 to 61 years old) in the base year than
are the samples of 51 to 56 year olds. This means that for the original HRS cohort, benefits were
discounted over fewer years than they are for the cohorts examined in this paper. That is, it takes
fewer years between the date of the survey and the date Social Security benefits are first
collected for a cohort that is 51 to 61 years old than for a cohort that is 51 to 56 years old. Age
differences aside, other factors create differences between the Early Boomer and Original HRS
cohorts. As mentioned previously, the age of receipt of full benefits was lower for the HRS
cohort, who did not face the complete increase of the full retirement age to 66. In addition,
interest rates were much higher during their period of high earnings for the HRS cohort. As a
result, the value of their tax contributions is increased. One might consider a simulation exercise
where those aged 51 to 56 in 1992 are given a birth date that occurs twelve years later. However,
the members of the Original HRS cohort would have lower earnings than the Early Boomers.
Adjusting for growth in earnings would require also adjusting for changes in the occupational
and educational distribution of earnings, a task well outside the scope of this paper.

       These findings are summarized in Figure 1. While the share of total benefits redistributed at the

individual level increased from 9.51 percent in 1992 to 11.68 percent in 2004, the share of total benefits

redistributed among households increased from 4.51 percent in 1992 to 7.08 percent in 2004. Thus the

gap between the shares of benefits redistributed among individuals vs. at the household level remains

roughly the same for these two cohorts. That is, redistribution based on own benefits for the 1992 cohort

(9.53) minus redistribution based on family benefits (4.51) shows a difference in the level of

redistribution between the individual and household levels of 5.02 percentage points. The comparable

figure for the 2004 cohort is 4.60 percentage points (11.68 - 7.08). Redistribution at the household level

remains smaller than the measured redistribution among individuals.

       Figure 2 compares the rates of return by AIME decile at the family level. The data underlying

Figure 2 are reported in Tables 8A and 8B. Looking at the third row, the rate of return for members of

the second AIME decile (column 2) had a median value of 3.3 percentage points in 2004 and 5.1

percentage points in 1992. By the highest decile of earners, the median value has fallen to 0.5 percentage

points in 2004 from 1.5 percentage points in 1992.

       Contrary to the direct measures of benefit redistribution reported above, as seen in Figure 2,

although the rates of return are lower in 2004 than in 1992, they decline at roughly the same rate for

each cohort when proceeding from low to high AIME deciles. Thus a comparison of the distributions of

rates of returns by AIME decile does not suggest a strong difference in benefit redistribution for

members of the 2004 cohort.

V. Robustness of Findings

       This section examines the sensitivity of differences in measured outcomes between the

2004 and 1992 cohorts to two differences between the relevant time periods in which they

worked and claim benefits. First, there has been an increase in the share of households

consisting of one divorced person that may affect measures of distribution and redistribution

(Tamborini, Iams and Whitman, 2009). Second, there are differences in the interest rates applied

to the two cohorts.

Sensitivity to Changes in Family Structure

       Table 9 presents revised measures of redistribution when household weights are adjusted

to hold constant the share of one person, divorced households. Specifically, the share of such

households in 2004 is adjusted to the level in 1992.

       As seen in Table 7, when the household distribution is not adjusted for changes in the

share of single, divorced households, 7.08 percent of total benefits are redistributed. When the

mix of households is standardized to control for the growth of households with a single, divorced

person, the bottom row, bottom column of Table 9 suggests that 7.25 percent of total benefits are

redistributed. Thus the basic findings are not very sensitive to the increase in the number of

divorced households.

Sensitivity to Changes in the Interest Rate

       When computing outcomes for the 2004 and 1992 cohorts, different interest rates were

used. The rates used for the 2004 cohort are those in place twelve years later than the interest

rates used for the 1992 cohort. Interest rates are generally higher for the 1992 cohort. A higher

interest rate reduces the present value of benefits and increases the present value of taxes paid

when yearly values are moved to the base period. Thus if the 1992 cohort enjoyed the lower

interest rates experienced by members of the 2004 cohort, the present value of their benefits as of

1992 would have been higher, and the present value of their taxes lower.

       To estimate the effects of these differences in interest rates, Table 10 reports the present

values calculated for the 2004 cohort (column 1) and the 1992 cohort (column 3) using the

interest rates that actually applied to those cohorts. Column 2 calculates comparable values for

the 1992 cohort using the interest rates that applied to the 2004 cohort. All values are taken to the

base year, either 1992 or 2004 as appropriate, and are converted to 2004 dollars.

       The rows of Table 10 then report the present value of taxes, the present value of benefits,

and the share of total benefits redistributed among deciles. The first panel is for individuals based

on own earnings. The second is for households from each cohort. Household benefits are the sum

of own benefits of each spouse in married households and any spouse and survivor benefits that

would accrue to the low earning spouse.

       The last column of Table 10 indicates the share of the difference in the relevant value

between the 1992 and 2004 cohort that is due to the interest rate. For example, take the present

value of benefits to be received by households. The measured difference in benefits is $271,000

in 2004 (from column 1) minus $209,000 in 1992 (from column 3). The part of the difference




                                                 35
from $209,000 to $226,000 (the value in column 2 minus the value in column 3) is due to the

lower interest rate facing the 2004 cohort. So as reported in column 4, 27 percent of the

difference in benefits is due to the difference in interest rates [(226-209)/(271 - 209)].

       In the case of taxes, the higher interest rate applicable when summing up the 1992

cohort's lifetime taxes increased the base value of the tax, and caused the difference in the taxes

paid by the 2004 and 1992 cohorts to be understated by just over a quarter.

       These findings mean that the raw differences in present value overstate the fall in the

benefit/tax ratio for Social Security between 1992 and 2004. Nevertheless, there has been a

substantial decline in the value of benefits relative to taxes over the period, as indicated by the

fall in the rates of return, which are not subject to the effects of changing market interest rates.

Remember that whatever the implications for differences between the cohorts in benefits and

taxes, the level of benefits and taxes paid by the 2004 cohort still differ in present value by only

4 percent, as shown in Table 4.

       More importantly, from the perspective of this paper, the differences in redistribution

measured in this paper are hardly affected by the difference in the interest rate. As seen in the

last column, last row of Table 10, the measured difference in redistribution affecting each cohort

is changed by only 14 percent when the interest rates are standardized.

       These exercises suggest our findings are not sensitive either to the differences in the

structure of families between the cohorts, or to differences in the interest rates that prevailed

between the two cohorts.

VI. Conclusions

       This paper has measured the difference in redistribution of benefits fostered by the Social

Security system between cohorts of individuals and households from the Health and Retirement

Study. In summarizing our findings, a number of results may be highlighted. Comparing the

1992 and 2004 cohorts, benefits received by members of the highest AIME deciles are reduced

by a greater proportional amount in 2004 than they were in 1992. The fraction of total Social

Security benefits redistributed from high to low earning individuals increased from 9.5 percent

for the 1992 cohort to 11.7 percent for the 2004 cohort. At the household level, the fraction of

benefits redistributed from high to low earning households increased from 4.5 percent to 7.1

percent. Nevertheless, a 4.6 percentage point gap remains between the share of benefits

redistributed at the individual and household levels. In sum, the 2004 Social Security system, by

some measures, was somewhat more effective in redistributing benefits to low AIME

households, but was still substantially less effective in redistributing benefits among households

arrayed according to lifetime covered earnings than it was in redistributing benefits among

individuals according to own earnings.

       Looking to the future, it will not be long until data for the 2010 HRS households become

available. One can expect an update of this study to indicate progress in the same direction as

measured here. Women from the new, younger HRS cohort will have shown even greater

attachment to the labor market. Nevertheless, the Social Security system is likely to remain less

effective in redistributing benefits among families with different income than is suggested by the

basic benefit formula.




                                                38
       From a policy perspective, this study provides basic facts upon which to base any policy

changes meant to revise the redistributive effects of the OASI system. The degree of

redistribution remains quite modest at the household level. Perhaps the lack of effective

redistribution has increased the popularity of the program as a source of income in retirement.

That is an issue for policy makers to wrestle with. They must decide whether they are happy with

the rather modest level of redistribution of Social Security benefits at the household level, or

whether they would prefer a system that is more, or less, redistributive.
