                                         ABSTRACT

We document new facts about risk in male wages and earnings, household earnings, and pre- and
post-tax income in the Netherlands and the United States. We find that, in both countries, earnings
display important deviations from the typical assumptions of linearity and normality. Individual-
level male wage and earnings risk is relatively high at the beginning and end of the working life,
and for those in the lower and upper parts of the income distribution. Hours are the main driver of
the negative skewness and, to a lesser extent, the high kurtosis of earnings changes. Even though
we find no evidence of added-worker effects, the presence of spousal earnings reduces the
variability of household income compared to that of male earnings. In the Netherlands,
government transfers are a major source of insurance, substantially reducing the standard
deviation, negative skewness, and kurtosis of income changes. In the U.S. the role of family
insurance is much larger than in the Netherlands. Family and government insurance reduce, but do
not eliminate nonlinearities in household disposable income by age and previous earnings in either
country.

1     Introduction
Wage risk affects key economic decisions, including consumption, saving, and labor sup-
ply, and is an important determinant of household’s welfare. Households can self-insure
against wage shocks: single people can adjust their own labor supply and savings and
couples can adjust the labor supply of both partners, in addition to savings. Further-
more, governments can supplement or partly replace the need for self-insurance through
progressive taxes and transfers.
    This paper studies the distribution of wage shocks and the role of insurance mecha-
nisms against them in the Netherlands and the Unites States. We start by documenting
the distribution of wage shocks at the individual level by analyzing distributional mea-
sures of wage changes, including the standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and persis-
tence, by age and previous earnings. To understand the role of individual-level labor
supply and fluctuations in hours, we compare the distribution of individual wage shocks
with that of individual-level earnings. To analyze the role of family insurance through
the labor supply of both partners, we compare the distributions of individual-level and
household-level earnings. To examine the role of government insurance, we compare the
distribution of household income, pre- and post-taxes, and transfers, by age group and
previous earnings.
    We use administrative data on income, taxes, and government transfers on individuals
and households for the Netherlands (IPO) to get precise estimates of the dynamics of
wage shocks and the role of private and public insurance mechanism to mitigate these
shocks. We compare the results with estimates for the U.S. Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID), and find that the distribution of wage and earnings shocks display
rich dynamics and, particularly, depend on age and previous earnings in both countries,
as was previously documented for earnings in the U.S. (Guvenen, Karahan, Ozkan and
Song, 2015, and Arellano, Blundell and Bonhomme, 2017).
    Our contribution to the literature is threefold. First, whereas most previous studies
investigated shocks to individual earnings, we distinguish between changes in wages and
changes in hours worked. As the two may have different dynamics, this provides us
with a better understanding of the nature of income risk. Using high-quality Dutch
administrative data on hours worked derived from payroll administration, we find that
hours are the main driver of the variability at the bottom of the earnings distribution, the

                                             2
negative skewness and, to a lesser extent, the high kurtosis of earnings. This differs from
what we find in Dutch household survey data (DNB Household Survey) or the PSID, and
suggests that accurate measurement of earnings and hours worked is crucial to properly
account for wage dynamics.
       Second, we investigate the degree of insurance provided by spousal labor supply and
by the tax and transfer system. We find that the family is a relevant source of insurance in
the Netherlands, but most of this insurance comes from income pooling rather than labor
supply reactions of secondary earners or added worker effects. Taxes and, particularly,
the transfer system play an even larger role in reducing income risk.
       Third, we compare two countries: the Netherlands and the U.S. This is an interesting
comparison because these two countries differ substantially in the size of their welfare
state and the progressiveness of their tax system.1 We find that family insurance is
more relevant in the U.S. than in the Netherlands, whilst in the latter the government is
responsible for the bulk of the reduction in income risk. This also holds if we compare
survey data across both countries. Finally, our analysis provides data that rich models of
risks and insurance should match to be consistent with the key features of the micro-data
that we document.
       Our paper contributes to a growing literature on higher-order moments of income
shocks. Guvenen et al. (2015) investigate higher order earnings risk using US Social
Security administrative data. They find substantial nonlinearities and non-normalities,
but they can only study gross individual earnings process, so they cannot separate hours
and wages or study additional insurance mechanisms. Hoffman and Malacrino (2019)
use Italian administrative data to decompose earnings growth in changes in employment
time and changes in weekly earnings. Like us, they find that changes in employment
time are the main driver of earnings growth. Halvorsen, Holter, Ozkan and Storesletten
(2019) analyze Norwegian data and attribute changes in earnings mostly to changes in
wages. These international differences suggest that country-specific institutional features
are important to determine whether wages or hours are the most important margin of
   1
    Although eligibility requirements have become more restrictive over the past two decades, the Dutch
welfare system is one of the most comprehensive in Europe; see Kalwij, Kapteyn and de Vos (2018)
for a detailed and up-to-date description of social security reforms in the Netherlands. The OECD
Social Expenditure Database 2016 shows that public social expenditure on family support, disability,
unemployment and active labor market policies as a percentage of GDP is twice as high in the Netherlands
compared with the U.S.



                                                   3
adjustment. Similarly to our results, Halvorsen et al. (2019) find that the benefit system
is particularly important to insure workers against earnings fluctuations. Pruitt and
Turner (2018), use administrative data from the U.S. and find that the probability of
the secondary earner entering employment rises when the primary earner experiences
earnings losses.
    There is mounting interest in the higher-order moments of income shocks. They are
key input for models on asset prices (Mankiw, 1986; Constantinides and Ghosh, 2017;
Schmidt, 2016), monetary policy (Kaplan, Moll and Violante, 2018), and optimal social
insurance and taxation (Golosov, Troshkin and Tsyvinski, 2016). Taking into account
higher-order moments also influence estimates on the welfare costs of earnings fluctuations
(De Nardi, Fella and Paz-Pardo (2019) find that they are smaller when taking into account
higher-order moments).
    These rich features derive from important economic mechanisms (Postel-Vinay and
Turon (2010) and Graber and Lise (2015)). For instance, a job ladder model can explain
negative skewness and some kurtosis because most people stay on the job and experience
small wage raises, while a small number of people lose their job and face large wage and
earnings drops. In addition, the persistence of these wage changes might depend on one’s
age (a young worker is more likely to experiment and switch jobs to figure out what he
or she is best at) while an old worker might switch to a part-time or less demanding job.
    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our data and
approach, Sections 3 and 4 present the results and Section 5 concludes.



2     Data and empirical approach
This section provides an overview of the data we employ, the sample selection criteria,
the variables used in our empirical analysis, and our empirical approach.


2.1    The data

The Dutch data We use two data sets for our main analysis: (1) administrative tax
records from the Dutch Income Panel Study (IPO) which contain detailed information of
various income sources and (2) administrative data on hours worked from the Dutch pay-
roll administrations (DPA). The IPO data set contains detailed information on, amongst


                                            4
others, personal income, household income, demographics, and labor market status for
a representative 1% population sample (about 95,000 individuals) and their household
members. While the data is available since 1989, we use it starting in 2001, due to a
change in the income definition in that year, and until 2014.
   The IPO data set has several important advantages over survey data. First, the data
is often collected or checked by a third party. For instance, income measures are derived
from tax records complemented with information provided by banks and other financial
institutions. In addition, Statistics Netherlands performs several checks on the data to
guarantee their quality. This drastically reduces or even eliminates measurement error
and errors due to non-reporting. Second, individuals are in the panel from the year of
birth (for immigrants, the year of arrival) and are followed for as long as they are residing
in the Netherlands (as of December 31 of the sample year). Thus, attrition only occurs as a
result of migration or death. Third and very importantly, unlike other administrative data
sets such as the US Social Security Administration’s, the IPO data set tracks households
rather than only individuals and contains a detailed decomposition of labor and asset
income, taxes and social insurance premia paid, as well as government transfers (broken
down into unemployment insurance, disability insurance, social assistance, and pensions)
received for all household members. This feature crucially allows us to investigate the
role of both the family and government insurance in reducing income fluctuations.
   The DPA payroll data provides very rich information on the number of days and hours
worked. It is obtained directly from employers. Dutch legislation mandates that all em-
ployers maintain up-to-date payroll records and report them to the relevant government
agencies on a monthly basis. The payroll records include information on (a) the start and
end date of the employment spell, (b) earnings, (c) the number of regular hours and (d)
the number of overtime hours that each employee has worked in a given month. These
data are not only salient for processing and paying salaries, but also for the computation
of holiday entitlement, social insurance benefit payments, and pensions (see Appendix A
for an extensive documentation on this).
   From 2006 onwards, we have access to the complete payroll records for each employee,
and thus have as accurate information on hours as possible. For the period before 2006,
Statistics Netherlands provides researchers with a summary measure of hours that has
two limitations: (a) it is normalized by “typical” working hours in a sector and (b) it


                                             5
is capped at fulltime hours. We address the first limitation of the pre-2006 data by
computing the typical workweek in each sector in the post-2006 data and using it to re-
normalize the data for each sector in the pre-2006 data. Concerning the cap at full-time
hours, it constrains the measurement of overtime hours for full-time workers, but not for
part-time workers, as long as the total number of hours worked does not exceed full time
hours.2


The U.S. data For the U.S., we use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID).3 This data set began in 1968 with a representative sample of 18,000 individuals
living in 5,000 households. We use it for the period 1968 to 1992. We exclude the years
1993-1997, because of a major redesign of the survey, and those after 1997 because the
PSID became bi-yearly after that date. To confirm that our results are not driven by
the different sample periods between the U.S. and the Netherlands (see Heathcote, Perri
and Violante, 2010 for a discussion of changes in the distribution of wages and earnings
in the U.S. across this period of time), in Appendix D.1 we compare our statistics of
interest for the period after 1997 for two-years income changes in both countries. This
robustness check shows that the cross-country differences that we document are driven
by country-specific differences rather than different sample periods.


2.2       Empirical approach

To investigate the role of various insurance mechanisms, we conduct our analysis on male
wages and earnings, household earnings, and household after-tax (disposable) income.
Comparing individual wages and earnings is informative about self-insurance through la-
bor supply, while comparing individual- and household-level earnings conveys information
about family insurance through the labor supply of the spouse. Finally, comparing house-
hold pre- and post-tax income sheds light on the role of government-provided insurance
through transfers and progressive taxation.
   To capture, in line with recent contributions (Guvenen et al., 2015; Arellano et al.,
2017; De Nardi et al., 2019), richer patterns of risks than typically assumed in the previous
   2
     To evaluate the effects of missing overtime hours for full-time workers before 2006, Appendix B
compares our results for our complete sample period with those we obtain using only the post-2006
sample period. The results are extremely close.
   3
     Appendix C documents our findings using survey data for the Netherlands.



                                                 6
literature, we follow Guvenen et al., 2015 and report key moments of the distribution of
the (one-year) changes of the log of each variable of interest by age group and percentile
of the distribution of male earnings in the previous year.4
       To be consistent with the related literature on rich earnings risk, we follow similar
sample selection, variable definition, purging of age and time effects, and moment compu-
tation. In terms of sample selection, for each country we select working-age male earners
with some labor market attachment and who are not self-employed. More specifically,
for an individual-year observation to be in our sample, the individual (a) must be be-
tween 25 and 60 years old, (b) have annual labor earnings above a minimal threshold
(2,200 euro in 2014 prices, which is around 4% of median earnings), and (c) not receive
self-employment income as a main income source. Appendix D.6 reports results when we
do not impose this minimal earnings threshold and we compute arc-percentage changes
instead of changes in logs. The results show that government insurance is stronger when
we consider zeros.
       In terms of variables definition, we define individual gross earnings as the total re-
muneration received by an employee in a given year, which includes his contributions to
social security.5 We compute household gross earnings by aggregating individual earnings
of all household members.6 By adding income from savings, we obtain household pre-
tax income. Finally, household after-tax income equals household pre-tax income minus
income taxes (including allowances, such as healthcare, rent, child and child care, study
costs, and alimony), plus transfers. Transfers are the sum of unemployment benefits,
disability benefits, social assistance, and pension benefits. Finally, wages are computed
by dividing yearly labor earnings by hours worked within the year.
       To purge age and time effects from yearly changes and from the distribution of previous
earnings, we take residuals from a regression on a (quadratic) polynomial in age and time
dummies.
       The moments that we consider include second and higher-order moments and quantile-
based measures.7 Our quantile-based measures of skewness and kurtosis are Kelley’s
   4
     Appendix D.2 also reports those conditioning on earnings over the past 5 rears rather than past year.
   5
     In the Netherlands, employee’s contributions to social security include a contribution for health
insurance and a premium for unemployment, disability, and pension benefits.
   6
     We equivalize all of our earnings measures using the equivalence scales provided by Statistics Nether-
lands for the Dutch data and the OECD equivalence scales for the U.S. data. The two equivalence scales
are very similar to each other.

     Appendix E reports formal definitions of standardized moments and of the moments that we omit

                                              P75 − P25

    Kelley skewness is positive (right skewness) if the probability mass between the median
and the top decile exceeds the probability mass between the median and the bottom
decile, while Crow-Siddiqui kurtosis, if large, denotes heavy tails, that is P97.5 − P2.5 is
large relative to the probability mass that is concentrated between P75 and P25 . For a
normal distribution, Kelley skewness equals zero and Crow-Siddiqui kurtosis equals 2.91.
    Quantile-based measures have the advantage of being both (i) easier to interpret and
(ii) more robust to outliers than centered moment. We also report standardized third
and fourth centered moments whenever they convey a qualitatively different picture than
their quantile-based counterparts.



3       Results: Netherlands
In this section, we first study the properties of male earnings changes and the contribution
of hours and wages to their dynamics. We then contrast the properties of male earnings,
household earnings, and after-tax household income and discuss their implications for
family and government insurance.


3.1     Male earnings, wages, and hours

3.1.1    Second moments

Figure 1 reports the standard deviation of male earnings (left), wage (middle), and hour
(right) changes by percentile of previous earnings for various age groups. It reveals
important patterns by age and previous earnings.
    Focusing on age, the dispersion of earnings changes is particularly high for those in
the bottom third of the previous earnings distribution in the youngest age group (25-34)
and for those in the upper two thirds of the previous earnings distribution in the oldest
from the main text.

age group (55-59). This pattern by age is mostly driven by differences in the dispersion
of hour, rather than wage, changes. Two institutional features of the Dutch labor market
are likely important in generating these findings. First, flexible contracts are common
among young workers and might generate more variability in their hours and earnings.
Second, older workers are more likely to become eligible for partial disability benefits,
which are reflected in the data as a reduction in hours whilst keeping the same wage.
               The standard deviation by previous earnings displays a pronounced U-shaped pattern.
It is more than twice as large for workers in the bottom decile of previous earnings
than for workers around the median. Comparing it to the dispersion of wage and hours
changes suggests that earnings fluctuations for lower earners are mostly accounted for
by fluctuations in hours, be they temporary unemployment, demand-induced reductions
in working time, or labor supply decisions. Workers with previous earnings above the
90th percentile also have higher dispersion of earnings changes than workers around the
median, though substantially less than workers in the bottom decile. In the latter case,
however, the pattern appears mostly due to a higher dispersion of wages, rather than
hours, which likely reflects variable or performance-related components of earnings such
as bonuses.
               Simply comparing the variances of earnings, wages, and hours changes does not ac-
count for the potential correlation between wage and hours changes. Figure 2 decomposes
the variance of earnings changes, across the distribution of previous earnings, into the
contribution of the respective variances and their covariance. It confirms that the rel-
atively higher dispersion of earnings changes for the bottom and top decile are mostly
accounted by the higher relative variance of, respectively, hours and wage changes.
               The covariance between wage and hour changes is negative throughout most of the

distribution; it lies between -0.02 and 0 for all but the bottom two deciles. A negative
covariance can be due to either measurement error in hours or to a strong income effect
in labor supply (inter-temporal substitution elasticity smaller than one) that induces
workers to increase hours in response to imperfectly insured falls in wages. Our finding
that this covariance is more negative at low levels of previous earnings implies that
measurement error would need to have a more elaborate form than classical in order to
explain this feature of the data.8 Additionally, the fact that wages (which are constructed
as earnings divided by hours) are less variable than both of the elements that are used to
compute them suggests that it is unlikely that the negative covariance is a byproduct of
significant measurement error in hours. In contrast, our observations are consistent with
plausible economic forces. Namely, workers previously experiencing lower earnings are
less able to self-insure through borrowing, more likely to need to finance a minimum level
of consumption, and more likely to be on hourly contracts and thus are willing and able
to increase hours to stabilize earnings in response to falls in wages. These considerations,
   8
     We cannot rule out that low income workers, whose hours are more volatile, are particularly more
affected by measurement error, which could increase the variance of their wage changes and make the
covariance more negative. However, under the extreme assumption that the variance of true wage changes
is zero, and as long as measurement error is uncorrelated with true hours and wage changes, the ratio
between the variance of wage changes and hours changes (0.38 for the lowest decile) provides an upper
bound to the contribution of measurement error to the observed variance of hours changes. In that
scenario, it would still be the case that hours are much more volatile at the lowest decile than at the
next.

together with the high reliability of our hour data (see Appendix A) indicate that this
negative correlation between hours and wage changes in the Netherlands is consistent
with economic mechanisms linked to a negative income effect, rather than merely being
the outcome of measurement error.9
       A complementary way of understanding the drivers of earnings changes is to de-
compose them into the contribution of wage and hours changes. Figure 3 reports this
decomposition by plotting the (log) change in wage and hours on the vertical axis against
the associated change in earnings on the horizontal axis. Each dot on a line represents a
decile of earnings changes. The three panels refer to workers at three different points in
the distribution of earnings levels in the previous year. Specifically, they refer to workers
in the first, fifth and top deciles. For instance, the leftmost data point in the left panel of
Figure 3 shows that workers in the lowest decile of previous earnings who experience the
worst earnings change suffer on average an 80% decrease in their earnings (read off the
horizontal axis). Of these, almost 70 percentage points are accounted for by a reduction
in hours, and 10 percentage points are due to a reduction in wages (both read off the
vertical axis). For these workers with low previous earnings, changes in hours are the
major driver of all changes in earnings, independently of the size of the earnings change.
The opposite is true for workers in the ninth decile of previous earnings (right panel) for
which wages account for the larger share of all earnings changes. These are likely mainly
full-time workers who remain in full-time employment and whose hours, therefore, vary
much less. For workers at the median of the previous earnings distribution (middle panel),
large negative earnings shocks are associated more with drops in hours (e.g., temporary
unemployment) whilst positive earnings shocks are driven by changes in wages.
       Finally, the right- and left-hand side panels of Figure 4 report the persistence, mea-
sured by the first-order autoregressive coefficient, of earnings and wage changes, respec-
tively. Similarly to what Karahan and Ozkan, 2013; De Nardi et al., 2019 document
for the U.S., in the Netherlands the persistence of earnings is lowest for the young and
increases until about age 40 when it stabilizes. The same is true for wages, though their
   9
    Averaging across the distribution of previous earnings the covariance between wages and hours is
-0.02 which is in line with, but smaller in absolute value, than -0.04 (we compute such a value from
the approximate correlation (-0.3) and variances of wage (0.15) and hour (0.1) changes taken from
their Figure 2) reported by Heathcote, Storesletten and Violante (2014) for the U.S. PSID. They argue,
quantitatively, that such a number is consistent with a model with endogenous labor supply in which
the income effect is large and measurement error in hours is small.

persistence is even lower until age 30, but then rises faster between 30 and 40.
                    In sum, male workers experience significant earnings variability, especially at lower
levels of earnings and during the earliest and latest phases of the working life. This
variability displays rich dynamics which, at low earnings levels, are mainly driven by the
behavior of hours rather than wages.


3.1.2                          Higher order moments

Turning to higher order moments, the first and second row of panels in Figure 5 study
the asymmetry of the distribution of earnings, wages, and hours changes by reporting
two measures of skewness: Kelley skewness (which is less sensitive to outliers) and the
third standardized moment. For earnings, Kelley skewness is zero or positive for most age
groups and for most of the distribution of previous earnings, with the noticeable exception
of workers in the 55-59 age bracket, for whom it is significantly negative. Turning to
wages and hours reveals that negative skewness is driven by the behavior of hours. Hours
changes are more negatively skewed, particularly for the 55-59 age group, while wage

changes are mostly positively skewed.
       While Kelley skewness does not take into account asymmetries in the top versus bot-
tom 10 percent of the distribution, the third standardized moment, reported in the middle
row of Figure 5, provides a measure of asymmetry over the whole distribution. According
to that metric, earnings changes display large and negative skewness.10 Comparing the
skewness of earnings changes to that of wages and hours reveals that it is again hours,
rather than wages that drive the negative skewness of earnings. The skewness of wage
changes is mostly non-negative with the exception of workers in the top decile of previous
earnings.
       Finally, the last row of panels reports the Crow-Siddiqui kurtosis.11 The kurtosis of
earnings changes is highest towards the bottom of the distribution of previous earnings (up
to the 20th percentile). The large kurtosis that we observe suggests that earnings shocks
are very infrequent but that, when they happen, they tend to be of a large magnitude.
This is particularly true for older workers, for whom employment protection is strongest
in the Netherlands. Perhaps not surprisingly, kurtosis is even higher for hours than for
earnings, suggesting that hour fluctuations are infrequent, but when they do happen they
are relatively large (note the different scale in the graph).
       As for the variance, comparing higher-order moments of earnings, wage and hours
changes does not account for the co-movement between wage and hours. To address this,
Figure 6 decomposes the skewness and kurtosis of earnings changes, as measured by the
third and fourth standardized moments, into the contribution of the corresponding mo-
ments of wage and hours changes and their interaction. As far as skewness is concerned,
the left panel in Figure 6 reveals that the negative skewness in earnings changes is mostly
driven by changes in hours rather than in wages, while the contribution of the (negative)
co-skewness is limited12 . Thus, the negative earnings skewness likely reflects persistent
non-employment spells or reductions in the numbers of hours worked per week. This is
  10
     This skewness, as measured by the third moment rather than by Kelley measure, is substantially
more negative than found in Guvenen et al. (2015) for the US or Halvorsen et al. (2019) for Norway.
This feature of the data is due to the fact that we plot the skewness of earnings over the distribution of
earnings in the previous year, while these studies plot it over a measure of recent earnings that represents
an average over the previous 5 years. As a result, our sample selection is less stringent (we only require
earnings in t and t−1 to be above the minimum earnings level, and the ordering of percentiles is different).
In Appendix D.2 we show that, using earnings over the last 5 years, skewness is much closer to the values
found in those studies.
  11
     For completeness, Appendix E reports the centered Pearson’s measure of kurtosis, which we do not
include amongst these results for brevity.
  12
     Appendix E.1 defines this decomposition, including co-skewness and co-kurtosis.

consistent with the evidence presented in Hoffman and Malacrino (2019) for Italy,13 but
at odds with the findings of Halvorsen et al. (2019) for Norway, where both the skewness
of wage changes and co-skewness play a substantial role in explaining the negative skew-
ness of earnings growth. These international differences suggest that the institutional
framework that governs the labor market is crucial to determine the sources of earnings
fluctuations and whether adjustment occurs at the hour or wage margin.
       Finally, the kurtosis of earnings changes, reported on the right-hand-side panel of Fig-
ure 6, is driven by both hours and wages, although the contribution of hours is somewhat
higher for individuals below the 90th percentile of previous earnings. Most individuals
do not experience changes in either between one year and the next and this leads mainly
to relatively small changes in earnings. As equation (6) in Appendix E.1 makes clear, the
large negative co-kurtosis reflects that very large absolute changes in hours (wages) are
associated with changes in wages (hours) of the opposite sign.
       Taken together, these moments provide strong evidence in favor of age-variation, non-
linearity, and non-normality of earnings changes and suggest that hours, more than wages,
play an important role in the Netherlands.
  13
    Hoffman and Malacrino (2019), as well as Busch, Domeij, Guvenen and Madera (2018) for Germany,
are mainly concerned with the cyclicality of skewness. Yet, table A.3 in Hoffman and Malacrino (2019)
reports the decomposition of the skewness of earnings changes in every year in their sample.

3.1.3           Separating days worked and hours per day

Our richer data starting 2006 (see Appendix A for details) allows us to further decom-
pose yearly working hours between the number of days worked per year and the average
number of hours per day worked. This decomposition (Figure 7) illustrates that most
of the fluctuations are driven by the number of days worked, rather than changes in
average hours per day. Thus, in the Netherlands, partial spells of unemployment or non-
employment are the key drivers of the non-linear and non-normal patterns that we study.
Changes in hours worked per day are less quantitatively relevant, with the only exception
of lower-income workers (see left panel), for whom hour fluctuations within or across jobs
are more frequent.

3.2            Household insurance

Income pooling within households is a potential source of insurance against individual
earnings fluctuations. There are two main reasons why a second earner can reduce the
impact on household earnings of shocks to male earnings. The first is due to income
pooling: a second earner being present implies that a share of household earnings is not
affected by a change in male earnings. The second, often called the added worker effect,
implies that the second earner might react to positive or negative shocks to her partner’s
earnings by changing participation or the number of hours worked.
       We investigate the effects of insurance within the household, by comparing male versus

                                                                         16
household earnings. The left and central panels in Figure 8 report moments for male and
household earnings respectively.14 The top row of the figure shows that persistence is
very similar for male and household earnings. Turning to the second row we can see that,
among older workers, the standard deviation is a bit lower for household earnings than
for male earnings and that, with the exception of younger households, Kelley skewness
(third panel) is less negative for changes in household than male earnings. Interestingly,
for younger workers in the top two thirds of the earnings distribution we find higher
standard deviations and more negative Kelley skewness for household earnings compared
with male earnings, which could be possibly be due to female spouses reducing working
hours after the birth of a child.
       The bottom two panels of Figure 8 show that the secondary earner plays an important
role in reducing the impact on household earnings of large shocks to male earnings.
Household earnings display substantially less negative skewness (as measured by the
third standardized moment) and lower kurtosis than male earnings. This means that, at
the household level, changes in earnings are relatively more frequent but smaller, while
at the individual level changes in earnings are more infrequent but, when they happen,
they are large. Thus, in the Netherlands the family plays a significant role in reducing
the risks that households face.
       Figure 9 disentangles the role of income pooling and added worker effects in generating
within-household insurance. It reports the average change in women’s hours between
years t and t+2, for those who were working in both years, as a response to changes in male
earnings between t and t + 1. Because women are typically the secondary earner, if there
were an added worker effect, the number of hours worked by the woman in the household
would respond to earnings shocks suffered by the man. By looking at two-year windows we
can capture changes in female labor supply which are not exactly contemporaneous to the
man’s earnings shock. We do not find any association between changes in male earnings
and changes in women’s hours worked, indicating that it is mostly income pooling which
explains the reduction in earnings risk at the household level that we have documented
in the previous set of graphs. This is in line with findings for Norway (Halvorsen et al.
(2019)), and may be due to correlated labour market opportunities of spouses. The only
  14
    The sample pools single males and those who are cohabiting or married. Appendix D.4 shows that
results are very similar if we just consider those who live in couples, who form the majority of our sample.
Household earnings include adult children labor income whenever they are present in the household.

noticeable, but small, labor supply reaction in the Netherlands is for women who reduce
hours worked in response to large positive changes in male earnings, if the husband is
in the top decile of the distribution of previous earnings (right panel). In Appendix D.5
we show that the same conclusions are true for contemporaneous hours changes of the
spouse and her labor market participation decision.


3.3                             Insurance from taxes and transfers

We also investigate the role of government insurance in reducing labor income risk. To this
effect the central and right panels in Figure 8 report corresponding moments respectively
for household earnings before taxes and benefits and disposable, after taxes and benefits,
income.15
                  The comparison of the rightmost two columns in Figure 8 shows that taxes and trans-
fers make a very large difference for the measures of risk that we focus on, especially
at the lower end of the income distribution and for households in the oldest age group.
Concerning disposable income, the standard deviations (second row of the figure) are
lower and both measures of skewness (third and fourth row) become less negative rela-
tive to pre-tax household earnings. For instance, the standard deviation at the lowest
percentiles of previous earnings declines from about 0.59 before taxes and transfers to a
little over 0.37 after taxes and transfers. The reduction in the standard deviations and
      15
    Household disposable income also contains net income from savings. This consists of the following
components: interests from saving accounts and bonds, dividends, the rental value of the residential
property, income from other real estate, income from other assets, and mortgage interest payments. It
does not include capital gains from stocks or other financial assets. In Appendix D.3 we show that this
capital income makes little difference for the dynamics of household income.

both measures of skewness is especially apparent for workers in the oldest age group. For
them, skewness becomes almost zero. The Crow-Siddiqui kurtosis (fourth row) at the
household level falls from about 8 before taxes and transfers (it peaked at about 17 for
wages and male earnings) to well below 7 after taxes and transfers.
                   Figure 10 explores further the roles of household and government insurance by showing
the pass-through of changes in male earnings to before- and after-tax household income.
It shows that taxes and transfers offset positive and negative changes in male earnings,
especially for households at the bottom of the distribution of previous earnings. For
example, households in the first decile of previous earnings with a negative earnings shock
of 80% experience on average a 50% drop in pre-tax household income, but only a 10%
drop in disposable household income. Households in the fifth and ninth decile of previous
male earnings experience smaller changes in male earnings (the dots are closer to zero).
Households in the 9th decile of previous male earnings receive, as expected, less insurance
from progressive taxation and transfers in case of a negative shock in male earnings (the
difference between the slopes of the blue and the red lines is smaller). Instead, positive
shocks in male earnings are also more cushioned by the government for households in the
first decile of previous male earnings (most likely reflecting benefit withdrawal), compared
with households in the fifth and ninth decile of previous male earnings.
                   Given that government insurance is especially prevalent in the Netherlands and es-
pecially so at older ages, Figure 11 further breaks down the role of various government
programs for our 55-59 age group by sequentially adding specific transfer programs and
taxes. The graphs show that disability insurance greatly reduces the standard deviation
of household earnings changes below the 20th percentile of previous earnings, while un-

employment insurance generates a significant reduction even at higher levels of previous
earnings. It also shows that, for this age group, (early) retirement transfers, associated
with early access to occupational pensions, play a much larger role in reducing varia-
tion in household income than progressive taxes. The right-hand-side graph of Figure 11
shows that negative skewness is largely offset by taxes and transfers.
   Our analysis makes it clear that the government and private pensions provide a lot
of insurance in the Netherlands. Progressive taxation reduces earnings variability and
the benefit system (unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and welfare) and early
access to occupational pensions reduce income variability. In particular for older workers
and for the bottom of the distribution of previous earnings, transfers effectively eliminate
large negative shocks, such that negative skewness disappears and the kurtosis is reduced.
The breakdown of transfer programs or taxes suggest that progressive taxation plays less
of a role in reducing earnings variability.

4       Results: Netherlands versus U.S.
While Section 3 focuses on risks and insurance in the Netherlands, this section compares
risks and insurance in the Netherlands and the U.S. Figure 12 reports our summary
statistics for the Netherlands (left) and the U.S. (right), pooling across all age groups
for clarity. A first noticeable feature is that the standard deviations of wages, hours,
earnings, household income and disposable income are, respectively, much larger in the
U.S. than in the Netherlands.
      Looking more into the top panel and comparing male wages to earnings also reveals
that moments for earnings and wages are substantially closer to each other in the U.S. data
than in the Dutch data. To better understand this phenomenon, Figure 13 decomposes
the relative contributions of hours and wages to second and higher moments of earnings
changes in the U.S. Its left panel shows that, in the U.S., the variance of wages is much
closer to that of hours (compare with Figures 2 and 6), suggesting that wage adjustments
are more frequent in the U.S. than in the Netherlands. Its center and left panel highlight
that in the U.S. too hours are the largest contributor to skewness and kurtosis.16 It is
worth noting that hours are measured less precisely in the PSID data than in our Dutch
data and this might affect some of these results.
      Turning back to Figure 12 and comparing male to household earnings reveals a larger
role for spousal insurance in the U.S. in terms of reducing the standard deviation and
skewness of male earnings at all levels of previous earnings. The presence of spousal
earnings tends to compress both the volatility and the tails of the household earnings
distribution in the U.S (in line with Pruitt and Turner (2018), who use administrative
data from the U.S.). These patterns are present in both countries, except that in the
Netherlands Kelley skewness becomes more negative after including spousal earnings.
      Finally, comparing gross to disposable income reveals that while government insurance
reduces the variability and negative skewness of earnings changes in both countries, this
role is much larger in the Netherlands and particularly so for households at the bottom
of the (previous) earnings distribution.

               To confirm that results are driven by cross-country differences and not by period
of observation, we also examine income dynamics for the PSID in the post 1997 period,
which covers the same time frame as the IPO data. The results are very similar (Appendix
D.1), thus indicating that the results are mainly driven by cross-country differences rather
than by different time periods.
               To evaluate whether our cross-country comparison is affected by the fact that we use
administrative data for the Netherlands and survey data for the U.S., we also compare
Dutch survey data (DHS) with those from our administrative Dutch data. Most of
the patterns across the income distribution are similar (see Appendix C). The main
differences are that, in the survey data, the differences between pre-tax income and
disposable income are smaller, and the role of wages in earnings dynamics are larger
than in our administrative data. Given that wages are constructed by dividing earnings
and hours, and that the survey data do not account for the number and duration of
employment spells in a year, this is likely to be related to measurement error in changes
in hours worked in the survey data. Thus, our results suggest that properly capturing
employment spells is crucial to properly decompose earnings fluctuations between hours
and wages.



5                           Conclusions
We study the nature of labor income risk in the Netherlands and the U.S. For the Nether-
lands, we use high-quality administrative data to disentangle the contribution of wages


                                                                                      24
and hours to the dynamics of male earnings. Furthermore, we investigate the degree of
insurance provided by spousal labor supply and by the tax and transfers system in both
countries.
   We document that the dynamics of individual male earnings is similar in both coun-
tries and displays important deviations from the typical assumptions of linearity and
normality. Individual-level male wage and earnings risk is relatively high at the begin-
ning and end of the working life, and for those in the lower and upper parts of the income
distribution. Importantly, we find that hours are the main driver of the negative skewness
and, to a lesser extent, the high kurtosis of earnings changes. In the Netherlands, hours
also account for most of the variability of earnings for workers in the bottom two deciles
of the earnings distribution.
   Turning to family and government insurance, in the Netherlands women’s earnings
reduce the standard deviation of labor income risk at the household level only if the
husband’s earnings are in the bottom third of the earnings distribution. Indeed, for the
age group 25-34 the variance of household earnings exceeds that of the husband’s earnings
if the latter are in the top two-thirds of the distribution. This is probably due to the birth
of children. However, income pooling within the household makes skewness substantially
less negative, thus suggesting that the presence of a secondary earner in the household
can smooth out large negative shocks. This effects appear stemming from income pooling
alone, as we do not find evidence of an added worker effect in the Netherlands.
   Comparing family and government insurance we find that the government plays a
much larger role in reducing wage risk in the Netherlands compared with the U.S. A
breakdown in government programs for older workers in the Netherlands shows that DI
and UI programs reduce income risk, especially for the lowest quarter of the male earnings
distribution. Pensions and taxes (to a lower extent) reduce earnings risk across the whole
distribution. Instead, in the U.S. the role that the family plays is much more important.
The results suggest that taxes and transfers may crowd out insurance that could be
generated within the family.

Appendix

A         The hours data
We obtain the data on hours worked by linking the IPO data with data from the Dutch
payroll administrations (DPA). To assess the quality of the data, this appendix describes
the data collection process and the importance of this data for various benefit systems.
       Dutch legislation mandates that all employers maintain up-to-date payroll records.
These records include employment start and end dates (and thus total number of days em-
ployed), number of regular and overtime hours, and earnings. Most employers outsource
the payroll administration and about 60% of pay slips are handled by four big companies:
Raet (25%), LogicaCMG (19%), ADP (11%) and PinkRoccade (6.6%). These companies
provide monthly pay slips to employees. The same software systems also provides an au-
tomatic report to the government each month. Therefore, if a pay slip contains a mistake
and the employee complains, a correction in the software system is made and passed on
to the government.
       The number of hours worked on an employee’s monthly pay slip matters for annual
leave computations, the duration of parental leave, pension contributions, pension ac-
crual, the eligibility and duration of unemployment and disability benefits, and child care
allowances. Thus, both employees and employers have strong incentives to check that
employment spell dates and hours worked on their pay slips are correct.
       With respect to annual leave, part-time workers usually receive a reduced number of
days. This also holds for parental leave time, which corresponds to 26 times the number
of weekly hours worked.17
       Employers also have to send payroll records to pension funds because hours worked
(technically, part-time factors, i.e., the ratio of an employee’s hours worked to the usual
working time in a sector) and employment spells are needed to compute pension con-
tributions and pension rights accumulation. Overtime work by part-time workers up to
a full time workweek is taken into account in the computation of pension contributions
and pension rights. When part-time and full-time workers work more than full time,
whether overtime work in excess of full time hours leads to higher pension contributions
  17
    During parental leave employees keep the same part-time factor, but gross and net salary are often
reduced. This implies a measured wage drop for people on parental leave. The same holds for sick leave.

                                                  28
and higher pension entitlements depends the pension plan’s rules.
   Furthermore, working hours and employment spells play a role in the Dutch UI and DI
system. People are entitled to unemployment benefits if they a) Lose at least 5 hours of
their labor hours per week. In case someone works less than 10 hours per week, he or she
becomes unemployed when he or she loses at least half of the working hours. For example,
if someone works 8 hours per week and loses 4 hours, he or she is unemployed. b) Have
worked at least 26 weeks out of the 36 weeks (in 2014) before becoming unemployed. The
requirement on the employment spell that we discuss in point (b) also holds for disability
insurance. Moreover, the duration of UI and DI benefits depends on employment history.
   Finally, the part-time factor is important for the number of hours that people receive
as child care allowance. The beginning and end dates of an employment spell are also
important for child care allowances, because people lose the entitlement to child care
allowances after a period of unemployment.
   Figure 14 shows an example of a pay slip, with 6.67 hours of overtime work. In jobs
that offer overtime pay, the worker has an incentive to verify whether the number of
overtime hours is not understated and the employer has an incentive to check that the
number of overtime hours is not overstated.




                              Figure 14: Example of a pay slip


   Hence, several mechanisms ensure the quality of the data. Because remaining errors
are still possible, the employment office performs several additional checks and amends
the data in case of errors.

                                            29
   The resulting data are exceptional, and particularly suitable for our purposes, because
they capture extremely well even those employees that have irregular patterns of employ-
ment. For instance, in 2013, 15% of all employees had more than one job, 12% worked
for more than one employer, and more than 7% worked for more than one employer in
the same month (most of them simultaneously). As we see in the figures that follow,
many employees do not work full time and many employees do not work the whole year.
Capturing the exact duration of labor market spells for irregular employees is particu-
larly difficult in survey data and some administrative data sources, and can introduce
substantial measurement error if a noisy measure of hours is used to compute wages using
earnings, which tend to be more precisely measured, particularly if they come from tax
records.
   We have access to all of this information from 2006 onwards, while slightly more
aggregated data are available since 2001. To have a longer sample period, we report the
results with the less aggregated data in the main body of the paper, while B we report
results using data from 2006 onwards only. All economic implications are the same.
   More specifically, the 2001-2005 data include the total number of employed days and
full-time equivalent hours. The total number of employed days measures the calendar
days that the individual was covered under a certain employment contract. An employee
is said to be a worker in a given day if he or she was working, on holiday or other
(un)paid absence, and this applies both to part-time jobs and full-time jobs. The full-
time equivalent hours measure is the result of, at a yearly level, aggregating the total
number of hours worked, converting it to days, and dividing it by the number of employed
days. The total number of hours worked in a year can be obtained by multiplying full-
time equivalent hours and the number of employed days. The full-time equivalent hours
measure includes workers working overtime or having two contracts at the same time,
even if these sum up to more than 40 hours a week, and workers working part-time, and
averages them out across the year.
   There are two caveats with the full-time equivalent hours measure in the 2001-2005
data. The first is that it is restricted to be at most 1 for an individual in a calendar
year. Thus, while it would be 1 for an individual that worked 85% of a full-time job for 6
months and 115% of a full-time job for 6 months, and it would be 1 for an individual that
worked a full-time job the whole year, it would also be 1 for an individual that worked

for 115% of the time for a whole year. The second caveat is that the full-time equivalent
hours measure is defined to be 1 if an employee works the (usual) number of weekly
working hours according to the Collective Labour Agreement (CAO) of a business sector.
For firms without a CAO a full time contract is defined as the most common number of
hours worked in the firm surpassing 34 hours: Dutch law recognizes full-time employment
from 36 to 40 hours per week. We use sectorial information and the post-2006 data to
impute the length of a full-time week for each sector. Thus, our final hours measure for
our main results is the result of multiplying the length of a full-time week by the number
of employed days divided by 7, by the full-time equivalent measure, which is between 0
and 1.
   Our richer data starting in 2006 is not affected by either of these two limitations,
and thus we use it to evaluate their impact on our results. Figure 15 compares both
variable definitions by showing the histogram of hours worked for the 2001-2014 dataset
and the richer post-2006 data. Both datasets capture regular and overtime hours until
one full-time year. However, only the post-2006 data captures overtime hours for full-
time workers. Figure 16 shows the distribution of overtime hours in the rich post-2006
dataset. Since this paper is about income dynamics, Figure 17 shows histograms of hours
changes using both definitions: whilst the post-2006 data is better suited to capture small
fluctuations of hours around zero, which implies a lower central peak, both distributions
of changes in hours worked are very similar.
   A comparison of the 2001-2014 data with the post-2006 data thus show that these
data are very similar and that both of these measures capture very well all patterns of

irregular employment, part-time work, workers with multiple jobs, and so on, that are at
the core of the wage dynamics we seek to explain.
      To compare our measured hours with those from survey data, Figure 18 shows the
histograms of hours worked and changes of hours worked implied by the Dutch DHS
household survey. As many household surveys, the DHS survey only asks about hours
worked in a typical week, and yearly hours can only be generated by multiplying that
number by 52. Thus, this measure captures improperly both those workers for whom
the typical working week has changed over the year and those who have had spells of
unemployment. This is reflected in higher bunching in the histogram for hours worked
and hours change.

B                   Results for the post-2006 data
From 2006 onwards, we have access to the complete payroll records for each employee,
and thus have as accurate information on hours as possible. For the period before 2006,
Statistics Netherlands provides researchers with a summary measure of hours that has
two limitations: (a) it is normalized by “typical” working hours in a sector and (b) it is
capped at full time hours. In our main results we use this latter version of the data. We
address the first limitation of the pre-2006 data by computing the typical workweek in
each sector in the post-2006 data and using it to re-normalize the data for each sector in
the pre-2006 data. Concerning the cap at full-time hours, it constrains the measurement
of overtime hours for full-time workers, but not for part-time workers, as long as the total
number of hours worked does not exceed full time hours.
           To evaluate the effects of missing overtime hours for full-time workers before 2006,
this appendix compares our results for our complete sample period with those we obtain
using only the post-2006 sample period. As we can see below, the results are extremely
close.

C     DNB household survey (DHS)
This section reports the same labor income moments in Section 4 but computed using
household survey, rather than the administrative IPO, data for the Netherlands. The
survey data come from the DNB Household Survey (DHS) which is a representative
Internet-based panel of over 2000 households administered by CentERdata at Tilburg
University and sponsored by the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). It contains detailed infor-
mation on components of personal and household income.
    We use the DHS to confirm that the patterns that we document for the Netherlands
in our administrative data set also hold in survey data for the Netherlands over the same,
2001 to 2014, period. Comparing Figure 26 below to the left-hand panels in Figure 12 in
Section 4 reveals that patterns are very similar across the two datasets. Only, the role of
wages in earnings dynamics is larger in the survey data than in the administrative data.
As the DHS does not allow us to account for unemployment spells during the year, this is
likely to be related to measurement error in changes in hours worked in the survey data.
In line with this, the skewness of hours worked is more negative in the administrative
data (Figure 6) than in the survey data (Figure 27).
    Given that our data for the U.S. comes from a household survey, this reassures us
that the differences that we document across countries are not due to the nature of the
data set but rather to institutional differences across countries.

D.2      Male earnings by recent earnings

Figures 29, 30, and 31 show the counterparts of Figures 1, 2, 6 and 8 with a different
defintion for the x-axis. Instead of using the percentile of last year’s earnings, we use the
percentile of recent earnings, following the definition in Guvenen et al. (2015). Namely,
recent earnings are the average income of a worker between years t − 1 and t − 5 (after
controlling for age and year effects). Additionally, and also following Guvenen et al.
(2015), this figures require that information on earnings is available both in t − 1 and
in two years between t − 5 and t − 2 to compute the measure of recent earnings. This
contrasts with our main results, in which we just require information to be available in
t − 1.
   The different sample selection and quantile ranking implies a lower value for the
standard deviation of earnings and a lower skewness (in absolute value), but all economic
implications, both in the comparison of hours and wages and in the study of government
insurance, remain unchanged.

D.3                  The role of asset income

Capital income consists of the following components: interests from saving accounts
and bonds, dividends, the rental value of the residential property, income from other
real estate, income from other assets, and mortgage interest payments. It does not
include capital gains from stocks or other financial assets. The results hardly change
with the inclusion of capital income, because capital income is relatively low compared

D.6                                 Arc-percent measures

In Figure 35 we represent an alternative measure of annual earnings changes, namely
arc-percent changes, defined as:

                                                                                                                         i
                                                                            i                                         Yt+1  − Yti
                                                                     ∆arc Yt,t+1 =                                     i
                                                                                                                                                                                                                (3)
                                                                                                                    (Yt+1  − Yti )/2
                 where Yti is earnings in levels. Therefore, this measure (unlike log changes) does
not require earnings in t + 1 to be above a minimum threshold and thus can accomodate
possible zeros, which are particularly relevant when studying government insurance, since
it can have a stronger effect for those individuals whose earnings change from being
positive to being zero for one whole calendar year.
                 We observe a strong reduction in all arc-percent measures of earnings risk when we
take into account government intervention, thus supporting the relevant role of the gov-
ernment in insuring workers against negative shocks, including the case in which earnings
become zero.

E.1         Decomposing skewness and kurtosis

(Residual) log earnings are by definition the sum of log hours and log wages. Let ∆y, ∆h,
and ∆w denote the one-year change, respectively, in (log) earnings, hours, and wages.
Dropping the household and time indices for simplicity, we can write


                                             ∆y = ∆h + ∆w

    In Figure 2, we provide a standard variance decomposition of ∆y at different points
in the earnings distribution, using the fact that:

   We denote the elements in the decomposition of skewness, respectively, the contri-
bution of hours to the skewness, the contribution of wages to the skewness, and the
co-skewness. Similarly, we denote the first two elements in the decomposition of kurtosis
the contribution of hours and wages to kurtosis, whilst the two addenda in the bottom
two rows jointly form the co-kurtosis.
   The contributions of hours and wages to both skewness and kurtosis follows naturally
from their respective definitions. For instance, ceteris paribus, a more left-skewed distri-
bution of wage changes will lead to a more left-skewed distribution of earnings changes.
   Co-skewness is more positive whenever large changes in hours are associated with
positive changes in wages, and large changes in wages are associated with positive changes
in hours. Intuitively, even if both the distributions of hours and wage changes were
symmetric, if it were the case that when hours change a lot wages increase, the resulting
distribution of earnings changes would be positively skewed (large positive earnings shocks
become more likely than large negative earnings shocks).
   Co-kurtosis is composed of three elements. It is more positive whenever (1) large
absolute changes in hours are associated with changes in wages of the same sign, (2)
large absolute in wages are associated with changes in hours of the same sign, and (3)
large absolute changes in hours and wages happen at the same time. If, as is in the case
in our main sample, tail events in wages (hours) are associated with changes in hours
(wages) of the opposite sign, co-kurtosis can be negative.
