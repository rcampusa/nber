During the Great Depression of 1930s, changes in the workweek drove a larger portion of changes
in total labor input than in other decades. Work-sharing policies appear to be responsible. Hoover
created various work-sharing committees lead by key industrialists, which pushed for shorter workweeks
and Roosevelt’s President’s Reemployment Agreement called for sharp cuts in weekly hours. The
hope was to spread available work amongst more people. While between 50 and 90 percent of declines
in labor input were accommodated by falling hours during these periods, in recent decades employers
have primarily relied on layoffs to achieve the same end. During the Great Depression of 1930s, changes

       The recent Financial Crisis and Great Recession has generated renewed interest in the

Great Depression and particularly the New Deal, as people seek answers about the sources of

recovery from a serious downturn. Studies of Depression-era labor markets have focused

heavily on downward stickiness of wages because unemployment rose above 20 percent for four

years and total hours of employment dropped more and recovered less than the number

employed (Bernanke 1983; Cole and Ohanian 1999). High wages are often cited as causing the

drops in employment and hours, but it is important to recognize that weekly hours and wages are

part of an overall employment package simultaneously set in labor markets. Benjamin Bernanke

(1983) recognized this in the analysis that underlay his seminal study of monthly data on

employment, hours, and earnings in manufacturing during the Great Depression and in work

with Powell (1986) on the post-war era until the early 1980s.


       During both the Great Depression and the Great Recession total hours worked dropped

dramatically and then remained well below long term trends during the recovery. However, the

contributions to changes in total hours of changes in the length of the workweek varied

dramatically between the two time periods and over the course of the century. The Median

Weekly Hours Share (WHS) in Table 1 uses monthly data from establishment surveys of hours

and employment to show the percentage that changes in hours worked per week contributed to

changes in total hours worked per week over three-month periods. For each decade, the WHS is

calculated for all periods and during periods when total hours rose and periods when they fell.

The results show striking changes across the decades. During the 1930s the WHS shows that

changes in weekly hours accounted for around half of all changes in total hours worked during

both upswings and downswings. During upswings in the post-war era the WHS remained stable

at about 25 percent between 1950 and 1980 before rising dramatically to 38 percent in the 1980s
and ultimately to 64 percent in the 2000s. This rise has sparked extensive discussions about

jobless recoveries since the early 1990s.1 During post-war downswings the WHS swung

between 31 and 43 percent between 1950 and 1980 and then declined over the next 3 decades to

27 percent in the 1980s and ultimately to 15 percent by the 2000s, as layoffs increasingly

dominated weekly hours reductions as the means of reducing labor inputs.


              Effective analysis of the differences in the role of weekly hours across time periods

requires a deep understanding of the labor market institutions and government policies across

eras. Our focus is on the 1930s, when the unusual pattern for the WHS for the 1930s was driven

in part by a series of emergency policies followed by the federal government in response to

moribund labor markets. Some of the patterns in the late 1930s were created by the introduction

of long run policies that established the basis for labor market institutions in later eras. Most

recent work on the 1930s has focused on high-wage policies coming through jawboning by

President Herbert Hoover in the early 1930s, code negotiations under the National Recovery

Administration (NRA), and strengthened unionization under the National Labor Relations Act

(NLRA).2 We emphasize that high wages were only one part of a policy package that tightly

interwove them with reductions in weekly hours and increases in employment. None of these

pieces can be treated as isolated from and/or exogenous to the others. Further, we place strong

emphasis on several key changes in the policy environment that have been largely glossed over

in most prior studies, including the President’s Reemployment Agreements beginning in August

1933, and the very weak enforcement of the NLRA until the Supreme Court found it

constitutional in April 1937. These key policy changes are associated with quite striking

changes in weekly hours, employment, and hourly earnings.


       I.      Changes in the WHS for Manufacturing Over the Last 90 Years


       The role played by changes in weekly hours in changes in total labor inputs has typically

been shown by comparing the variances of total hours, weekly hours, and total employment

using a time series filter to clear out seasonal fluctuation and long run trends. We chose the

WHS approach without seasonal or cyclical adjustment because we wanted to show the data as

the policy makers were seeing it, particularly in the 1930s. Further, we wanted to show changes

over time in the asymmetry in the WHS during upswings and downswings in hours. Responses

to seasonality are unlikely to be the source of the differences in Table 1 because when we

calculated the WHS with 12-month changes, the comparisons were similar in magnitude.


       The size of the contribution of changes in weekly hours to changes in total labor input

was starkly different during the 1930s and the 2000s when compared with other decades.

Bernanke and Powell (1986) had noted differences in the behavior of weekly hours between the

1923-1940 and the 1950-1982 periods. The patterns of the WHS in Table 1 also show

differences between the two periods as well as some additional variation within the interwar

period. During upswings, the WHS in Table 1 shows that the typical contribution of rising

weekly hours to the rise in total hours rose from 32 percent in the 1920s to 45 percent of the

increases during the 1930s and then fell back to 27 percent in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

During downswings the changes in the WHS show that reductions in weekly hours contributed

35 percent of the total hours reductions in the 1920s. The percentage rose sharply to 51 percent
in the 1930s and then dropped back to between 31 and 43 percent of the reductions between

1950 and 1980.


              The WHS figures suggest that employers used changes in hours about as much as layoffs,

hiring, and firing to change labor inputs during the 1930s. In the 1920s, 1950s, 1960s, and

1970s, adjustments in weekly hours played a much smaller role. Bernanke and Powell (1986,

594-5) attributed the greater stability of post-war hours to greater postwar importance of unions,

which may have preferred layoffs of junior workers to a general reduction of hours, and the

advent of unemployment insurance, which provided unemployment benefits to fully unemployed

workers but not to workers on short time. But this can only be a part of the answer. Most of the

difference between the interwar and postwar period arises from the high WHS in the 1930s,

while the differences in the WHS between the 1920s and the 1950-1980 period are much smaller.

Given that unions were weak and that there was no unemployment insurance in the 1920s,

greater unionization and access to unemployment insurance can only partially explain the

interwar and post-war differences. A careful look at the policy moves and the harshness of the

Great Depression is needed in order to explain the unusual behavior of WHS during f the 1930s.


              The WHS measure also reveals a striking change in the role played by hours after 1980

that has led analysts to talk of jobless recoveries and heavy reliance on layoffs.3 Increasing talk

of jobless recoveries has been driven by rises in the WHS during upswings in hours worked. The

share of increases in total hours due to increases in weekly hours has risen sharply each decade

from 23 percent in the 1970s to the Depression Era level of 46 percent in the 1990s to a very

high 64 percent in the 2000s. Meanwhile, employers appear to have been relying increasingly on

layoffs and firings rather than reductions in hours worked to reduce labor inputs in

manufacturing. The decline in the WHS during downswings since the 1970s shows that the

contribution of reductions in weekly hours to reductions in total hours declined from 31 percent

in the 1970s to a low of 15 percent.


                             II. Work-sharing Policies during the 1930s

       During the 1920s the average manufacturing work week in most years was close to 48

hours with drops to around 45 hours in the 1921 recession and 47 hours in 1924. After October

1929 average weekly hours shown in Table 2 dropped sharply and stayed below 41 for the

remainder of the 1930s. Given the cyclicality of weekly hours, there is no doubt that a

significant share of the changes in weekly hours during the 1930s were driven by the size of the

Depression. Import the WHS ratio from the 1920s into the 1930s and roughly one-third of the

upswings and down-swings in total hours might have been explained by cyclical conditions.

Yet, the WHS for the 1930s shows that the actual contribution of changes in weekly hours to the

ups and downs in total hours worked was roughly 50 percent.

       As shown in Table 2, there were significant changes in the contributions of changes in

weekly hours during periods defined by various policy regimes during the 1930s. The WHS in

Table 2 is calculated with disaggregated data for 11 manufacturing sectors, so that each

observation used to calculate the median is an industry-month. The disaggregated WHSs for the

1920s in Table 2 are very similar to the aggregated WHSs for the 1920s in Table 1. Many but

not all of the 11 industries follow similar paths over the period.
       II.a. The Hoover Years

       A share of the differences between the 1930s and other decades can be attributed to the

various work-sharing policy regimes pressed by the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations, and

even some major industrialists, to help workers survive in an economic emergency. In his

memoirs, Hoover (1953, 54-57) stated that the labor policies he proposed to industrialists in the

early 1930s called for employers to look after the relief of their own workers, maintain

employment by work-sharing with weekly hours cuts, and insure that each worker’s weekly

purchasing power was not cut too drastically by maintaining hourly wages or allowing them to

decline only with the cost-of-living. He referred to these work-sharing policies as a type of

“indirect relief” for unemployment—contrasting it with “direct relief” whereby funds are

provided by some charitable or government action.

       The Roosevelt administration followed suit with its policies toward industry and work

relief. The President’s Reemployment Agreements (PRA) and the NRA codes were explicitly

designed with these goals in mind. Meanwhile, work relief under the Federal Emergency Relief

Administration (FERA) from 1933 to 1935 was explicitly designed to limit hours of work for

recipients so that relief could be provided to more families to reach a minimum consumption

standard. In some cities where FERA budgets were overwhelmed, hours and benefits were cut

so that more families could at least some help. Under the Works Progress Administration work

relief, monthly hours were also limited so that more families would benefit. Unions also pressed

for work-sharing by cutting weekly hours but they tried to add a requirement that weekly wages

not be cut, a policy that no one else supported.

       Hoover’s efforts to promote the work-sharing policy began on November 21, 1929, less

than one month after the stock market crash, when President Hoover invited several leading
industrialists to the White House. Hoover asked them to spread “available work…among all

employees by temporarily shortening the work-week of individuals” and to maintain wage rates

(Rose 2010; Hoover, 54-7).” Following the President’s lead, in May 1930, the Railway

Employees Department of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) urged a 40-hour workweek

as a way to reduce unemployment (Bernstein 1969, 476). The AFL’s Executive Council

likewise endorsed reductions in work hours as a way to alleviate unemployment at the union’s

October 1930 convention. Shortly after Standard Oil of New Jersey went to a 40 hour workweek

while Kellogg Company adopted an even more radical six-hour day (Hunnicut 1996).

       Building upon this momentum, in October of 1930, Hoover created the President’s

Emergency Committee for Employment (PECE). Consistent with Hoover’s general approach to

the Depression, the committee encouraged local responsibility and voluntary cooperation from

employers with respect to solutions to the employment problem. Shorter workweeks were

strongly encouraged by PECE so as to keep workers off relief rolls. US Steel was touted by

PECE as a prime example of work-sharing’s benefits. Myron C. Taylor, head of US Steel’s

Finance Committee, went on the radio on behalf of PECE to announce that in December of 1930

the company was operating at only 38 percent of capacity, but it had as many employees as it did

in December 1929 thanks to a reduction in the average workweek from 46.2 to 34.4 hours

(Bernstein 1969, 306). PECE published pamphlets providing suggestions for how companies

could cut hours and optimally time shorter shifts to promote maximum efficiency. Many

companies followed suit including American Telephone and Telegraph, Bethlehem Steel, Du

Pont, General Electric, General Motors, International Harvester, and Westinghouse. Indeed, the

average workweek in manufacturing fell from 44.5 hours in June 1930 to 32.8 hours in June

1932. Some of this drop would certainly have occurred anyway with the faltering economy, but
the anecdotal evidence presented above suggests that at least some of the 26 percent drop in the

workweek was caused by Hoover’s work-sharing policies. Over the same 24 months, the number

of workers employed in manufacturing fell 32 percent from 7.56 million to 5.10 million, but total

labor input (number of employees * average workweek) fell an astounding 50.3 percent from

337 million hours worked to 167 million hours worked per week (see also Figure 1).

Meanwhile, the WHS, as shown in Table 2, rose dramatically relative to the 1920s. During

Hoover’s jawboning period through August 1932, the contributions of declines in weekly in

hours to declines in total hours rose to 52 percent. In the few periods and industries when total

hours rose, employers relied even more on expansions in weekly hours, as the WHS jumped to

80 percent. Had it not been for work-sharing, whether caused by Hoover’s policy efforts or by

natural agreements between workers and firms to cut workweeks, the unemployment problem in

the early 1930s would have been far worse.

       In August 1932 Hoover called another conference of industrial leaders to Washington in

which he encouraged still more work-sharing via cuts to the workweek. Additionally, Hoover

created a share-the-work committee headed by Standard Oil of New Jersey President Walter C.

Teagle. The Teagle Committee, with its slogan “Job Security by Job Sharing,” further

encouraged companies to cut workweeks, and again provided models of how such measures

could be accomplished. In early 1933, a survey by the Commerce Department suggested that 80

percent of the nation’s employers had adopted some form of work-sharing and that one quarter

of those Americans employed owed their situation to this policy (Bernstein, 1969, 479).

       Why did so many industrial leaders appear to have followed Hoover’s suggestions for

work sharing? One contributor may have been that the industrialists agreed with Walter Teague,

President of Standard Oil of New Jersey, who used the analogy of famine in advocating work
sharing. “If there is but a limited amount of food, no one would suggest feeding two-thirds of the

distressed people and letting the other third starve. The available food is rationed. That is what

we are now doing with work, because there is a partial famine in work” (Weinberg and

Weinberg, 1968, p. 247).4

              Another may have been fears that if they did not follow suit, the Hoover administration

might shift federal policy in favor of collective bargaining. During the World War I emergency

the federal government had actively promoted collective bargaining over the protests of many

industries. After the federal government withdrew its control of large parts of the economy,

labor strife followed as employers and workers sought to work out the new rules of bargaining.

The end result was that union membership and strike activity waned and the figures in the early

1930s matched post-war lows. Given the nadir of unionization at that time, it does not seem

likely that employers feared strikes or unions much. However, the employers might well have

feared that an irritated Hoover and Congress would respond to the Depression emergency with

new federal labor policy. Hoover (1953, 54-57) emphasized that he wanted to prevent lockouts

and strikes that would add to the turmoil in his meetings with industrialist. Hoover eventually

supported expanded opportunities for collective bargaining by signing the Davis-Bacon Act in

March 1931 and the Norris-LaGuardia Act in March 1932.



              II.b. Union Pressure for Reduced Hours During the Interregnum

              After Roosevelt’s electoral victory in November 1932, labor unions, who had long

pushed for shorter workweeks in the US, saw an opening to accomplish not just Hoover’s push

for firms’ “voluntary compliance” in shortening the workweek, but legislative action. During the

AFL’s annual convention, three weeks after the election, President William Green proposed a six
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    See Baily (1976) and Ohanian (2009) for models of how firms use hours cuts in recessions and job sharing.
hour per day, five-day week, claiming it would have a dramatic positive effect on the

unemployment problem. Three weeks after the AFL convention, Senator Hugo Black of

Alabama introduced a 30 hour per week bill and in April 1933, the bill passed the Senate.

       Himmelberg (1976) notes that many in the Roosevelt Administration felt the 30-hour

week was too extreme. Needing to put forth an alternative, the Administration drafted the

National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). Under the NIRA industries would create “codes of

fair competition.” To gain government approval, the codes had to contain workweek reductions,

with 35 hours being the general guidepost, although hours could vary by industry, city

population, and job description. While the NIRA was passed on June 16, 1933, the process of

drafting codes of fair competition was slow.



       II.c. The President’s Reemployment Agreements

       To speed the labor provisions of the act into effect, Roosevelt created the President’s

Reemployment Agreement (PRA) which began on August 1, 1933. Roosevelt pressed firms to

expand employment under the act and asked them to sign a “blanket” agreement to pay

minimum hourly wages of 40 cents per hour, raise wages for higher paid workers, cap the

workweek at 35 hours, and allow workers to bargain collectively. Roosevelt provided incentives

for the firms to sign the agreements through a massive public relations campaign. Firms that

signed the agreement were listed on Honor Rolls at post offices and often in newspapers, and

were given posters and the right to display the Blue Eagle symbol of the NRA. Roosevelt’s

Fireside Chats included exhortations for people to support the firms that signed the PRA. In late

August of 1933 the NRA sent out 1.5 million volunteers to go door-to-door and obtain 20 million

signatures to Statements of Cooperation pledging “cooperate in the reemployment” and support
and patronize firms that displayed the Blue Eagle. Compliance with the PRA’s wage and hours

provisions was extremely high (Taylor 2011).

       The PRA was associated with a sharp reversal in a prior rise in weekly hours. When

industrial production had rebounded sharply between March and July of 1933 in Figure 1,

weekly hours had surged to 42.9 hours per week. After the PRA campaign, weekly hours

immediately plunged and reached a low of 33.8 in November of 1933. The PRA timing also

matched a sharp change in hourly earnings. Real hourly earnings in manufacturing in Figure 1

had bottomed out around May and June of 1933, and then rose sharply over the next three

months. Although the number employed in manufacturing continued to rise after the PRAs were

signed, the drop in weekly hours was enough that total hours worked fell.

       The PRAs were largely in effect from August to December of 1933 when many industries

replaced them with NRA codes. One of the most striking features of this period is what

happened to the WHS. In contrast to all other periods we have measured, the WHS was negative

for industries that were expanding work hours during this five-month span. Weekly hours

actually fell when total hours worked were rising, working against the expansion of total hours

by a negative 23 percent. In the periods when industries expanded total hours in the PRA time

frame, the drop in weekly hours accounted for 89 percent of the expansion in total hours.

       The PRAs were the classic example of a package of high wages, job-sharing, and

maintenance of employment. Even though they were voluntary, they received much more of a

boost than the job-sharing, high wage jawboning by Hoover because of the massive public

relations campaign launched by the Roosevelt administration. Further, the PRAs were signed by

many nonmanufacturing firms and the changes seen in manufacturing were also seen in mining,
trade, and nearly every sector except utilities (see Figures in Appendix II). Prior to that time

only bond sales had received such promotion during the World War I emergency (Taylor 2011).



       II.d. The NRA Codes and the NLRA Before the Court Declared It Constitutional

       The NRA codes were negotiated between employers, workers, and consumers, but the

employers typically held the upper hand. Figure 1 for manufacturing industries shows that

during the NRA period, hourly earnings rose slightly, while weekly hours were centered around

a 35-36 hour level with fluctuations around that level that help drive similar fluctuations in total

hours. During that time, the WSH in Table 2 shows that roughly 40 percent of the swings in

total hours were contributed by swings in weekly hour in both upswings and downswings. The

median WSH’s were only slightly higher than those seen in the 1920s.

       On May 27, 1935, the Supreme Court’s Schechter decision ruled the NIRA and all its

component parts unconstitutional. Companies were thus freed from legal obligations to their

codes, although there is plenty of evidence that enforcement of the codes had already diminished

(Taylor and Klein, 2008). On July 5 President Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations

Act, giving workers the right to collective bargain with their employers if a majority of workers

demanded it. Contemporaries describe enormous uncertainty among employers and workers as

to whether the Act would survive a test of its constitutionality. Two lower courts had ruled

against enforcement of the Act in the Jones & Loughlin Steel Corporation test case and

Roosevelt’s court-packing scheme had met extensive opposition. The effects of the passage of

the Act seem small, as several measures of strike activity in 1935 and 1936 were well below their

levels for 1933 and 1934. Leo Troy’s measures of union membership show little change
between 1934 and 1936, although BLS measures show an increase in union membership of about

25 percent (Rosenbloom 2005, 336-7, 354-5).

              In either case the effect of the elimination of the NRA and the introduction of the NLRA

are not readily detectible in the labor market data in Figure 1 and Table 2. During a phase of

strong recovery in industrial production, weekly hours, total hours worked, and hourly earnings

all follow relatively smooth paths with a slightly positive trend from May 1935 through March

1937. The WHS measures in Table 2 are roughly the same for the NRA and NLRA period

before constitutionality was affirmed. The WHS in both periods differed drastically from the

WHS in the PRA period and still remained somewhat higher than they had in the 1920s.



              II.e. A Constitutional National Labor Relations Act

              The changes were far more dramatic when the NLRA was affirmed by the Supreme

Court on April 12, 1937 in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel

Corporation, 301 U.S. 1. The effect on strike and union activity was immediate. The number

of workers in union recognition strikes nearly quadrupled, from 202,118 and 272,013 in 1935

and 1936 to 941,802 in 1937.5 Likewise, annual data on union membership support the notion

that 1937 was a key turning point. Estimates from Freeman (1998, p. 289) show that union

membership spiked from 3.85 million in 1936 to 6.76 million and 7.76 million respectively in

1937 and 1938. 6 Additionally these two years saw a surge in sit-down strikes, before the

National Labor Relations Board and courts ruled them to be illegal.

              Drops in total hours in Figure 1 started immediately. Some of the drop was likely due to

the sudden surge in strike activity, however it is important to note that weekly hours dropped as

well. Both series began falling before the sharp drop in industrial production associated with the

1937-1938 recession. Real hourly earnings in Figure 1 had begun to surge a few months before

the decision, but surged even more rapidly after the decision. They soon leveled off later in the

year, despite sharp drops in output, employment, and hours. The one area where the NLRA

decision does not seem to have affected things much was in the WHS measures in Table 2,

which were very similar before and after the court decision.


              The next change in federal policy was the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in

June of 1938, however the 40/40 standards were phased in over time rather than instituted all at

once. Beginning on October 24, 1938, firms engaged in interstate commerce had to pay at least

25 cents per hour and had to pay time and a half on hours beyond 44 hours per week. The

minimum wage rose to 30 cents per hour and the maximum workweek (without overtime pay)

fell to 42 hours in October 1939. The overtime cutoff fell then fell to 40 hours in October 1940.

However, the average work week was still under 37 hours during the period, so the overtime

cutoff likely did not have much effect until the end of 1940. Similarly, the minimum average

wage was binding only in some industries in the South and Andrew Seltzer (1997) shows that

those industries routinely found ways around the law.7

 Another significant change was the introduction of unemployment insurance. The impact of
this change is not easily seen in aggregate data because many states delayed in passing the
enabling legislation and 20 states did not begin paying claims until 1939.
   III. Conclusions


       One of the most serious problems for the current economy is the sharp drop in total hours

worked since the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Total hours can change due to changes in

employment or in hours worked per worker. Comparisons for manufacturing over the past

century show that the contribution of changes in weekly hours to changes in total hours worked

has changed enormously. During the 2000s when hours of work increased, increases in weekly

hours accounted for an all-time high of nearly two-thirds of the change in total hours. During

declines in total hours, less than 15 percent of the decline came in the form of drops in weekly

hours with the balance attributable to layoffs. The pattern is quite different from other decades

and particularly, the Great Depression of the 1930s, when roughly half of changes in total hours

were contributed by changes in weekly hours.


       One reason for the differences between the 1930s, the 2000s, and other decades is the

structure of federal policy toward labor during the 1930s. Both the Hoover and Roosevelt

Administrations actively pressed industry to adopt a job-sharing employment packages that

combined lower hours per week with maintained hourly wages, so that more workers could be

employed. The policies changed several times and most of the changes led to different

contributions of changes in weekly hours to changes in total hours worked. Hoover’s jawboning

in the early 1930s led to substantial changes when compared with the 1920s. The most powerful

effects were found under Roosevelt’s President’sRe-employment Agreements in the second half

of 1933, which appear to have had powerful effects that reduced weekly hours and raised wage

rates, while sharply increasing job-sharing. Once the National Labor Relations Act was affirmed

by the Supreme Court, weekly hours again fell sharply and wage rates rose, setting the stage for

the patterns seen in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.
        This paper focuses on the aggregate information for manufacturing to tell the story. It

summarizes the experiences we have found for most manufacturing industries during the 1930s.

The PRA effects in manufacturing look similar for trade, and mining and miscellaneous

categories, but are not there for utilities, which had different labor market institutions.

Furthermore, some sectors like mining and railroads were governed by policies specific to those

sectors. Preliminary work shows that the size of the effects of the job sharing in the raw data still

are present after controlling for cycles, seasonality, and policies directed at the money supply,

deficit, and relief.

                     Calculating the Weekly Hours Share Measure for a Time Period

        To provide a sense of how changes in weekly hours contributed to changes in total hours

worked during a week in different policy regimes during the 1930s in Table ??, we collected data

from surveys of establishments from the National Industrial Conference Board (NICB) in the

1920s and 1930s for 11 industries between 1920 and 1940. For comparisons across the decades

in Table 1 we used the data aggregated for all manufacturing from the NICB from 1920 to 1940

and the data aggregated for all manufacturing collected from the establishment surveys by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics from 1950 through 2011.

        Total hours worked during the week in industry i in month t (Hit) is the product of

average hours per week in industry i in month t weekly hours (hit) and average employment in

the week closest to the 15th of month t in industry i (Eit).

        Hit = hit * Eit.

        The natural log of the equation is

        ln(Hit) = ln(hit) + ln(Eit).

        To smooth the data some for sharp changes that might have occurred due to unusual

fluctuations, we calculate growth rates over a three month period can be calculated as

        ln(Hit) - ln(Hit-3)   = [ln(hit) - ln(hit-3)] + [ln(Eit) - ln(Eit-3)].

        Note that this will lead to overlaps across periods. The share of the contribution of the

log change in weekly hours to the log change in total hours, which we call Weekly Hours Share

(WHS)

                WHSit,t-3 = [ln(hit) - ln(hit-3)] / [ln(Hit) - ln(Hit-3)] *100.
       To see how the contribution varied between one policy regime (p) and the next during

upswings in total hours worked (U), we calculated the median WHS during Hours Share for

industry-months during upswings

              WHSUp = Median(HSit)| [ln(Hit) - ln(Hit-3)] > 0,

       And we made a similar calculation for industry-months during downswings.

       WHSDp = Median(HSit)| [ln(Hit) - ln(Hit-3)] < 0,

       We used the medians so that highly unusual values did not dominate the measure.

 We followed the same procedure for calculating the WHS during upswings and downswings in
  manufacturing for each decade in Table 1 except that we used the aggregate manufacturing
   observations rather than industry specific observations, which leads to the removal of the
                         industry i subscript from all of the equations.
