This paper investigates the reasons for discrepancies between the pension plan type reported by respondents
to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and pension plan type obtained from documents produced
by their employers, called Summary Plan Descriptions (SPDs). The analysis suggests the discrepancies
are sizable and are mainly due to misreports by respondents. Discrepancies between respondent and
firm reports of plan type are first documented for different years and from different data sources. Changes
over time in respondent and firm reports are analyzed for those who say their plans did not change.
 Plan type from payroll data produced by Watson Wyatt, a pension consulting company, is examined
and compared to respondent reports for employees covered by Watson Wyatt plans. The Watson Wyatt
payroll data report plan type without error, and yet we find the patterns of discrepancies between respondent
and firm provided data are the same as for the HRS employer and respondent data. We also explore
other evidence gathered by the HRS in the course of interviews and various experiments. Our findings
that errors are mainly the result of misreporting by respondents, together with findings from experiments,
suggest a number of changes in survey design that can help to reduce reporting error. They also suggest
that models of retirement and saving behavior should allow for imperfect knowledge by decision makers.

Introduction

       To understand the role of pensions in retirement and saving, surveys have gathered data

from respondents as well as their employers. Evidence continues to accumulate that there are

substantial differences between pension outcomes reported by some pension covered workers and

the corresponding outcomes gleaned from employer produced data.1 Our aim in this paper is to

understand the reasons for differences in one key outcome, pension plan type. Most importantly,

we would like to know whether differences between respondent and firm reports of pension plan

type are the result of respondents’ imperfect knowledge and understanding of their pensions, or

whether there are other reasons for these differences.

       If respondent errors are common, and are the main cause of discrepancies between

respondent reported pension outcomes and outcomes obtained from employer plan descriptions,

then there are important implications for analyses of retirement and saving behavior. Respondent

errors would call into question the assumption in standard models that retirement and saving

decisions are made by well informed agents. For example, questions would be raised about how

well people do in determining the adequacy of their retirement saving; whether covered workers

understand the choice set created by the complex rules governing retirement plans2; and whether

people appropriately value the pension plans their employers provide as part of their compensation

packages.

       We will focus on whether the plan is defined benefit (DB), defined contribution (DC), or

some other type of plan. With a defined benefit (DB) plan, a formula determines the benefit based

on past earnings, experience and age of retirement. Defined benefit plans typically pay a stream of

benefits beginning at retirement and lasting for as long as the covered worker (or the worker and

Stevens (2006).
2
  It appears that retirement behavior conforms to the incentives from pensions only for those who
understand how their pensions work (Chan and Huff Stevens, 2005).

                                                                                                      1
spouse) live. There may be a bonus for retiring early and other differences in the total value of the

pension that depend on when a person retires.3 A defined contribution (DC) plan is essentially an

account that will be turned over to the covered worker upon separation (assuming the worker has

stayed long enough for the pension to be vested), or upon retirement. Contributions by the

employer and/or the employee are accumulated and invested, and the employee is entitled to the

contributions plus the returns. Unless the defined contribution plan is one of the few offering

benefits in the form of an annuity, the pace and size of withdrawals from the plan are determined by

the retiree. Hybrid plans combine features of DB and DC plans. For example, a common type of

hybrid plan called a cash balance plan creates a notional account with a prespecified return, with the

firm funding the implied liability from these accounts as they would fund the liabilities from a

defined benefit plan.

       Plan type is a key piece of information required to understand a person’s pension plan. It is a

major determinant of the value and incentives created by a pension. Thus surveys asking

respondents about their pensions often begin by asking about plan type.4

       Once plan type is determined, surveys ask other detailed questions about benefits and the

features of a worker’s pension. Which question is asked often depends on what plan type was

reported. For example, those with a defined benefit plan are typically asked when they expect to

retire and what their yearly benefit will be. Holders of defined contribution plans are often asked to

report the current balance in their plan account. If plan type is incorrectly reported, questions may

be asked that are not appropriate for the plan held. We will show that respondents who are

  Gustman and Steinmeier (1989) provide a detailed discussion of how the various features of
pensions affect the present value of the plan.

  The Health and Retirement Study indicates it is interested in finding out what type of pension the
respondent has. “In some retirement plans, call them Type A, benefits are usually based on a
formula involving age, years of service and salary. In other plans, call them Type B, money is
accumulated in an account for you.” The respondent is then asked whether their plan is Type A,
Type B, or Both.

                                                                                                        2
questioned about a plan type other than the one they hold may become confused and provide

answers that make little sense. Moreover, respondents who misreport plan type may not be asked

questions that are important for determining the value and properties of their pension.

       This paper measures discrepancies in reported pension plan type between respondents and

firms. It presents evidence suggesting the extent to which plan type is misreported by respondents.

The data are taken from three different sources, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Survey

of Consumer Finances (SCF) and a survey conducted by the Watson Wyatt Company. Most of the

evidence is from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal survey of the older

population that began in 1992. The HRS matches respondent reports about their pension plans to

plan descriptions obtained from their employers.5 In addition to information from the core survey

and from employers, we introduce information from a number of experimental questions in the HRS

pertaining to plan characteristics and plan type. Recordings of interviews also help to pinpoint

reasons for misreporting. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances are used to document the

relationship between employer and respondent reports about pensions in 1983, so that a very rough

time series of discrepancies can be created. Watson Wyatt Company has made a sample available

that includes employer payroll data as well as respondent reports of their pensions. Differences

between employer and respondent pension reports are sometimes attributed to the failure to match

an employee with the appropriate pension offered by the firm. Plan descriptions from payroll data

are perfectly matched to the respondents, so that all discrepancies are due to errors in information

provided by the respondent.

5
  The HRS collects detailed, employer produced plan descriptions, called Summary Plan
Descriptions (SPDs), directly from employers, Department of Labor files, from the net, and from
respondents themselves who request the plan descriptions from their employers. This information
allows us to determine the degree of consistency or inconsistency between the respondents’ answers
and indications of plan type gleaned from firm produced plan descriptions. It also allows us to
explore the importance of various reasons for any inconsistency in answers, and potential remedies
in terms of survey design.


                                                                                                       3
       Taking all of this evidence together, it appears that discrepancies between respondent and

firm reports of plan type are mainly due to errors in respondent data.

       Section II lists a number of reasons why firm and respondent reports may contain errors.

Section III compares reports of pension plan type from respondent data with reports from employer

produced plan descriptions. In Section IV consistencies and inconsistencies in firm and respondent

reports of plan type over time are documented for those reporting their plans have not changed.

Section V explores survey and matched payroll data from Watson Wyatt. In Section VI we analyze

variation in self reported plan type in seven waves of the HRS panel for those members of the

original HRS cohort who reported they were covered by a pension, and who also reported their

pension plans were unchanged over time. Section VII compares plan type reported by respondents

at different times, including the time a respondent leaves a pension covered job, to the firm report

collected just before leaving the firm. Section VIII reports findings from listening to interview

tapes, as well as findings from an experimental module that asked respondents whether they know

the technical name of their plan. Section IX reports the results of an experiment where those who

reported a DB plan were asked questions relevant to a DC plan and vice versa. This suggests the

nature of errors that would arise should questions not be conditioned on plan type, so that people

with one type of pension are asked about pension characteristics for a plan type they did not report.

Section X concludes.

II. Reasons for differences between firm and respondent reports.

       As we will document extensively, workers’ reports of their pension plan types often differ

from the information obtained from their employers. A few of the possible reasons for these

differences are listed here.

       The fault may lie with the respondent or the respondent’s knowledge (see Gustman and

Steinmeier, 2005).


                                                                                                        4
1. Some respondents may be badly informed about their pensions because their plans are too

complex for them to understand. Other respondents may be able to understand their pensions after

some effort, but may choose not to exert the effort because the benefits are not worth the costs

(Lusardi, 1999). Either the costs may be high because of the difficulty of the calculation, or the

benefits may be low. Low benefits may reflect a low dollar value of the pension, or a good pension

that, together with Social Security, will provide a good replacement rate, so that further

investigation will not affect either retirement or savings decisions.

2. When there is more than one plan, respondents may be confused when asked in the HRS and

other surveys to talk about their most important plan. In most cases, the DB plan is the most

important plan. Nevertheless, some respondents may think the DC plan is the most important of

his/her plans. Even worse, the respondent may report one plan is more important in some waves,

and that the other is more important in other waves. This confusion as to which plan is most

important may be the result of the complexity of the pension calculation.

3. If some respondents do not participate in a plan, and do not report being eligible for the plan,

these respondents may report being covered by fewer plans than are listed by the firm. This could

be a particular problem for those with a DC plan who do not contribute each year, and consider

themselves not to be covered by the plan in years they do not contribute.

4. Respondents may misreport whether their plan has changed over time, affecting plan type

reported in different waves.

       The fault may lie with the survey questions and design.

5. Survey questions that attempt to distinguish plan type may be poorly crafted. For example, the

survey may present definitions of DB and DC plans, and describe the properties of different plans,

noting that a defined benefit plan provides a benefit that is determined by salary and years of




                                                                                                      5
service, while a defined contribution plan provides an account. These descriptions may be unclear

to the respondent.

       The fault may lie with process of collecting and matching employer provider plan

descriptions to a particular respondent (Rohwedder, 2003).

6. A firm may offer a large number of plans of different types, and may have submitted many plan

descriptions. Summary Plan Descriptions list the characteristics of those workers who are covered

by the particular plan being described – e.g., union workers, full time, hired in a specified window,

say from 1990 to 2000. Still, the characteristics of the respondent and of the covered workers may

not be precisely enough stated. As a result, the wrong plan description may be selected from the

group of plans submitted by the firm to the HRS.

7. In some cases, the firm may not have sent in all the available plan descriptions for its employees;

or the full set of plan descriptions may not have been available from the supplementary sources

used by HRS when collecting plan documents.6

8. There may be some matching problems based on the date of the SPD, whether received from the

firm or from other sources.7

       Public pension plans may be a particular source of confusion as to plan type. First, defined

benefit plans offered by government entities commonly require a contribution by the covered

worker, while most private sector defined benefit plan do not. Second, there is a separate

accounting for the employee’s contribution. Third, at time of job termination, instead of waiting for

6
  In the next round of matches, HRS pension coders have been instructed to create an index
indicating the degree of certainty or uncertainty they hold as to the quality of the match; that is, how
well a particular plan description applies to a given HRS respondent.
7
  In 2005, HRS is collecting employer produced pension plan descriptions from a number of
sources. Respondents are collecting the descriptions directly from their employers. Presumably, if
these respondents sent in all their plans, matching would be exact and up to date. Comparisons of
plans submitted by respondents with those obtained from other sources should indicate the extent to
which collection of outdated SPDs accounts for discrepancies between firm and respondent
provided plan descriptions.

                                                                                                        6
a payment from the DB plan, government employees are often given the opportunity to cash out or

roll over an account holding only the employee’s contribution. About 43% (1000/2325) of all

respondents to the Health and Retirement Study with matched plan documents are government

employees. Those respondents usually have a DB plan, or both a DB and a DC plan. Only about 3%

of them have a DC plan only.

III. Consistency between employer and respondent reports.

       The period we will be examining for consistency between respondent and firm reports runs

from the early 1980s through 2004. The early data are from the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances

(SCF); the later data from the Health and Retirement Study. The intervening period is characterized

by a sharp trend in pension plan type, with the share of respondents reporting a defined benefit plan

falling from 91.6 percent in the 1983 SCF to 38 percent in the 2004 HRS. Each of the two surveys

provides information both from respondents and from employers, and both sets of data are

consistent with other data highlighting the trend to defined contribution plans. Remember,

however, that all tables in this section include only observations where respondent reports have

been matched to employer reports. In dealing only with matched data, we are analyzing a selected

sample that should not be used to measure the overall size of the trend to DC plans.8

       The SCF affords an opportunity to document for the period of the 1980s the extent of

agreement between respondent reports of pension plan type and reports from firms indicating the

type of pension covering the workers in the sample. It is based on a sample of all households of all

ages, and obtains detailed pension plan descriptions for those respondents who report they are

covered by a pension.




8
 Although the SCF covers a younger age group than the HRS, the trend in reported plan type is
obvious in any data set, and has been documented extensively in the literature. See Gustman and
Steinmeier (1992) for early results.

                                                                                                       7
       Despite the overwhelming dominance of DB plans in the early 1980s, 40.3 percent of SCF

respondents report either that they do not know the plan type, or report a plan type that does not

correspond to the plan type reported by the employer. Net differences between the reports of

respondents and firms can be seen from Table 1A by comparing the column totals with the row

totals. Although 88.1 percent of firm reports in the 1983 SCF indicate coverage by a DB plan only,

58.9 percent of respondent reports indicate coverage by a DB plan only. Even adjusting for the

DKs, dividing 58.9 by .836, the fraction with a DB plan only is lower in the respondent data at 70.5

percent. Moreover, the fraction with both types of plans is also much higher in the respondent data,

with 17.3 percent of respondents (20.7 percent of respondents who identified a plan type)

suggesting they are covered by both types of plans, but only 3.5 percent of firm documents

indicating coverage by both types of plans.

       The number of respondents who thought they had a DC plan only corresponds rather well

with firm reports of DC plan only. Adjusting the 7.4 percent figure in column 2, row 4 of Table 1A

for the fraction who answered DK, 8.9 percent of respondents who answered said they had a DC

plan only. According to matched employer reports, as seen in row 2, column 5, 8.5 percent had a

DC plan only. Moreover, adding the total of respondents who said they had a DB plan, either

because they had a DB plan only or both types, the fraction of respondents who report a plan type

who have a DB plan [(58.9 + 17.3)/.836 = 91.1] is very close to the fraction whose employers

reported they had a DB plan (91.6). The major difference is that the number of respondents who

report any DC plan [(7.4 + 17.3)/.836 = 29.5] greatly exceeds the 12 percent with a DC plan in the

firm data. The source of the discrepancy is the very high number with both types of plans in the

respondent data compared to the firm reports.

       The diagonal of Table 1A includes those cases where the respondent and firm both report

the same plan type. Along the diagonal, plan type reported in respondent data matches plan type in

some type of disagreement between the two indicators of plan type. Summing the remaining off

diagonal elements of the table, 23.9 percent of the cases have misidentified their plan type.9

       As seen in Table 1B, at a time when most people had a DB plan, most people who could

answer questions about plan type told interviewers they had a DB plan when their employer said

they had one, and told interviewers they had a DC plan when employer data suggested they had one.

Thus in Table 1B, only 4.5 percent of those whose employers’ documents said they had a DB plan

only reported they had a DC plan only. Of the 8.5 percent of respondents whose employer

documents said they had a DC plan only, as seen in column 2, row 2, 36.7 percent of them agreed,

with another 10.2 of them suggesting they had both a DB and a DC plan. Although 28.6 percent

(column 1, row 2) of those whose employers reported they had a DC plan only reported having a

DB plan only, that difference represents only 2.4 percent of all those with a pension.

       Now consider more recent data from the Health and Retirement Study. We begin with HRS

data from 1992, covering a population born from 1931 to 1941 during a period where there has been

an obvious decline in the prevalence of defined benefit plans. Comparing Tables 1A and 2A, the

growth in defined contribution plans is obvious. According to the employer data from 1992, 52

percent (column 5 of Table 2A, sum of rows 2 and 3) of all respondents reported a DC plan, either

held alone or in combination with a DB plan. This compares to 12 percent with a DC plan (Table

1A, column 5, rows 2 plus 3) in 1983. Note that the over fifty HRS population, with greater union

and manufacturing employment, would be expected to have a larger fraction of its population with a

DB plan, and a smaller fraction of its population with a DC plan. Nevertheless, the strong trend to



9
  Even though a large number of observations fall off the main diagonal, the instrument asks most
of those with a DB plan about the details of the plan, and asks many of those with a DC plan about
the details of a DC plan. So 91.6 percent (88.1 +3.5) of employer documents reported coverage by
a DB plan, while 72.9 (55.2+1.2+15.1+1.4) percent of respondents whose employer reported a DB
plan also reported coverage by a DB plan, amounting to 87.2 (72.9/.836) percent of those who
reported a plan type.

                                                                                                  10
DC plans is obvious even given a comparison with the earlier SCF data covering the full age range

of pension covered workers.

       In 1992 the fraction of DK responses in the HRS was 2 percent. This compares with a DK

level of 16.4 percent recorded in the SCF survey from nine years earlier. One reason for the higher

DK frequency in the SCF data may be its younger population.

       Comparing row with column totals in Table 1A and then Table 2A, while in 1983 there were

systematic discrepancies between the frequencies of reports of different plan types by respondents

and employers, in 1992 there are no such discrepancies. In 1983, self reports of DB plans fell

below firm reports, and self reports of coverage by both types of plans exceeded firm reports. In the

1992 HRS data, the overall distributions of plan type, DB only, DC only and both, are similar

whether reported by respondents or firms. Shares with any DB or any DC are also similar.10

Observations


10
   There appears to be little overall disagreement in the average plan type reported by respondents
and their employers in 1992. In Table 2A, 48 percent of provider reports indicate a DB plan only
(row 1, column 5), roughly the same total (46 percent) as in respondent reports (row 4, column 1).
The fraction with a DC plan only (row 2, column 5) is 21 percent in the firm data, and 24 percent
(column 2, row 4) in the respondent data. The fraction found with any DC plan in the employer
data in 1992 (column 5, rows 2 plus 3) is the same as the fraction found in respondent reports (row
4, columns 2 plus 3). Similarly, 79 percent of employer reports indicate coverage by a DB plan,
either via coverage by a DB plan only (row 1, column 5), or by both a DB and a DC plan (row 3,
column 5), while 74 percent of respondent reports suggest coverage by a DB plan either alone or in
addition to a DC plan (row 4, column 1 plus column 3).

                                                                                                  11

       Turning to the question of how often the respondent and employer reports of plan type agree

for a given respondent, a larger number of responses fall in off diagonal elements in 1992 than in

1983, signaled less agreement in each matched pair of reports in the latter year. Thus from Table

2A, only 49 percent of responses lie along the main diagonal in 1992, vs. 60 percent in 1983.

       The extent of overall disagreement in 1992 between employers and respondents appears

noticeable when we condition on provider (employer) responses, and ask how well respondents’

answers agree. From Table 2B, row 1, column 2, among those whose firm report indicates a DB

plan only, 15 percent of respondents report a DC plan only. Among those with a firm report of a

DC plan only, 26 percent report a DB plan only (row 2, column 1). In row 2, column 2, 18 percent

of respondents whose employer documents report both types of plans instead report having a DC

plan only. Most of the rest reported a DB plan only, with only 35 percent of those respondents

whose firms reported both a DB and a DC plan reporting having both a DB and a DC plan, in row 3,

column 3.

       Moving to a more recent date when DC pensions have become even more prevalent, Table 3

shows the distribution of plan type reported in 2004 by respondents in the core of the HRS and

gleaned from firm documents. By 2004, employer provided plan descriptions, which as of this

writing are only available for 790 cases working in the private sector, reflect the very strong trend to


                                                                                                     12
defined contribution plans.11 Only thirty eight percent of the private sector cases with at least one

plan description and/or a statement from respondents’ current pension plan(s) are defined benefit,

either held as DB plans alone (17 percent, from row 1, column 5), or in combination with a DC plan

(21 percent, from row 3, column 5).12

       From Table 3A, in 2004, as in 1983, we observe systematic differences in the average plan

type reported between respondents and their employers. In total, from column 5, row 1, 17 percent

of provider reports indicate a DB plan only, while 25 percent of respondent reports (column 1, row

4) indicate coverage by a DB plan only. Although 62 percent of provider reports (row 2, column 5)

suggest coverage by a DC plan only, 52 percent of respondents (row 4, column 2) indicate coverage

by a DC plan only. Since 20 percent of the respondent reports (row 4, column 3), and 21 percent of

the firm reports (row 3, column 5), indicate coverage by both types of plans, the difference between

respondent and firm reports lies in the overstatement of those with a DB plan, and corresponding

understatement of the fraction with a DC plan, by respondents. Altogether, 38 percent of firm

reports indicate coverage by a DB plan, either exclusively (row 1, column 5) or in combination with

a DC plan (row 3, column 5), while 45 percent of respondent reports indicate coverage by a DB

plan (row 4, column 1 plus row 4, column 3).




11
   In the 2004 survey, there are 3685 cases who reported being included in one or more pension
plan(s) through their current employment. As of the present time, employer plan descriptions and
respondent’s statements or plan descriptions have been roughly matched for 797 (523+329-55) of
those respondents. Thus, this exercise begins with about 22% (797/3685) of respondents reporting a
pension in the current job. Plans for government employees are not included in the data.
12
   Although half the plans held by members of retirement age cohorts who are working full time are
still defined benefit, fully half of all defined benefit plans are held by public employees. Once the
pension plans for government workers are matched, we expect that almost half the respondents with
a pension in 2004 will be covered by a DB plan, corresponding to the share of plans that are DB
reported by respondents.

                                                                                                        13

* Employer data includes plans processed as of May, 2006.

       In 2004, almost two thirds (62 percent) of the observations lie along the main diagonal,

indicating a higher number of cases where respondents and their employers agree as to the plan

type. This is somewhat better than the situation in 1983, and much better than the situation with

HRS data in the first year of the survey, 1992. Only 3 percent of respondents report they do not

know their plan type.

       Other discrepancies are reported in Table 3B. Of those whose firm reports coverage by a

DC plan only, 14 percent of respondents report coverage by a DB plan only, and 14 percent report

coverage by both a DB and a DC plan (row 2, columns 1 plus 3). Among those whose firm reports




                                                                                                    14
a DB plan only, 13 percent report coverage by a DC plan only (row 1, column 2), while 20 percent

report coverage by both types of plans (row 1, column 3).

       Table 4 summarizes a number of the key findings over the three surveys.

1. The trend from defined benefit to defined contribution plans is reflected in the values from

employer produced plan descriptions seen for those respondents who report having a pension and

have matched employer pension plan descriptions. Row 1 indicates the decline in the proportion of

respondents with matched plan descriptions holding defined benefit plans only, from 88.1 percent of

plans held by pension covered workers of all ages in the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, to 48

percent and 17 percent of all pension covered workers with matched employer plans in the Health

and Retirement Study in 1992 and 2004 respectively. Row 2 shows the corresponding increase in

the proportion of respondents with defined contribution plans from 8.5 percent in the 1983 Survey

of Consumer Finances to 62 percent in the 2004 Health and Retirement Study, while Row 3 shows

the fraction holding both a DB and a DC plan, with an increase from 3.5 percent to 21 percent

between the 1983 sample of all ages, and the 2004 HRS sample of older workers only. Again,

because these samples are selected to include only those respondents with matched employer data,

and because the SCF and HRS contain respondents of different ages, these figures are meant to

provide baseline indications of reports, rather than the basis for calculating trends over these years.

2. The fraction of respondents who don’t know their plan type is lower in later years (Table 4, line

4). Some of the difference probably reflects the younger age of the population in the 1983 SCF data

than in the HRS data collected in later years.

appears to increase over time. The findings from 1983 through 2004 raise questions about one

hypothesis for explaining systematic disagreement between respondent and firm reports of plan

type. To the extent that secondary DC plans are more difficult to collect from employers than DB

plans, it might be argued that the frequency of DC plans is systematically understated in employer

data. But the patterns of discrepancies are uneven. Moreover, in 2004 we find that coverage by DB

plans is over-reported by respondents, while coverage by DC plans is under-reported by

respondents, relative to the distributions in employer produced plan descriptions.

4. Rows 6, 7 and 8 take the report from the employer pension plan description as correct, and

compare the probability of DB only, DC only and Both plan types being reported by the respondent

with the corresponding probability from firm reports. There are no consistent patterns in these data

indicating either that the degree of over or understatement is consistent over time. Rather, when DB

plans are the dominant plan, as in 1983, the frequency of DB only is understated by respondents,

while in the period when DC is the dominant plan type, the frequency of DC only is understated, as

in 2004.

5. Those whose firm reported they had a DB plan were less likely to claim erroneously that they had

a DC plan in 1983 (column 1, rows 9 and 10) than in 2004. In 2004, with the DC as the dominant

type of plan, those whose firm reported a DB plan only reported with greater frequency (in column

3, rows 9 and 10), they had a DC plan only or both types of plans than were reported in 1983.

6. In 1983, when DB was the dominant type of plan, those who worked for firms reporting their

plan was DC only were much more likely to report that they had a DB plan (column 1, row 11) than




                                                                                                    17
was the case for those who worked for a firm reporting DC only in 2004 (column 3, row 11), when

DC was the dominant type of plan.

       These respondent errors in reporting are substantial. They are sufficiently complex, and

vary enough over time, that they are not easy to characterize or remove. The complexity of the

misclassifications by respondents does suggest important changes for the HRS. There will be an

increased efforts to collect employer provided pension plan descriptions, and beginning with the

2008 respondent survey there will be an increased effort to condition as few questions as possible

on respondent reports of pension plan type.

IV. Difference over time in respondent and firm reports

       One way to address reporting consistency is to consider reports over time only by those who

indicate there has been no change in their plan. Accordingly, we turn to HRS respondents who

reported in 1994, 1996 and 1998 that their pension plans did not change from the previous wave.

Thus according to these respondents, their plans were identical in 1992 and 1998, two years when

employer plan reports are also available. Here we examine both changes in self reports of plan

type, and in firm reports of plan type over the 1992 to 1998 period.

       For this exercise, it is important to determine whether those who report their plans are

unchanged over time between 1992 and 1998 have a similar distribution of plan type to all those

with a pension in 1992. Comparisons indicate there is a close similarity in the fractions with DB

only, DC only and both types of plans in the two samples.13



13
  In Table 2A, where data for 1992 were reported, the percentages of respondents reporting a DB,
DC and both types of plans was 46, 24 and 28 percent respectively. In Table 5A, where plan type is
reported among respondents who reported their plan type has not changed between 1992 and 1998,
the proportions of respondents with DB, DC and both types of plans in 1992 are 45, 25 and 28
percent respectively. Also note that the sub-sample of employer reported plan types for respondents
who reported the same pension in 1992 and 1998 in Table 5C matches the distribution of employer
reported plan types in Table 2A for the larger sample of all respondents with matched pensions in
1992. Thus in Table 2A, the percentages reported in employer data of DB, DC and both types of

                                                                                                     18
       If respondent reports were correct and plans matched correctly, there should be no change in

plan type for anyone in this sample. Given the discrepancies we found in the previous section, it is

not surprising to find that reported plan types vary over time for a significant minority of

respondents who report no change in their plan. Moreover, when respondents report a different plan

type from the one reported in 1992, they often misreport the nature of the change.

       There are a number of possible reasons why the reported plan type changed even though a

respondent said there was no change. The respondent may be wrong about the plan not having

changed. Or despite reporting correctly that the plan has not changed, the respondent may

misidentify the plan type in one or another of the two years. A third possibility is that the

respondent may have a defined contribution plan, but may participate in some years and not in

others, failing to report plan type as DC in a year when not participating.

       To avoid problems where the report of the most important plan changes over time because

the respondent does not consistently value the plans, that is, in one year considers the DB plan to be

the most important, and in another year considers the DC plan to be the most important, we classify

plans as DB only, DC only and both. So if a person has both types of plans in different periods, but

considers the defined benefit plan to be the most important in one period and the DC plan to be the

most important in the other, we tabulate whether the respondent has reported on two plans, and do

not take account of which one was listed as most important in each period.

       By contrasting the changes for the respondent sample and the firm sample, the evidence

suggests that plans have changed in many more cases than respondents think. Table 5A shows the

distribution of self reported plan types between 1992 and 1998 for those who report no change in

plan type. Along the diagonal, we see that 58 percent of respondents report the same plan type in

1998 as they did in 1992 (32+16+10). From row 1 of Table 5B, among those who reported having

plans in 1992 are 48, 21 and 31 percent respectively. In Table 5C, the corresponding figures are 48,
19, and 33 percent.

                                                                                                    19
a DB only in 1992, 72 percent continue to report a DB only in 1998, 16 percent report a DC plan

only, and 11 percent report both. Thus there is a reported gain in DC plans only, replacing DB

plans only, and an 11 percent increase in the frequency of both types of plans.

         Since these changes are in the direction of trends in plan type, they cannot be dismissed out

of hand. However, for the 25 percent of respondents reporting a plan type who reported a DC plan

only in 1992, as seen from Table 5B, row 2, 22 percent of respondents report that their plan type

switched back to a DB plan only, and another 14 percent claim that they gained a DB plan as their

firm adopted both types of plans. Yet we know there was almost no adoption of new DB pension

plans after the mid-1980s (Ippolito and Thompson, 2000). Similarly, from row 3 of Table 5B, 50

                                                                                                     20
percent of those who claimed to have both a DB and a DC plan in 1992, claim to have lost the DC

plan in the intervening six years, while 15 percent of those with both types of plans claim to have

lost their DB plan over the intervening period.

       Now consider the changes in employer reported plan type for this sample, who claim their

plans were unchanged over the period. From Table 5C, only 55 percent (14+16+25) of the

observations lie along the diagonal, suggesting that plan type changed for the remaining 45 percent

of the sample. The changes found in this table, and examined further in Table 5D, are much more

consistent with what is known about trends in pensions over the period. Thus while only 30 percent

of those with a DB plan only in 1992 have employer reports suggesting they are covered by a DB

plan only in 1998, the reason is that 64 percent of them now are covered by both types of plans.

More importantly, among those with a DC plan only in 1992, their employer provided data suggests

they are covered by a DC plan only in 83 percent of the cases. In sharp contrast with the self

reported data in Table 5B, where 36 percent of respondents with a DC plan only reported gaining a

DB plan over the intervening period, only 18 percent (5+13) of those whose employer reported they

had a DC plan only in 1992 were seen to gain a DB plan over the six years. Although more in line

with known trends, the gain in DB plans in the private sector among the employer data does suggest

some difference in matching procedures over time, or in the number of plan descriptions provided

by employers over time. Of perhaps greater interest, according to this sample of respondents, there

was no change in their plans between 1992 and 1998, yet the changes observed in employer

reported plan types mirror the strong changes observed among general holders of pensions.

       We also find discrepancies when we consider results for a sample of 48 respondents who

reported no change in their pension for the entire period between 1992 and 2004 and have matched

plan data for both 1992 and 2004 surveys, and for a comparable sample between 1998 and 2004.

         To summarize, we find misreporting by respondents on two fronts. They report their plan

types have not changed when they have, and respondents misreport the types of plans that they

hold. Of the respondents who reported no change in their pension for the period of 1992 to 1998

and have matched plan documents, 58 percent of respondent reports indicate the same plan type(s)

                                                                                                   22
in those two periods. According to their plan documents, 55 percent of them had the same plan type

in both years. Moreover, the changes observed in the employer sample correspond more closely to

trends in pensions in the 1990s found in administrative data such as Form 5500 data from the

Department of Labor, while those reported by respondents do not.

       For the corresponding periods 1992 to 2004 and 1998 to 2004, the matches were better. For

the respondent reported plan types, among those who reported no change in their pensions, the plan

types are the same over the period in 62 percent and 68 percent of the cases respectively. For the

plan documents, the same plan types are reported in 72 percent and 63 percent of the cases over the

two time periods respectively.14

V. Comparison with Payroll data from a sample produced by Watson Wyatt

       There are a number of potential problems that may result from the process of matching firm

reports of plan type to the covered workers in the HRS sample. Although the Summary Plan

Descriptions (SPDs) describe the characteristics of covered workers, and HRS asks respondents

about these characteristics, e.g., hourly or weekly employee, union member, white collar or blue

collar, history of employment and coverage at the firm, there is always a chance for slippage in

matching a plan to an individual. Moreover, despite requests that firms send HRS all their plans,

they may not have supplied a full set of matched plans.15

       Using payroll data matched with respondent reports of plan type can help to determine

whether there are strong consequences from these limitations on the pension matching process used

14
   Percentages are not additive due to varying sample sizes over the periods.
15
   Even if the matches obtained were perfect, plan matches are obtained for only two thirds of HRS
respondents who indicate they are covered by a pension. This means that when generating
descriptive data that apply to the overall population, pension plan type has to be imputed for one
third of respondents. Moreover, a major reason for trying to improve identification of plan type is
to ensure that the respondent is being asked questions that are appropriate for whatever plan type is
covering the individual. Employer data cannot help with the matching process. They are not
obtained until a year after the respondent survey, and thus cannot be used to determine which plan
type to quiz the respondent about.

                                                                                                     23
by the HRS. HRS does not have payroll data for its covered respondents. But the Watson Wyatt

Company has made available a matched sample with both payroll and respondent survey data.

Because the payroll data reveal the worker’s pension plans with certainty, comparisons of

respondent reports of plan type with the plan types reported in the payroll data provides a reliable

indication of the extent of misreporting of plan type by respondents. Since we find the same degree

of misreporting by respondents whether the baseline from employer data is taken to be Summary

Plan Descriptions collected from respondent employers, or the payroll data collected by Watson

Wyatt, the suggestion is that most of the discrepancy between respondent and firm produced data is

due to misreports by the respondent.

       Steve Nyce (2005) of Watson Wyatt has followed this methodology by matching payroll

data from the Human Resource Departments of a number of firms with data from pension

questionnaires administered to workers covered by those plans. Moreover, he has at our request

reformatted his findings to allow a direct comparison with Tables 3 above, which relates employer

and respondent data for the 2004 HRS.16

16
   Some differences between the Watson Wyatt data and the HRS data should be noted. Although
some analysis with the Watson Wyatt data suggests that age is not a dominating factor, the Watson
Wyatt data cover a full age range while the HRS data cover those over the age of 50. With regard
to the definitions of coverage, there is only a slight difference between the Watson Wyatt and HRS
data. We classify the following two cases as DK, while Watson Wyatt data classify them as DC or
DB respectively.
Have DB Have DC
1. DK           Yes
2. Yes          DK
Our categories for HRS data are DB only, DC only and both. So if a person says DK to either DB
or DC, we can’t tell whether they have both or not, and classify the response as DK.
        The two data sets also treat cash balance plans differently, and cash balance plans are more
likely to be found in the Watson Wyatt sample of large firms. HRS treats hybrid plans as DC (they
involve an account) while the Watson Wyatt data separate out 401k and 403b, call them DC, and
classify hybrid plans as DB. Thus in the Watson Wyatt sample, according to Appendix Table A.1,
73 percent of respondents have a DB plan, which includes hybrid plans, while 28 percent of the
sample has a hybrid plan. So 38 percent of Wyatt DB plans are hybrid. It is clear that there are
more DB plans in the Watson Wyatt sample of firms than in the HRS, and that the HRS is much
less successful in identifying hybrid plans in its sample. Note the possibility that with respondents

                                                                                                       24
       In Table 3A, 62 percent of HRS observations are on the main diagonal where respondent

reports match firm reports. In Table 6A, the comparable figure for the Watson Wyatt sample is 65

percent.17 Because there are overall differences in the samples of covered workers, it is useful to

focus on respondent reports of plan type conditional on the plan type reported in firm provided data.

When we do that, the two tables match remarkably well.

with no pension coverage – 20 to 64.

in the HRS sample all over the age of 50, many more in the HRS will have been grandfathered into
their old DB plans than would be the case for the younger Watson Wyatt sample.
        There also are other differences between the populations surveyed. The Watson Wyatt
sample is not nationally representative. Moreover, voluntary respondent participation is lower in
the Watson Wyatt sample than in the HRS. Those who participate may be better informed about
their pensions than those who refuse to take part in the survey, creating another source of bias.
17
   In the HRS data, 17 percent of the respondent matched, firm reported plan types are DB only, 62
percent are DC only, and 21 percent are both. In the Watson Wyatt sample, 3 percent of respondent
matched plan types from payroll data are DB only, 26 percent are DC only, and 70 percent are both.
Thus 38 percent of the HRS firm reports indicate coverage by any DB plan, while for 73 percent of
the respondents in the Wyatt sample, the payroll data suggest coverage by any DB plan. Hybrid
plans are not nearly numerous enough to account for this difference. Similarly, in the HRS sample,
83 percent of firm reports involve any DC, while in the Wyatt sample, 96 percent of reports involve
any DC.

         For convenience the comparisons are summarized in Table 6C. The bottom line from this

table is that when respondents’ reports of pension plan type disagree with the reports by their

employers, the error is in the respondents’ reports. Among those with a firm report of a DB only, in

the HRS, the percentages of respondents reporting DB, DC and both are 65, 13 and 20. In the

Watson Wyatt data, the percentages reporting DB, DC and both are 62, 16 and 10, which when

adjusted for the additional 10 percent DK in the Watson Wyatt sample, come relatively close to the

HRS values. For those whose firms report DC only, the comparable fractions in the HRS are 14, 70

and 14, while the corresponding figures in the Wyatt sample are 2, 68 and 24. There is a larger

tendency in the Watson Wyatt sample to mistakenly pick DC only, rather than to mistakenly pick

                                                                                                   26
DB only, as in the HRS. The largest discrepancy is in the fraction whose employers say they have

both types of plans who report coverage by both. In the HRS, 37 percent of those whose employers

report both also report both. In the Watson Wyatt data, when the employer reports both, 64 percent

of respondents report both.

       It is obvious that the findings from the HRS and Watson Wyatt survey are highly

complementary. Much of the discrepancy remains between respondent and firm identification of

plan type, even when the match is perfect between the respondent and the employer provided plan

description. The comparisons between the Watson Wyatt and HRS findings indicate that most of

the discrepancy between firm and respondent reported data results from errors or misunderstanding

by respondents. This suggests that findings to date with HRS data are valid. Accordingly, findings

with Watson Wyatt payroll data suggest that HRS data can be used to estimate and model the

effects of imperfect knowledge in analyses of retirement and saving.

       For the first time, results based on Watson Wyatt data also provide an indication of

underreporting of pension coverage. HRS does not try to collect plan descriptions from those who

report not having a pension. Findings with Watson Wyatt data suggest that under reporting of

pension coverage amounts to about 5 percent. (The tables above remove this 5 percent.)

VI. Plan type in the full respondent panel.

       In this section we use the HRS panel to expand our analysis of changes in reported plan type

by respondents who report their plans have remained unchanged. 18 The data allow us to consider



18
   Changes in plan type observed in panel data among those who report no change in their pensions
tell us how those in relatively stable employment situations perceive their plan type over time. The
remainder of pension covered workers, those with pensions that change between waves, may be in
less stable employment, may be located in firms that have switched to cash balance or other hybrid
plans, may be covered by plans that are more suitable for job changers, or their plans may differ for
other reasons from the plans of those who remain the same job with an unchanging pension. There
also is a question about how knowledge or learning about one’s pensions is affected by having
experienced a recent plan change. Those whose plans are unchanged from period to period may

                                                                                                   27
  both consistency across adjoining waves, as well as cumulative consistency over a number of

  waves. Once again it will be apparent that many people who claim to have unchanging pension

  plans nevertheless change their reported plan types over time.

  have a longer period to learn about their pension. On the other hand, those with a recent pension
  change may have just recently been made more aware of their plan type by their employer.

                                                                                                      28
       Table 7 documents some of the inconsistencies that arise in the panel among respondent

reports of number of plans and plan type, for a sample that reports their pension plans have not

changed since their previous interview. In this table we see differences over two consecutive

interviews. Comparing adjoining waves, typically a fifth to a third of those reporting no change in

their pensions nevertheless report a different number of plans or plan type than they reported in the

previous wave. For example, row 1, column 2 of Table 7 indicates that there were 2,771 cases who

reported how many pensions they held in Wave 2 of the HRS. Out of this group, there were 752

cases (27%) who reported a different number of plans from the number they had reported in their

Wave 1 interview. Similarly, row 1, column 3 shows that there were 1,790 cases who reported

having at least one DB plan in Wave 2. Of those, 329 (18 percent) reported not having any DB

plans in Wave 1. Row 1, column 4 shows the number of respondents (1,110 cases) reporting at

least one DC plan in Wave 2. There were 251 cases out of the 1,110 (or 23 percent) who did not

report any DC plans in Wave 1, even though they reported their plan was unchanged since Wave 1.

       Cumulative changes since Wave 1 are reported in Table 8. For example, row 5, column 3

indicates 383 respondents in Wave 6 were working at the same employment since Wave 1,

reporting each period there had been no change in their pension since the last period. Out of this

group, 206 cases reported having at least one DB plan in Wave 6 (excluding DK/RFs) and 125 of

them (61%) reported a plan type that did not include a DB plan in at least one previous wave. Row

5, column 4 shows the number of respondents (174) with at least one DC plan in Wave 6 who

reported no change in their pension since Wave 1. Out of this group, there are 112 cases (64%) who

did not report any DC plans in one or more of the previous waves.

                                                                                          30
        The cumulative results show the extent of misreporting in the panel. By Wave 8, despite

having reported no change from Wave 1 to Wave 8, two thirds to three quarters of respondents who

consistently report no change in their plans over the entire period nevertheless are reporting a

different plan type in at least one previous wave than they reported in Wave 8, and 43 percent are

reporting a different number of plans. One simply cannot take a report that the plan has not

changed at face value, especially if trying to understand the evolution of a respondent’s pension

over the life cycle.

        To generalize the results in the panel, we have compared respondents’ reports of certain

pension characteristics as they vary across seams. A seam is defined as a connection between two

waves, starting with Wave 1, over which respondents report no change in their employment and in

their pension plans’ rules. One seam is reported if there is no change in the pension between Wave

1 (respondent’s first interview) and Wave 2 or respondent’s next interview if Wave 2’s interview

was skipped. Over two seams there is no change in the pension from Wave 1 through the next two

interviews. For three seams there is no change from Wave 1 through the next three interviews; four

seams from Wave 1 through the next four interviews; five seams from Wave 1 through the next five

interviews; six seams from Wave 1 through the next six interviews; and seven seams from Wave 1

through the next seven interviews.

        The number of seams could be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, where 0 indicates a respondent

reported a change in plan rules or change in the job after the Wave 1 interview; 1 indicates no plan

change between the first and second interview, but that the third wave differs from the first, and 7

indicates the plan did not change over the life of the survey; from Wave 1 to Wave 8.

        Each cell in Table 9 indicates the percent of observations with a given number of seams

who reported the indicated number of matches in plan type across those seams. The overall sample

for the table includes 4345 respondents who reported coverage by a pension in Wave 1. The


                                                                                                       31
number of seams is the number of waves starting in 1992 over which the respondent reported no

change in pension plan.

       The first row of the table indicates the zero seam category, where 1491 out of 4345 cases did

not report having the same pension in the next interview after Wave 1. Therefore, all (100%) of the

cases had a zero match for their plan type. An observation fell in the one seam category if

respondents reported the same pension and no change in the pensions across first two waves. Two

seams are reported if the respondent had the same pension in the first three interviews, and the

pension remained unchanged. In 683 out of 4345 cases the respondent reported the same pension in

three consecutive interviews. i.e. reported their plan did not change from the last interview in Wave

2 and Wave 3. About half of this group (49%) consistently reported the same plan type in all 3

interviews and about 31% in 2 interviews. About 19% reported a different plan type each of the

three times they were interviewed.

       The six seams category includes those who were interviewed in all seven waves and had

reported no pension change in any of the interviews. About 24% of this group consistently reported

the same plan type in all seven waves and another 14% across five of the six seams from Wave 1 to

Wave 7. About 2% of the respondents did not have a match in reported plan type across any seam,

although they may have reported the same plan type in different waves that were not adjoining.

       These inconsistencies buttress the evidence from comparisons between plan types reported

by respondents and in matched SPDs obtained from employers that there is considerable error in

reported plan type, so that one cannot rely solely on respondent reports of plan type as an error free

indicator of what type of plan is held by the respondent. While they add to the weight of the

evidence, they are not sufficient to establish that the respondent is responsible for any discrepancy.

       A question arises because the plan type used for any wave is the type of the most important

        four fifths of the cases. Nevertheless, if the respondent with two plans is well aware of the plan

        type, but feels that a plan that was once considered secondary is now of greater value than the

        primary plan, one can see the reported plan type of the most important plan change between waves

        even though the respondent correctly reports there has been no change in the pension.

VII. Reliability of respondent reports before retirement and at retirement.

       Chan and Huff Stevens (2006) and Hurd and Rohwedder (2006) examine respondent

knowledge, and impute values for missing pensions respectively. The key assumption made by

each study is that people know the most about their pensions right after they leave their jobs.

According to this assumption, the closer a person is to retirement, the higher the expected level of

agreement that should be found between respondent and firm reports. Chan and Huff Stevens find

“Among those reporting pensions on a job that has just ended, almost one quarter indicated in the

previous wave that they did not have a pension on this job, while another 30 percent are inconsistent

in their pension type reports, didn’t know their pension type, or refused to answer the question.”

They also find that consistency in answering the plan type question increases by only one

percentage point between the ages of 50 and 60. Comparing reports of plan type between the wave

following job termination and each wave preceding job termination, they also find that “…

individuals are not likely to be more consistent in the wave immediately preceding job

termination.”19




       19
           Much of the analysis in Chan and Huff Stevens refers to measures of the value of the
pension. One can, however, question the accuracy of reported pension values obtained from
respondents just after they leave their job. Pension benefits reported by respondents before they
retire typically are estimated using the standard formula for a single annuity. For those who
annuitize benefits, typically those with a DB plan, pension value in retirement depends on the type
of annuity chosen. The amounts vary a great deal between a joint and survivor benefit, which for
married persons is required by law, compared to the single annuity reported when the benefit is not
yet in receipt. This may generate some of the differences observed between values reported pre-
and post- retirement. Moreover, annuities may differ for other reasons from those expected before
retirement, or analogously from the stated benefit contained in the SPD. For example, a person may
ask for a 10 or 20 year certain payment, which will reduce the benefit payments in retirement.


                                                                                                       34

*These are respondents who reported the same pension over the reported period and have all
required information available.
       To further examine this hypothesis, we use HRS data to compare respondent descriptions of

their plan upon leaving with corresponding employer plan descriptions. Comparisons are confined

to those who left their job between the time the plan description was collected from the firm and the

wave following that year.20 We use employer provided plan descriptions for the years 1992, 1998

and 2004. The sample of pension leavers is limited to those who left their jobs between 1992 and

1994, 1998 and 2000, and 2004 and 2006.

       In contrast to the assumption made by Chan and Huff Stevens and Hurd and Rohwedder, the

data in Table 10 suggest that the respondent does not do any better in identifying plan type in the

survey taken just after job termination than in previous surveys. That is, the percentage of cases

where the respondent’s report of plan type agrees with the employer’s report does not increase as

the job leaver approaches the date of leaving the plan. Nor is there greater agreement just after the

job leaver has terminated employment.

       VIII. Further Evidence from Interview Tapes and Module 6/7

Evidence From the Interview Tapes

   To further our understanding of the problems in reported plan type, we listened to 44 HRS

interviews covering the pension section, selected randomly. Our impressions from the tape

reinforce the conclusions reached from examining the data in the preceding sections, and provide

further insight into the reasons for respondent errors in reported plan type, and in other information

pertaining to their pensions. Some generalizations follow.




       20
          If the firm reports were collected at a different time than the respondent reports, and the
plan had changed in the mean time, this would reduce the degree of correspondence between
respondent and firm reports. Given the short period between respondent and firm reports, this
should have only a limited effect.


                                                                                                        36
   Respondents seemed to fall into three groups based on their knowledge of pension and

consistency in reporting their plan type. Well informed respondents knew their plan type/name

consistently in all three plan type questions and most of the other features of their plan. They

accounted for 26 percent of the interviews. We would call about 49 percent of the respondents

informed. Some of them knew the plan type and/or some of their plan features. The poorly

informed group accounted for 26 percent of the interviews and did not know their plan, or they

made contradictory responses or guessed answers.

   In general, respondents are more likely to know their plan name if it is a 401k. When

respondents know the name of their plan such as 401k, 403b, etc., it is not in terms of “DB/Type A”

or “DC/Type B”. Respondents who do not know their plan type may know other features of that

plan. A majority of respondents with a DB plan can identify it as a DB plan if a DB plan is defined

for them. Respondents may be confused about the number of their plans. This is true especially for

cases where there was both an own and an employer contribution. Respondents may be confused

about their coverage. Respondents whose company is being merged, whose plan is being frozen, or

who are not making any contributions may not answer they are included in a plan. Respondents do

their best to answer a question even if it is not relevant. A respondent with a DC plan may give a

value that s/he expects to receive at retirement.

   We also considered the quality of the interview. A majority of interviewers are well informed.

They know how to ask questions and how to probe when it’s needed. However, there are some

infrequent errors. In a couple of cases, the interviewer showed a lack of knowledge about the name

of plans. A few interviewers also had problems in deciding how to deal with the situation when a

respondent made contradictory responses. In one case, the interviewer clicked on a wrong plan

type, as evidenced by a discrepancy between the respondents answer and the recorded plan type in

the data for that observation.


                                                                                                     37
     Evidence from the HRS Pension Module

     With an eye toward developing a procedure to improve identification of plan type, in 2004 the

HRS administered a special supplement/module to the core survey inquiring about detailed pension

plan characteristics including their plan’s type or name21. In this module, in contrast to the core,

plan types were not defined, but respondents were asked if they knew the technical name or the type

of their plan.

   Seventy three percent of respondents reported they knew the plan name or the type of their most

important plan. About 49% of respondents (Table 11) who reported they know their most important

plan type, reported a 401k. For about 84% of respondents (Table 12) who reported having a 401k

only and had a matched plan, the plan document was DC only. Among respondents with a matched

DC plan only, about 80% of them (Table 13) reported a DC only. Among respondents who had a

matched DB plan only, about 42% of them (Table 13) reported a DB plan only. About 20% of

respondents with a matched DB plan only answer DK when asked their plan type. In contrast 5% of

respondents with a matched DC only answer DK when asked their plan type.

       These findings again suggest that respondents have a good deal of information about their

pensions, but that a number do not know their plan type. The method used in the module may

improve the accuracy of respondent answers. Nevertheless, it appears that respondent reports of

plan type will continue to be characterized by errors.

IX. Effects of asking questions pertaining to the wrong plan type.

       Much of this study has focused on the reasons for discrepancies between respondent and

firm reports of pension plan types, with a majority of the evidence pointing to reporting errors by

respondents. Before concluding, we wish to consider the consequences of this finding for one

approach to redesigning surveys such as the Health and Retirement Study. In particular, one might

ask whether it is possible to skip the step of identifying plan type altogether. Why shouldn’t

surveys simply ask all respondents all questions about pensions, whether the preponderance of

evidence suggests they have an account, or a DB plan?

       One answer is contained in Table 15, which is based on an experiment HRS conducted in

2006. People were deliberately asked questions appropriate for plan types they didn’t have. It

looks like respondents will move outside the current sequence to provide an answer, whether

appropriate or not.

       When respondents who report their plan is DB are asked for the account balance, 62 percent

of them provide an account balance, either directly, or indirectly in the form of brackets. To further

understand just what it means when someone who says they have a DB plan reports a plan balance,

we did a preliminary analysis for three groups.

       1. Respondents who have both a DB and DC. Among the respondents who reported their

plan was DB, the balance some of them supplied was appropriate for their second plan, which was

DC. More specifically, 14 out of 82 in the selected sample report the amount in their secondary DC

account when asked what their balance is in their primary DB account.

                                                                                                      41

* The 2006 data is from the early release version.

       2. Comparing the expected value of the benefit in 2006 with the value of the account

balances when a person with a DB is asked how much is in the account, we would expect to see the

account balance somewhere between ten and twenty times the expected yearly benefit. Again in a




                                                                                              42
selected sample, the ratios of account balance to expected yearly benefit range from less than 1 to

50. Many ratios are in the low single digits.

       3. Respondents who report different plan types in 2004 and 2006. 17 out of 59 of them

report a DB balance in 2006 that is very close to their DC balance in 2004.

       Should surveys ask all pension covered workers about their plan balance, users are going to

find it very difficult to interpret what the respondent is reporting when he reports a DB plan and

then a balance. In many cases, the report will simply reflect a misunderstanding, or will be the

result of the respondent assuming that a question that is not appropriate for a person having their

plan type really does make sense.

       As seen in Table 15, other responses are also likely to be error ridden when respondents are

asked questions appropriate for plan types they do not hold. Forty percent of respondents who

report they have a DB plan also report they receive quarterly reports on their pension when asked.

But quarterly reports are common for those who hold a DC plan, and much less common for those

with a DB plan. Forty nine percent of those who report their plan is DC indicate they will receive

lifetime benefits when asked, even though annuities are rare for DC plans and most benefits take the

form of an account balance that becomes available upon retirement. Fifty five percent even

reported an expected amount for the benefit (either directly or through brackets).

       Thus a survey that is designed to very carefully separate the question sequences between

different plans, trying hard to avoid any double counting, may hopelessly entangle certain answers

pertaining to different plans if plans are not separated according to plan type. Moreover, some of

the answers provided to irrelevant questions may simply be erroneous. Although many questions

can be asked regardless of plan type, one cannot entirely skip the process of determining plan type

before asking certain questions. By asking a respondent certain questions about the plan type s/he

did not report, one is inviting error in the response.


                                                                                                      43
X. Summary and Conclusions

       Respondent reports contain a good deal of useful information about their pensions. Watson

Wyatt data suggest that underreporting of plan coverage is not too severe a problem. Moreover, on

average, respondent reports do a good job of describing the overall distribution of pension plan

type. Thus respondent reports of plan type often indicate the same frequency of occurrence for

those with DB only, DC only or both plans as do employer data.

       However, our findings suggest there is a great deal of error in respondents’ reports of plan

type. Although much of this error is offsetting in the aggregate, so that the overall frequencies of

plan type are close to the values reported by employers, the errors have serious implications for

respondent knowledge and understanding of their pensions.

       Discrepancies between respondent and firm reports are found in cross section data, over

time, in panel data, and are confirmed to be present in a number of surveys. Thus we find that

reports by a third or more of respondents disagree with their employers’ reports as to what type of

pension they hold.

       Evidence developed in this paper shows that many people approaching retirement do not

understand what type of pension plan they have. Discrepancies between respondent and firm

reports might arise from errors in the firm reports. However, the evidence presented here suggests

that while the process of matching employer produced pension plan descriptions to survey

respondents is not error free, the employer provided data is a much more accurate indicator of

pension plan type than is respondent provided data.

   Findings for respondents who report that their plans have not changed run counter to the well

known trend toward defined contribution plans, and well documented evidence that firms have not

been adopting defined benefit plans. Our results also suggest that respondents have some difficulty

in determining which is their most important plan.


                                                                                                       44
   As DB plans take on more of the features of DC plans, morphing through cash balance or

related plans, and DC plans take on more of the characteristics of DB plans, offering opportunities

for annuitizing benefits, imposing defaults and participation requirements, it will be much harder for

analysts to clearly determine plan type, and less likely that respondents will understand and

correctly categorize their plans.

       Implications for survey design.

       Our findings suggest certain modifications in the design of surveys to reduce reporting error.

One suggestion arises from our finding that respondents misreport whether their plans have changed

over time. To save survey time, the Health and Retirement Study has conditioned the set of pension

questions asked in particular waves on whether the respondent reports a pension change since the

last wave of the survey. When the respondent reports no pension change, the set of questions asked

is truncated, and some responses from the previous wave are used. But if some of these plans have

changed, it is inappropriate to use answers from a previous wave.

       Another implication concerns the way that information about plan type is elicited. Plan type

will be more accurately identified by those who have defined contribution pensions if they are

simply asked what type of pension they have. In contrast, respondents with a DB plan will be more

accurate in reporting their plan type when the characteristics of a defined benefit plan are read to

them before they are asked about plan type. As a result of these findings, the 2008 version of the

Health and Retirement Study will ask respondents first if they know the name or type of plan they

have, and if so what it is. Then the definition of each plan type will be read to respondents and they

will be asked to identify plan type.

       Although respondent reports of plan type are subject to errors, and these errors sometimes

create systematic bias, we have also shown that respondent reports do contain a good deal of useful

information. Given the information content of respondent answers, alternative approaches to


                                                                                                       45
identifying plan type within surveys become less attractive. For example, we have shown

elsewhere (Gustman and Tabatabai, 2006) that it would not help the situation much to try to identify

plan type from respondent reports of characteristics that are disproportionately associated with

either a DB or with a DC plan – e.g., whether a respondent receives a report about the plan on a

quarterly basis, whether the plan pays lifetime benefits, and others.

       The evidence also shows that providing a person with the opportunity to report on the wrong

plan type will invite the individual to present erroneous information. That means one cannot simply

ask every person all questions, those pertaining to the plan type they have, and those pertaining to

the plan type they do not have. Each time a person is asked a question pertaining to a different plan

type from their own, the effect is to introduce complex errors that are difficult to unscramble.

       One might suggest that survey questions should use information on plan type from firm

reported data. However, firm reported pension data are available with a lag. They can only be

collected from firms or the web once the main survey is completed. If they are to be collected

indirectly from government sources such as Department of Labor files containing attachments to

form 5500 data, an additional lag is created by any delays in the release of the government data.

Moreover, once plan descriptions are obtained, it takes time to process them. Consequently, firm

reported data are not available on a timely basis for use in a survey.

   Implications for further research on pensions.

   This paper has focused only on issues pertaining to plan type. One next step is to build on our

earlier work (Gustman and Steinmeier, 1989, 2004) and recent contributions by Rohwedder (2003),

Chan and Huff Stevens (2006) and others to consider the quality of self reported vs. firm reported

information on plan features, such as ages of eligibility for retirement, and various measures of plan

value and plan incentives.

   Respondent reporting error is a major concern, but there are more important implications of our

findings than just the existence of misreporting of pension plan type. To the extent that the

misreporting results because respondents do not understand their pension plans, models of pension

plan determination, saving and retirement would have to be modified to explain who does and who

does not understand their pension, what form misunderstanding takes, and what misunderstanding

implies for behavior. Thus to fully understanding retirement and saving behavior, knowledge must

be treated as an endogenous outcome. Having to jointly explain knowledge, retirement and saving

greatly complicates life cycle and related models, but the evidence presented here and related

evidence suggests that we must understand the role of imperfect knowledge if we are to understand

the behavior and policies influencing retirement and saving.

       Employer plan documents were collected from three different sources. Respondents who

reported having a pension provided the names and addresses of their employers. These employers

were contacted, or plan descriptions were collected from postings on the web for government

employees. In addition, in 2004 respondents requested pension documents from their employer

(Experiment Y).

Private and Public Employers:

       For respondents working for private employers, the employers were contacted directly and

their summary plan descriptions were requested. In total, employers of 582 respondents who work

for private employers sent in at least one plan description. Out of this group, 523 cases are matched

with at least one plan and 36 cases could not be matched right away. They will be addressed by

HRS staff at a later time. The remaining 23 cases had at least one plan description, but were not

matched.

       The plan descriptions for workers employed by the federal, state, and many local

government agencies are now available on the web. The federal and state plans and plans that state

governments maintain for workers employed by their local governments are downloaded. Then

these employers are contacted to confirm which of the plans obtained from the web are relevant to

the particular public employer and if they are offering any additional plans that are not on their

website. In cases where additional plans (mainly a DC) were offered those plans are requested also.

At this point, none of the government employees are matched with a high degree of accuracy and

they are not included in the data.

Appendix 2: Findings for pension changes between 1992 and 2004, and 1998 and 2004.

       This appendix provides additional results to those reported in Section IV. In that section,

findings on changes in plan type in respondent and firm reports were analyzed for respondents who

indicated their plans had not changed between 1992 and 1998. This section provides additional

results covering the periods 1998 to 2004 and 1992 to 2004.

       Appendix Table 1A begins with respondent reports in 1992 and 2004 for respondents who

reported no change in plan type over that period. In Appendix Table 1A, 62 percent of the

observations lie along the main diagonal. That means that plan type changed for the remaining 38

percent of the sample even though they had reported no change in their pension. Of the plan types

identified in the 2004 plan documents, 72 percent of the sample was in agreement with the plan

type reported in the provider reports in 1992 (Appendix Table 1C). Among respondents who had

reported DC only in 1992, in 2004, in Appendix Table 1B, 19 percent of them reported their plan is

DB only, again an unlikely outcome given the trend from DB to DC plans. Another 5 percent

gained a DB plan because their plan was converted from a DC plan in 1992 to a combination plan in

2004. In contrast, in Appendix Table 1D, no set of provider reports indicated a transition from DC

only to DB only between 1992 and 2004, and only 6 percent of observations imply a transition from

DC only to both over that period.

       Next Table 1E considers respondent reports of plan type for a sample that includes

observations where respondents reported the same pension between 1998 and 2004. About 68% of

them reported the same plan type in both survey years. Appendix Table 1G reports analogous

results for the sample’s employer plan documents. According to the plan documents, 63 percent of

respondents had the same plan type in 1998 and 2004, so that there was a disagreement in plan type

from the plan document in about 37 percent of the cases in this sample. Appendix Table 1H shows

that 19 percent of the sample who had a DB plan only in 1998 had plan documents that showed in


                                                                                                     50
2004 they had a DC plan only. According to their plan documents, another 37 percent appeared to

gain an additional DC plan. Among respondents whose employer plans had indicated DC only in

1998, for an overwhelming majority of them (95% of them), their employer plans also indicated a

DC plan only in 2004. Their plan documents suggested a gain in DB coverage for only 5 percent of

respondents, with the entire gain resulting from the conversion of a DC to a combination type of

plan. In contrast, Appendix Table 1F, based on respondent reports as to plan type, indicates that of

those with a DC only plan in 1998, 22 percent gained a DB plan by 2004, either by having DB only

in 2004, or by having both types of plans in 2004.

Appendix 3: Experimental Pension Characteristics Module

        This is a set of questions about plan characteristics distributed to all those within the survey

who have a current pension. The questions pertain to various characteristics of DB and DC

pensions. These plan features include whether enrollment is automatic, whether the individual

receives periodic (quarterly) reports indicating an account balance; whether the employer

contributes to the plan; whether the individual can guide the investment of own and of the firm’s

contributions; whether the individual can borrow on the plan; whether R would be eligible for a

lump sum payment upon leaving the firm before reaching the early retirement age; whether at

retirement the respondent would receive periodic payments for as long as the respondent lives; as

well as the technical name for the plan.

        Appendix Table 2 presents the percentage of responses indicating plan characteristics in the

Pension Characteristics Module arrayed by plan type, DB, DC, or combination. In this table, the

plan types from matched 2004/2005 plan documents are used for classifying the responses. This

table includes all cases who have gone through the module and have a matched document.

Questions such as whether there is automatic enrollment in the plan (59% of those with a matched

DB plan, 38% of those with a matched DC plan), having the ability to make choices in the

account’s investment (37% of those with a DB plan, 72% of those with a DC plan), being able to

choose how one’s own contributions are invested (36% of those with a DB plan, 70% of those with

a DC plan), and if benefits are paid for the lifetime (83% of those with a DB plan, 53% of those

with a DC plan22), are the characteristics that best discriminate among types of pension plan.




22
  The 53 percent of respondents reporting an annuity type of benefit from a DC plan seems to be too high.
This number agrees with responses to a similar question in the core (62 percent). However, according to
Department of Labor’s figures, fewer than 20% of 401k plans offer an annuity option. There is some
confusion among respondents as to the form that payouts will take.


                                                                                                            54
