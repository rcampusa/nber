This paper describes the results of a Monte Carlo study of certain aspects
of robust re'ession confidence region estimation for linear rrdels with
one, five, and seven parameters. One—step sine estimators Cc    l.2) were
used with design matrices consisting of short-tailed, Gaussian, and long-
tailed columns. The samples were generated from a variety of contaminated
Gaussian distributions.
    A number of proposals for covariance matrices were tried, including
forms derived from asymptotic considerations and from weighted-least
squares with data dependent weights. Comparisons with: the Monte Carlo
"truth" were made using generalized eigenvalues. In order to measure
efficiency and compute approxizxte t-values, linear combinations of parameters
corresponding to the largest eigenvalues of the "truth" were examined.
     For design matrices with columns of rrcdest kurtosis, the covariance
estimators all give reasonable results and, after adjusting for asymptotic
bias, some useful approxizrate t-values can be obtained. This implies that
the standard weighted least-squares output using data-dependent weights need
only be modified slightly to give useful robust confidence intervals.
    When design matrix kurtosis is high and severe contamination is present
in the data, these simple approximations are not adequate.
