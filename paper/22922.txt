                                             ABSTRACT

Many theorems in economics can be proven (and hypotheses shown to be false) with “quantifier elimination.”
 Results from real algebraic geometry such as Tarski’s quantifier elimination theorem and Collins’
cylindrical algebraic decomposition algorithm are applicable because the economic hypotheses, especially
those that leave functional forms unspecified, can be represented as systems of multivariate polynomial
(sic) equalities and inequalities. The symbolic proof or refutation of economic hypotheses can therefore
be achieved with an automated technique that involves no approximation and requires no problem-specific
information beyond the statement of the hypothesis itself. This paper also discusses the computational
complexity of this kind of automated economic reasoning, its implementation with Mathematica and
REDLOG software, and offers several examples familiar from economic theory.

       Economics has been profoundly affected by progress in information technology
that has facilitated the collection and processing of vast amounts of data related to
economic activity.    Information technology has so far assisted less with economic
reasoning – deducing conclusions about behavior, markets, or welfare from assumptions
or observations about motivation, technology, and market structure – of the sort done by
Alfred Marshall, Paul Samuelson, Gary Becker, or Roger Myerson. There are automatic
algebraic simplifiers, but simplicity is often in the eye of the beholder and such tools are
sparingly used by economic theorists. Computers have already been used for generating
numerical examples, but approximation quality is a concern, and more thinking is always
needed to appreciate the generality of the results from examples. The purpose of this
paper is to show how approximation-free economic reasoning is beginning to be
automated, present the mathematical foundations of those procedures, and allow readers
of this paper to access a user-friendly tool for automated economic reasoning.
       Section I introduces, to an economics audience, quantified systems of polynomial
equalities and inequalities, and their quantifier-free equivalents, as defined in real
algebraic geometry. Section II shows how a number of hypotheses in economic theory,
especially those that leave functional forms unspecified, are isomorphic with those
systems. Section III shows how quantifier elimination can be used as a tool for proving
hypotheses, detecting inconsistent assumptions, reformulating hypotheses to make them
True, measuring the relative strength of alternative assumptions, and generating examples
and counterexamples. Results from mathematicians Tarski, Collins, and followers –
shown in Section IV – speak to the feasibility of, and algorithms for, eliminating
quantifiers from systems of polynomial equality, inequality, and not-equal relations
(hereafter “polynomial inequalities”) and thereby for confirming or refuting many
hypotheses in economic theory. In addition to presenting results from the mathematics
literature, Section IV links them with the economic examples, and gives special attention
to single-cell decompositions, universal sentences, and existential sentences.
       Readers are also pointed to existing software implementations of quantifier-
elimination methods and given some indication as to likely progress in this dimension.
One of the implementations is in the Wolfram Language/Mathematica, which has a
number of other symbolic capabilities such as automated differentiation and various

interface options. REDLOG is less familiar and has a more primitive user interface, but
typically eliminates quantifiers more quickly than Mathematica does.1


I. Sets and hypotheses represented with and without quantifiers


I.A. An example from elementary algebra
        As a first example, Figure 1 shows the two dimensional set of coefficients (b,c) of
parabolas that have real roots. Equation (1) features two (of many) ways of defining the
same set:


                         {(𝑏, 𝑐 ) ∈ ℝ2 : ∃𝑥(𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0)} =
                                                                                                (1)
                                  {(𝑏, 𝑐 ) ∈ ℝ2 : 𝑏2 ≥ 4𝑐 }


where b, c and x are scalar real numbers.2 The first (hereafter, “quantified”) definition
uses the “existential” quantifier “Exists” () over the quantified variable x in order to
represent the parabola property of interest: having a real root. The second “quantifier-
free” definition has no quantifiers, but nonetheless describes the same subset of ℝ2 .
        Now consider the question of whether a particular parabola (b,c) is in the set
featured in (1): whether it has real roots. The question might not be answered in finite
time with the quantified definition, taken literally, because a parabola cannot be
confirmed to be outside the set without checking all possible values of x. At the same
time, the quantifier-free definition provides verification in just one step: verifying
whether b and c satisfy the inequality.           Ease of verification is why it can be of
“enormous” practical value to “eliminate quantifiers” from a set’s definition: that is, to
take a quantified definition such as the LHS of (1) and transform it into a quantifier-free

1
  Mathematica calculations have been fast enough for my purposes. See also Bradford, et al.
(2016), who find Mathematica to be faster than three other implementations (none of which is
REDLOG) and Davenport and England (2015), who find Mathematica to be “exceptionally fast.”
I have also encountered specific problems that REDLOG processes orders of magnitude more
slowly than Mathematica does.
2
  I assume that the coefficient on x2 is nonzero, and therefore without loss of generality describe
roots of quadratic equations by reference to a quadratic equation with a unit coefficient on x2.
Throughout the paper, each variable is assumed to be a scalar real number unless explicitly
indicated otherwise.

                                                                                                  2
one such as the RHS of (1). 3 Indeed, some artificial intelligence research equates
quantifier elimination with the vernacular concept of “solving” a mathematics problem
(Arai, et al. 2014, p. 2).
         Real algebraic geometry has a number of results as to (a) what quantified set
definitions have an equivalent quantifier-free representation, and (b) algorithms that
eliminate quantifiers. The purpose of this paper is to report results from the real algebraic
geometry and symbolic computation literatures, show how they permit a significant part
of economic theory to be automated, and give more details as to features that are
especially relevant for the economics applications.
         The quantified definition (1) has one quantified variable, x, and two that are
unquantified {b,c}. Now consider introducing quantifiers over one or two of the parabola
coefficients as well. For example, if we introduce the “universal” quantifier “ForAll” ()
over the linear-term coefficient b, we describe a coefficient set in ℝ:


                 {𝑐 ∈ ℝ: ∀𝑏∃𝑥 (𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0)} = {𝑐 ∈ ℝ: 𝑐 ≤ 0}                            (2)


The quantified definition reads “For all b, there exists a real root” (the order of the
quantifiers matters in this case).        Again, the quantifier-free definition facilitates
verification that any particular parabola is in the set of interest. Introducing a third
quantifier, we have:


                             ∃𝑐∀𝑏∃𝑥 (𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0) = 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒                                 (3)


All three of the variables are quantified in Equation (3). A fully-quantified formula is
known as a “sentence,” and all sentences are either True or False. 4 Removing the
quantifiers from a sentence is known as “deciding” that sentence and, in effect, is a proof
of its assertion because the quantifier-free representation of any sentence is either True or
False.



3
 Caviness and Johnson (1998, p. 2).
4
 Another example is the hypothesis that all parabolas have a real root (∀{𝑏, 𝑐}∃𝑥 (𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 =
0)), which is a False sentence.

                                                                                                3
         Hypotheses that involve assumptions also fit into this framework.              Take for
example the hypothesis that if any parabola’s coefficients satisfy b2  4c then it has real
roots:


         ∀{𝑏, 𝑐 }[𝑏2 ≥ 4𝑐 ⇒ ∃𝑥(𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0)]
                                                                                               (4)
                         = ∀{𝑏, 𝑐 }[𝑏2 < 4𝑐 ∨ ∃𝑥(𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0)] = 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒


The first equality follows from the definition of “Implies” (): that either the implication
is True or the assumption is False. 5 The second equality shows the removal of the
quantifiers from the sentence, and that the result is True. This example shows how
statements of the form “If X is true, then so is Y” are logically equivalent to Boolean
combinations of hypotheses with And () and Or () and are therefore sentences that
would be proven True or False by quantifier elimination.




I.B. The General Framework
I.B.1. The formulated hypothesis
       The general framework has N <  real scalar variables x1, …, xN.                      The
formulation HF of a hypothesis involves quantifiers on x1, …, xNF, with the remaining 0
 F < N of them free (unquantified):


                 𝐻𝐹 = (𝑄1 𝑥1 )(𝑄2 𝑥2 ) … (𝑄𝑁−𝐹 𝑥𝑁−𝐹 )𝑇(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁 )
                                                                                               (5)
                             𝑄𝑖 ∈ {∀, ∃} 𝑖 = 1, … , (𝑁 − 𝐹)


where the “Tarski formula” T by itself is a quantifier-free Boolean combination, with the
logical And and Or operators, of a finite number of polynomial (in x1, …, xN)


5
 Note that, by this definition (also implemented as “Implies” in Mathematica and REDLOG),
∃𝑐(𝑐 < 0 ⇒ 𝑐 > 0) = 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒. This is one reason why (a) logicians sometimes argue for
alternative definitions of Implies (Priest 2000, p. 53) and (b) when connecting assumptions with
implications under the existential quantifier, Mathematica requires that there exists a point in
which both the assumption and implication are simultaneously True. See also below on “empty
assumption sets.”

                                                                                                   4
inequalities. 6 For brevity I also use the Not operator, which merely refers to reversing an
inequality (or changing = to ), and the Implies operator, which is a shorthand for a
Boolean combination of And, Or and Not (see above).
         Of particular interest are universal and existential formulations that have the same
quantifier on each of the NF variables. In these cases, I show the quantifier only once
and list the quantified variables in braces:


    (𝑄𝑥1 )(𝑄𝑥2 ) … (𝑄𝑥𝑁−𝐹 )𝑇(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁 ) ≡ 𝑄{𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁−𝐹 }𝑇(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁 )     (6)


Hypotheses formulated with only one kind of quantifier, e.g., (6), have the same meaning
regardless of the order of the quantifiers. Moreover, every universal formulation can be
expressed as an existential formulation, and vice versa:


     ¬∀{𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁−𝐹 }𝑇(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁 ) = ∃{𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁−𝐹 }¬𝑇(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 , … , 𝑥𝑁 )   (7)


where ¬ is the Not operator.7 If, for given values of the free variables, the Tarski formula
is not True on all of ℝ𝑁−𝐹 , then there exists at least one point in ℝ𝑁−𝐹 where the Tarski
formula is false, and vice versa. The order-invariance and quantifier-interchangeability
properties of universal and existential formulations offer many opportunities for
facilitating and verifying computation.
         Because of their relationship with proofs, sentences (F = 0) are especially useful
for automating economic reasoning.               This contrasts with previous discussions of
quantifier elimination in economic theory, such as Brown and Matzkin (1996), Snyder
(2000), Brown and Kubler (2008), Carvajal et al. (2014), and Chambers and Echenique
(2016), whose purposes are to derive restrictions on free variables that they associate with
“observables.” Moreover, with an exception appearing in the appendix of Brown and
Matzkin (1996), they do not intend to “carry out” the quantifier elimination but rather be
assured that the result of doing so would be a non-empty semi-algebraic set in ℝ𝐹 .

  C.W. Brown (2004, 2). For example, putting the middle of (4) in the same format, we have
(∀𝑏)(∀𝑐)(∃𝑥)[𝑏2 < 4𝑐 ∨ 𝑥 2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0], with the Tarski formula in square brackets.
7
  (7) is known as “De Morgan’s law for quantifiers.”

                                                                                                  5
I.B.2. An equivalent representation, without quantifiers


         As above, we are interested in a quantifier-free, but equivalent, statement HE of a
formulated hypothesis HF. Formally,


                                𝐻𝐸 = 𝑃(𝑥𝑁−𝐹+1 , … , 𝑥𝑁 )                                       (8)


where P is another Tarski formula (distinct from the T appearing in HF), and therefore a
quantifier-free Boolean combination of a finite number of polynomial inequalities. If
there are no free variables (F = 0), then P is either 1 = 1 (True) or 1 = 0 (False).
         Quantifier elimination refers to an algorithmic method that derives P from HF.8
We are also interested in the existence and properties of such “automated” method(s), but
first we consider some familiar economic hypotheses that fit into this framework and the
potential value of such a method as a tool for economic reasoning.




II. Examples of quantifiers in economic analysis
II.A. Concave and quasiconcave production functions

         Consider the assertion, adapted from Jehle and Reny (2011), about continuous
and differentiable production functions of two inputs x and y: that all such production
functions f that are strictly increasing and strictly quasiconcave at a point (x,y) with
positive input quantities are concave functions of their inputs at that point. We can
investigate this assertion by formulating a hypothesis within the framework (5), as shown
below:




8
  In the quadratic formula example (2), it would be a method that derives the RHS (an inequality
restriction on c) from the LHS. Ideally, the same method used for (2) could also be used for (1),
(3), and (4) and any other application that fits within the general framework (5).

                                                                                                    6

The hypothesis formulation on the LHS of (9) is a universal sentence with 7 scalar real
variables. 9 Its logical form is an assumption with an implication. The first-derivative
conditions in the assumption say that, at the arbitrary point (x,y), the production function
is increasing in both arguments. The assumption’s second-derivative condition says that
the production function is strictly quasiconcave at that point. The implication’s second-
derivative conditions say that the production function is, at the same point, jointly
concave in the two inputs. Eliminating the quantifiers from the LHS reveals that the
hypothesis is False: there are elements of ℝ7 in which the assumption is True but the
implication is not.
        Note that quantifiers in the general framework (5), and in the example (9), are not
formulating universal or existential statements about elements of a function space.
Rather, (9) refers to values of function arguments and derivatives at a particular point
(x,y) and thereby to polynomials in ℝ7 . “ForAll” means all possible values for those
seven arguments and derivatives. This isomorphism is essential to broadly applying the
results from real algebraic geometry because the latter refer to polynomials in real closed
fields (such as the real numbers). Table 1 illustrates the isomorphism more starkly by
relabeling the input and derivative values as v1 through v7.10 Every component of the


9
  Two of them, x and y, are not related to the rest of the inequalities, but we use them later as we
modify the example.
10
   The variables in (9) are mapped to the generic notation {v1,…,v7} in alphabetical order (as
sorted by Mathematica with variables before functions of variables). Table 1 lists the variables in

                                                                                                   7
assumption and every component of the hypothesis is an equality or inequality comprised
of a sum of various products of these variables (with some of the variables appearing
more than once in the product).
        The ForAll quantifier is powerful because it allows statements about real numbers
to generate statements about classes of functions. If, for example, (9) had been True,
then it would tell us that any real-valued differentiable two-argument function that is
strictly increasing and strictly quasiconcave at a point (with positive inputs) would be
concave at that point because any such function has its arguments and derivatives
(relevant to concavity and quasiconcavity) at a point described by seven real numbers.
(9) is in fact False, which tells us that there exists seven real numbers to assign to those
arguments and derivatives that describe, at a point with positive inputs, positive marginal
products and strict quasiconcavity but not concavity. Any function with those seven
arguments and derivatives would prove by example that not all quasiconcave functions
are concave. 11
        It follows that neither (9) nor (5) requires the production function to be a
polynomial in x and y alone, as assumed the chapters of Brown and Kubler (2008) that
posit semi-algebraic economies. Indeed, as we shall see, an explicitly semi-algebraic
production function would restrict the range of analysis and potentially have tremendous
computational costs.



II.B. A Monopolist’s pass through of marginal costs

        Consider a monopolist that faces a demand curve whose inverse is W(q) with
W(q) < 0, where q is the quantity sold to consumers. The cost of producing q is g(q,a),
which satisfies




order of the complexity of their contribution to the system of polynomial inequalities (C. W.
Brown 2004).
11
   Given seven numbers that falsify (9), a entire family of nonconcave but analytic, increasing and
quasiconcave functions could be found by using those values to specify the corresponding level
and derivative terms in an infinite Taylor-series representation of the production function. It is an
entire family because the seven numbers are consistent with any values for the third- and higher-
order coefficients in the Taylor series.

                                                                                                   8

II.C. Laffer curve surprises
            Consider the prototype static representative agent economy for examining
aggregate consequences of labor income taxation. Specifically, the representative agent
has preferences over the amount consumed c and the amount worked n, as represented by
the utility function u(c,n). c is a good, n is a bad, and preferences are quasiconcave, in
the relevant range. The economy’s production set is weakly convex with its boundary
described by the monotone increasing production function f(n).
            The government levies a constant-rate labor income tax in order to finance a lump
sum transfer. Given a labor income tax rate , a competitive equilibrium in this economy
is a list of five scalars {c,n,a,r,w} such that:
    (i)        Given a, r, w, and , the pair (c,n) maximizes the representative worker’s
               utility subject to his budget constraint:


                 (𝑐, 𝑛) = argmax 𝑢(𝑐 ′ , 𝑛′ ) 𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑐 ′ ≤ (1 − 𝜏)𝑤𝑛′ + 𝑟 + 𝑎             (16)
                            𝑐 ′ ,𝑛 ′



    (ii)       Given w, n maximizes the representative employer’s profits a:


                                       𝑛 = argmax 𝑓 (𝑛′ ) − 𝑤𝑛′                          (17)

There typically is more than one tax rate that is consistent with the same amount of
revenue r: for example no revenue could come from  = 0 or from  = 1. In this case, the
                                                                                      10
lower tax rate method of obtaining that revenue is associated with more equilibrium
utility for the representative agent, but is that a general result? Formally, if we have an
equilibrium {cL,nL,aL,rL,wL} associated with tax rate L and another equilibrium
{cH,nH,aH,rH,wH} associated with tax rate H > L > 0 and rL = rH > 0, can we conclude
that u(cL,nL) > u(cH,nH)?
        Note that, unless L were at the peak of the Laffer curve, we cannot assume that,
say, cH differs from cL by only a differential change as we did with the first two examples
that applied the chain rule of calculus. This Laffer-curve example relates to discrete
differences, but is nonetheless amenable to quantifier elimination. Here the assumptions
are:
                                    0 < 𝜏𝐿 < 𝜏𝐻 < 1                                       (20)


                  𝑤𝐿 > 0, 𝑤𝐻 > 0, 𝑛𝐿 > 0, 𝑛𝐻 > 0, 𝑐𝐿 > 0, 𝑐𝐻 > 0                          (21)

        𝑢𝐿 = 𝑢(𝑐𝐿 , 𝑛𝐿 ) > 𝑢𝐿′ = 𝑢(𝑐𝐿′ , 𝑛𝐻 ), 𝑐𝐿 − 𝑐𝐿′ = (𝑛𝐿 − 𝑛𝐻 )(1 − 𝜏𝐿 )𝑤𝐿           (24)

               (𝑢𝐿′ − 𝑢𝐻 )(𝑐𝐿′ − 𝑐𝐻 ) > 0 ,       ′
                                                (𝑢𝐻 − 𝑢𝐿 )(𝑐𝐻′ − 𝑐𝐿 ) > 0                 (26)


                𝑀(𝑐𝐿 , 𝑛𝐿 ) = (1 − 𝜏𝐿 )𝑤𝐿 , 𝑀(𝑐𝐻 , 𝑛𝐻 ) = (1 − 𝜏𝐻 )𝑤𝐻                     (27)


        The inequalities (20) and (21) define the question of interest (i.e., looking at
equilibria with nondegenerate tax rates, positive wage rates, and positive amounts
worked).14 Equation (22) assumes that the two equilibria have the same tax revenue.


14
  For brevity, I also assume that the utility and production functions are continuously
differentiable in the neighborhood of each of the two equilibria being considered. This

                                                                                           11
The inequalities (23) represent the production function assumptions: production is strictly
increasing and the marginal product of labor is weakly decreasing.15 The inequalities
(24) define and characterize one of the equilibrium utility levels. In particular, an agent
in equilibrium L choses not to work the amount nH and have the corresponding
consumption level 𝑐𝐿′ . In equalities (25) do the same with respect to the H equilibrium.
The inequalities (26) say that consumption is a good. The equations (27), which include
the marginal rate of substitution function M, are the workers’ first order condition for
each of the two equilibria under consideration.
         Formally, the hypothesis of interest is that (20) through (27) imply that uL > uH.
Quantifier elimination in a sixteen-dimensional space shows that more assumptions are
required in order to conclude that uL > uH, because the hypothesis is true in part, but not
all, of the sixteen-dimensional space. 16 For example, the additional assumption that
consumption and leisure are normal goods – in particular that (M(cL,nL)  M(cH,nH))(nL 
nH) > 0 – is sufficient. An alternative sufficient assumption is that the demand for labor
is elastic ((wLnL  wHnH)(nL  nH)  0).
         Note that the equilibrium definition (16) through (19) is not in the format (5) and
therefore not identical to the Tarski formula that is the conjunction of (20) through (27).
However, any pair of a low-tax equilibrium and high-tax equilibrium that satisfies (20)
and (21) will have associated with it the sixteen real numbers (delineated in the previous
footnote) that satisfy (22) through (27). Anything that is necessarily implied by (20)
through (27) must therefore describe any pair of equilibria (satisfying (20) and (21)). In
other words, adding any additional implications of (16) through (19) to the assumptions
already in the Tarski formula cannot alter a conclusion that is already True.
         Conversely, quantifier elimination shows that, without an assumption beyond (20)
through (27), it is possible that uL < uH. Even so, it is not necessarily obvious that there is

guarantees that different tax rates are associated with different work amounts and permits
calculation of marginal rates of substitution and marginal products in the same neighborhoods.
15
   Note that, for brevity, I have eliminated four equations and four variables by making the
substitutions 𝑓 (𝑛𝑖 ) = 𝑐𝑖 , 𝑓 ′ (𝑛𝑖 ) = 𝑤𝑖 , 𝑖 = 𝐿, 𝐻. As a result, c is measuring the levels of both
consumption and production, and w is measuring both the wage and the production function
slope.
16
   The sixteen variables are
𝑐𝐿 , 𝑐𝐻 , 𝑐𝐿′ , 𝑐𝐻′ , 𝑀(𝑐𝐿 , 𝑛𝐿 ), 𝑀(𝑐𝐻 , 𝑛𝐻 ), 𝑛𝐿 , 𝑛𝐻 , 𝑢𝐿 , 𝑢𝐻 , 𝑢𝐿′ , 𝑢𝐻
                                                                           ′
                                                                             , 𝑤𝐿 , 𝑤𝐻 , 𝜏𝐿 , 𝜏𝐻 . Taking the Tarski
formula as (20) – (27)  uL > uH, the universal sentence is False and the existential sentence is
True (i.e., the Tarski formula is True somewhere, but not everywhere).

                                                                                                                   12
a pair of equilibria (defined by (16) through (19)) with the property that uL < uH. Below I
show that quantifier elimination can generate necessary conditions for a result, such as uL
< uH, which can then be compared with the equilibrium definition for a possible
contradiction.   In this Laffer-curve example, it turns out that no other property of
equilibrium is relevant for concluding that uL could be less than uH. Appendix I proves
this by providing specific utility and production functions, and graphing the
corresponding Laffer curve, for which uL < uH at high tax rates.
        It is well known that models with optimization can be examined with local
analysis (“first-order conditions” at a point) or revealed preference arguments (e.g., (24)
and (25) from the Laffer-curve model), with many results obtainable with either
approach.17 A revealed preference argument can be more versatile because it connects to
points away from the optimum, but also more tedious because of the number of
inequalities involved.    Quantifier elimination alters this tradeoff in favor of reveal
preference because the processing of inequalities is embedded in the elimination
procedure that, as shown in Section IV, is to be done by computer.



II.D. Concave and quasiconcave production functions revisited

        As compared to subsection II.A above, Jehle and Reny (2011) examine more
general production functions in that their functions (a) can have more than two inputs and
(b) do not have to be differentiable. They relate concavity and quasiconcavity to triples
of production inputs, rather than single-point second-derivative restrictions as in equation
(9). Quantifier elimination can be applied in the “triples” framework too, as suggested by
the subsection II.C’s Laffer-curve example. Specifically, it can be shown by quantifier
elimination (in the space of real numbers) that a production function f, with any number
of inputs, that is positive, homogeneous, and quasiconcave must be concave.
        Let V1 and V2 be any two vectors of production input and  denote a scalar. We
define two more vectors W1 and W2 as well as the scalar :

(1967), Brown and Matzkin (1996), and Chambers and Echenique (2016).

the positive and homogeneous properties. Using the definitions of W1 and W2, (32) and

quasiconcave production function.
          The Tarski formula for the “triples” representation is that (29) through (34)
together imply that f is concave, as represented by (35):


              0 < 𝜇 < 1 ⇒ 𝑓(𝜇𝑉1 + (1 − 𝜇)𝑉2 ) ≥ 𝜇𝑓(𝑉1 ) + (1 − 𝜇)𝑓 (𝑉2 )                          (35)


One approach to quantifier elimination from the system (29) - (35) would be to (a) take
any specific value of K, and (b) apply the algorithm to the (4K+10)-dimensional space
that includes each of the K elements of each of the V1, V2, W1 and W2 vectors as well as

𝜇)𝑉2 ), 𝑓 (𝜇𝑉1 + (1 − 𝜇)𝑉2 ), 𝑓(𝜆𝑊1 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑊2 )} .19 However, the result would apply
only to the specific value of K.
        A second approach is to leave the dimension of the vectors unspecified, because
none of those vectors enter (29) - (35) except through f, which maps vectors into scalars.
All of the inequalities in the Tarksi formula are polynomial inequalities in the ten-
dimensional       space     {𝜆, 𝜇, 𝑓(𝑉1 ), 𝑓(𝑉2 ), 𝑓(𝑊1 ), 𝑓(𝑊2 ), 𝑓(𝜇𝑉1 ), 𝑓((1 − 𝜇)𝑉2 ), 𝑓(𝜇𝑉1 +
(1 − 𝜇)𝑉2 ), 𝑓(𝜆𝑊1 + (1 − 𝜆)𝑊2 )}. The Tarski formula would be True for all values of
this vector if and only Jehle and Reny’s Theorem 3.1 – that all positive, homogeneous,
and quasiconcave productions are concave – were correct.                       Quantifier elimination
confirms their Theorem.
        Note, however, that the quantifier-elimination-based proof, as well as Jehle and
Reny’s, involves referencing eight different points on the production function f and using
the assumed properties to derive relationships between those eight points even though the
each definition of concavity and quasiconcavity refers to only three.20 In this sense, a
more comprehensive result from quantifier elimination requires more thought – i.e.,
“manual” rather than “automated” economic reasoning – as to the setup of the Tarski
formula, as compared to the single-point approach (9).




III. Quantifier elimination as a tool for economic reasoning

        Quantifier elimination can do more than determine the truth of hypotheses. It can
help formulate and understand hypotheses by detecting inconsistent assumptions,
calculating necessary and sufficient conditions, and generating examples.                           Each
subsection below explains how this is done and provides examples by reference to the
production function, monopolist pricing, and Laffer curve models above.




19
  This approach would also need to include the definitions (28) in its Tarski formula.

  Similarly, the Laffer curve problem refers to four points on the utility function (𝑢𝐿 , 𝑢𝐻 , 𝑢𝐿′ , 𝑢𝐻
                                                                                                      ′
                                                                                                        )
even though the statement of the hypothesis refers to only two (uL,uH).

                                                                                                       15
III.A. Detecting inconsistent assumptions

        Anything can be “proven” with an empty assumption set because 𝐴 ⇒ 𝐵 is
identical to ¬𝐴 ∨ 𝐵, which is True everywhere that A is false. It is therefore important to
know whether assumptions are mutually consistent. Quantifier elimination performs this
task too, by beginning with the sentence that there exist values of each of the variables so
that the assumptions are simultaneously True. If the quantifier-free representation of that
existential sentence is False, then the assumptions are mutually inconsistent.
        Take the Laffer curve model, in which the “surprise” result uL < uH requires that
one of the goods is inferior (M(cL,nL) < M(cH,nH)) at the same time that the demand for
labor is relatively inelastic ((wLnL  wHnH)(nL  nH) < 0). In order to confirm that the two
assumptions are simultaneously compatible with (20) through (27), we eliminate
quantifiers from the sentence that says that there exists at least one point in ℝ16 where
(20) through (27), M(cL,nL) < M(cH,nH), and (wLnL  wHnH)(nL  nH) < 0 are True.



III.B. Necessary and sufficient conditions: reformulating hypotheses to
make them True

        The hypothesis (9) is False. Quantifier elimination can show what assumptions
could be added so that the reformulated hypothesis is True.                 For example, consider
reformulating the hypothesis without the quantifiers corresponding to the production
function’s second derivatives, as shown below using the condensed notation of Table 1.


  ∀{𝑣1 , 𝑣2 , 𝑣3 , 𝑣5 }[(𝑣1 > 0 ∧ 𝑣2 > 0 ∧ 𝑣3 > 0 ∧ 𝑣5 > 0 ∧ 𝑣32 𝑣7 + 𝑣52 𝑣4 < 2𝑣3 𝑣5 𝑣6 )
                                                       ⇒ (𝑣4 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣7 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣4 𝑣7 ≥ 𝑣62 )]      (36)
                                        3
                   = {(𝑣4 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 ) ∈ ℝ : ((𝑣4 = 0 ∨ 𝑣7 = 0) ∧ 𝑣6 = 0) ∨ 𝐺 (𝑣4 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 )}



As before, there are seven variables, but three of them are unquantified (free) and
correspond to the second derivatives of the production function. The LHS of equation
(36) is not a sentence. This alone says that the formulated hypothesis might be neither
True nor False. Applying quantifier elimination to the formulated hypothesis, we get the
RHS of (36), which is a set of restrictions on the free variables {v4,v6,v7}. The set

                                                                                                 16
consists of two subsets described by the blue term and the G term. 21 Each subset’s
description is providing sufficient conditions to add to the assumptions of (9) to make it
True.22 For example, the blue term says that the hypothesis (9) would be True if its
assumptions also included that the production function was a quasilinear function of its
inputs, as shown in (37).23


                                   ∀{𝑣1 , 𝑣2 , 𝑣3 , 𝑣4 , 𝑣5 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 }

        [(𝑣1 > 0 ∧ 𝑣2 > 0 ∧ 𝑣3 > 0 ∧ 𝑣5 > 0 ∧ 𝑣32 𝑣7 + 𝑣52 𝑣4 < 2𝑣3 𝑣5 𝑣6                                           (37)
        ∧ ((𝑣4 = 0 ∨ 𝑣7 = 0) ∧ 𝑣6 = 0)) ⇒ (𝑣4 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣7 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣4 𝑣7 ≥ 𝑣62 )] = 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒



In other words, quantifier elimination produces the blue term that, when added to the
assumptions, makes the formulated hypothesis (9) True. 24 Moreover, some of the
byproducts of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD), which is the primary
quantifier-elimination algorithm, are further options for algebraically describing
restrictions among the of the variables, regardless of whether they are “free.” These
options facilitate characterizing the intersection of the assumption and hypothesis sets,
which goes more directly to the question of what additional assumptions are needed to
make a hypothesis True.           CAD and other quantifier-elimination algorithms are the
subjects of Section IV.



III.C. Necessary and sufficient conditions: distinguishing strong
assumptions from weak ones

           In many cases there are multiple assumptions that deliver a result. Quantifier
elimination can show which, if any, implications are stronger than others, conditional on


21
     G is a more complicated function that is shown in Appendix II.
22
     Together, the two are also necessary.
23                                                          𝜕2 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)           𝜕2 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)            𝜕2 𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)
     In the more verbose notation, the blue term is ((         𝜕𝑦 2
                                                                          =0∨     𝜕𝑥 2
                                                                                            = 0) ∧    𝜕𝑥𝜕𝑦
                                                                                                                 = 0).
24
   In other words, because it is not a sentence, equation (36) has a lot in common with the
quantifier elimination in Brown and Matzkin (1996) and Chambers and Echenique (2016).
However, they do not use CAD, or improvements on it, to actually perform the quantifier
elimination.

                                                                                                                     17
a set of assumptions A. Specifically, if one of those implications is B and the other C,
then the statement that B is a (weakly) stronger implication than C is written as:25


                          [𝐴 ⇒ (𝐵 ⇒ 𝐶 )] = [¬𝐴 ∨ ¬𝐵 ∨ 𝐶]                                    (38)


Reversing B and C in (38) would make the statement that C is a (weakly) stronger
implication than B. If both are True, then B and C are equivalent conditional on A
[𝐴 ⇒ (𝐵 ⇔ 𝐶 )].
        In the Laffer curve model, assuming (20) through (27), quantifier elimination
proves that a linear production function (wL = wH) is one with elastic labor demand ((wLnL
 wHnH)(nL  nH) < 0). Another example: quantifier elimination proves that, conditional
on the same assumptions, nL > nH is equivalent to uL > uH.
        Of course, irrelevant assumptions do not affect conclusions.                 Quantifier
elimination therefore (a) still obtains the result even when the Tarski formula contains
irrelevant assumptions and (b) can be used to identify the irrelevant assumptions. These
features of quantifier elimination allow the user to assemble his Tarski formula with less
discretion. The proof in the Laffer curve model, for example, requires evaluating utility
at four points: {𝑢(𝑐𝐿 , 𝑛𝐿 ), 𝑢(𝑐𝐻 , 𝑛𝐻 ), 𝑢(𝑐𝐻′ , 𝑛𝐿 ), 𝑢(𝑐𝐿′ , 𝑛𝐻 )} , where 𝑐𝐻′ ( 𝑐𝐿′ ) is the
consumption that would be obtained by working the low-tax (high-tax) amount at the
high-tax (low-tax) prices. The first two are obvious, but the user might not be sure
                    , 𝑢 𝑐𝐻 , 𝑛𝐿′ )} must also be included.26 These two utility levels, and the
                 ′ ) (
whether {𝑢(𝑐𝐿 , 𝑛𝐻
revealed-preference restrictions that go with them (for a total of eight utility levels and
four revealed-preference restrictions), could be included in the Tarski formula without
affecting the conclusions. For that matter, the Tarski formula can be augmented with any
additional implication of the equilibrium definition (16) through (19) that is expressible
as a polynomial inequality.




25
  To be clear, A, B, and C are Boolean variables.
26
  Any labor amounts with a prime indicates the amount that must be worked in order to obtain
the counterfactual consumption.

                                                                                               18
III.D. Generating examples, counter-examples, and step-by-step proofs

        The     primary     quantifier-elimination      algorithm,     Cylindrical     Algebraic
Decomposition (CAD) automatically generates sample points as part of its lifting phase
(the phases of CAD are discussed further below). For a hypothesis that is not everywhere
False, the CAD can generate an example. For a hypothesis that is not everywhere True,
the CAD can generate a counterexample. Take the Laffer curve model, without normal-
goods or elastic-demand restrictions. The hypothesis that, conditional on (20) through
(27), uL > uH is neither everywhere True nor everywhere False. The CAD can therefore
generate both an example of uL > uH and uL  uH, both of which are consistent with (20)
through (27). See Table 2.
        A CAD represents a step-by-step proof. In order to see, and qualify, this result, it
is necessary to reference some of the theorems from real algebraic geometry and to
understand some of the details of CAD construction. This is the purpose of Section IV.


IV. Relevant Theorems from Real Algebraic Geometry

IV.A. Tarski: Quantifier elimination is always possible
        Mathematician and logician Alfred Tarski proved that there exists a universal
algorithm (that is, one not requiring problem-specific guidance) for quantifier elimination
from systems of polynomial inequalities on real closed fields by providing such an
algorithm. 27 Because the real numbers are an example of a real closed field, the Tarski
result guarantees that there exists a P so that HF = HE and gives an algorithm for finding
P. If HF is a sentence, then the quantifier elimination algorithm is a “decision method”: a
procedure for determining whether HF is True or False.28
        Tarski’s theorem applies to all of the examples above because, when interpreted
in the right space, they are special cases of systems of polynomial inequalities. A system
with even one transcendental term is not covered by Tarski’s theorem (unless there is a
change of variables that makes all terms polynomial), although quantifier elimination



27
   Tarksi made the proof in 1930 (Caviness and Johnson 1998, p. 1), but the result was not
published until Tarski (1951).
28
   Renegar (1998, p. 221).

                                                                                             19
may still be possible. There are algorithms for deciding existential sentences that contain
transcendental terms, although they are not fully developed (see below).



IV.B. Collins: A more efficient algorithm for quantifier-elimination that
defines sets recursively

        Although Tarski’s method is enough to prove that quantifiers can be eliminated, it
is not used in practice due to its “extreme” inefficiency. 29 A major step forward came
with the Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) method introduced by
mathematician George E. Collins in 1973. 30



IV.B.1. Properties of CAD
       In our setting (5), the CAD method decomposes ℝ𝑁 into finitely many connect
regions, known as “cells,” with three properties:
        (i)      each cell of the CAD is a semi-algebraic set (i.e., it is defined by a finite
                 number of quantifier-free polynomial inequalities).
        (ii)     The CAD result is cylindrical because the projections of any two of the
                 cells into ℝ𝑘 , 1  k  N, are either identical or disjoint.
        (iii)    Each cell is adapted to the Tarski formula from which it was derived,
                 which means that none of the polynomials in the Tarski formula T has
                 more than one sign {-1,0,1} in any one of the cells.
Every Tarski formula has such a CAD (Basu, Pollack and Roy (2011, Theorem 5.6)).
        The T-adapted (i.e., uniform sign) property of the cells, and the fact that the cells
are finite in number, means that any quantified formula can be confirmed in a finite
number of steps.31 The cylindrical property of the decomposition means that the cells
have a natural ordering and many times can be processed more than one at a time.
        Narrowly speaking, CAD refers to a method, or sometimes an expanded set of
polynomials (including, among others, those in the original Tarski formula) obtained by
29
   Arai, et al. (2014). See also Davenport, Siret and Tournier (1988, p. 119), who describe
Tarski’s method as “completely impractical.”
30
   Collins (1973) and Collins (1975).
31
   By construction, the Tarski formula is True at any one point in a cell if and only if it is True
everywhere in that cell.

                                                                                                      20
the method. One of result of the CAD method is its cells, described by Cylindrical
Algebraic Formulas (CAFs).        I follow Kauers (2011), Mathematica, REDLOG, and
others by (a) referring to CAD and CAFs interchangeably and (b) displaying CAFs that
are simplified to exclude cells where the Tarski formula is false and to unify the
remaining cells. 32 For example, I refer to the right-hand sides of (2) and (3) as CADs.
       As an example (due to Kauers 2011), take the set of all points in the plane that are
outside the origin-centered circle of radius two and inside the hyperbola centered at (1,1):


          {(𝑥1 , 𝑥2 ) ∈ ℝ2 : 𝑥12 + 𝑥22 − 4 > 0 ∧ (𝑥1 − 1)(𝑥2 − 1) − 1 < 0}                (39)


Figure 2 displays a CAD of the set described in (39), with each of the two-dimensional
cells shown as a different color. The CAD partitions the x1-axis six different ways: x1 
r1, x1  (r1, r2], x1  (r2,1), x1 = 1, x1  (1,2) and x1 > 2, where r1 and r2 are the two real
roots of z4  2z3  2z2 + 8z  4 = 0. Each of partition of x1 defines a cylinder of all points
in the plane that would be projected onto that part of the x1-axis. Each cylinder is itself
vertically partitioned where one of the polynomials changes sign, which guarantees that
the CAD is adapted to the two polynomials.           If the problem were more than two
dimensional, then the CAD would proceed further by stacking one-higher dimensioned
cylinders on top of the cells in the [x1,x2] plane, partitioning those cylinders, stacking
one-higher dimensioned cylinders on the cells in the [x1,x2,x3] space, etc.
       The CAD shown in Figure 2 has seven two-dimensional cells and two one-
dimensional cells. Although not emphasized in Figure 2, the rest of the plane could be
decomposed into cells (12 in this case) using the same cylinders. As a result, at most 21
sample points need to be checked – one in each cell – to confirm or deny hypotheses such
as “There exists points outside the circle that are inside the hyperbola” or “All points
outside the circle are inside the hyperbola.” In this way, CAD decides universal and
existential sentences in a finite number of steps.




32
  See Strzebonski (2010) and Chen and Maza (2015) for more on the distinction between CAD
and CAF.

                                                                                            21
IV.B.2. CAD Construction
       A CAD is obtained in two straightforward, albeit tedious, phases: projection and
lifting. In the projection phase, one variable is eliminated at a time in the order that they
are quantified in the formulated hypothesis. 33 In order to eliminate a variable, both
polynomial intersections and singularities are found. 34 In Figure 2, there are two
intersection points, two singularities for the circle (x1 =  2), and one singularity for the
hyperbola (x1 = 1) that can be used to make a cylindrical projection. 35 The set described
in (39) is two dimensional, so there is only one projection step, but the general case
involves one projection step for each variable eliminated, with the exception of the final
variable.    Also note that higher polynomial degrees can increase the number of
intersections and singularities to be processed, as shown by example below.
        The following describes the lifting phase, assuming for brevity that xN is the first
variable eliminated, 𝑥𝑁−1 is the second, etc., until only x1 is left. In the lifting phase, one
scalar value – a sample point – for x1 is found for each of the cells defined on the x1-axis
by the projection phase. Using those values, sample points in the [x1,x2] plane are found
for each of the cells in the cylinders above the cells on the x1–axis. This procedure is
repeated (“lifted”) through each dimension until there is a sample point in the [x1,x2,…,
xN] space for every cell in the CAD. Because the CAD is adapted to the Tarski formula,
one sample point is enough to determine which˙ inequalities are satisfied at all points in




33
   This means that CAD can be constructed in at least N! different ways: one for each possible
variable-elimination sequence. Although familiar from linear systems, Gaussian elimination is
not necessarily a close analogy because polynomial intersections are not the only calculations that
may occur as the CAD eliminates a variable (Van den Dries 1988, p. 9).
34
   When viewed as a function of the variable being eliminated, each polynomial in the system has
roots that are (a) numbered according to the degree of that variable and (b) potentially a function
of the remaining variables. As a function of the remaining variables, the roots need to be
identified as real or complex (the source polynomial’s singularity points indicate which is the
case) and the real ones sorted collectively for the entire system (the polynomial intersection
points indicate the sort order). Each sort is associated with conditions on the remaining variables
and a partition of the eliminated variable at each root. The exact algebra requires several pages of
explanation, for which readers are referred to the literature, especially Arnon, Collins and
McCallum (1998) and Basu, Pollack and Roy (2011). I have found the latter to be especially
helpful because each subalgorithm is illustrated with an example (see also (Dolzmann, Sturm and
Weispfenning 1998)).
35
   Figure 2’s projection does not need the x1 = 2 singularity in order to have a cylindrical
projection, but it would if the set of interest were the points outside both the circle and hyperbola.

                                                                                                   22
the cell. The quantifier-free formula is the union of all cells where the Tarski formula is
True.36
          Recall the existential quantifier elimination result shown in (1), which has a
Tarski formula of x2 + bx + c = 0. If x were eliminated first, and then c, then the full
decomposition of ℝ3 the nine cells below

Only three of the cells above satisfy the Tarski formula. The (b,c) projections of those
three cells are:37


                         (𝑏2 = 4𝑐 ) ∨ (𝑏2 > 4𝑐 ) ∨ (𝑏2 > 4𝑐 )                                     (41)


which simplifies to the RHS of (1).
          Note that, for economic applications, CAD construction, and even quantifier
elimination by way of CAD, can be fully delegated to either commercial or open-source
software packages, much as the standard economics practice for, say, inverting matrices.
Mathematica and REDLOG are featured in what follows.


36
   The lifting phase can be done together with the quantifier elimination, in which case entire
cylinders may be discarded (i.e., no sample points calculated).

   As C.W. Brown (2003, p. 97) puts it, “the existential quantifier is simply projection.”

                                                                                                   23
IV.B.3. Single-cell CADs
       In general, CADs can have many cells, especially when the number of variables is
large. The three-dimensional version of the circle-hyperbola example has 242 cells (as
compared to 9 shown in Figure 2).              The four-dimensional version has 3,531. 38
Sometimes the CAD has just one cell, even when there are more than two variables. The
single-cell CADs are of special interest because (a) the hypothesis represented by the
CAD can be proved recursively in the order in which the CAD projections occurred and
(b) the steps of that recursive proof correspond to the components of the single-cell
formula generated by the CAD.
        Take, for example, a three-dimensional set described by


              {(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) ∈ ℝ3 : 𝑥 > 0 ∧ 𝐴𝑦 (𝑥, 𝑦) > 0 ∧ 𝐴𝑧 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) = 0}                     (42)


Where Ay and Az are quantifier-free functions mapping scalar arguments into ℝ1 . The
system of inequalities is triangular in the sense that only Az = 0 contains all three
variables and, of the remaining two inequalities, only Ay > 0 contains both remaining
variables. Eliminating the variables in the order {z,y,x}, the cylindrical decomposition is:


                  {𝑥 > 0 ∧ {𝑦: 𝐴𝑦 (𝑥, 𝑦) > 0} ∧ {𝑧: 𝐴𝑧 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) = 0}}                        (43)


which is cylindrical because the third atom is conditional on x and y, the second atom is
conditional on x, and the first atom can be evaluated without regard for y and z. It has
only one cell, as evidenced by the fact that it has no disjunctions (). (43) would be a
single-cell CAD if the functions Ay and Az were algebraic (i.e., polynomials).
        The monopolist’s pass-through model from above is a triangular system with a
single-cell CAD, from which a recursive proof can be constructed. Consider the (True)
hypothesis that, assuming (11)-(13), (15), a demand curve that is concave and slopes


38
  These CADs (technically, CAFs) were calculated by Mathematica, with cells distinguished by
the disjunction operator (). The cell counts refer only to the cells where the Tarski formula is
True.

                                                                                                24
down (W(q)  0, W(q) < 0), then marginal costs are not overshifted (ie.,   1). To see
                                                                        𝜕𝑔(𝑞,𝑎)
this concisely, we drop the irrelevant variables {𝑔(𝑞, 𝑎),                        , 𝑊(𝑞)} and the
                                                                          𝜕𝑞

inequalities in which they appear: (11), (12) and the first part of (10).39 That leaves six
             𝜕2𝑔   𝜕 2 𝑔 𝑑𝑞
variables {𝜕𝑞𝜕𝑎 , 𝜕𝑞2 , 𝑑𝑎 , 𝑊 ′′ (𝑞 ), 𝑊 ′ (𝑞 ), 𝑞} and seven inequalities describing the

assumptions of the model. 40 When the six variables are eliminated in this order, the CAD
representation of the model’s assumptions is:

                        ′(              ′′ (
                                                        𝑑𝑞     𝜕 2 𝑔(𝑞, 𝑎)
          {𝑞 > 0 ∧ 𝑊 𝑞 ) < 0 ∧ 𝑊               𝑞) ≤ 0 ∧    <0∧             ≥0
                                                        𝑑𝑎         𝜕𝑞 2
                                                                                               (44)
            𝜕 2 𝑔(𝑞, 𝑎)      ′         ′′
                                               𝜕 2 𝑔(𝑞, 𝑎) 𝑑𝑞
          ∧             = [2𝑊 (𝑞 ) + 𝑞𝑊 (𝑞 ) −            ] }
               𝜕𝑞𝜕𝑎                                𝜕𝑞 2    𝑑𝑎


which is a single cell (no disjunctions). In order to prove that pass-through cannot exceed
one using the CAD (44), we assume the contrary:
                     𝑑                         𝑑𝑞
                         ( )          𝑊 ′ (𝑞 ) 𝑑𝑎
                     𝑑𝑎 𝑊 𝑞   = 2                       >1                                     (45)
                   𝑑 𝜕𝑔(𝑞, 𝑎)  𝜕 𝑔(𝑞, 𝑎) 𝑑𝑞 𝜕 2 𝑔(𝑞, 𝑎)
                   𝑑𝑎 [ 𝜕𝑞 ]                 + 𝜕𝑞𝜕𝑎
                                  𝜕𝑞 2 𝑑𝑎


We take the last atom of the single-cell CAD, which represents the assumption (15), to
eliminate from (45) the first variable (at least) from the elimination list:


                                       𝑊 ′ (𝑞 )
                                                       >1                                      (46)
                                2𝑊 ′ (𝑞 ) + 𝑞𝑊 ′′ (𝑞 )


The result (46) contradicts the first three atoms of the CAD, which are the assumptions
about a positive quantity and the demand curve’s shape. This completes the CAD-
inspired proof by contradiction that pass-through cannot exceed one.

39
   The level of cost g(q,a) appears only in (11) and in doing so does not restrict the remaining
variables. With (11) dropped, W(q) appears in only in condition (12), without restricting any of
the other variables. With (11) and (12) dropped, marginal cost appears only in the first part of
(10), without restricting any of the other variables.
40
   The seven inequalities form a triangular system in the sense that only one of them contains all
six variables, a second contains four variables, and the remaining five contain only one variable
each.

                                                                                                 25
          Note that any CAD eliminating N variables has N! different elimination sequences
and thereby up to N! different CADs and up to N! different methods of proving the same
result.    The CADs may differ in terms of the number of cells, which means the
complexity of the proofs they represent may differ.41 One CAD by itself is enough to
decide a universal sentence, but sometimes it may be of interest to examine multiple
elimination sequences in order to find a relatively simple proof of that decision.



IV.B.4. Necessary and sufficient conditions revisited with CAD

          Each of the N! CADs offers a potentially unique algebraic characterization of the
same set. This is useful when we have a hypothesis that does not follow from the
assumptions because CAD can offer various algebraic descriptions of the intersection of
the assumptions and the hypothesis. Any extra assumption that restricts the model to a
subset of that intersection is, together with the original assumptions, sufficient to
conclude that the hypothesis is True. Such an extra assumption is readily identified from
a CAD.
          The model (9) is an example: concave production does not follow from
quasiconcave production:


                                    ∀{𝑣3 , 𝑣4 , 𝑣5 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 }
     [(𝑣3 > 0 ∧ 𝑣5 > 0 ∧ 𝑣32 𝑣7 + 𝑣52 𝑣4 < 2𝑣3 𝑣5 𝑣6 )                                        (47)
                                          ⇒ (𝑣4 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣7 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣4 𝑣7 ≥ 𝑣62 )] = 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒


where (49) uses the condensed notation of Table 1 and for brevity omits v1 and v2, which
do not affect the conclusions. The intersection of the assumptions and the hypothesis is a
subset of ℝ5 that can be characterized with CAD. That description depends on the
elimination sequence used during the projection phase. If the variables representing



41
  If variables were eliminated from the pass-through example in reverse order, then the CAD
would have four cells rather than the single cell shown in (42). Also note the analogy with
Gaussian elimination for full-rank N-dimensional systems of linear equations: there are N!
different elimination sequences.

                                                                                               26
second derivatives (v4,v6,v7) are eliminated last, and otherwise variables are eliminated in
reverse alphabetical order, we have:


                                    (𝑣3 , 𝑣4 , 𝑣5 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 ) ∈ ℝ5 :
     {                                                                                      }
         (𝑣3 > 0 ∧ 𝑣5 > 0 ∧ 𝑣32 𝑣7 + 𝑣52 𝑣4 < 2𝑣3 𝑣5 𝑣6 ) ∧ (𝑣4 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣7 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣4 𝑣7 ≥ 𝑣62 )
                                                                                                      (48)
                                                                          5
                                                (𝑣3 , 𝑣4 , 𝑣5 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 ) ∈ ℝ :
                        ={                                                                        }
                             (𝑣4 = 𝑣6 = 0 ∧ 𝑣7 < 0 ∧ 𝑣3 > 0 ∧ 𝑣5 > 0) ∨ 𝛤(𝑣3 , 𝑣4 , 𝑣5 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 )


where the right-hand side is the CAD, which consists of two subsets described by the
blue term and the  term.42 Each subset is by itself a sufficient condition to add to the
assumptions of (49) to make it True. 43 For example, the blue term says that the
hypothesis (49) would be True if its assumptions also included that the production
function was quasilinear in its second input. In other words, the CAD of the intersection
of (49)’s assumption and hypothesis produces the blue term that, when added to the
assumptions, makes it True.
              Recall that the condition (36) describes a set in just the three free variables
because the other two (v3,v5) were quantified and then eliminated. In contrast, the CAD
(48) is a set in all five dimensions.               In other words, CAD can provide a “simple”
description of a set by prioritizing variables rather than, or in addition to, eliminating
them. In the case of (48), v3 and v5 still appear, but restrictions on v4, v6, and v7 are
shown without reference to v3 and v5: that’s that it means for the decomposition to be
cylindrical. The CAD approach thereby offers a wider range of descriptions of the
necessary and sufficient conditions than does the elimination approach shown in
subsection III.B.



IV.C. The complexity of quantifier elimination

              Collins’ CAD method is not necessarily the most efficient method for quantifier
elimination, but it is a good benchmark for understanding the computational complexity
of practical problems.              CAD’s computational complexity (e.g., computing time) is

42
      is a more complicated function that is shown in Appendix II.
43
     Together, the two are also necessary.

                                                                                                       27
polynomial in the number of inequalities and in the maximum degree of their
polynomials, but double exponential in the number of variables. In order to anticipate
practical experiences with CAD-based quantifier elimination, it helps to see a graph of a
double-exponential function, which reflects a kind of “curse of dimensionality.” Figures
3a and 3b graph the same function 2^(2x), but on different domains. Figure 3a’s graph is
almost a vertical wall: doubling the number of variables (e.g., moving from the middle of
the horizontal axis to the right edge) in this range increases the complexity by a factor of
more than 4,000. The figure thereby gives the impression that CAD, and perhaps any
method for quantifier elimination, may never be practical.                  Indeed, a number of
economics papers discussing quantifier elimination cite the theoretical complexity results
and suggest that quantifier elimination is too “computationally demanding” without ever
reporting any actual computation times. 44
        But Figure 3b gives a much different impression. It is fairly close to linear, with a
doubling of the number of variables less than tripling the complexity. In other words, the
feasibility of CAD depends on where the “wall” is located relative to problems of interest
and whether those problems can be rephrased to, in effect, move the wall to the right. As
Shankar (2002, p. 13) puts it, “Many decision procedures are of exponential, super-
exponential, or non-elementary complexity. However, this complexity often does not
manifest itself on practical examples.” Although CAD and related methods have been
used for many problems in geometry (Lasaruk and Sturm 2011), I am not aware of their
use on sentences that represent economic problems, which tend to be less symmetric and
with lesser polynomial degrees. We must also remember that CAD is not the only
method for quantifier elimination, especially in the case of existential sentences.
        There is therefore no substitute for actually trying quantifier elimination on
economics examples. Each of the examples in this paper, which were chosen for their
economic interest – they are interesting enough to appear in textbooks and have journal
articles devoted to them – rather than computational simplicity, have been processed in


44
  E.g., Carvajal, et al. (2014). In his lectures at the Cowles Foundation, mathematician Charles
Steinhorn (2008, p. 177) conjectures “…quantifier elimination is something that is do-able in
principle, but not by any computer that you and I are ever likely to see. Well, I’ll retract that last
statement because it’s probably false.” Using the same logic, Anai et al (2014, p. 7) claim –
incorrectly, as shown throughout this paper – that “[t]he practical limit to obtain a solution would
be at most five variables.”

                                                                                                   28
milliseconds. In my own research and teaching, the norm is that problems of this type are
processed orders of magnitude faster than the time it takes for me to type the
assumptions. Appendix III shows an example, based on a growth model with taxation,
whose CAD is in 41 dimensions, yet nonetheless is processed in milliseconds.
        With that said, the double-exponential property means that poor judgement and
brute force can produce economics problems whose CADs are overwhelmingly complex
for today’s computers. 45 Take the concave production function example II.A., using
quantifier elimination to prove, based on derivatives at a single point, that a
homogeneous and quasiconcave production function is a concave production function.
This example is a particularly tough test for quantifier-elimination methods because (a) it
concerns second-order properties of the model rather than first-order, and thereby more
polynomials of higher degree and (b) alternative proof strategies are available that avoid
any reference to second derivatives of the production function. 46 Nevertheless, assuming
that the production function has two inputs, the quantifier elimination (in seven
dimensions) from subsection II.A. takes at most a few dozen milliseconds on a laptop
computer (see the first row of Table 3).47 If three inputs were assumed, twelve variables
are quantified and the quantifier elimination occurs in about two minutes with
Mathematica, and a fraction of a second with REDLOG. However, neither software
package could eliminate quantifiers in the four-input case in less than five days of




45
   Complex in terms of having a large number of cells, and defining the cells with roots of high-
degree polynomials.
46
   See subsection II.D.
47
   Specifically, using the condensed notation (36), quantifiers are eliminated from

                                    ∀{𝑣1 , 𝑣2 , 𝑣3 , 𝑣4 , 𝑣5 , 𝑣6 , 𝑣7 }
                [(𝑣1 > 0 ∧ 𝑣2 > 0 ∧ 𝑣3 > 0 ∧ 𝑣5 > 0 ∧ 𝑣32 𝑣7 + 𝑣52 𝑣4 < 2𝑣3 𝑣5 𝑣6
                ∧ 𝑣2 𝑣4 + 𝑣1 𝑣6 = 0 ∧ 𝑣2 𝑣6 + 𝑣1 𝑣7 = 0)
                                         ⇒ (𝑣4 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣7 ≤ 0 ∧ 𝑣4 𝑣7 ≥ 𝑣62 )]

where the two equations are the second-order-term restrictions implied by homogeneity and are
derived by differentiating Euler’s theorem with respect to each input. The quantifier-free
equivalent is True (because all homogeneous and quasiconcave production functions are
concave).

                                                                                                29
processing (more than 100 million milliseconds; this case has 18 quantified variables).48
Here we see the double-exponential property.
        The CAD algorithm, especially when applied to universal sentences, is amenable
to parallel processing methods that can, in effect, move the “wall” to the right. For
example, an N-variable universal sentence has N! different sequences in which to
eliminate variables in the projection phase and there is no known generic formula for
determining which of these is the least complex. 49 Parallel processors can be used to,
among other things, simultaneously execute different elimination sequences and then
terminate all processes that are still running after the first process has completed.50
        Finally, the CAD algorithm is more general than needed for deciding universal
sentences, such as the economic examples provided in this paper. Quantifier-elimination
algorithms are being developed specifically for existential sentences, which are
equivalent to universal sentences (recall (7)) and known as the “existential theory of the
reals.” The complexity of the dedicated algorithms are “just” singly exponential in the
number of variables even without parallel processing. 51 These advances are not yet fully
incorporated into Mathematica and REDLOG software (Passmore & Jackson, 2009;
Davenport & England, 2015).52 As computing power increases and singly-exponential


48
   Subsection II.D. shows an alternative approach that expresses the general case (i.e., any number
of inputs, and a not-necessarily differentiable production function) in the polynomial framework
(5). As shown in Table 3, this approach eliminates 10 quantifiers in less than one second.
49
   C.W. Brown (2004). Mathematica and REDLOG have heuristics for guessing an elimination
sequence than might economize on computation, but were not used for the results reported in this
paper. Also note that the elimination sequence is irrelevant for symmetric a Tarski formula such
as (39); in my experience economic hypotheses are not so symmetric.
50
   When consecutive variables have the same quantifier, changing their order does not affect the
meaning of the formulated hypothesis, but it does affect features of the CAD, such as the number
of cells and the difficulty of the algebraic operations required to obtain it (Brown and Davenport
2007). Table 3 eliminates variables in alphabetical order (as sorted by Mathematica), which
generally does not minimize computation time. Algorithms for determining more efficient
elimination sequences, which are beyond the scope of this paper, can, for example, find a
sequence (and process it) for the four-input model in a few minutes as compared to more than
five days for elimination in alphabetical order.
51
   These decision problems are in PSPACE (Canny 1993). See Basu, Pollack and Roy (2011) for
a recent theoretical treatment of algorithms for deciding existential sentences.
52
   Separate from the CAD literature, computer scientists have (for the purpose of automatically
verifying software programs) developed non-CAD algorithms for deciding existential sentences.
Some of them, such as those competing at http://smtcomp.sourceforge.net in the QF-NRA
division, deal with nonlinear polynomials. In my experience, Microsoft’s Z3 is the most adept at
answering the economics questions, but still narrower than the primarily-CAD methods used by

                                                                                                30
algorithms are put into practice, it is likely that even larger economic problems will be
practically processed by quantifier elimination (Passmore, 2011, p. p. 100).




IV.D. The utility of leaving functional forms unspecified

        Ironically, specifying assumptions and hypotheses with particular functional
forms makes it more difficult to use the quantifier-elimination results. Take, for example,
the first derivative restriction f/x > 0 in the concave production function example. In
this form, it is a (trivial) polynomial inequality in the seven-dimensional space noted
above. If, instead, a production function were specified with transcendental marginal
product schedules, then we would no longer have a polynomial inequality in x and y.
Even a Cobb-Douglas production function with exponents  and  would have its first
derivative restriction entered as 𝛼𝑥 𝛼−1 𝑦 𝛽 > 0, which is not a polynomial inequality in
{,,x,y}. 53 Thus, while traditional “pencil-and-paper” proving approaches are many
times facilitated with functional-form assumptions, quantifier elimination in the Tarski-
Collins tradition is facilitated by avoiding them.
        Semi-algebraic economies include Cobb-Douglas utility and production functions
as long as their exponent parameters are rational numbers, because then statements about
those functions are special cases of polynomial inequalities. Still, for the purposes of
implementing quantifier elimination as we have outlined above, their approach is
unnecessarily complicated. First, the quantifier-elimination would have to be performed
with specific values of the exponent parameters. For example, the production function in
the Laffer curve example could be, say, n7/10, but then the quantifier-elimination result
would refer only to n7/10 and not to any other Cobb-Douglas production function, even
with rational coefficients.




Mathematica and REDLOG. For example, Z3 does not process the concave production function
problem with three production inputs in less than 1000 seconds.
53
   In this case, the marginal-product restrictions could be transformed to be of the form  > 0 and
 > 0, which are polynomials in { ,}, but more complicated statements about Cobb-Douglas
production functions cannot be simplified to restrictions on the exponents.

                                                                                                 31
        Second, a CAD for hypotheses about a production function having a rational
exponent is likely vastly more complicated than the CAD for the same hypothesis
expressed in terms of f(n). Take the rather simple (and True) hypothesis that, assuming a
Cobb-Douglas production function with a positive exponent, aggregate labor income is
increasing in the amount of labor. Expressed in terms of f(n), it is:



              (𝑤𝐿 = 𝑓 ′ (𝑛𝐿 ) > 0 ∧ 𝑤𝐻 = 𝑓 ′ (𝑛𝐻 ) > 0 ∧ 𝑛𝐿 > 𝑛𝐻 > 0

                                              𝑓 ′ (𝑛𝐿 )𝑛𝐿 𝑓 ′ (𝑛𝐻 )𝑛𝐻                       (49)
                  ∧ 𝑓 (𝑛𝐿 ) > 𝑓 (𝑛𝐻 ) > 0 ∧              =            )
                                                𝑓 (𝑛 𝐿 )     𝑓 (𝑛 𝐻 )
                                   ⇒ 𝑤𝐿 𝑛𝐿 > 𝑤𝐻 𝑛𝐻


where, as in the Laffer curve example, n denotes labor input and w the wage rate. The
second row of assumptions shows the relevant restrictions imposed by Cobb-Douglas:
positive output and a constant elasticity of output with respect to input.
        Deciding the hypothesis (49) with (an eight-dimensional) CAD takes a fraction of
a second because the number of inequalities is low and the polynomial degrees are no
more than three.54 Transforming (49) into a semi-algebraic economy by replacing f(n)
with n to a specific rational power reduces the dimensionality of the CAD, but can
increase the polynomial degree and thereby increase the decision time by orders of
magnitude. Figure 4 shows the relative decision times of the semi-algebraic model with
various production-function exponents.55 The decision time is, for example, five times
longer when f(n) is replaced with n5/8 (some of the polynomials are of degree 8), and
3,000 times longer when replaced with n23/30 (some of the polynamials are of degree 30).
        The unnecessary complexity of semi-algebraic production functions is even
greater in systems with more inequalities, such as the systems used above to examine the
Laffer curve. Table 4 shows some results of deciding the (True) hypothesis that a Cobb-
Douglas production function, together with the other assumptions (20) through (26),

54
  The eight dimensions are nL, nH, wL, wH, f(nL), f(nH), f(nL), and f (nH).
55
  The exponents, when simplified, have denominators ranging from 2 through 30 and numerator
equal to the integer making the exponent closest to 7/10 without changing the denominator. E.g.,
13/20 is used rather than 14/20, because the latter simplifies to 7/10. Note that the exponent
denominator is the degree of the polynomial in the Tarski formula.

                                                                                              32
guarantees that the lower tax rate is associated with greater utility. The Table’s first two
rows are the benchmarks with unspecified functional forms. The first row refers to a
generic production function f(n) that satisfies (23) and (24) as well as the elasticity
restriction ((wLnL  wHnH)(nL  nH)  0). 56 As shown in Table 3, the decision time with
REDLOG software is 190 milliseconds.57 The largest power on any one variable in the
polynomial system is only two, and no more than three variables are multiplied together
at the same time. For additional comparability with Cobb-Douglas, Table 4’s second row
also imposes that the elasticity is constant (i.e., labor’s share of output is the same at
allocations L and H). The second row shows a decision time of 380 milliseconds.
        The third and fourth rows use the production functions n1/2 and n2/3, respectively,
and results in the shorted decision times because quadratic and cubic formulas can be
used. The decision time is about the same with an exponent of 3/4. Several orders of
magnitude are added to decision times by using more complicated rational exponents,
such as 3/5 or 4/7. The table also shows how a more complicated rational exponent adds
to the degree of the polynomial system.
        As noted by Brown and Kubler (2008), any specific rational exponent allows
Cobb-Douglas production to fit into the Tarski framework. An irrational exponent would
not.   A symbolic exponent, e.g., , cannot be processed with Tarski and Collins
procedures either, because the degree of every polynomial must be known and specific in
order to apply the algorithms. But the generic functional form f(n) fits in the Tarski
framework as long as f and its relevant derivatives (at one or more points, as needed) are
each treated as a separate variable, because the production function restrictions take the
form of polynomials of a degree that is specific, known, and relatively low. This is an
example of the computation gains from “rais[ing] the level of abstraction” (Kroening and
Strichman 2008, p. v).




56
   The elastic restriction is imposed on the non-semi-algebraic benchmarks because (a) Cobb-
Douglas production functions satisfy it and (b) it affects the result (see above).
57
   Mathematica has more overhead computation – e.g., syntax processing and graphic renderings
– that make it less reliable for measuring decision times for decisions that are quick (the overhead
time is large in comparison to the actual calculations).

                                                                                                 33
V. Conclusions

        A number of economic hypotheses are, interpreted in the right space, quantified
(“for all”) statements about Tarski formulas, each of which is a quantifier-free Boolean
combination of polynomial inequalities.58 In order for an economic hypothesis to fit in
this framework, it must be stated in terms of properties of the model that are expressed as
a finite number of relationships among real numbers. For example, the hypothesis that,
for any supply-demand equilibrium in which the two curves have their usual slopes, a
downward supply shift increases the equilibrium quantity and decreases the equilibrium
price (Marshall 1895, Book V, Chapter XII) can be expressed in terms of the demand and
supply slopes in the neighborhood of an arbitrary equilibrium point, the quantity impact,
and the price impact, each of which is a real number.                   The same hypothesis can
alternatively be expressed in terms of relationships between two arbitrary points on the
supply curve and two corresponding points on the demand curve, without reference to
derivatives (see also Appendix IV). Either way, given that the equilibrium points are
arbitrary, and that the statements refer to all possible values of the real numbers, the truth
or falseness of the hypothesis tells us about the properties of supply and demand
functions on the parts of their domains that satisfy the slope assumptions.
        In other words, when Alfred Marshall and other early pioneers of formal
economic reasoning made (correct) if-then statements about human behavior, they were
implicitly eliminating “for all” quantifiers from a True sentence. 59 The contribution of
this paper is to make the quantifier elimination explicit and thereby bringing to bear
applicable tools from real algebraic geometry.
        Quantifier elimination algorithms automatically decide the truth of such
hypotheses in finite time, without approximation or functional-form assumptions. The
algorithms, especially Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD), can thereby also
help formulate and understand hypotheses by detecting inconsistent assumptions,

58
   See Davenport (2015) and Arai, et al. (2014) for a more systematic measurement of the
prevalence of problems that can be posed in this way.
59
   I use the phrase “implicit quantifier elimination” in the same way that Brown and Kubler
(2008, p. 4) do, but point out that it applies to if-then sentences, too, and thereby predates Afriat
(1967) in the economic literature.

                                                                                                    34
calculating necessary and sufficient conditions, and generating examples. For hypotheses
that involve optimization, inequality-intensive revealed preference expressions can, with
quantifier elimination, be as easy to process as equation-intensive local analysis, with the
added potential of arriving at global conclusions.
       These results are not merely hopeful conjectures for the practice of economic
theory. Software is already available for automatically eliminating quantifiers, which I
have incorporated into an economist-friendly interface running in Mathematica.60 All of
the hypotheses in this paper were refuted or verified merely by entering them as
assumptions (e.g., (20) – (27)) and potential implications (e.g, uL > uH). The interface
confirms the mutual consistency of the assumptions, returns True, False, or “True for
some [values], False for others,” and provides push-button options for further analysis.
Figure 5 is a Mathematica screen shot showing the processing of the monopolist’s pass-
through example.
       A wide range of economic hypotheses can be processed in this way, although
more work is needed to expand the range, and better understand the practical limits, of
economic hypotheses and proofs that can be automated with quantifier elimination. One
clear limitation of the methods in this paper is that the number of quantified variables
must be finite which, without variable changes or additional verification strategies (e.g.,
induction, fixed point, or limit arguments), rules out hypotheses that contain integrals or
infinite series. As shown by the concave production function example, some economic
hypotheses can be represented as quantifier elimination problems in multiple ways, and
thereby present a potential tradeoff between user effort (in assembling the Tarski
formula) and computational complexity.
       The quantifier-elimination methods in this paper deliver conclusions, but a
conclusion is not the same as a concise proof.         The steps of cylindrical algebraic
decomposition construction are themselves a proof, and the CAD can be displayed by
quantifier-elimination software. Some CADs have just one cell and thereby immediately
show the steps of a concise proof (see subsection IV.B.3), but other CADs are
complicated enough that the proof represented by their construction is too lengthy and

60
  The Mathematica package is obtained by executing Get["http://economicreasoning.com"] at a
Mathematica prompt. The package has already been used to generate substantive conclusions
about the economy (Mulligan and Tsui 2016).

                                                                                          35
tedious for a human reader to appreciate or practically verify. But even in those cases
quantifier elimination could be of tremendous assistance to someone attempting to
construct a concise proof by: confirming that a hypothesis is provable, investigating the
equivalence of one hypothesis with another, incrementally eliminating or modifying
assumptions to see which of them are binding, verifying any number of intermediate
results that may serve as one of the steps in the proof, and automatically generating
examples.61
        Human error can result in logically or mathematically erroneous conclusions from
economic theory, whether those conclusions were generated with a machine or with
pencil and paper.      In the latter approach, a diligent reader, editor, or referee, also
operating with pencil and paper, has been required to detect and correct publication
errors. Human errors could in principle be embedded in quantifier-elimination software
(Davenport & England, 2015), although CAD methods can decide any universal sentence
with two different methods (i.e., the left- and right-hand sides of (7) involve different
CAD software steps) and each of those decisions can be processed in N! different
sequences (N is the number of quantified variables).             Moreover, multiple software
packages are available to perform the same calculation (this paper uses both Mathematica
and REDLOG), not to mention the fact that the owners of commercial software packages
have both the opportunity and incentive to find and correct software errors. 62 In some
instances, such as the hypotheses represented with single-celled CADs, the machine-
generated output is itself a practical guide to confirming its conclusion with pencil and
paper. Also note that empirical economics publications already include dozens, if not
hundreds, of matrix inversions that are never verified with pencil and paper or even with
an alternative software package. Perhaps economic theory will follow a similar path.




61
   Some of the non-CAD methods for deciding existential sentences do routinely provide proofs,
but those methods so far appear to be more limited in the practical range of economic problems
that they can process.
62
   If the machine-generated conclusion is that either an example or counter example exists, then
this can readily be verified with pencil and paper because the software provides the example (see
also Appendix I).

Appendix I. A non-monotonic Laffer curve

       In the Laffer-curve model shown in the main text, it is possible for a higher tax
rate to be associated with more utility, holding revenue constant, if leisure is not a normal
good and the production function is concave enough in labor. This appendix illustrates
this possibility by taking a specific production function that is piecewise linear, and
therefore especially concave at the point where the marginal product of labor changes. It
also takes a specific utility function for which leisure is an inferior good over some range
that includes the kink in the production function.
       The utility function is:
                                  3        𝑛 2
                     𝑢(𝑐, 𝑛) =      ln 𝑐 −   − (2𝑐 − 1)2 𝑛3 + 1                         (50)
                                  4        50 3


       The production function is (for n > 0):


                                              1 4
                             𝑓 (𝑛) = min {𝐴𝑛 + , 𝑛}                                     (51)
                                              5 5


where A is normalized so that the efficient amount of labor is one and greater than the
labor at the kink point:
                                𝜕𝑢/𝜕𝑛               4
                            −         |         =𝐴<                                     (52)
                                𝜕𝑢/𝜕𝑐 𝑐=𝐴+1,𝑛=1     5
                                            5



Note that, everywhere along the production function, consumption is a good, labor is a
bad, and preferences are convex.
       The Laffer curve for this economy can be calculated parametrically by mapping
each point (n,c) on the production function with n  (0,1), except the kink, to a point on
the Laffer curve. The tax rate  at a point is the percentage gap between the marginal rate
of substitution and the marginal product w. The transfer amount at the same point is the
product wn.
       A range of wage rates, tax rates and transfer amounts are consistent with a
competitive equilibrium at the production function kink. All of these points have the
same equilibrium work, consumption, and utility.
                                                                                          37
           Utility rises with n along the production function as long as n < 1. At the kink
point, utility is ukink.63 Figures 6a and 6b show the resulting Laffer curve with differing
degrees of detail, using red to show utility (and therefore labor) that is less than its value
at the kink point. Utility at (above) the kink are shown as black and green, respectively.
Of course, utility at a zero tax rate (on the green part of the Laffer curve) is greater than it
is at a 100 percent tax rate (on the red part). Nevertheless, the fine-detail Figure 6b
shows most clearly that the green (low-utility) part of the Laffer curve is sometimes to
the left of the red part. This possibility shows why (20) through (27) by themselves are
not sufficient to imply that uL > uH.

           Equation (36), using the condensed notation of Table 1 and reproduced below,
shows a set representing the (not necessarily True) hypothesis CAD that quasiconcave
two-input production functions are concave.

The quantifier-free representation of the set is the disjunction of two terms. The details
of the second term are:

Equation (48), reproduced below (and also using the condensed notation from Table 1), is
a CAD for the set representing the intersection of the assumption and hypothesis above.

Output in each period is an additively separable function of capital k and labor n.64 Given
an initial capital stock k1, first period output can be used to consume (privately c, or
publicly g) or accumulate capital. Second period output and capital are consumed:

than 300 milliseconds (see the final row of Table 3), shows that the hypothesis is True. It
also shows that the hypothesis is not always True if either the Laffer curve assumptions
or the normal-goods assumptions are removed. 66




66
  Intuitively, a permanent increase in government consumption has both a wealth effect and a
substitution effect. The Laffer curve and normal goods assumptions guarantee that both effects
on labor are in the same direction.

Appendix IV. Two Classic Examples
       Economics is replete with hypotheses that can be expressed in the real quantifier
elimination framework (5). This appendix briefly shows two more of them, drawn from
some of the most famous hypotheses in economics: Alfred Marshall’s equilibrium
comparative statics and Anthony Downs’ Median Voter Theorem.
       Marshall (1895, Book V, Chapter XII) concluded that, for any supply-demand
equilibrium in which the two curves have their usual slopes, a downward supply shift
increases the equilibrium quantity q and decreases the equilibrium price p. A local-
comparative-statics version of Marshall’s result is:


                                                        𝕕𝑞 𝕕𝑝
                                  ∀ {𝑑′ (𝑞), 𝑠 ′ (𝑞),     , }
                                                        𝕕𝑎 𝕕𝑎
                                𝕕               𝕕𝑝   𝕕           𝕕𝑞     𝕕𝑝            (66)
 [(𝑑′ (𝑞) < 0 ∧ 𝑠 ′ (𝑞) ≥ 0 ∧      [𝑠(𝑞) − 𝑎] =    =   𝑑(𝑞)) ⇒ (    >0∧    < 0)]
                                𝕕𝑎              𝕕𝑎 𝕕𝑎            𝕕𝑎     𝕕𝑎

                 = 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒


where the inverse demand and supply curves are d(q) and s(q)  a, respectively (i.e., the
parameter a shifts the supply curve down). The first two assumptions are local slope
assumptions. The third says that a perturbs the equilibrium. A global version of the
result requires nine variables rather than four:


                     ∀{𝑎, 𝑑(𝑞𝐻 ), 𝑠(𝑞𝐻 ), 𝑞𝐻 , 𝑝𝐻 , 𝑑(𝑞𝐿 ), 𝑠(𝑞𝐿 ), 𝑞𝐿 , 𝑝𝐿 }
 [([𝑑(𝑞𝐿 ) − 𝑑(𝑞𝐻 )](𝑞𝐿 − 𝑞𝐻 ) < 0 ∧ [𝑠(𝑞𝐿 ) − 𝑠(𝑞𝐻 )](𝑞𝐿 − 𝑞𝐻 ) ≥ 0 ∧ 𝑎 > 0          (67)
 ∧ 𝑠(𝑞𝐻 ) = 𝑝𝐻 = 𝑑(𝑞𝐻 ) ∧ 𝑠(𝑞𝐿 ) − 𝑎 = 𝑝𝐿 = 𝑑(𝑞𝐿 )) ⇒ (𝑞𝐿 > 𝑞𝐻 ∧ 𝑝𝐿 < 𝑝𝐻 )] = 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒


The first two assumptions are global slope assumptions. The last three say that the L
equilibrium differs from the H equilibrium by a downward supply shift in the amount a.
       In Downs’ (1957) model, public policy g is one dimensional.              Voters are
heterogeneous, with single-peaked policy preferences that align them from left to right.
The continuous CDF F(g) denotes the fraction of the electorate whose preferred policy is




                                                                                       42
no greater than g. Each of two candidates L, R proposes a policy, which for brevity I take
to be distinct with gL < gR.67 The proof by quantifier elimination is:


                                  ∀{𝑣𝐿 , 𝐹(𝑔𝐿 ), 𝑣𝑅 , 𝐹 (𝑔𝑅 )}

 [(0 ≤ 𝐹 (𝑔𝐿 ) < 𝐹 (𝑔𝑅 ) ≤ 1 ∧ 𝑣𝐿 + 𝑣𝑅 = 1 ∧ [𝐹(𝑔𝐿 ) < 𝐹 (𝑔𝑅 ) ⇒ 𝐹 (𝑔𝐿 ) < 𝑣𝐿 < 𝐹 (𝑔𝑅 )])
                                                                                               (68)
                                 1                        1
                 ⇒ ([𝐹 (𝑔𝐿 ) =     ⇒ 𝑣𝐿 > 𝑣𝑅 ] ∧ [𝐹(𝑔𝑅 ) = ⇒ 𝑣𝑅 > 𝑣𝐿 ])] = 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒
                                 2                        2


where vL and vR denote the vote shares received by the left and right candidates,
respectively. The first assumption is a normalization plus the relevant properties of a
cumulative density function.       The second assumption reflects the arithmetic of vote
shares in a two-candidate election. The final assumption is single-peaked preferences:
voters choose the candidate whose proposal is closest to their preference (see also
(Acemoglu and Robinson 2006, Definition 4.1)). 68                 The hypothesis asserts that
whichever, if any, candidate’s policy is at the median is the election winner.




67
   I leave it to the reader to show how the Tarski formula could be amended to allow for the
additional possibility of gL = gR.
68
   Note that, for the purposes of proving the theorem, we do not have to specify how the voters
between gL and gR vote, except that some of them vote left and others vote right (hence the strict
inequality surrounding vL).

numbers, where N is the number of dimensions needed to represent the model, and
typically take longer to decide than existential sentences. Computer time was

Note : The elastic labor demand specification is (w1n1-w2n2)(n1-n2)>0. The constant
elastic labor demand specification also has (w1n1c2=w2n2c1). Max own degree is the
maximum exponent on any one variable in the polynomial system. Term degree is the
sum of exponents on all variables in a mononomial (max refers to the mononomial with
the greatest term degree). Note that equation (27) is not part of these systems.
