                                              ABSTRACT

Recently a market in options based on CPI inflation (inflation caps and floors) has emerged in the
US. This paper uses quotes on these derivatives to construct probability densities for inflation. We
study how these pdfs respond to news announcements, and find that the implied odds of deflation are
sensitive to certain macroeconomic news releases. We compare the option-implied probability densities
with those obtained by time series methods, and use this information to construct empirical pricing
kernels. The options-implied densities assign considerably more mass to extreme inflation outcomes
(either deflation or high inflation) than do their time series counterparts. This yields a U-shaped empirical
pricing kernel, with investors having high marginal utility in states of the world characterized by either
deflation or high inflation.

1    Introduction

Fifteen years ago, the US Treasury began issuing index-linked debt. The spreads be-

tween the yields on these Treasury Inﬂation Protected Securities (TIPS) and the yields

on their nominal counterparts—known as inflation compensation or breakevens—have

become widely used as a real-time measure of investors’ inﬂation expectations. They

are commonly cited by Federal Reserve oﬃcials. A growing literature attempts to de-

compose these into inﬂation expectations, inﬂation risk premia and liquidity premia

(see, Gürkaynak, Sack and Wright (2010), Pﬂueger and Viceira (2011), Campbell,

Sunderam and Viceira (2010), Christensen, Lopez and Rudebusch (2010), D’Amico,

Kim and Wei (2010), Grishchenko and Huang (2012) among others). Subsequently

an over-the-counter market in inﬂation swaps emerged (Fleckenstein, Longstaﬀ and

Lustig (2010)). These are contracts where one party agrees to pay an interest rate

on a notional underlying principle that is ﬁxed at the start of the contract, while the

other party agrees to pay the realized inﬂation rate on that same notional principle.

Only the net of the two amounts actually changes hands. Under risk-neutrality, the

ﬁxed rate should equal expected inﬂation over the life of the contract.

     Much more recently, a new market has emerged that is potentially considerably

more powerful in providing direct market-based measures of investors’ inﬂation beliefs.

It is the market for inﬂation caps and floors—option-like securities whose payoﬀ is

tied to the realized inﬂation rate. The market developed ﬁrst in the euro area and the

UK, but has expanded in the US during the last few years. This is no doubt in part

because of heightened investor concerns about the possibilities of deﬂation or of high



                                          1
inﬂation in the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis. Unlike TIPS or inﬂation swaps, these new

inﬂation derivatives provide direct information about the whole probability density for

inﬂation, not just inﬂation expectations. This is naturally of great potential interest

to a forward-looking central bank with an inﬂation objective.

        In this paper, we use prices of inﬂation ﬂoors and caps to form implied probabil-

ity density functions (pdfs) for inﬂation at diﬀerent maturities, at the daily frequency

over the last 2-1/2 years. While the sample period is short, it is of course a period

of exceptional turbulence in the US economy and ﬁnancial markets.

        Our emphasis is on the economic interpretation of these inﬂation pdfs. In an

event-study approach, we relate them to macroeconomic news announcements, ﬁnding

that certain news announcements signiﬁcantly impact the implied probabilities of

deﬂation, and of high inﬂation. We construct a measure of FOMC announcement-day

surprises and ﬁnd that these do not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on implied pdfs. However,

the inﬂation pdfs did change over the time period that the market expectations about

the second round of large scale asset purchases or LSAP-2 were formed in the fall of

2010.

        These implied inﬂation pdfs are worked out under an assumption of risk-neutrality.

We can however compare the pdfs to the density forecasts that would be formed by an

econometrician. We ﬁnd that our option-implied pdfs put substantially more weight

on both high inﬂation and on deﬂation than their objective counterparts. That im-

plies that the pricing kernel of investors is U-shaped in inﬂation, with investors having

high marginal utility in both the state of the world where inﬂation is high and in the

deﬂationary state.


                                             2
          The plan for the remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses the

inﬂation ﬂoors and caps, and the extraction of the implied pdfs. Section 3 is an

event-study analysis that relates these pdfs to certain news announcements. Section

4 compares the option-implied pdfs to econometric-based “physical” density forecasts,

in order to obtain an empirical pricing kernel. Section 5 contains some robustness

checks and extensions, while section 6 concludes.


2         Inflation Caps and Floors

Throughout this paper, we will work with zero-coupon inﬂation ﬂoors and caps; these

are analytically by far the most convenient forms of these securities to work with. A

zero-coupon inﬂation cap is a contract entered into at time t. The seller of the cap

promises to pay a fraction max((1 + π(n))n − (1 + k)n , 0) of a notional underlying

principle as a single payment in n years’ time, where π(n) denotes the average annual

CPI inﬂation rate1 from t to t + n, and k denotes the strike of the cap. Without loss

of generality, we normalize the notional underlying principle to $1. In exchange for

this, the buyer makes an up-front payment of Pt (k, n). The buyer receives collateral

to ensure that they will receive their payment at the end of the contract. Obviously,

if inﬂation ends up being lower than k, then the option expires out-of-the money and

ends up being worthless. A zero-coupon inﬂation ﬂoor is identical, except that the

payment is max((1 + k)n − (1 + π(n))n , 0).

          The market for inﬂation ﬂoors and caps is still in its infancy. The nominal

Treasury market is far more liquid than the TIPS market, which is in turn more

    1
        Headline CPI, not seasonally adjusted.


                                                 3
liquid than the market for inﬂation swaps, and that is in turn more liquid than the

market for inﬂation ﬂoors and caps. Still, according to a dealer, about $22 billion

of notional principle was traded in the inter-dealer market in 2011, which represents

an increase of around 200% from 2010. Economists have a strong presumption that

the prices that individuals are willing to pay reﬂect their beliefs, even when the

stakes may not be that high. In experimental game theory, it is common to study

individuals’ behavior when tiny sums are at stake. Prediction markets are a good

example of cases in which the stakes are small, but there is strong evidence that prices

are nonetheless quite informative (Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2004)). The dollar trading

volumes in inﬂation derivatives are minuscule relative to the Treasury market, but

still big enough to presumably reﬂect the beliefs of traders in this market, and far

bigger than those in experimental games and in prediction markets.

      It is hard to know who are the participants in the market for inﬂation ﬂoors and

caps. However, based on SEC ﬁlings, we can see that mutual funds and insurance

companies participate in this market. They both buy and sell protection against both

inﬂation and deﬂation. For example, PIMCO has written a substantial amount of

inﬂation ﬂoors.

      We obtained daily quotes on zero-coupon inﬂation caps at strike prices of 1, 2,

3, 4, 5 and 6 percent, and on zero-coupon inﬂation ﬂoors at strike prices of -2, -1,

0, 1, 2 and 3 percent.2 The maturities are 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years. The data were

kindly provided to us by BGC Partners. The sample period is from October 6, 2009

   2
     Anecdotal reports suggest that the most actively traded ﬂoors and caps are currently those at
0 and 5 percent strikes, respectively.



                                                4
to March 27, 2012.

      We use these quotes to form implied pdfs for inﬂation, but without assuming

normality, as it is especially useful to have measures of investors’ perceptions of tail

outcomes. Our approach to forming the implied pdfs is a simple one based on the

methodology of Breeden and Litzenberger (1979). Let us suppose that inﬂation over

the next n years can be approximated as having only integer support. If we consider

a butterfly portfolio that involves buying caps with strikes of k − 1 percent and k + 1

percent while shorting two caps with a strike of k percent, then this is a pure Arrow-

Debreu security with a payoﬀ of $1 if inﬂation is k percent and zero otherwise, for

any integer k. Let pk,n denote the probability that π(n) = k. A risk-neutral investor

will pay e−rn n pk,n for this Arrow-Debreu security, where rn denotes the continuously-

compounded interest rate for n years. As the ﬁnal payment is secured by collateral,

we wanted to use a risk-free rate for discounting, and so discount by the nominal

Treasury term structure, using the dataset of Gürkaynak, Sack and Wright (2007).

      This mechanically gives us the risk-neutral probabilities of inﬂation being -2, -1,

0, ....5 percent. As for the tails, if an investor buys an inﬂation cap at 5 percent and

shorts one at 6 percent, then this investor receives $1 if inﬂation is 6 percent or more

and zero otherwise. This gives the probability of inﬂation being 6 percent or higher.

The same works in the left tail as well, yielding the probability of inﬂation being

-2 percent or lower. Thus we have essentially the whole term structure of inﬂation

pdfs.3

   3
     There also exist year-over-year inﬂation ﬂoors and caps, securities in which the payment is
based on the diﬀerence between the strike price and actual inﬂation in each year over the life of
the contract. It is possible to use these to form implied inﬂation pdfs (Mercurio (2005), Mercurio


                                                5
      Figures 1 and 2 show the resulting pdfs at all the available maturities on two

sample days—June 10, 2010 and February 28, 2011, respectively. The implied pdf in

June 2010 put substantial odds on deﬂation over the medium term, and was clearly

skewed to the left.     This is likely in part at least indicative of the concerns about

further disinﬂation that prompted the Fed to introduce LSAP-2 (also sometimes re-

ferred to as QE2) later in that year. In contrast, in February 2011, the implied pdf

was more symmetric, and indeed appeared to be approximately normal. The implied

pdfs shown in Figures 1 and 2 both exhibit quite high variance. For example, the

implied standard deviation of average inﬂation over the next ten years is about 1.5

percentage points in both ﬁgures. That seems high, though of course concerns about

inﬂation becoming unanchored, in either direction, have been elevated over this pe-

riod. It is important to remember that these implied pdfs are based on an assumption

that agents are risk neutral. More about this in section 4.

      As another way to report evolving perceptions of inﬂation risk that does not

focus on two arbitrarily chosen days, we can plot the probability of deﬂation (deﬁned

here as inﬂation falling to 0 percent and below) against time (Figure 3) and the

probability of high inﬂation (deﬁned as inﬂation rising to 4 percent and above) against

time (Figure 4). At the one-year horizon, the implied probability of deﬂation was

high in 2010 and fell in 2011.       The odds of deﬂation at longer horizons rose in late

2010 and again in late 2011, which were both times of considerable concern about

the durability of the economic recovery in the wake of ongoing ﬁnancial turmoil. The

odds of high inﬂation rose at all horizons in late 2010 and early 2011, before dropping

and Moreni (2006), Kruse (2011)), but it is much harder. Meanwhile, our focus in this paper is not
on the mechanics of extracting the risk-neutral inﬂation pdfs per se, but rather on their economic
interpretation.

2.1     The Embedded Deflation Option in TIPS

A diﬀerent source of information about inﬂation risks is available from TIPS. TIPS

bonds have the property that the principal repayment cannot be less than the face

value of the bond, even if the price level falls over the life of the bond. This gives TIPS

an option-like feature in which the “strike price” is the reference CPI (the price level

at the time that the bond is issued). For a newly issued bond, any deﬂation will result

in this option being in the money. For a bond issued, say, ﬁve years ago, however, the

deﬂation has to have been very severe—enough to unwind all the cumulative inﬂation

over the past ﬁve years—before this deﬂation option has any value. Thus comparing

the real yields on pairs of TIPS with comparable maturity dates but diﬀerent reference

CPIs contains information about the odds of deﬂation (again under risk-neutrality).

At times during recent years, these spreads such pairs of TIPS bonds traded at quite

diﬀerent yields, indicating substantial odds of deﬂation and/or a big deﬂation risk

premium. Authors that have used the embedded-option in TIPS to measure the

odds of deﬂation under risk neutrality include Wright (2009), Christensen, Lopez and

Rudebusch (2011) and Grishchenko, Vanden and Zhang (2011). The TIPS market

is more liquid than the market in inﬂation ﬂoors and caps. But the information on

inﬂation risks that can be gleaned from comparing TIPS is far more limited; it only

gives odds of deﬂation, not a complete pdf. And the comparison of TIPS yields could

be aﬀected by other factors, such as diﬀerences in liquidity across TIPS securities,

                                               7
and the fact that no two TIPS have exactly the same maturity date (so that the

comparison could be distorted by the seasonal pattern in CPI). Thus, in this paper,

we use inﬂation ﬂoors and caps rather than comparison of TIPS yields as they are a

much cleaner and more complete measure of investor perceptions of inﬂation risks.


3    Events that Move the Inflation PDFs

While asset prices ought to be related to economic fundamentals, the link between

the two is often frustratingly diﬃcult to uncover. But the high-frequency reaction

of asset prices to macroeconomic news announcements can represent a rich source of

information about the relationship between ﬁnancial asset prices and our measures of

economic fundamentals. In a small window around a major news announcement, the

announcement swamps any other public or private information that becomes avail-

able, and so relating the surprise component of this announcement to the change in

asset prices is akin to a “natural experiment”. For example, it is notoriously hard

to relate exchange rates to any fundamentals. Nonetheless, Andersen, Bollerslev,

Diebold and Vega (2003) ﬁnd that in short intradaily windows around macroeconomic

news announcements, there is a systematic relationship between macroeconomic sur-

prises and exchange rate changes.

     Accordingly, we relate daily changes in our implied inﬂation pdfs to nine leading

macroeconomic announcements. Table 1 lists the announcements, their frequency

and release times. For all announcements other than the FOMC announcement, the

surprise component of each announcement is measured as the real-time actual value

less the median expectation from the survey conducted by Money Market Services


                                          8
(MMS) on the previous Friday. For the FOMC announcement, we are faced with the

diﬃculty that this is the period at which the federal funds rate is stuck at the zero

bound—any properly measured monetary policy surprises based on the federal funds

would necessarily be identically equal to zero. But the FOMC announcements over

this period contain information about the expected duration of the zero interest rate

period and also about Fed asset purchases. As in Wright (2011), we quantify the

surprise components of these announcements by the ﬁrst principal component of the

intraday change in the yields on two-, ﬁve-, ten- and thirty-year Treasury futures from

15 minutes before the time of the FOMC announcement to 1 hour and 45 minutes

afterwards.5 It is hard to see how these jumps in yields owe to anything other than

the FOMC announcements.            The FOMC announcements that we consider include

both FOMC meetings and important speeches by FOMC members relating to the

outlook for monetary policy.

       The event-study regressions that we run are of the form:


                                   ∆pk,n,t = ΣJj=1 βj sjt + εt                                (1)

where ∆pk,n,t is the risk-neutral probability of deﬂation, or of inﬂation exceeding 4

percent over the next n years, as of day t, while sjt denotes the surprise component

of an announcement of type j. The regression is run over all days where there is at

least one news announcement: the surprise is set to zero for news types for which

there is not an announcement on that day. The device of regressing yield changes

on surprise components of all diﬀerent types of announcements jointly accommodates

   5
    These are normalized so that a drop in the level of interest rates around the FOMC corresponds
to a positive surprise.

                                                9
the possibility of multiple announcements coming out concurrently.

       The results are shown in Table 2 (for deﬂation) and Table 3 (for high inﬂation).

The probabilities are in percentage points, the macroeconomic surprises are in the

units listed in Table 1. For example, the eﬀect of a CPI surprise on the deﬂation

probability at the one-year horizon is reported as -10.94. This means that if CPI were

to come in a full percentage point above expectations (a very big surprise indeed),

then the implied the probability of negative CPI inﬂation over the next 12 months

would fall by 10.94 percentage points.6

       For all of the macroeconomic surprises that we consider, a positive surprise

corresponds to higher-than-expected economic activity/inﬂation. It is not surprising

that most estimates in Table 2 are negative; surprises indicating more strength in

aggregate demand lower the perceived risk of deﬂation. At the one-year horizon,

CPI is the only macroeconomic surprise that has a signiﬁcant impact on deﬂation

risk—of course CPI surprises should mechanically have an eﬀect on deﬂation risk,

since inﬂation caps and ﬂoors are based on the CPI. At longer horizons, higher than

expected releases of existing home sales, nonfarm payrolls, PPI and retail sales all

signiﬁcantly lower the perceived odds of deﬂation. FOMC surprises do not have any

statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on deﬂation risk. One of the channels through which un-

conventional monetary policy was intended to support the economy was by lowering

the risk of deﬂation. That eﬀect does not show up in the approach considered here, in

   6
    Strictly, an h-year inﬂation cap or ﬂoor refers to the h-year inﬂation rate starting about two
months before the start date of the contract. This indexation lag is familiar to inﬂation-related assets
and is necessitated by delays in compiling CPI data. But of course this means that a surprise in the
CPI index for the last month enters directly into the cap/ﬂoor payoﬀ and so should mechanically
have a big eﬀect on the pdf, especially at shorter horizons.


                                                  10
which we link derivative-based inﬂation probabilities and FOMC-day surprises con-

structed from Treasury futures. It should be noted, however, that the expectations

about unconventional monetary policy over our sample period were shaped not only

by FOMC announcements but also by other factors such as speeches by the Federal

Reserve oﬃcials and discussions in the media.7 Indeed, inﬂation probability distribu-

tions became more skewed toward higher inﬂation outcomes during the period from

late August to early November 2010, over which expectations for LSAP-2 were priced

in by investors. On the day of the actual LSAP-2 announcement, Nov. 3 of 2010,

deﬂation odds fell and probability of high inﬂation rose slightly.

      Most of the estimates in Table 3 are positive; surprises indicating more strength

in aggregate demand raise the perceived risk of inﬂation exceeding 4 percent. The

eﬀects of CPI surprises on the perceived probability of high inﬂation at the one- and

three-year horizons are both statistically signiﬁcant. But, apart from existing home

sales, no other macroeconomic surprises have any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the odds of

high inﬂation at horizons below ten years.

      Overall, there is a bit more evidence of deﬂation probabilities being sensitive

to macroeconomic news than for high inﬂation probabilities being sensitive to news,

at least at medium horizons (three to seven years). Perhaps this is a result that is

particular to the sample period. News about demand may have had a heightened

impact on investors’ perceptions of the odds of the economy becoming stuck in a

deﬂationary spiral, which would not be the case at a time when the economy was far

   7
     See, for example, a Bloomberg article of October 28, 2010, by Rebecca Christie and Craig
Torres for a snapshot of market expectations regarding additional monetary stimulus shortly before
the FOMC meeting of November 2010, at which the LSAP-2 was announced.


                                               11
from the zero lower bound.

        Table 4 lists the days of the ten biggest absolute changes in the options-implied

odds of deﬂation or high inﬂation at the ten-year horizon. For these days, we went

back and searched Wrightson ICAP daily summaries of ﬁnancial markets for news

stories that could help explain the change. The possible contributory factors that we

found are also listed in Table 4. There are some cases in which changes in option-

implied odds are consistent with news stories. For example, the ﬂuctuations in the

odds of deﬂation in October 2010 can be at least partially explained by shifting

speculation about the size of the LSAP-2 program that the FOMC was expected

to announce at its meeting on November 3 of that year. At the same time, most

substantial changes in the inﬂation pdfs occurred on days when it is hard to ﬁnd

news or an event that provides even a partial plausible explanation. It is however

a long-standing puzzle that news announcements can explain only a small share of

asset price variation, and indeed that the biggest asset price movements occur in the

absence of any apparent public information (Fair (2002)).

        One might wonder if the announcement by the FOMC of a 2 percent long-run

goal for inﬂation on January 25, 2012 aﬀected these probability densities. They were

little changed on the day of the announcement, and indeed over several subsequent

days.


4       Inflation Risk Premia

The implied pdfs that we have obtained are based on the assumption of risk-neutrality.

In standard ﬁnance terminology, they are obtained under the Q measure. Agents are


                                            12
presumably not risk neutral, and so the probabilities will diﬀer from a physical density

forecast (the P measure). As is well known, the risk-neutral probability of a particular

state of the world is equal to the physical probability times the pricing kernel, in that

state of the world. Outcomes in which the marginal utility of an investor is high

will be overweighted under the Q measure. The ratio of the estimated pdf under

the Q measure to that under the P measure represents the empirical pricing kernel

(Rosenberg and Engle (2002)).

      We consider four diﬀerent time series approaches to form a physical density

forecast for inﬂation. These are:

1. The unobserved component stochastic volatility model (UCSV), which Stock and

Watson (2007) ﬁnd to provide good forecasts for inﬂation. The model is univariate.

Inﬂation is πt , which can be decomposed as:

                                        πt = τt + σT,t ηtT

and

                                       τt = τt−1 + σP,t ηtP

where (ηtT , ηtP )′ is iidN (0, I2 ), log(σT,t+1
                                           2              2
                                                 ) = log(σT,t                 2
                                                              ) + ψ1,t , log(σP,t+1          2
                                                                                    ) = log(σP,t )+

ψ2,t and (ψ1,t , ψ2,t )′ is iidN (0, γI2 ), with (ηtT , ηtP )′ and (ψ1,t , ψ2,t )′ being mutually

independent. The model can be ﬁtted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, and

can be used to simulate a density forecast for inﬂation. Following Stock and Watson

(2007), the parameter γ is ﬁxed at 0.2.

tion between ηtT and ψ1,t is ρ1 and the correlation between ηtP and ψ2,t is ρ2 . This

                                                13
introduces a leverage eﬀect. We refer to this as the UCSV model with correlated er-

rors (UCSV-CE), and use the algorithm of Omori et al. (2007) to obtain the posterior

distribution of the parameters, which we then use to simulate a density forecast.8

3. An AR(4) model for inﬂation, with an EGARCH speciﬁcation for the errors. The

UCSV model allows the density forecasts to be fat-tailed, but restricts them to be

symmetric. The AR-EGARCH speciﬁcation loosens this restriction.

4. The VAR model with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility, proposed

by Primiceri (2005). The VAR uses real-time data on quarterly CPI inﬂation, the

federal funds rate and the unemployment rate. Following Primiceri, the speciﬁcation

has two lags and coeﬃcients that follow random walks, while the error terms exhibit

stochastic volatility. The VAR is constrained to be stationary in every period. We

evaluate the posterior distribution of the parameters, and then use this to simulate a

density forecast for inﬂation.

In Figure 1, we reported the options-implied pdfs for inﬂation, as of June 10, 2010.

Figures 5-8 plot the corresponding physical pdfs for inﬂation based on the UCSV,

UCSV-CE, AR-EGARCH and TVP-VAR models, respectively, using the CPI data

that were available as of that date.9 Figures 9-12 plot the ratio of the options-implied

to these physical pdfs, which represent estimates of the empirical pricing kernel.

       The physical pdfs in Figure 5-8 assign low odds to tail outcomes, especially for

   8
    Note that our forecast density takes account of parameter uncertainty—we use draws of the
parameters from their posterior distribution. The priors for ρ1 and ρ2 are independent and uniform
on [-1,1].
   9
   These use CPI inﬂation data from the start of 1960 up to April 2010, the last available data on
June 10, 2010.


                                               14
the AR-EGARCH speciﬁcation (Figure 6). Note that this is a stationary speciﬁcation.

The density forecast for average inﬂation over the horizon h that is implied by the

AR-EGARCH model converges by construction to a degenerate distribution equal

to the sample average of inﬂation in the limit as h goes to inﬁnity. This is not

true for any of the other models, which all allow for a slowly varying local mean of

inﬂation. The UCSV and TVP-VAR models both imply symmetric density forecasts,

by construction. That is not true for the UCSV-CE and AR-EGARCH models,

although their density forecasts show little sign of skewness.

      For any of the four physical pdfs in Figures 5-8, the tail outcomes have lower

odds under the P measure than under the Q measure. The direct implication of this

is that the empirical pricing kernel is very high for both severe deﬂation outcomes

and for high inﬂation outcomes (Figures 9-12). The empirical pricing kernel is thus

generally U-shaped, although the relative marginal utilities in the deﬂationary and

inﬂationary tails depends on the method that is used to form the forecast under the

P measure.

      These empirical pricing kernel results apply, of course, only to one day.         To

investigate the question over the rest of the sample period, we show the options-

implied and physical probabilities of deﬂation over the whole sample (Figure 13)

and, likewise, the options-implied and physical probabilities of inﬂation exceeding 4

percent (Figure 14). The physical probabilities are obtained in both cases from the

UCSV model. The options-implied probabilities of deﬂation are consistently above

the physical probabilities. It’s perhaps a little less stark for the odds of high inﬂation.

However, the options-implied probabilities of high inﬂation are nearly always above


                                            15
the physical probabilities, at horizons beyond one year.            So the U-shaped pricing

kernel does not apply to one day alone.

      The U-shaped pricing kernel in turn has implications for the risk premia in

nominal bonds. We have found direct and model-free evidence that investors view

both high inﬂation and deﬂation as states of the world in which their marginal utility

is high. Consequently, assets that pay oﬀ in these scenarios are valuable hedges.

Nominal bonds are assets whose real value is eroded by high inﬂation, but which do

well in a deﬂationary environment. Until recently, deﬂation seemed a very remote

possibility, and so over the range of plausible inﬂation outcomes, investors would

have seen marginal utility as upward sloping, leading nominal bonds to command a

positive risk premium. But in the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis, there are substantial

odds of both high inﬂation and deﬂation, and that should make the risk premium on

nominal bonds be lower, or even negative. Using a quite diﬀerent approach Campbell,

Sunderam and Viceira (2010) argue that nominal bonds have recently switched from

being exposed to inﬂation risk (with positive term premia) to being deﬂation hedges

(with negative term premia), which is entirely consistent with what we ﬁnd in this

paper. A simple approach to estimating term premia is to take the diﬀerence between

long-term Treasury yields and average expected short-term interest rates measured

by the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey. Term premia on ten-year Treasuries,

estimated in this way, are shown in Figure 15. They trended down from over 2 percent

in the late 1980s, to being slightly negative at the end of 2011.10 Given the U-shaped

   10
      Aﬃne term structure models (such as that of Kim and Wright (2005)) show term premia de-
clining over the 1990s and 2000s. This trend has continued into the ﬁnancial crisis, and the term
premium estimates of Kim and Wright are now mildly negative.


                                               16
pricing kernel, this would be consistent with investors shifting from being worried

about high inﬂation alone to being worried about both high inﬂation and deﬂation.


5     Robustness Checks and Extensions

We also investigated alternative methods for reverse-engineering probability density

functions from the prices of inﬂation ﬂoors and caps. One was to ﬁt a mixture of

two normals, picking the parameters so as to minimize the sum of squared percentage

pricing errors. The other was to use the nonparametric procedure of Shimko (1993).

Both of these gave similar probability density functions to those that we obtained in

section 3.

     It would also be of interest to have a probability density for inﬂation over some

period in the future. Alas, the inﬂation ﬂoors and caps are all contracts that are

written on average inﬂation from the outset of the contract to the maturity date.

Assuming risk neutrality, we can back out the marginal densities of average inﬂation

over these horizons, but cannot extract the density for forward inﬂation without

making further assumptions. For example, with ﬁve- and ten-year ﬂoors and caps,

we can back out the marginal densities of inﬂation at ﬁve- and ten-year horizons, but

working out the probability density function for inﬂation from ﬁve to ten years’ hence

is a deconvolution problem that can only be solved if we make some assumption about

the dynamics of the inﬂation process, such as assuming that inﬂation in the ﬁrst ﬁve

and subsequent ﬁve years are mutually independent.

     In Figure 16, we show the probability density functions for inﬂation from ﬁve to

ten years’ hence on four recent dates from December 2011 to April 2012, constructed


                                         17
assuming that inﬂation over the ﬁrst ﬁve and subsequent ﬁve years are mutually

independent. These dates were chosen because they are the dates that the New York

Fed conducted surveys of primary dealers asking respondents for their judgmental

density forecasts for inﬂation from ﬁve to ten years’ hence.11 The survey density is

also included in Figure 16. Over this period, the survey density is virtually unchanged

from one date to the next, and the options-implied densities are very stable too.

Clearly, the options-implied densities assign much higher probabilities to both tails

than do the survey respondents. We interpret this as further evidence for the U-

shaped empirical pricing kernel.


6      Conclusions

In this paper, we have used quotes on inﬂation caps and ﬂoors to construct risk-

neutral probability densities for inﬂation over the last 2-1/2 years. These pdfs do

not require an assumption of normality, and indeed on some occasions the pdfs were

skewed towards deﬂation. We have studied how these pdfs responded to certain

announcements. While most of the variation in inﬂation pdfs cannot be tied to

macroeconomic news announcements, the implied probability of deﬂation (and, to a

lesser extent, the implied probability of high inﬂation) are both signiﬁcantly related

to the surprise components of certain macroeconomic news announcements. The pdfs

that we have obtained are formed under an assumption of risk neutrality. Comparing

  11
    Respondents are asked to assign probabilities to average inﬂation being less than 1 per-
cent, 1-1.5, 1.5-2, 2-2.5, 2.5-3 or over 3 percent. The probabilities are then averaged over the
21 respondents. Aggregate survey results used in this study are publicly available at http :
//www.newyorkf ed.org/markets/primarydealer survey questions.html.

them to econometric density forecasts allows us to see how investors marginal utility

relates to inﬂation. We ﬁnd that states of the world in which inﬂation is either very

low or very high are ones in which investors have high marginal utility.

Notes: This table reports estimates of the regressions of daily changes in the options-implied proba-
bility of average CPI inﬂation exceeding 4 percent per annum over diﬀerent horizons onto macroeco-
nomic surprises. The probabilties are in percentage points; the units of the macroeconomic surprises
are given in Table 1. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are in parentheses. One, two and
three asterisks denote statistical signiﬁcance at the 10, 5 and 1 percent levels, respectively.

Notes: This table reports the dates of the ten biggest absolute daily changes in the options-implied
probability of average CPI inﬂation being negative (top panel) or exceeding four percent (bottom
panel). The changes in the options-implied probabilities on these dates are shown in the second
column, in percentage points. The third column lists possible contributory factors that we identiﬁed
from Wrightson ICAP daily summaries of ﬁnancial markets.

Notes: The blue curves show the pdfs for average CPI inflation from five to ten years hence derived from
inflation floors and caps under an assumption of risk neutrality. The densities were obtained assuming that
inflation over the first five and subsequent five years are independent mixed normal random variables. The
red curves show the corresponding pdfs from the New York Feds survey of primary dealers. The pdfs are
shown for all dates on which there is publicly available information for the New York Fed survey.
