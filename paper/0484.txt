                    Fixed Costs and Labor Supply



                              ABSTRACT



    This   study is a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of

time and money costs of labor market participation on married women's supply

behavior. The existence of fixed costs implies that individuals are not

willing to work less than some minimum number of hours, termed reservation

hours. 'The theoretical analysis of the properties of the reservation hours.

function are derived. The empirical analysis develops and estimates labor

supply functions when fixed costs are present, but cannot be observed in

the data. The likelihood function developed to estimate the model is an

extension of the statistical model of Heckman (1974) that allows the minimum

number of hours supplied to be nonzero and differ randomly among individuals.

The empirical results indicate that fixed costs of work are of prime importance

in determining the labor supply behavior of married women. At the sample

means, the minimum number of hours a woman is willing to work is about 1300

per year. The estimated fixed costs an average woman incurs upon entry into

the labor market is $920 in 1966 dollars. This represents 28 percent of her

yearly earnings. Finally, labor supply parameters estimated with the fixed

cost model are compared to those estimated under the conventional assumption

of no fixed costs. Large differences in estimated paramters are found, suggesting

that the conventional model is seriously inisspecified.

                           I. INTRODUCTION



     In the last seven years, labor economists have produced a considerable

volume of research on the determinants of married women's labor supply

behavior. During this period, several substantive methodological and

empirical advancements have been made. Perhaps these advancements are best

characterized by the work of Gronau (1973, 1975) on the "selectivity bias"

in wage equations, Heckman (1974) on the estimation of wage, labor force

participation, and labor supply functions, Hanoch (1976) on the theoretical

foundations for empirical integration of alternative measures of labor

supply, and Heckman (1974), Smith (1974), Heckman and Willis (1977), and MaCurdy

(1980), on life—cycle models of labor supply behavior. Although these studies

have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the role that economic and demographic

factors play in shaping married women's labor market behavior, much remains

to be done. There are several key issues that have been entirely neglected

or treated only on a superficial level. One such issue is the impact of

time and money costs of labor market entry on labor supply behavior. In

empirical work, little if any systematic attempt to incorporate such costs

into econometric models of labor supply behavior has as yet been undertaken.

Most often, the existence of these costs is assumed away. This lack of

empirical work stems primarily from two difficulties. First, data on

actual amounts of time and/or money costs incurred upon entry into the

labor market are at best scant and incomplete. Furthermore, even if entry

costs could be obtained for participants in the labor force, such data are

inherently not observable for nonparticipants. Second, the existence of
                                    2




fixed entry costs imparts a discontinuity in the individual's labor supply

function. This discontinuity reflects the fact that with costs of labor

market participation, individuals will not choose to work below some minimum

number of hours. This minimum, or reservation hours, is not observable in

the data and presumably differs among individuals.

     In this paper, a simple model to illustrate labor supply effects of

time and money costs of labor market entry is presented and a statistical

procedure for estimating labor supply functions when these costs are not

directly observable in the data is developed. Although the analysis is

confined to married women's labor supply, the approach taken is quite

general and may be applied, for example, to the estimation of demand func-

tions for goods sold under fixed—fee plus marginal price arrangements.

     Section II is devoted to a theoretical analysis of the effects of costs

of labor market entry on labor supply behavior. In Section III the statis-

tical model and estimation procedures are discussed. The model relies on

two behavioral functions: an hours of work function and a reservation hours

function. The hours of work function is a garden variety labor supply func-

tion. The reservation hours function indicates the minimum number of hours

an individual is willing to supply to the market. With costs of labor

market entry, these two functions characterize the supply side of the market.

A market demand or wage function is added to complete the model. A maximum

likelihood estimator is proposed to estimate the parameters of these equa-

tions. This estimator extends the statistical model of Heckman (1974) by allow-

ing for entry hours to be nonzero and to differ randomly among individuals,

Section IV presents the empirical results. These results indicate that entry

costs are of prime importance in determining the labor supply behavior of

married women. The estimated size of the discontinuity in the supply function
                                    3



is large——around 1,000 hours per year at the sample means. Again at the

sample means, the estimated annual cost of labor force participation is

approximately $920 in 1966 dollars, which amounts to about 28% of the

average yearly earnings of working women in the sample. Also, labor supply

parameter estimates of the entry cost model are compared with those obtained

under the assumption of zero cost of participation. These comparisons reveal

large differences between estimated parameters and suggest that the

conventionally formulated empirical labor supply function is misspecified.

                         II. SOME THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS



          Most of the important implications of cost to labor market entry are

      easily summarized by the familiar income—leisure and corresponding labor

      supply diagram:




                                                                              H(W,Y-MfW(H-i)

                                                                         HOURS OF WORK (h)

                                      Figure 1


  In Figure 1(a) Y and H are the individual's endowment of nonwage income and

  time, respectively. The variables M and T denote the level of money and time

  lost upon entry into the labor market. The reservation wage, the minimum wage

  offer just necessary to induce the individual to work, is depicted as WR. As

  Figure 1 illustrates, an implication of fixed working cost is that individuals

  will not be willing to work below some minimum number of hours, termed reser-

  vation hours. The reservation hours is given in Figure 1(a) by H—r—L1 and is
                                      5


described by the discontinuity of the labor supply function at the reservation

wage in Figure 1(b). The size of the discontinuity depends on the individual's

preference function as well as the levels of Y, '1, and

     A second immediate consequence of fixed cost of labor market entry is that

their existence severs the identity between the reservation wage and the shadow

price (value) nonworkers assign to their time. The value a nonworker assigns

to his or her time is given in Figure 1(a) by the slope of the indifference

curve at E*. Previous attempts to estimate nonworkers' values of time have

relied on its equality with the reservation wage. Two approaches have been

used. One is to use labor force participation data (Gronau, 1973, 1974). The

other is to use the height of an estimated labor supply function at zero hours

of work (Heckman, 1974). As Figure 1(a) suggests, the former approach, which

correctly estimates reservation wages, will tend to overestimate values non—

workers assign to their time. The latter approach, which estimates the slope

of the indifference curve net of the time and money cost (pt E in Figure 1(a)),

will underestimate the value of time at zero hours of work if only money costs

of entry exist, and overestimate this value if only time costs exist.

     The effects of variations in fixed costs on hours of work among workers

are obvious and can be stated without derivation. Increases in money cost of

entry act as reductions in money wealth and, if leisure is a normal good, will

increase hours of work among workers. Increases in the time cost of working,

on the other hand, will reduce hours of work among workers.2

     The effects of money and time costs of entry on the minimum number of

hours the individual is willing to work are less obvious, but easily estab-

lished by using the individual's expenditure function. The expenditure

this section.
     2Strictly speaking, these results follow only if leisure is a normal good
in the case of money costs and the composite commodity (income) is a normal
good in the case of time costs.

function is written as


(1)                Y = G(w, U) + N — W(H —


where (Y/W) E    equals the equilibrium quantity of leisure demand and
              C1

(BY/RU)            G2 is the reciprocal of the marginal utility of income. Furthermore,

(2G/W2)              G11 is the Hicks—Slutsky substitution effect of a risejn the

wage rate on the quantity of leisure demanded, and (2C/WU) C12 > 0

if leisure is a normal good,

               The reservation hours of work function may be derived by differentiating

equation (1) with respect to the wage and evaluating the derivative at the

reservation wage (WR).


(2)                hR = _Gl(WR, U°) + H —


where U° is the level of utility achieved if the individual does not work.

               To obtain the effect of a change in the money cost of work on reser-

vation hours, differentiate equation (2) with respect to N holding utility

constant at U°. This differentiation yields


(3)                dhR          dWR
                   dM        11dM

The term                 is the change in the reservation wage for a given change in

the money cost of labor market entry. As should be intuitively obvious, an

increase in the cost of entry will raise the reservation wage; that is,
               1
      >   0.       The remaining term, — C11, is the substitution effect of a wage



        'Formally, this result may be derived by differentiating the expendi-
ture function simultaneously with respect to W and M, and solving for

change on the quantity of labor supplied. It is also necessarily greater

than zero. Reservation hours, therefore, rise with Increases in the

money costs of work.1

        The effect of an increase in time cost of market entry on reserva-

tion hours is, on the other hand, theroetically ambiguous in sign. To

see this, differentiate equation (2) with respect to t   holding   utility

constant at U° to obtain

         dhR            dWR
(4)



The product of the first two terms is the change in the quantity of leisure

demanded at the reservation wage. As with money costs, an increase in time

costs increases the reservation wage. The higher reservation wage reduces

the quantity of leisure demanded at the reservation wage. However, the total

quantity of time available for work or leisure declines by an amount equal to

the increase in time cost of market entry. The change in reservation hours

depends upon the relative strengths of these two opposing effects.2


            interesting implication of equation (3) is that if one had data
on money costs and could estimate reservation hours of work, one could use
this information to estimate the parameters of the compensated labor supply
function.

        2Further expansion of equation (4) yields an interesting though,
perhaps, less intuitive expression. Using the expenditure function, the
                                                                 w
effect of time cost on the reservation wage can be solved for as . Sub-
stituting this result into equation (4) yields                     R

(5\
         dT   Wh
The product of the first two terms is the elasticity of the compensated
labor supply function evaluated at the reservation wage—hours combination.
Thus, the effect of time costs on reservation hours may be said to depend
on whether the compensated labor supply function evaluated at the reserva-
tion wage is greater or less than unity.

         Finally, to obtain the effect of nonwage income on reservation hours

differentiate equation (3) with respect to Y, allowing utility to vary.

Differentiation yields


           dhR =     1        dWR           dU0l

                     [i   1         + G12


Assuming leisure is a normal good, an increase in nonwage income will
                                             dWR
raise the reservation wage; hence                  is positive. Obviously since an

income in nonwage income raises the utility achieved by not working,
  0
      is also positive. However, under the assumption that leisure is a

normal good G11 and           are opposite in sign. Thus, in general, the effect

of nonwage income on reservation hours is ambiguous.

         This effect, however, can be signed in at least one interesting

case; when the uncompensated labor supply function is backward bending

in the neighborhood of the reservation wage. If it is, an increase in

nonwage income will raise reservation hours. To derive this result, diff-

erentiate the expenditure function with respect to Y holding utility constant

to obtain an expression for the change in the reservation wage for a given

change in nonwage income. Differentiation yields

        'As stated earlier, this expression is positive if leisure is a
normal good. Note that the product of the first two terms inside the
bracket is actually a ratio of marginal utilities evaluated at two points
along an indifference curve in income—leisure space. If leisure is a normal
good then the ratio is greater than unity. This proposition is easily proven
by evaluating the utility compensated effect of a wage change on the marginal
utility of income.

Substituting equation (6) into (5) and rearranging terms yields


                                                =

The sum of the first two terms inside the brackets is the slope of the

uncompensated labor supply function evaluated at the reservation wage.

All other terms have been defined earlier and are positive in sign.

      Assuming an upward rising labor supply function, the analysis suggests

a rather convenient characterization of the hours of work and labor force

participation decisions. Define an augmented labor supply function as

the actual labor supply function extrapolated back to the wage axis. This

augmented labor supply function can be written as


(8)       h* =H(W,Y-N+W(H-T))

The reservation hours function is


(9)       hR    F(M,T,Y)


Using equations (8 ) and (9 ) and assuming an upward rising labor supply

function, the labor force participation decision may be cast in terms of a

comparison between h* and hR. If h exceeds hR the individual will choose

to work and her observed hours of work (h) will equal h .   If   hR exceeds h*

the individual will choose not to work and observed hours of work will

equal zero.1


     1This formulation of the participation decision is obviously equivalent
to using the more conventional market Wage—reservation wage characterization.
The above formulation is used because it leads naturally to a specification
of the econometric model that facilitates comparisons with early work.

                                III. ESTIMATION


        To estimate labor supply functions when there are costs of labor force

participation, one of two empirical strategies may be followd If information

on the time and money costs of labor market entry incurred by participants

is available, then these costs can be used to estimate the structural

parameters of not only the labor supply function but also of costs of work

functions. On the other hand if information on the time and money costs

of work is not available, then one can only obtain estimates of a quasi—

reduced form labor supply function. The quasi—reduced form estimates will

reflect not only the parameters of the individual's utility function but

also the effects of variations in the cost of work. In this section, I

discuss estimation when time and money costs cannot be directly observed

on the data.'

       In order to estimate the parameters of the model, it is necessary to

specify the relevant equations and the underlying stochastic structure.

Following the analysis of Section II, two functions characterize the labor

supply decision: an augmented hours of work function and a reservation hours

function.

       The augmented hours equation is assumed to take the followingform

for the ith individual:


            h =
(10)
                  yO+ylN(W.)+y2YH+y3C+y4E.+y5A+oEylN(w)+y'z,+c



     'Estimation of the complete set of structural parameters when the
costs of work are available is discussed in Cogan (1977).
                                                   11



where N(W1) is the natural logarithm of the wife's hourly wage, E is her

years of education, C is the number of preschool children (age 0—5) in the

home,         is the husband's income, and A. is the wife's age. The theoret-

ical and empirical relevance of each of these variables, in the absence of

costs of work, is well known.

        The reservation hours equation assumes the form


(11) hR =
          i
               0+          .1
                                 + 2C. + 3E. + 4A. + c 'Z1 +
                                                            1           1        1


        Although one may have intuitive feelings about the effects of each of
these variables on reservation hours, the theory developed in the preceding

section offers little insight into their expected effects.

        The dependent variable is annual hours of work in 1966. This choice

requires some discussion. Ideally, we would like to use a measure of labor

supply whose dimension is the same as the period of time over which the

fixed costs are incurred. That is, if daily fixed costs, such as transpor-

tation costs to and from work, are important, then the appropriate measure

of labor supply would be hours of work per day. Unfortunately, existing

micro data files do not contain information on daily hours of work.

        Together ezluations (10) and (11) imply a reservation wage equation of

the form


(12)          WR. = 60 +        61H.1   + 62C. + 63E. + 64A. + u2
                1                                                   1

where E is the level of education completed by the wife, X is her prior

labor market experienceU is a dummy variable which assumes a value of one

if the woman resides in an urban area, and N and WE are two regions of the

country dummies, north and west, respectively.

       The vector of disturbances (c0,c1,c2) is assumed to be normally dis-

tributed with mean vector zero and constant covariance matrix Q.

       Clearly, if the endogenous variables, h*, hR. and W, could be observed

for all individuals, then the parameters ot equations (1O)—(13) could be

estimated with two— or three—stage least squares. Unfortunately, these

variables are not observed for all individuals. Reservation hours

cannot be observed for      individual in the data, and h* and wage offers

cannot be observed for nonworkers. Without these data, an alternative

statistical approach, such as maximum likelihood is required to estimate

the parameters.

       To form the likelihood function it is necessary to relate the values

of the hypothetical dependent variables to their empirical counterparts,

and describe the process by which these observable counterparts are

generated in terms of the underlying stochastic elements. Assuming an

upward rising supply function, a woman will be observed to be working if


(14)        h1 >hR

     1Work by Heckman and Willis (1977) casts serious doubt on whether it
is appropriate to regard prior labor market experience as exogenous to the
current wage offer. Also, more recent work by Reckman (1980) suggests that

Substituting the market wage offer equation into the hours of work function,

the participation decision may be written as


(15)         y1a'Z0 + (y' —                 >      — (c    + y1c2)


or more compactly, as             -




(16)         I > u


where


             u ''   N(0, o +              + y2a2 —             — 211012 + 211002)


The likelihood of observing a nonparticipant is simply

For    observations on workers we know that reservation hours are less than

     The computational burden of optimizing the likelihood function may be

reduced by replacing the trivarlate normal density function with the product

of the bivariate conditional normal and unit normal marginal densities.

This permits factoring the right—most term in equation 20 into a simple

univariate probit and bivariate normal density)

     To estimate the parameters of the model, a multi—step procedure was

used. First, consistent estimates of the parameters of the wage equation

were obtained with Beckman's (1976) censored sample regression procedure.

The likelihood function, conditional upon these estimated values,2 was

then optimized. This two—step procedure yields consistent estimates of

the parameters, but incorrect asymptotic standard errors. To obtain

asymptotically efficient standard errors, these parameter estimates were

used as initial values in a one—step Newton—Raphson iteration on the

likelihood function in equation (20).

         2The likelihood function conditional upon estimated values of
the wage equation parameters collapses to one which is identical to that
proposed by Nelson (1974) and Olsen (1975) for models with unobserved
stochastic censoring thresholds.

                          IV.   EMPIRICAL RESULTS



     The data used for the empirical analysiswere taken from the 1967

National Longitudinal (Parnes) Survey of Mature Women age 30—34 in 1966.

The sample selected contained 898 wives who worked at some time during 1966

and 939 who did not. Details of the data selection process and means and

variances of the variables used in this study are provided in the Appendix.

     Estimates of the market wage function are reported in Table 1. For

comparative purposes, ordinary least—squares estimates of the wage offer

equation are also presented. The coefficients on education, experience,'

and urban are all statistically significant. The coefficient on education

should be interpreted as the effect of completing an additional year of

schooling rather than spending that year out of the labor force. Likewise,

the experience coefficient represents the effect of spending at least six

months in the labor force during a given year relative to spending that time

out of the labor force. The small size of the age coefficient indicates

little, if any, effect of either wage depreciation resulting from spending

time out of the labor force or variations in the quality of schooling over

time. Using a two—standard—deviation confidence ban (a 95% confidence

interval), our results indicate that the age effect lies between plus and

minus 1%.

     Comparing these ordinary least—squares estimates with the "selectivity

bias—free" estimates provides some evidence of the effect of the selectivity

bias on individual parameter estimates. The major bias appears to be in the

estimate of the intercept term, which accounts for the entire difference


     'Experience is defined as the number of years since completion of
school to 1966 in which the woman worked at least six months of the year.

 conditional and unconditional average wages at the sample means. The dif-

 ference in the estimate of the effect of prior labor market experience,

 though small in absolute magnitude, is large relative to the size of the

coefficient (23%). Likewise for the urban dummy (40%). It is encouraging

to find that the selectivity bias has little effect on the education

coefficient. Since the coefficients on age, north, and west have such

relatively large standard errors, little can be concluded about the impact

of the sample selection bias on these estimated parameters.

     Table 2 presents estimates of the parameters of the hours of work and

reservation hours functions. The asymptotic standard errors of the esti-

mated parameters are given in parentheses.

     The estimates presented in Table 2 conform, at least qualitatively, to

those obtained in previous empirical studies of this demographic group (see,

for instance, Heckman, 1974; Cogan, 1975; Schultz, 1975) and thus indicate

that incorporation of time and money costs of entry do not alter the quali-

tative nature of the estimated labor supply parameters. An increase in the

wife's wage increasannua1 hours of work among working women, though its

effect is much smaller than those found in earlier studies of Heckman (1974) and

Schultz   (1975). The wife's education, her husband's income, and the

number of preschool children in the home all exert a negative influence on

her annual hours. Finally, there appears to be no life—cycle or cohort

variations in hours worked among working women in the age range of the

sample.

     In the reservation hours equation, both preschool children and the

wife's age significantly raise the minimum number of hours a woman is

willing to supply to the labor market. Increases in the husband's earnings

also tend to increase the minimum number of hours but its effect is small

and not statistically significant. Increases in the wife's level of educa-

tion, on the other hand, reduce minimum hours, though its effect is also

not significant.

       The estimated mean reservation hours is large, for both working and

nonworking women in the sample, indicating that time and money costs of

labor market entry are of prime importance in affecting a married woman's

labor supply decisions. For example, a 10% increase in the wage offer

facing the average nonworking woman in the sample would not induce her to

enter the labor market. However, a 15% increase would and she would supply

1,327 hours a year at this new wage. If there were an additional increase

of 15% in her wage offer, her hours of work would increase by only an

additional 180 per year.



       The estimated parameters may be used to solve for the compensating

variation measure of the costs of participation. In order to obtain this

measure, it is necessary to derive the form of the compensated labor supply

function from the assumed form of the uncompensated function. The uncompen—

sated labor supply function (equation (10)) may be written succinctly as


(21)       hi =     y'Z.   + y1N(W.) +



where Z is the vector of other included right—hand—side variables. Using

the Slutsky decomposition, we may write the slope of a compensated labor

supply function associated with (21) as


(22)                 =      — h12

                                               20




         The general form of the compensated function may be obtained from

 equation (22) easily. Equation (22) is a first—order linear differential

 equation whose general solution on an interval I is given by



                       e
                             W        e    — dt

                             J   w*

 where w is the intercept of the labor supply function extrapolated down to

 zero hours of work and c is an arbitrary constant. The particular solution at

 the reservation wage—hours p0-mt can be obtained with numerical methods.

         Given the form of the compensated labor
                                                            supply function, I have
computed estimates of the annual fixed costs of work for the average

working and nonworking women separately. These estimates are presented

in Table 3 along with estimates of how these costs change with the number

of preschool age children and years of education for the average woman

in the data. Unfortunately, I have been unable to compute the standard

errors of these estimates. Caution, therefore, should be exercised

before attaching too much weight to their importance.

     The estimates of the annual fixed costs are large, though not unreason-

ably so. For working women, this annual participation cost expressed as a

percentage of the average annual earnings of working women is 28.3%. As

expected, the estimated cost facing nonworkers exceeds that facing workers,

with the differential being $113.23. The estimated effect of an additional

preschool—age child, evaluated at the sample means, is of the expected sign

and quite large. At the sample means the difference in the number of pre-

school children accounts for 80 percent of the difference in the fixed costs

of working between working and nonworking women, .   Education has a positive

effect on the annual costs of participation. An additional year of education

increases the annual costs of work by over $100. Michael (1973) and others

have argued that education raises nonmarket production. If so, then one

might expect that more educated women would have better allocative skills,

and hence lower costs of entry. However, there are other factors which would

tend to produce a positive relationship between education and the costs of

participation. More highly educated women live in higher income households

which tend to locate further from central business districts than low—income

households (see Kain, 1962 and Muth, 1969).   Thus transportation costs would

be higher for more educated women. Also, more highly educated women attach

a higher value to their nonmarket time, and hence place a higher value on a

given amount of time lost in entering the market.

     The assumed form of the labor supply function, in particular, hours

as a linear function of log wages is one commonly used to estimate labor

supply functions of married women.    It would be of interest

to know whether allowing for a discontinuity in the market supply function

results in parameter estimates that differ from those of this conventional

formulation. To aid in characterizing the restrictions implied by the
                                                22

conventional model, return for the moment to the empirical model (equations

(10) —    (12)).          Under the assumption of no costs of participation, reserva-

tion hours (hR) are identically zero for all observations. Thus, equation

(11) is eliminated from the model and the restricted model becomes

Equations          (25)   and (26) characterize the conventional model.

This   model was first proposed by          Heckman (1974a), Without detracting from

Heckman's      contribution, note that it imposes two restrictions relative to
a      model that allows for costs of entry. First, it           imposes   the restriction
of   continuity in the supply function for all hours. Second, it imposes a

proportionality relationship between the parameters of the labor supply

and reservation—wage equations. The reservation—wage equation is defined

as the shadow—wage equation (25) at zero hours of work. Each parameter

is proportional to the corresponding parameter in the hours of work equation

with the factor of proportionality being the slope of the labor supply function.1

          1
              It
           should be pointed out that this restriction is relaxed by Heckman
in the generalized version of the model which he proposes in his l974b paper.
                                    23
     If entry costs are important in the data, one would expect the esti—

mates of the conventionalmodel to systematically exceed in absolute value

those of the entry cost model. To see this, consider the graph in Figure 3.

In this graph, hT represents the "true" labor supply function when there are

costs of participation. The existence of fixed costs is reflected by the

discontinuity at the reservation wage. A constraint of zero costs of entry

in the model implies a constraint of continuity in the labor supply func-

tion, i.e., that the height of the labor supply function at its origin (the

shadow price of time as full—time leisure) equals the reservation wage.

Imposing this constraint on data which has at least some nonworkers will

result in an estimated labor supply function that looks like hE and the

effect of the wage on hours of work will be overstated. This result will,

in general, hold for all estimated parameters.

     To determine whether the two models lead to important differences in

parameter estimates, Heckman's (1974) maximum likelihood procedure was

applied to the data to estimate the parameters of the conventional model.

     'In Figure 3, the intercept of the estimated labor supply function
(the estimated reservation wage), is drawn  so that it equals the true
reservation wage (WR). In reality, it is not clear whether the conventional
model will lead to an over or under estimate of the reservation wage if
both time and money costs are present.
                                     25

The estimated wage coefficient is almost three times as large in the

converitionalinodel, the education coefficient twice as large, the husband's

earnings coefficient four times as large, the children coefficient five

times as large, and the age coefficient one hundred times as large.

     To further assess the comparability of the two models, some 'additional

statistics were computed. Both the conventional model and the entry cost

model jointly estimate the probability of working and hours of work among

the workers. The sample labor force participation rate is .491. The

estimated mean probability of working with our proposed procedure is .494, while

that of the conventional model is .52, Using a 50 percent rule, the propor-

tion of successful predictions of labor force status with the fixed cost

model is .718; with the conventional model it is slightly higher, .725.

Thus, the two approaches appear to predict the work—not work decision

equally well.

     To compare the relative accuracy of the two models in predicting hours

of work, the sum of squared deviations of actual hours of work from pre-

dicted hours of work for the subsample of labor force participants was

computed. The sum of squared deviations for the conventionalmodel is four

times as large as that for the entry cost model.

          To make a final assessment on the comparability of the

two models, consider the graph in Figure 4 of the labor supply functions

estimated with the two models. Let W be the wage at which the labor supply

functions estimated from the two models intersect one another. If nonzero

reservation hours are important in the data, the conventional model would be

expected to underpredict hours of work among the workers with wages below

W relative to the entry cost model. The reverse should be true for workers

with wages above W. For wages below W, the mean residual (actual minus predicted)

                           supply functions



for the entry cost is +70.6; for the conventional model, it is +1293.3.

For wages above , the entry cost yields a mean residual of —729.8, and

for the conventional model it is —1379.6.

        These comparisons indicate that the conventional model is

misspecified relative to the entry cost model. It is tempting to conclude

that the misspecification arises because fixed costs of labor market

entry are ignored. However, this is not necessarily correct. It might

be that fixed costs of entry are unimportant in generating observations

on hours of work and that labor supply functions are nonlinear; being
                                    27

relatively flat at low wages and relatively steep at high wages.

If so, allowing for a discontinuity might provide a good approximation

to the relatively flat portion of the supply function. Hence, it might

give the appearance of the importance of fixed costs of entry when, in

fact, these costs are unimportant. The point is that without observable

data on fixed costs, evidence of their effects can only be obtained

indirectly and, as a consequence, results of tests for their existence

may depend crucially on the assumed functional form of the labor supply

equation. However, regardless of whether or not fixed costs are important

in generating the data, the conventionally used labor supply function for

married women is misspecified. It is likely that the rather large own—

wage elasticities estimated for these women reported in earlier studies

is a direct result of this misspecification.

                              V. CONCLUSIONS

     The major conclusion drawn from the analysis presented in

this paper is that costs of labor force participation, measured both

in terms of their estimated dollar amount and their estimated effects on

labor supply behavior, appear to be important, at least in the demographic

group analyzed here. For the average woman in the data the costs of

work amount to approximately 28 percent of annual earnings. These

costs impart a discontinuity in the average woman's labor function of

almost 1300 hours per year, which is larger than half—time work. Also,

differences in the number of preschool—age children in the home appear

to be a major factor contributing to these costs and account for virtually

all the difference between the costs of work facing working and nonworking

women. From the comparisons of estimators, there is evidence that the

conventionally used empirical model of labor supply which ignores fixed

costs leads to substantial overestimates of the true labor supply parameters.

     These conclusions must be qualified somewhat. Estimation of the costs
of work requires extrapolation of the compensated labor supply function

from the level of the discontinuity to the origin. In this region there

are relatively few observations. It is also not clear how sensitive the

costs estimates are to the function form chosen. Serious consideration

should be given to these issues before attaching too much weight to the

estimates of the annual costs of work. Also, the model assumes that women

can freely choose and vary their hours of work. Yet, casual empiricism

suggests that there may be minimum hours of work constraints imposed by

employers for many types of jobs. The large constant term in the

reservation hours function may primarily reflect these constraints rather

than the effects of fixed costs of work in the supply side.

                              APPENDIX



     The data used for the empirical analysis was taken from the National

Longitudinal Survey of Nature Women. The NLS data file consists of five

annual surveys of a multi—stage probability sample of women aged 30—44 in

1966. In this study only the information contained in the first interview

(1967) was used. The basic sample drawn from the 1967 survey consisted of

approximately 2700 observations on white households in which both the

husband and wife were present. Given the problems of separating reported

income into the return to labor and capital for individuals who are self—

employed or owned a farm, households in which either spouse reported being

self—employed were dropped from this basic sample. After these exclusions

about 2300 observations remained. Further exclusions (360 observations)

were made because of missing or incomplete information on the core variables

of this study, such as income, age, education, etc. Finally, an additional

110 observations on households in which the husband performed no market in

1966 were dropped from the sample.

     The remaining sample used for the empirical analysis consisted of 1829

households. Of these, 898 contained wives who worked at some time during

1966 and 931 who did not. Table A.1 provides the means and variances of

all the variables used in our empirical analysis.
