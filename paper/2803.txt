               THE JOINT RETIREMENT DECISION OF HUSBANDS MD WIVES


                                    ABSTRACT




    The objective of the paper is to find empirically whether husbands and
wives tend to retire at the same   time, and   to give an explanation of the

findings. Similarity of retirement dates could be caused by similarity of

tastes (assortative mating), by economic variables, or by the complimentarity

of leisure.    Each explanation would have   different implications for the

response of retirement to policy changes.
     Both simple data analysis and economic models of the age of retirement
point to coordination of retirement dates: husbands and wives tend to retire
at the same time. According to the results, very little of the coordination
is due to economic variables, and simple cross-tabulations rule out
assortative   mating as an important explanation. This leaves complimentarity
of leisure. Because of data limitations, this conclusion is, however, mainly
qualitative.
     The data   set is the Mew Beneficiary Survey.

1. Introduction
   Whereas the retirement behavior of wales has been rather intensively

                                                      Mitchell and Fields
studied (Boskin and Hurd (1978). Burtchauser(198O).

(1983,1984). Diamond and Hausman (1984), Ward and Boskin (1984). burtless and

Moffitt (1985). Hausman and Wise (l9BS). Honig and Flanoch (1985),   Custman and

Steinmeier (1986). and Sickles and Taubman (1986)). very little attention has

been paid to the retirement behavior of couples, most likely because in a

self—weighting sample there are not many observations on working women of

retirement age. For example. Fozzebon and Mitchell (1986) use just 139 obser-

                                                           retirement behavior of
vations from the Retirement History Survey to study the

married women. Because the labor force participation rate of women has grown

substantially over the last 30 years. the retirement behavior of women will

become increasingly important in understanding many issues such as the future
                                                         the aggregate cost of So-
 size of the labor force, the number of retirees., and

 cial Security benefits. Cf particular interest is the joint retirement behav-
                                                              of retirement age
 ior of husband and wife, both becaus numerically couples
                                                             and because the joint
 are more important than single people of retirement age,

 retirement decision is much more complex than the decision of an individual.

     Most research on the retirement of males finds that the date of retirement

 is affected by the level of Social Security benefits, health. mandatory

 retirement, and, to a lesser extent, by other aspects of the economic environ-

 ment such as the wage rate and assets. For example. Ward and Boskin (1984)
                                                               the early 1970s pro-

  pation during that   period.
  fect   towards early retirement and that mandatory retirement at age 65 approxi-
  mately doubles the probability of complete retirement at age 65. (The indlr
                                                                             2



vidual   retires rather than   finding another job.) Ilausman and Wise    (1985) ob-

tain similar findings.      This   line of research generally considers only hus-

bands whose wives are not working, so the issue of the joint choice of retire—

went dates does not arise. Studies of family labor supply, however, typically

find   that   the wife's labor supply is influenced by the husband's wage rate or

by the husband's income. It would not be surprising, therefore, to find that

the   wife's retirement date is influenced by the variables that help determine
the husband's retirement date. Whethn the husband's retirement date is
similarly influenced by the wife's variables is more of an open question.
      Although a correlation between husbands' and wives' retirement dates has
yet to be firmly established, there are several kinds of reasons why one might
expect to find such a correlation.t If men who have a particularly strong
taste for goods marry women with similar tastes •      one   would find a positive
correlation between retirement dates, even if retirement dates are not in-
fluenced by any economic variables. A correlation could also be caused by
economic variables: for example, both the husbands and wives in families with
substantial assets may tend to retire early, which would induce a postive cor-
relation in dates. A more interesting example is correlation caused by cross—
wage effects. Cross—wage effects could be due to income effects on the.
retirement dates of both husband and wife and/or by compensated cross—wage ef-
fects. The compensated effects result from a utility function in which the
own marginal rate of substitution of goods for leisure is affected by the
leisure of the spouse. One might well imagine such an effect particularly
with respect to. years of retirement: own retirement years may be less
pleasurable if the spouse is working because of constraints put on travelling
and so forth. This kind of reasoning would suggest that husbands' and wives'
                                                                           3



years of retirement are compliments. so that, cat. Dar., they would desire to

retire at the same time.

    This paper has two goals. The first is to give some empirical evidence on

the correlation between retirement dates. Do, in fact, husbands and wives

tend to retire at the sane time, and how strong is the tendency? The results

should provide a baseline for future research. The second goal is to find.

within the constraints of the data, whether observable economic variables con-

tribute to any correlation in retirement dates, and to find evidence of corn—

pensated cross—equation effects,

    The   data set is the New Beneficiary Survey. It has    the   advantage of a
substantial number of observations on working husbands and wives of retirement
age. Its main disadvantage is that it is a choice—based cross—section. which
limits the complexity of the analysis that can be undertaken.
    The rain findings are that husbands and wives tend to retire at the same
time. Some of the results can be interpreted to mean that their retirement
years are compliments. There is weaker evidence that some of each spouse's
 economic variables influence the retirement age of the other, but the findings
 are not robust enough to attempt to find compensated effects.

 2. Data.
     The New Beneficiary Survey (liDS) is a survey of individuals who first
 received S.ocial Security benefits in the window." June, 1980 through Hay.
 1981 (Maxfield, 1983). The individuals and their spouses were interviewed in
 October—December. 1982. Nine catagories   of recipients were     defined. For this

 study the important ones are retired male workers and retired female workers,

 A retired male worker received his first retirement benefits during the

 window, and was entitled on his own   earnings   record, and similarly for retired
                                                                          4


female workers. A number of      the female workers, in particular, were dually

entitled. Within each catagory sampling rates varied by the age of the

recipient. The sample sizes and sampling rates are as fellows

           65                      1388        1/67

           62                      1319        1/236
          63—64                    1074        1/95
           65                      1045        1/50
           66+                      774        1/24


    Although the   1435 is   a choice—based sample, in a static population it can
be used for analysis provided the proper weighting is used. For example, sup-
pose one wanted to find the probability that an eligible 62 year old would
receive his first benefits at age 63. This is a conditional probability, con-
ditioned on his not having previously received benefits. It is also called
the hazard rate or risk of receiving initial benefits at 63. In a static pop-
ulation the hazard would be the number of 63—year olds in the 1455 divided by
number greater than 62, all weighted by the inverse of the sampling rate.
Even though one does not observe the actual population of 63 year olds exposed
to the risk of benefit receipt, that population can be estimated from the
fractions of older vintages that reached 63 without having received benefits.
However, in a dynamic population this calculation loses accuracy because the
population of 63 year olds at risk is not the sum of the older recipients.
For example, if the population were growing, the population at risk would be
                                                                         S



under—estimated, so the risk would be over estimated. Similar reasoning ap-

plies to the estimation of the response of retirement age to economic vari-

ables. For example, suppose one wants to find how the wage affects the prob-

ability of retirement at 63. In a static population one observes the entire

distribution of wages and retirement dates, so that, in principle, the desired

parameter could be estimated. If wages are growing over time, however, the

older   recipients in the MS come from cohorts that had lower wages when they
were 63 than the current 63—year—old recipients. One would associate low
wages with late retirement. Even if the wage bad no effect on retirement, one
would estimate that the retirement hazard at 63 increases in the wage.
    In the MS.    the   respondents and their spouses were asked extensive ques-
tions   about their work histories, incomes, assets, wages and   health condition.
From the answers, one can construct their economic environment at the time of
the interview, but not in the years before the interview. This limits the
complexity of the retirement model that can be estimated with the 1135 because
one does not know the alternatives that caused them to continue to work in
earlier years. This is a weakness of the 113$ compared with other data sets
such as the Retirement History Survey. The strength of the 1135 is that it has
a generous number of observations on recently retired husbands and wives.

3. Data Mtalysis.
    The goal of this section is to present evidence on whether husbands and
wives tend to retire at the same time. No economic variables will be taken
 into account, so the results will simply establish the kinds of behavior that
have to be explained by     a model.

     In these   data, someone is said to be retired when he is not working. In
 that all respondents are at least 63 years old by the time of the survey, and
                                                                             6

have   received retired workers' Social Security benefits there is probably

little unretirement. For the results of this section, the        sample is
restricted to couples in which both the husband and wife have a date of leav-
ing the last Job. This eliminates couples in which the wife only worked when
she   was   young because only jobs held after 1950 are recorded. For most of the
results the sample will be further restricted to include only couples in which
both retired after the age of 54, so that the behavior accords more with what
is generally taken to be retirement.
      In the reals—worker sample, 1536 couples satisfied these requirements, and
several other minor requirements concerning missing data. The median dif-
ference between the husband's and wife's retirement dates is about 3.8 years.
In that the average age difference is about 3.1 years • this implies that many
husbands and wives retire at about the same age. Table 1 gives the distribu-
tion of the difference between the husband's and wife's retirement dates. In
the male—workers sample, 6.1% of couples retired in the same month; 9.4%
within one month of each other; 11.01 within two months of each other; and
24.6% in the same year. In the female—workers even greater coordination of
retirement dates is found: 8.5% retired within       the same   month. Although it
is not shown in the table • no other concentration of the difference in retire-
ment dates appears. That is, the distribution is flat everywhere except at
differences of a year or less, where there is substantial mass. The table
certainly suggests joint determination of retirement dates.
    To find if the coordination ef retirement dates could be induced by the
Social Security system, the distribution was calculated by the retirement age
of the respondent. The idea is that Social Security has different effects at
different ages •    so   the amount of coordination of retirement dates should vary
                                                                                   7


by   age. For example, if eligibility for benefits at age 62 causes both hus-

band and wife to retire at the same time, one             would   expect a greater con-

centration   of the distribution among respondents who retire at 62 than among
respondents who retire at 63 or 64. The table has some suggestion of such an
effect in the female—workers sample, but it is not verified in the male—
workers sample. In fact, no pattern is apparent in both data sets. The table
does not distinguish coordination of retirelent due to economic variables from
coordination caused by coisplimentarity in leisure; but the table would appear

to rule out coordination caused by assortative mating because while assorts—
tive   mating   would induce a correlation between retirement dates, it would not
cause suàh high concentrations within a year.
       The remainder of this section will be devoted to other ways of studying
tbe correlation in retirement dates that is suggested by the findings in Table
I. The idea that husbands and wives desire. to retire at the same time will be
called the joint retirement hypothesis.
       table 2 shows the probability in the male—worker sample that the wife
retires in a particular age interval as a function of the husband's age at
retirement and of the difference in their ages. For example, among husbands
who retire      at age 62 and who   are   the   same   age as their wives, 30Z have wives
who retire      between 55 and 59. This number [s calculated from the relevant
sub—sample of the male—workers sample by taking the ratio of the number of
wives who retire at 55—59 divided by the total number of husbands who retire
at 62. The average is unweighted because the conditioning event means that
approximately all the observations in a column receive the same weight.                   Many

of the entries      in the table are missing because of sample selection: having

selectedon husband's retirement age and age difference, one cannot observe
                                                                     8


the fraction of wives that retire at certain ages. Consider1 for example,
husbands who retired at 62 and aro three years older than their wives. At the
time of the survey most of the husbands were 63; their wives were 60. and
some of the wives were still working. One does not know how many will retire
at 62. The table does not extend beyond age differences of 4 and —l because
the number of observations becomes small.
    If the joint retirement hypothesis is correct, the wife's retirement prob-
ability will vary with the age difference: the wife's retirement probability
should be greatest at the age difference when both husband and wife can retire
at the same time. An example is when the husband's retirement age is 62 and
the wife's retirement age is 55—59. When the age difference is 2, the wife is
60 at the husband's retirement; when the difference is 3, she is 59. One
would expect, therefore, the probability the wife retires at 59 to be greater
when the age difference is 3 than when the age difference is 2, and the table
shows that to be the case. & counter—example is whon the husband's retirement
is 65, the wife's retirement is 63—64, and the age differences are 0 and 1.
One would expect a higher retirement probability to be associated with the
greater age difference, but that is not the case. Only a few similar ;om—
parisons can reliably be made because of missing data or small samples. If
one restricts comparisons to cells in which the husband and wife retire at the
same time and cells adjacent to those, Just five comparisons in which the
probabilities are based on more than 15 observations can be made. Table 3 is
an extract of Table 2; it has comparisons that are based on 10 or more obser-
vations. The last column indicates whether the comparison supports the Joint
retirement hypothesis: 6 of the 9 entries show support.
    Table 4 has the probability the husband retires classified by the age at
which the wife retires and by the age difference; the probabilities are based
                                                                           9


on the female—workers data. Seven comparisons of retirement probabilities
similar   to those in Table 3 can be made; six support the joint retirement

hypothesis.    In total, then, 12 of   16 comparisons support the hypothesis. The

fraction   of successful comparisons is different from 1/2 at about the 0.05
significance level.
    These kinds of comparisons are not very systematic, and some subjective
judgement is exercised in choosing the cases. Furthermore, one would think
that age differences would shift the entire distribution of retirement ages.
which would change the retirement probabilities at every age. For example
husbands who are four years oldâ than their wives should be less likely to
retire at younger ages than husbands who are the same age as their wives.
    Eecause husbands tend to be older than their wives •    many   of the retirement
probabilites are not reliable in the wale—worker data. The rest of the data
analysis, therefore, uses only the female—workers sample. The object of anal-
ysis is the distribution of the husband's retirement age conditional on the
retirement age of the wife. The joint retirement hypothesis implies that as
the age difference increases the probability that the husband retires at an
early age decreases; that is, the entire distribution of retirement ages
shifts towards greater ages.
    The retirement distributions, conditional on the wife's retirement age,
 are given in Table S. They are found by summing the retirement probabilities
 in Table 4. An example where the joint retirement hypothesis is generall3?
 supported is found in the column headed 60—61 and the rows labelled 55-42. If
 the husband is one year younger than the wife, he would have been 59 or 60
 when the wife retired; 602 of such husbands retired before the age of 63. If
 the husband is 4 years older than the wife, he would have been 64 or 65 when
                                                                        10


the   wife retired. The joint retirement hypothesis   implies that any of these
husbands would retire   at 64 or 65, so that few would retire before 63. The

data    show that to be the case: just 25% of such husbands retired before the
age of 63. Generally the probability the husband retires should increase with
in each block as one moves down each column. Similar reasoning implies that,
holding constant the difference in age, the retirement probabilities should
decrease as the retirement age of the wife increases. An example is the
retirement probability at 61 or less of husbands who are the same age as their
wives: when the wife retires at 55—59, 41% of the husbands retire before 62;
when the wife retires at 66+, just 6% of the husbands retire before 62.
       The entries generally seem to decrease both as the age difference in-
creases and as the wife's retirement age increases. It is desirable, however,
to verify this in a systematic way. One method is to calculate the trends in
the table. Table 6 has the least squares estimates of the trends in the
columns. The interpretation of the entries is the change in the husband's
retirement probability for a change in the age difference. in the example
mentioned before, inwhich the wife retires at 60—61, the probability that the
husband retires before 63 decreases by 0.067 for each year of age difference.
The average of all, the entries in the table is —0.033. This is a simple
measure of the shift in the retirement distributions for an increase in the
age difference. 21 of the 30 entries are negative, which gives additional
support to the joint retirement hypothesis. A roug1 idea of the change in
husband's retirement age for a change in age difference can be calculated from
the entries in Table 6. Taking the retirement ages to be the midpoints of
each interval (with 67 for the upper interval), one finds that a change of a
year in the age difference is associated with an increase in the husband's
retirement age of 0.44 year.
                                                                               11



    Table    7 has the change   in the husband's   retirement probability for a
change in the wife's retirement age, holding constant       the    age difference. For
example, when the age difference is zero the probability that         the   husband
retires before    63 decreases by about 0.033 for each year the wife delays

retirement. The average of the table is —0.043.           28 of the 30 entries are

negative. The increase in husband's retirement age for an increase in wife's

retirement age is roughLy 0.41. Again, these results are consistent with the

joint retirement hypothesis.

    A simplified summary of what the data reveal about the joint retirement

hypothesisis given in table 8.2 The entries are classified by age dif-
ference. They give the percentage distribution of the difference in retire-
ment age. The table aims to show that the difference in age at retirement is
systematically    related to the difference in age. For example, if the joint

retirement hypothesis is correct, then husbands and wives who are the same age

will tend to retire at the same age; thus, one ought to find that if the age
difference is zero, a high fraction will have the same retirement age. In

Table 8 • 25.8% of husbands and wives of the same age retired at the same age.
Similar reasoning suggests that the largest entries in the table should be
along the diagonal: couples with the same difference in age will tend to have
the same difference in retirement age. That is exactly what is found in the
table: the greatest entry in every coltnn is on the diagonal.

4. Models of Retirement Age.
       The results above certainly support the view that retirement dates are

correlated, but they give no indication of the source of correlation: joint

 retirement could be induced by the economic environment, by taste variation,

 or by complimentarity in leisure. For example, it may        be   that wives and hus—
                                                                                 12



bands   tend   to retire at the same time   because   the wife's Social Security

benefit, based on the husband's earnings record, cannot be drawn until the

husband retires. One would then find correlation between retirement dates.

Further cross—classification by levels of economic resources would allow one

roughly to hold constant economic resources, but the counts in the cells would
become too small to allow interpretation. A useful way to proceed
                                                                   is to in-
troduce a model of retirement behavior. It will control for economic vari-
ables in a way dictated by the functional form. The, reader can interpret the
results as an extension of the cross—tabulations or as indicative of behavior.
      The vehicle for exploring the    influence   of economic variables on retire-
ment age will be the Stone—Geary utility function. It can quite naturally be
parameterized to include both systematic and random taste variation that are
econometrically identified. The thought experiment that will lie behind the
estimation is as follows: given at age 55          a fixed wage and   a stock   of assets,

workers    choose the number of additional years to work. From this point of
view, the age of retirement is an object of demand, and an equation that ex-
 plains the retirement age is a demand equation. Because of the economic en-

 vironment,     however, there are some   important differences from the usual kinds

 of   demand estimation; these differences will be discussed          below.

        Suppose that the husband and wife maximize lifetime utility givon by


               (l—31—82)ln(x—a) ÷ B1ln(b1 — A1) + E21n(b2 —


 in which x measure lifetime goods        consumption; a is   a parameter, necessary

 goods consumption; A1      is the husband's years of work (retirement age);
 is the husband's taste parameter; and A2 and b2 are the wife's years of work
 and taste parameter. As suggested by the cross—tabulations in Section 3, b1
                                                                                     13



and b2 will depend     on the difference in    ages,     and on random components that

are correlated. In addition they wilt vary with health status. For the mo-

ment assume that the lifetime budget constraint is given by


            px   — w1A1 VA + !.

in which p is the price of x, w1 and w2 are the wage rates and Y              is
The retirement equations are

            A1 — (l—B1)b1 — B1(b2w2/w1
                                          + Y/w1 —

                            —                       —
            A2 — (1—B2)b2       B2(b1w1/w2 + Y/w2       ap/w2).

The    taste index of each person enters his own equation and his spouse's equa-
tion. Let b1 and b2 haveboth systematic parts and random parts                as


                 — xp1 +

                 —      +


Upon substituting the specifications of b1 and             b2   in the demand equations.
 the   demand   equations will have a systematic part           that depends on      and

        and error terms (derived from a1 and a2) that have a complicated
 variance—covariance matrix. From the specification, the structure of the
 variance—covariance matrix is known, and it            offers    cress—equation restric-
 tions, With static wages and prices and realizations on A1 and                    one could

 contemplate estimating the parameters, including the taste parameters and
 variance—covariance matrix.

       In the NBS data a number of obstacles stand in the way of estimation.
One    observes assets at about the time of retirement, so that the realizations
on    I will depend on the realizations on A. Neither pensions nor Social

Security has        been   mentioned; yet they surely affect the retirement decision.

They have a wealth affect: couples with higher levels of pensions and Social

Security     will    tend to retire earlier. They have price effects; the reward

from    working another year depends in a complicated way on age,                the   structure
of the pension, the Social Security law and the contribution history. The
price effects act through actuarial reductions in benefits, recalculation of
benefits to reflect an extra year's              earnings,   and within period    effects

through      the earnings test. Full—scale modelling             of   the influence    of pensions
and Social Security on the retirement of a              single   person is    far beyond what

can be      supported by      the 1155 because   the data give    little   information on these

variables      in   the years before retirement. For example, even at retirement
one does not know the increase             in the pension    or Social     Security that   would

result      from another year of work.
       The approach        to these problems is to assume that realizations on assets
and    on   annuities (the sum      of   pensions   and Social   Security) are   representa-

tions of the opportunities available to a worker who is contemplating retire-
ment, but that the realizations differ from the opportunites by a random com-
ponent that         depends   partly on the actual     retirement     age chosen. This implies
that assets and annuities should enter equations (I) as endogenous variables.
Annuities should have a different coefficient from assets as they are a flow,
not a stock.
       Weighted averages of the data are shown in Table g• The weights account
 for the stratified sampling procedure. It is evident that there are system—
                                                                              15


atic    differences between the two   samples. As   would be expected, the   wives   in

the    female—workers sample have a greater attachment to the labor force than
the wives in the male—workers sample: they retire later; they have higher
wages, higher Social Security benefits and pensions. They are in better
health as a smaller fraction say they have health problems that affect their
jobs. The husbands in the female—workers sample are different from the hus-
bands in the male—workers sample: they retire •arlier; they have lower
wages, fewer assets, smaller Social Security benefits and pensions, and worse
health. The health of the husband is a possible reason for the differences
between the two samples: the wives of husbands with bad health spent more
time in the labor force; the husbands had lower earnings and greater health
expenditures, resulting in lower assets at retirement.
       The results from estimating the retirement—age equations (1) over the two
samples can be found in Table 10. The estimates certainly differ across the
two samples. At least partly this is due to large standard errors. Accord-
ing to the Stone—Geary utility function, the error terms have heteros—
cedasticity as well as cross—equation correlation. This was not corrected in
the estimation as .later results suggest the Stone—Gear)' framework may not be
appropriate. The emphasis here will be on the average of the two estimates.
       Reference to (I) shows that in the husband's retirement equation the vec-
tor that explains husband's tastes appears directly, whereas in the wife's
equation the vector is multiplied by a factor of proportionality, 2' In
the husband's equation increases in the age difference increase b1, which in-
creases the marginal utility of work and hence increases the retirement age.4
The average of the effects in the two samples is about 0.26 per year of age
difference:      increasing the age difference by a year would increase the hus—
                                                                                   16



band's retirement age by 0.26 year, holding constant the wife's taste para-

meter, If the factor of proportionality in the wife's equation is negative.

which   it should be •   one   finds   the same pattern of signs   on   the age difference

variables   as in the husband's equations.
   The husband's own health affects his retirement age in the expected way.
It is interesting that the few husbands who say health limits their work at
home tend to retire later. In th. wife's retirement equation the same nega-
tive factor of proportionality that multiplies husband's health should multi-
ply the age difference; yet, there is little consistancey of sign.
    In the wife's retirement—age equation, the wife's taste index decreases
in the age difference, which is symmetric with the husband's. taste index.
Thus, if the age difference decreases (the wife becomes older), the marginal
utility of work of the wife increases and she retires later, Just as does the
husband if his age increases. On average a decrease of a year in the age
difference increases the wife's retirement age by 0.27 year, holding constant
the husband's taste index. The responses of the husband and wife are for
practical purposes exactly the same. The effect of age difference on the
wife's taste index in the husband's retirement equation should, at least.
have the same sign over the two samples, but there is no such cons is tancy.
    In the wife's retirement equation, the wife's health indicators affect
retirement in the usual way: if health affects work on the Job. b2 decreases
and the wife retires earlier. In the husband's equation, bad health in-
creases the husbands retirement age. The effect is through b2, which if the
factor of proportionality is negative, decreases with bad health. This
reduces the wife's retirement age and increases the husband's.
    The total effects of the economic variables cannot be read directly from
the table because of intereactions. As far as the own wage is concerned, it
                                                                             17


has   a positive effect if all the other economic variables with which it is

intereacted are put to zero. However, if they are evaluated at their sample

means, the wage effect takes     the   opposite sign: evaluating own   wage, spouse

wage,   own annuity, spouse annuity and assets    at the sample means produces

these estimates of the wags effects in years per dollar.

                       Effect of own wage on own retirement age
                                 Husbands Retirement Wife's retirement
               Male Data                   —.02                —.31
               Female Data                 —.16                —.02


Thus increasing the own wage tends to cause earlier retirement, although the
change is not large.
   The spouse's wage is interacted with the spouse's taste vector and with
the own wage. Evaluated at no health limitation and no age difference, the
average effect (over both samples) of the wife's wage on the husband's
retiremànt is about -0.02 year per dollar; the effect of the husband's wage
on the wife's retirement is about 0.02 year per dollar. These effects are
practically zero.         -

       The   effect of own annuity (the sum of Social Security and pensions) on
retirement age averages about 0.04 year per thousand for husbands and 0.43
for wives. Both suggest the price effect dominates income effects: appar-
ently the annuity gain from delaying retirement is substantial.
       The effect of the husband's annuity on the wife's retirement age is prac-
 tically zero. An increase in the wife's annuity on the husband's retirement
age is positive and of moderate magnitude. An explanation for this is found
in the wife's response to her own annuity: her retirement age increases, so
 the   husband's retirement age also increases.
                                                                             18

       The average effect of assets on the husband's   retirement age is   practi-

cally zero. The average change in the wife's retirement age       is   about —0.006

year    per thousand dollars of assets. Because these data have considerable
variation in assets across households, asset variation can reduce the wife's
retirement age by several years.
     The following table sumniarizes the effects of the economic variables.
Part A gives the estimated change in retirement age associated with changing
the economic variables from the 25th percentile point in the distribution of
the variable to the 75th percentile point. Part B gins the changes in the
variables that underlie the calculations.

       Husband     6.5         3.8            8.0          5.2             67
         Wife      3.8         6.5            5.2          8.0             61


For example a change of $5.2 thousand in the wife's annuity is estimated to
reduce the wife's retirement age by 2.24 years.
       One might well ask whether the Stone-Ceary utility function produces a
reasonable representation of the data. The response of retirement age to the
economic variables certainly seems reasonable, but this is not really a test
of the functional form. The utility function implies a number of cross—
                                                                                       19



equation   restrictions which were not imposed in the estimation. They result
from the appearance of both taste parameters in both retirement equations.
The factor of proportionality is —B2/(l—B1) for the husband's index and —
            for the wife's index, and —B and —B2 are the coefficient, on as-
sets. But it would be taking the model beyond reasonable bounds to estimate
  and    B from the coefficients on assets for the purpose of checking the
equivalence   of the index parameters because of other implicit factors. For

example, wage rates are in dollars per hour whereas the utility

function refers to lifetime utility. A more generous test of the propor-

tionality    hypothesis rests on whether or not the              12x4 matrix


               —
                    (ft1   fi2    $3    $4)

has    rank one.     Each    of   the         is a 12—vector of the estimated coefficients

that    give the husband's and wife's taste parameters. Each retirement equa-
tion produces two estimates of the fi, one from each data set. The form of the
test comes from noting that one should be able to write each vector as

             fi —

where    It1 is a scalar. This implies that B has rank one. The normalized
characteristic roots of E'8 are

             .45 .32 .17 and .06.

The second and third are far enough from zero that a formal test was not con-
ducted • and B was concluded to have rank greater than one.
       The retirement equations derived from the Stone—Geary utility function
are complicated and difficult to interpret because of the interactions. In
                                                                                  20


that    the   cross—equation restrictions do not seem to hold, a simplified
retirement equation was estimated. Retirement was made linear in all the
variables. The results of that estimation are in Table 11. As before, the -
estimation method is instrumental variables taking own annuity and assets to
be endogenous variables.
    As far as the effects of own taste variables on own retirement age are
concerned, they are about the same as the average effects from the Stone—
Ceary formulation. Both formulations produce an increase in retirement age
of husbands of about 0.25 per year of age difference and 0.27 for wives. The
effects of the own health variables on own retirement age are as follows

                        Effect on own health on own retirement
                              Husbands                     Wives
                         Stone—Gear, Sianle          Stone—Gear, S laDle

               Home           .60        .56               .47       .28
               Both         —.85     —.76                 —.92     —1.10


The effects are remarkably     consistent      across estimation methods,   and   they are

very    similar for husbands and wives. There is, of course, some question
about the interpretation of theses effects: they are based on the reported
health status after retirement. They will be the result of a mixture of
people who become seriously ill so that they cannot work, people who may have
a chronic minor illness so that they choose not to work and a range of people
in between. Although only lX—2X of the individuals report their health af-
fects work at home, they work about a half a year longer than people with no
such health limitation.
       The effects of the economic variables can be most easily summarized by
giving the change in retirement age that would result from changing a van—
                                                                              21


able from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile. The changes in retire-

ment age are as follows


                    Own   wage Spouse wage Own annuity Spouse annuity Assets
       Husband        —.13       —.04           —.41         .44             .40
        Wife          —.10        .10           2.68        —.12        —1.07


The own   wage response is practically zero here whereas     in the Stone—Geary

formulation    it was about —0.5 year. Other differences are that in these
results an increase in own annuities causes the husband to retire earlier
whereas in the Stone—Ceary results he retired later. The wife's response to
assets is almost three tines as great as before.
    The correlation between the residuals from the husband's and wife's
retirement equation is 0.29 in the male data and 0.32 in the female data.
Thus • even   taking into account the age differences and the spouse's economic
variables there still remains unexplained positive correlation between the
retirement ages.
    If someone desires to work beyond the normal retirement age associated
with his primary job, often he must change jobs, and often the new job has a
lower wage rate than the primary job (Burtless and Moffitt, 1985; Guslnan and
Steinmeier,      1986). One   would therefore, tend to find a negative association
between the wage and the retirement      age.    Put differently, the wage   on the

last   job depends on the retirement age, so that, according to this reasoning.
it is endogenous in a retirement equation. to check the empirical importance
of this observation, the simplified retirement equation of Table 11 was
reestimated taking the own wage as well as assets and own annuity to be
endogenous. The results are very similar to those in Table 11. so they are
                                                                         22


not reported. Of particular interest is that the own wage response remains
small.
    A further method to find the interaction between retirement ages is to
estimate   a conditional retirement equation. It specifies that the retirement

age of, say, the husband depends on the retirement age of the wife. From

such   an equation one can directly read the magnitude of the dependence. The
theoretical Justification is based on the conditional, distribution of
bivariate normal random variables. If X and Y are bivariate normal random
variables,   then



             E(YIX) —,s,+p—'(X—p)
                            ax


in which p, is E(Y); p, is E(X); p is the correlation coefficient between Y
and X; and    and a, are the standard errors of Y and X. Let I be the
retirement age of the husband and X be the retirement age of the wife. Then,
the coefficient on the retirement age of the wife in the husband's retirement
equation should be p o/a.
   Table 12 has the estimated conditional retirement equation. The func-
tional form is the simplified retirement equation of Table 11 with the addi-
tion that the spouse's retirement age enters as a right—hand variable. The
estimated coefficients are qualitatively similar to those reported in Table
11 so they will not be discussed further. Of greater interest is that the

spouse's retirement age is an important explanatory variable. Increasing the
wife's retirement age by a year increases the husband's retirement age by
 about 0.25 year (average over both data sets); increasing the husband's
 retirement age by a year increases the wife's retirement age by about 0.31
                                                                                   23


year. As discussed earlier, a rough estimate of the effect of the wife's
retirement age on the husband's retirement age can be found          from   the   results

in   Table 7. That effect is 0.41. Given the great difference in methods,

this compares rather well with the estimate in Table 12. These relationships

between retirement ages are in addition to any induced by the age difference,

which by itself would tend to cause retirement dates to be correlated.

      The   conditional retirement results may be   compared with unconditional

results by using the theory of normal random variables. As discussed above
the coefficient on X in the relationship E(YIX) should be p                   p was

cient on X, the wife's retirement age in the conditional equation for the
husband's retirement age, should be 0.24*2.71/4.15 — 0.16. The actual value
from   Table 12 is 0.18. The following table summarizes the comparisons.

      The comparisons are quite close and support further the Joint retirement
hypothesis. The general impression is that the         husband's   retirement age has

a    greater effect on   the wife's retirement age than the wife's on the hus-

band's. This accords with      the   generally accepted view in the labor supply

literature.


5.     Conclusion.

       The results support the idea that    the   retirement of husbands and wives is

a Joint process. Often both spouses retire within a short period. The dif-

ference    in ago seems to cause substantial variation in retirement age. The
rough estimate from the retirement probabilities is about 0.45 year per year
of age difference. From either the Stone—Geary or the simple model it is
about 0.25.. Given the wide differences in estimation methods, these
estimates are in good agreement and certainly support the joint retirement
hypothesis.
       Generally the cross—economic variables      do not have a strong effect on

retirement    ages, so they do not provide a good explanation for the correla-
tion of retirement dates. But it would be surprising to have strong cross
effects given that the own effects are not strong.          This is surely at least

partly    due to weaknesses in the data and to the simplified estimation methods
required by the data. In particular one cannot construct the economic en-
vironment in the years before retirement.
       The residual correlation between the retirement ages of husbands and
wives also supports the joint retirement hypothesis. Of course one does not
know the cause of the correlation: it could be due to neglected economic

variables, assortative mating, or true complimentarity in the utility func-

tion.
                                                                        25

       Much mote research on the Joint retirement decision is needed. In par-

ticular, a close modelling of Social Security and pensions should be able to

separate the wealth eEfects from the price effects. Nothing was done here

about adjustment of hours within a year, which is often accompanied by a

reduction in the wage rate. One would hope that future research would be

able    to account for these problems and to find the extent of true com—
plimentarity in retirement.

1. Henretta and O'Rand find in the Rfl that increasing the age of the wife
decreases the probability that she will retire after the husband, which seems
to imply a correlation. But this result cannot be interpreted as a joint
retirement decision: one would get the same result if individuals in the
sample were randomly attached to other individuals simply because increasing
age is associated with decreased labor force participation.
2. This table was suggested by David Ellwood.
3. The model does not have a role for the adjustment of annual hours of
work. In this formulation, the wage is implicitly the annual wage (earn-
ings); but in the estimation the hourly wage is used as it is surely a better
measure of the cost of leisure.
4. The dependence of tastes on the age difference was, in estimation not
reported here, represented by 10 dummy variables; the relationship was close
enough to linear that tastes were made linear in age differences between —4
and 6.
5.   This   correlation is slightly different from what was reported earlier be-
cause it    comes   from an equation in which the own wage is endogenous.
