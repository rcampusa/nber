                                              ABSTRACT

        We update and extend our previous study of the effect of drug age -- years since FDA approval --
on total medical expenditure, in several respects. The estimates indicate that, in the entire population, a
reduction in the age of drugs utilized reduces non-drug expenditure 7.2 times as much as it increases drug
expenditure. In the Medicare population, a reduction in the age of drugs utilized reduces non-drug
expenditure by all payers 8.3 times as much as it increases drug expenditure; it reduces Medicare
non-drug expenditure 6.0 times as much as it increases drug expenditure. About two-thirds of the
non-drug Medicare cost reduction is due to reduced hospital costs. The remaining third is approximately
evenly divided between reduced Medicare home health care cost and reduced Medicare office-visit cost.
We also found that the mean age of drugs used by Medicare enrollees with private Rx insurance is about
9% lower than the mean age of drugs used by Medicare enrollees without either private or public Rx
insurance.

                    Benefits and Costs of Newer Drugs: An Update

Executive Summary


       In previous work, we found strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the
replacement of older drugs by new drugs resulted in reductions in total medical
expenditures. In this study, we update and extend our previous study of the effect of drug
age—years since FDA approval—on total medical expenditure, in several respects: (1)
the unit of analysis is a medical condition, rather than a prescription; (2) the sample is
much larger, including data for three years, rather than one year; (3) we obtain estimates
for the Medicare population as well as for the entire population; and (4) within the
Medicare population, we examine the effect of drug age on Medicare expenditure as well
as on expenditure by all payers.
       The estimates indicate that, in the entire population, a reduction in the age of
drugs utilized reduces non-drug expenditure 7.2 times as much as it increases drug
expenditure. For example, reducing the mean age of drugs used to treat a condition from
15 years to 5.5 years is estimated to increase prescription drug spending by $18 but
reduce other medical spending by $129, yielding a $111 net reduction in total health
spending. Most of the savings are due to reductions in hospital expenditure ($80) and in
physician office-visit expenditures ($24).
       In the Medicare population, a reduction in the age of drugs utilized reduces non-
drug expenditure by all payers (i.e., Medicare and various forms of Medicare
supplemental insurance, Medicare for dually eligible individuals and Medicare
beneficiaries’ out of pocket payments) 8.3 times as much as it increases drug expenditure;
it reduces Medicare non-drug expenditure 6.0 times as much as it increases drug
expenditure. About two-thirds of the non-drug Medicare cost reduction is due to reduced
hospital costs. The remaining third is approximately evenly divided between reduced
Medicare home health care cost and reduced Medicare office-visit cost.
       We also show that Medicare enrollees with private prescription drug coverage
tend to use newer drugs than those without such coverage: the mean age of drugs used by
                                                                                                      2


Medicare enrollees with private Rx insurance is about 9% lower than the mean age of
drugs used by Medicare enrollees without either private or public Rx insurance.


        Introduction


        In a previous paper 1 , we used person-, condition-, and event- level data from the
1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to examine the effect of drug age—
years since FDA approval—on total medical expenditure and mortality. Since many
individuals in the MEPS sample have multiple medical conditions, we were able to
control for all individual characteristics—both observed and unobserved—by including
“individual effects”.
        The results provided strong support for the hypothesis that the replacement of
older by newer drugs generally results in reductions in total medical expenditure as well
as mortality. The estimates indicated that reductions in drug age tend to reduce all types
of non-drug medical expenditure, although the reduction in inpatient expenditure was by
far the largest. The total estimated reduction in non-drug expenditure from reducing the
age of the drug was almost four times as large as the increase in drug expenditure, so
reducing the age of the drug results in a substantial net reduction in the total cost of
treating the condition. Moreover, people consuming new drugs were significantly less
likely to die by the end of the survey than people consuming older drugs.
        In this paper we update and extend the previous study in three important ways. In
the previous study, the unit of observation (level of aggregation) was the prescribed
medicine event (prescription). We linked condition- level data (e.g., data on the number
of hospital stays associated with the condition for which a drug was consumed) to data on
each of the prescriptions associated with the condition. Hence if a person had five
prescriptions for a given condition, there would be five observations in the sample
corresponding to that condition.

MEPS,” Health Affairs 20(5), September/October 2001, 241-51. A previous version of this paper, “The
Benefits and Costs of Newer Drugs: Evidence from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey,” was
issued as NBER Working Paper No.w8147, March 2001.
                                                                                                3


           Alternatively, we could have aggregated the prescription level data up to the
condition level. This approach would address any concern about correlation among
disturbances relating to observations corresponding to the same condition. That is the
level of aggregation we will use in this paper. In this approach, there is one observation
per condition per person, rather than one observation per prescription. The drug vintage
measure we use is the mean age of all of the person’s prescriptions for that condition.
Aggregation reduces the size of the sample by about half. In 1996, 76 thousand
prescribed medicine events were linked to 36 thousand distinct conditions.
           While estimation at the condition level is likely to reduce the measured precision
of the estimates, another change we will make—increasing the sample period from one
year to three years—is likely to increase the (true and measured) precision of the
estimates. Since the original study, which was based solely on 1996 data, was performed,
data for two additional years (1997 and 1998) have become available. 2 The number of
medical conditions recorded during the entire 3-year period is 3.4 times as great as the
number of conditions recorded in 1996 alone. 3
           In 1997, 39 percent of MEPS prescriptions were consumed by people who had
Medicare coverage. The vast majority of these prescriptions were not paid for by
Medicare, but Congress and the Administration are currently developing proposals for a
Medicare prescription drug benefit. While there is no obvious reason why the effect of
drug age on total medical expenditure should be different in the Medicare population than
it is in the non-Medicare population, it may be useful to estimate the model in the
Medicare population as well as in the total population. We will report both of these. We
will also present estimates of the effect of drug age on Medicare (as well as total)

Medicare beneficiaries with private Rx coverage and those without either private or
public Rx coverage.

         Methodology


         The basic model that we will estimate is similar to the model estimated in the
earlier study:


Yijt = ηi + θj + δt + β log(AGE_DRUGijt ) + Σ y λy COND_DURijty + εijt                           (1)


where:
         Yijt = a measure of medical expenditure (e.g., hospital expenditure) associated
         with condition i borne by person j in year t (t = 1996, 1997, 1998)
         ηi = a fixed condition effect
         θj = a fixed person effect
         δt = a fixed year effect (t = 1996, 1997, 1998)
         log(AGE_DRUGijt ) = the log of the average age (years since FDA approval) of
         the drugs consumed for condition i by person j in year t
         COND_DURijty = 1 if condition i borne by person j in year t began y years ago,
         otherwise zero
         ε ijt = the disturbance.
Inclusion of “individual effects” (θj ‘s) controls for all individual characteristics—both
observed (e.g. age of the patient) and unobserved (e.g. age and practice style of his
physician)—that determine Y and may be correlated with the age of the drug. Estimates
of the parameter of interest (β) from eq. (1) are based entirely on the within-individual




4
  Medicare expenditures differs from total expenditure on the Medicare population because the latter
includes various types of supplemental insurance, Medicaid for dually-eligible individuals, and Medicare
beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket payments.
                                                                                                            5


correlation between Y and log(AGE_DRUG), not on the between- individual correlation. 5
Suppose a person has two conditions, asthma and hypertension, and is taking medications
for both. He may have above-average numbers of hospital stays for both conditions,
compared to other individuals with the same conditions. And he may be taking older-
than-average drugs for both conditions. But due to the presence of individual effects in
eq. (1), this would not make β positive. For β to be positive, it would have to be the case
that the condition for which the age of the person’s medications were more above average
(relative to both individual and condition means) was the same as the condition for which
his hospital stays were more above average.


         Results


         Estimates of the parameter β from equation (1) are presented in Table 1. Each
estimate reported in the table is from a separate model. The estimates in panel A are
based on the entire population, and on expenditures by all payers, by type of service
(prescription drugs, hospital care, home health care, etc.)
         The first dependent variable we consider is total prescription drug expenditure
associated with the condition. Not surprisingly, a decrease in log(AGE_DRUG) is
associated with a significant increase in total prescription drug expenditure. Reducing
the mean age of drugs consumed for the condition from about 15 years to 5.5 years
(which would cause log(AGE_DRUG) to decrease by 1) would increase total prescription
drug expenditure by about $18.
         The second dependent variable is total non-drug expenditure (the sum of
expenditure on hospital care, office visits, home health care, outpatient visits, and
emergency room visits). A decrease in log(AGE_DRUG) is associated with a significant
decrease in total non-drug expenditure. Moreover, the estimated reduction in total non-
drug expenditure is 7.2 times as large as the estimated increase in drug expenditure. This
implies that a unit decrease in log(DRUG_AGE)—which would occur, for example, if

  The θj‘s capture all attributes of the individual that do not vary across prescriptions and conditions,
including sex, age, education, race, income, insurance status, and the number of medical conditions
reported by the person.

one switched from 15 year-old drugs to 5.5 year old drugs —would yield a $111 net
reduction in the total medical cost of the condition. The next five columns show
estimates of the effects on each of the five components of non-drug medical costs. All of
the estimated effects are positive and highly statistically significant. Reduced hospital
expenditure accounts for 62% of the total non-drug medical cost reduction. A unit
decrease in log(DRUG_AGE) is estimated to reduce hospital expenditure by $80, or 21%
of mean hospital expenditure per condition (which includes expenditures for those with
and without hospitalizations). The second- largest cost reduction--$24--comes from
reduced office-visit expenditure. Home health care and outpatient expenditure are
reduced by about $12 and $10, respectively. These figures are summarized in the second
column of the following table.

        The estimates in panel B of Table 1 are based on the Medicare population, and
again examine expenditures by all payers on Medicare beneficiaries (e.g. Medicare,
private supplemental insurance, Medicaid for dually eligible individuals and out of
                                                                                                           7


pocket). Average medical expenditure per condition is 57% higher ($1286 vs. $817) in
the Medicare population than it is in the entire population: Medicare recipients have more
expensive conditions, as well as more conditions per person. In the Medicare population,
a unit reduction in log(DRUG_AGE) would increase total prescription drug expenditure
per condition by about $21, and reduce total non-drug expenditure per condition by $176,
yielding a $155 net reduction in expenditure per condition. Hospital cost reduction
accounts for 58% ($102) of the latter. Home health care yields the next largest cost
reduction ($37); office visits ($34) account for most of the remaining cost reduction.
These figures are summarized in the third column of the table above.
         The estimates in panel C of Table 1 are based only on Medicare expenditure and
the Medicare population. Medicare pays about two-thirds of the total non-drug medical
costs of the Medicare population. The estimates indicate that a unit reduction in
log(DRUG_AGE) would reduce Medicare expenditure per “Medicare condition” 6 by
$127. (This just happens to be very close to the effect of a unit reduction in
log(DRUG_AGE) on expenditure by all payers per condition in the entire population.)
About two-thirds of the non-drug Medicare cost reduction is due to reduced hospital
costs. The remaining third is approximately evenly divided between reduced Medicare
home health care cost and reduced Medicare office-visit cost. These figures are
summarized in the last column of the table above.


         Effect of Rx insurance coverage on age of drugs consumed


         The preceding evidence indicates that the age or vintage of drugs has important
effects on non-drug medical expenditure. Now we will argue that the age or vintage of
drugs is likely to depend on the extent of prescription drug coverage 7,8 :




6
  A “Medicare condition” refers to a condition borne by a Medicare recipient.
7
  Prescription drug coverage may also affect the quantity of drugs consumed.
8
  A recent HHS study alluded to this effect: “People with coverage not only fill more prescriptions than
those without coverage; they are likely to have access to a broader array of therapies, including more costly
therapies.” (Department of Health & Human Services, “Report to the President: Prescription Drug
Coverage, Spending, Ut ilization, and Prices,” April 2000.)
                                                                                                          8


                                                                                   Non-drug
    Rx insurance                           Age of drugs                             medical
     coverage                                utilized                             expenditure

        Suppose that a patient has a choice between a new drug and an old drug to treat a
given medical condition. Let BN represent the gross benefit (or value) to the patient of
the new drug, and B0 represent the gross benefit to the patient of the old drug. Then (BN -
B0 ) is the difference between the benefit of the new drug and the benefit of the old drug.
Suppose that this difference in benefit is normally distributed across patients. This is
depicted in Figure 1. (Although the mean difference in benefit is presumably positive,
for some patients BN < B0 .) Let (C N - C0 ) represent the difference between the cost to the
patient of the new drug and the cost to the patient of the old drug. Suppose that
physicians/patients choose the new drug if and only if the benefit difference exceeds the
cost difference: (BN - B0 ) > (C N - C0 ). Hence, the fraction of patients who choose the
new drug is equal to the area under the normal curve to the right of (C N - C0 ).
        We hypothesize that prescription drug coverage often reduces (C N - C0 ), because
it reduces the cost to the individual of new drugs more than it reduces the cost of old
drugs. This is illustrated by the following example:


Cost to individual             New drug Old drug Difference
Without insurance                     $50       $20        $30
With insurance
(copayment)                              $15              $5              $10

If prescription drug coverage reduces (C N - C0 )—it shifts the (C N - C0 ) line to the left in
Figure 1—it will increase the fraction of patients utilizing the new drug.
        The data are consistent with the hypothesis that Medicare enrollees with private
Rx insurance use newer drugs than Medicare enrollees without either private or public Rx
insurance. The mean age of drugs used by Medicare enrollees with private Rx insurance
is about 8.6% lower than the mean age of drugs used by Medicare enrollees without
private or public Rx insurance. 9

  56.3% of the drugs utilized in 1997 by Medicare enrollees with private Rx insurance were approved by
the FDA after 1970. 52.1% of the drugs utilized in 1997 by Medicare enrollees without private or public
Rx insurance were approved by the FDA after 1970.

       Summary and Conclusion


       In this paper we updated and extended our previous study of the effect of drug
age—years since FDA approval—on total medical expenditure, in several respects. The
estimates indicate that, in the entire population, a reduction in the age of drugs utilized
reduces non-drug expenditure 7.2 times as much as it increases drug expenditure. In the
Medicare population, a reduction in the age of drugs utilized reduces non-drug
expenditure by all payers (e.g. Medicare, private supplemental insurance, Medicaid for
dually eligible individuals and out of pocket) 8.3 times as much as it increases drug
expenditure; it reduces Medicare non-drug expenditure 6.0 times as much as it increases
drug expenditure. About two-thirds of the non-drug Medicare cost reduction is due to
reduced hospital costs. The remaining third is approximately evenly divided between
reduced Medicare home health care cost and reduced Medicare office-visit cost.
       We also found that Medicare enrollees with private prescription drug coverage
tend to use newer drugs than those without such coverage: the mean age of drugs used by
Medicare enrollees with private Rx insurance is about 9 % lower than the mean age of
drugs used by Medicare enrollees without either private or public Rx insurance.
