According to conventional wisdom, terms of trade shocks represent a major source of business
cycles in emerging and poor countries. This view is largely based on the analysis of calibrated
business-cycle models. We argue that the view that emerges from empirical SVAR models is
strikingly different. We estimate country-specific SVARs using data from 38 emerging and
countries and find that terms-of-trade shocks explain less than 10 percent of movements in
aggregate activity. We then build a three-sector open economy model and estimate key structural
parameters country by country. We find that at the country level there is a disconnect between the
empirical and theoretical models in the importance assigned to terms-of-trade shocks.

1     Introduction
The conventional wisdom is that terms of trade shocks represent a major source of business
cycles in emerging and poor countries. This view is largely based on the analysis of calibrated
business-cycle models. Essentially this result is obtained by first estimating a process for
the terms of trade and then feeding it to an equilibrium business cycle model to compute
the variance of macroeconomic indicators of interest induced by this type of disturbance.
Then this variance is compared to the observed unconditional variance of the corresponding
macroeconomic indicator to obtain the share of variance explained by terms-of-trade shocks.
Consistently, this methodology arrives at the conclusion that more than 30 percent of the
variance of output and other macroeconomic indicators is attributable to terms-of-trade
shocks (Mendoza, 1995; Kose, 2002).
    In this paper, we argue that there is a disconnect between theoretical and empirical mod-
els when it comes to gauging the role of terms-of-trade disturbances in generating business
cycles. We estimate country-specific structural vector autoregression (SVAR) models using
data from 38 poor and emerging countries and find that on average terms-of-trade shocks
explain only 10 percent of movements in aggregate activity. The result that emerges from
the SVAR analysis is therefore that terms of trade shocks account for a modest fraction of
business cycle fluctuations.
  We then perform country-by-country comparisons of the predictions of the empirical
SVAR model with the predictions of a theoretical model. The comparison is disciplined by
four principles. First, the SVAR is based on the identification restriction that the terms
of trade in poor and emerging countries are exogenous. This assumption is universally
embraced by the related literature whether empirical or theoretical. Second, we use (a
generalized version of) the theoretical environment upon which the conventional wisdom
was built. This is a model with three sectors, importables, exportables, and nontradables,
featuring production, domestic absorption, capital, and labor in all three sectors. Third, the
empirical SVAR model and the theoretical model share the same terms-of-trade process for
each country in the sample. Fourth, both the empirical and theoretical models are estimated
country by country on the same time series. Specifically, the structural parameters of the
theoretical model are estimated by matching the impulse responses to terms-of-trade shocks
implied by the SVAR model. This last principle gives the theoretical model a larger chance
to match the data than is customary in the related literature.
   We find that when macroeconomic indicators are measured in the same units in the
theoretical model as in the data, then terms-of-trade shocks explain on average around 10
percent of the variance of output and other key macroeconomic indicators. On the surface


                                              1
this result appears as consistent with the predictions of the SVAR model. However, we find
that at the country level the theoretical and empirical models are disconnected. There is
virtually no relationship between the importance assigned to terms-of-trade shocks in the
two models, despite the fact that both share the same country-specific terms-of-trade process
and are estimated on the same data.
   This paper is related to a number of theoretical and empirical studies on the effects of
terms-of-trade shocks in poor and emerging countries. On the theoretical side, Mendoza
(1995) and Kose (2002) find, using calibrated models, that terms-of-trade shocks are a ma-
jor driver of short-run fluctuations. These two papers are the standard reference for the
conventional view that terms of trade represent a major source of fluctuations for devel-
oping countries. Fernández, González, and Rodrı́guez (2015) and Shousha (2015) focus on
commodity exporters (countries for which commodities represent a large fraction of total
exports) and find that movements in commodity prices play an important role in explaining
business cycles since the mid 1990s. On the empirical side, Broda (2004), using an SVAR
methodology, finds that terms-of-trade shocks play a much larger role in generating business
cycles in fixed-exchange rate economies than they do in flexible-exchange rate economies.
The present paper is most closely related to Lubik and Teo (2005), who estimate a small
open economy model using full information Bayesian methods and find that interest rate
shocks are a more important source of business cycles than terms of trade shocks and to
Aguirre (2011), who estimates an SVAR and a business-cycle model and finds that in the
theoretical model output and other macroeconomic aggregates display a larger response to
terms-of-trade shocks than in the empirical SVAR model.
   The remainder of the paper is presented in seven sections. Section 2 estimates country-
specific SVAR models and presents the implied share of aggregate fluctuations attributable to
terms-of-trade shocks. Section 3 extends the SVAR analysis to allow for interest rate spread
shocks. Section 4 develops the theoretical model. Section 5 presents the calibration of
the theoretical model and performs country-specific estimates of key structural parameters.
Section 6 analyzes the importance of terms of trade shocks predicted by the theoretical
model. Section 7 presents a country-by-country comparison of the contribution of terms of
trade shocks to business cycles implied by theoretical and SVAR models. Section 8 concludes.

2         How Important Are Terms of Trade Shocks? SVAR
          Analysis
Movements in the terms of trade are generally believed to be an important driver of business
cycles. But how important? In this section, we address this question by providing an
empirical measure of the contribution of terms-of-trade shocks to aggregate fluctuations
based on an SVAR model.
        The model includes six variables, namely, the terms of trade, the trade balance, output,
consumption, investment, and the real exchange rate and is estimated on annual data from
38 emerging and poor countries covering the period 1980 to 2011. The data source is the
World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. The criteria for a country to
be included in the panel is to have at least 30 consecutive annual observations on all compo-
nents of xt and to belong to the group of poor and emerging countries.1 The countries that
satisfy both criteria and are therefore included in the panel are Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia,
Botswana, Brazil, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo, Costa
Rica, Cote d’Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras,
India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Pak-
istan, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa, South Korea, Sudan, Thailand,
Turkey, and Uruguay.
   The terms of trade of a given country are defined as the relative price of its exports
in terms of its imports. Letting Ptx and Ptm denote, respectively, indices of world prices of
exports and imports of the particular country in question, the terms of trade for that country
are given by
                                                Px
                                         tott ≡ tm .
                                                Pt
In constructing the terms of trade for a particular country, the WDI uses trade-weighted
export and import unit value indices.
        Our empirical measure of the real exchange rate is the bilateral U.S. dollar real exchange
rate defined as
                                                       Et PtU S
                                          RERt =                ,
                                                          Pt
where Et denotes the dollar nominal exchange rate, given by the domestic-currency price of
one U.S. dollar, PtU S denotes the U.S. consumer price index, and Pt denotes the domestic
consumer price index.2 Details of the data are provided in the appendix.

    We define the group of poor and emerging countries as all countries in the WDI database with average
PPP converted GDP per capita in U.S. dollars of 2005 over the period 1990 to 2009 below 25,000 dollars.

    An alternative measure of RERt is the real effective exchange rate, which is based on the value of a

    All variables are quadratically detrended.3 The trade balance is first divided by the trend
component of output and then quadratically detrended. The results are robust to scaling
the trade balance by output instead of the trend component of output (online appendix,
section 4).
    The empirical model takes the form

                                          A0 xt = A1 xt−1 + µt ,                                         (1)

we can write
                                           xt = A xt−1 + Πt ,                                           (2)

The vector t is a random variable with mean zero and identity variance-covariance matrix.
    The typical emerging country is a small player in the world markets for the goods it ex-
ports or imports. Therefore, we, like much of the related literature, assume that the emerging
country takes the terms of trade as exogenously given. Accordingly, we postulate that the
terms of trade follow a univariate autoregressive process. This hypothesis is supported by
the data. An F-test against the alternative that the terms of trade depend on lagged values
currency against a trade-weighted average of foreign currencies. Our results are robust to using this measure
(online appendix, section 1). We do not use it in the baseline estimation because it has a more limited time
and country coverage.

     The results are robust to HP filtering and first differencing (online appendix, sections 2 and 3).

of the trade balance, output, consumption, and investment is rejected at the five-percent
level for 32 out of the 38 countries in the sample.4 Specifically, we impose the restriction
that all elements of the first row of A1 except the first be zero. Thus the first equation of
the SVAR system (2) represents the law of motion of the terms of trade and is given by

                                        tc
                                         ott = a11tc
                                                   ott−1 + π111t ,                                      (3)

where a11 and π11 denote the elements (1,1) of A and Π, respectively. As a result, the first
element of t, denoted 1t , has the interpretation of a terms-of-trade shock, because it is the
only innovation that affects the terms of trade contemporaneously. The assumption that A0
is lower triangular is not needed for the identification of the terms-of-trade shock. All that
is required is that the elements of the first row of A0 except the first be zero. Also, because
our analysis focuses on the effects of terms-of-trade shocks, the ordering of elements 2 to 6 of
xt in the SVAR is immaterial. We estimate the matrices A0 , A1 , and Σ country by country
by OLS.
   Table 1 displays country-specific estimates of equation (3). The cross-country median of
the estimated autocorrelation coefficient, a11, is 0.52. This means that terms-of-trade shocks
vanish relatively quickly, having a half life of about one year. The median unconditional
standard deviation of the innovation to the terms of trade, π11, is 0.08. The fit of the AR(1)
process is modest, as indicated by a median R2 of 0.30. Overall, the median estimate of the
terms-of-trade process is close to that obtained by Mendoza (1995) who uses terms-of-trade
data from 1961 to 1990 for a set of 23 poor and emerging countries, which has 16 countries
in common with our 38-country panel. The cross-country estimate of the terms-of-trade
                                       c t = 0.414 tot
process reported in Mendoza (1995) is tot          c t−1 + 0.10711t .
   Figure 1 displays the response of the variables included in the vector xt to a 10 percent
improvement in the terms of trade. We choose a 10 percent improvement because it is a
round number and because it is close to the median standard deviation of the terms of trade
innovation, π11, of 8 percent. The displayed impulse responses are point-by-point medians
of the corresponding country-specific impulse responses. On impact, a ten-percent increase
in the terms of trade causes an improvement in the trade balance of half a percent of GDP.
Thus, the data lends support to the Harberger-Laursen-Metzler (HLM) effect. In fact, the
HLM effect obtains for 29 out of the 38 countries in our sample. This result concurs with
Otto (2003) who finds a positive response in the trade balance to an improvement in the
terms of trade in 36 out of a sample of 40 developing countries spanning the period 1960 to
1996.

    The countries for which the null hypothesis of a univariate specification is rejected at the five-percent
confidence level are Botswana, Malaysia, Mauritius, South Africa, Sudan, and Thailand.

   The improvement in the terms of trade causes an expansion in aggregate activity. Specifi-
cally, the 10 percent increase in the terms of trade causes an increase of 0.36 percent in GDP.
Investment displays a larger expansion, albeit with a one-year delay. Private consumption
contracts on impact and then swiftly bounces above its trend path. The ten-percent im-
provement in the terms of trade leads to a 1.6 percent real exchange rate appreciation on
impact, with a half life of about 2 years. This means that the improvement in the terms of
trade causes the country to become more expensive vis-a-vis the rest of the world.
   There is, however, substantial dispersion in the impulse response estimates both within
and across countries. Section 5 of the online appendix displays country-by-country impulse
responses with 66-percent confidence bands computed using bootstrapping methods. Al-
though, as we just discussed, on average across countries a positive terms-of-trade shock
causes an improvement in the trade balance and an expansion in output, this improvement
is statistically insignificant (as measured by the error bands including 0) in 18 countries for
the trade balance and in 24 countries for output in our panel of 38 countries. Similar results
obtain for the other variables included in the SVAR. These findings are a prelude to the main
result of this section, namely that SVAR evidence suggests that terms-of-trade shocks are
not a major source of fluctuations in emerging and poor countries during the sample period
considered.
   A common way to gauge the importance of a particular shock in driving business cycles
is to compute the fraction of the variance of indicators of interest it explains. Table 2
displays the share of the variance of the six variables in the SVAR explained by terms-of-
trade shocks. The estimates reported in the table indicate that on average terms-of-trade
shocks explain about 10 percent of the variances of output, consumption, investment, and
the trade balance, and 14 percent of the variance of the real exchange rate. There is sizable
cross-country variation with a median absolute deviation about three-fourths as high as the
median.
   A similar result obtains when the cyclical component is computed by HP filtering with
a smoothing parameter of 100 (online appendix, section 2) or by first differencing (online
appendix, section 3). Under HP filtering, the cross-country median of the variances of the
trade balance, output, consumption, investment, and the real exchange rate explained by
terms-of-trade shocks are 14, 12, 11, 12,and 13 percent, respectively. Under first differencing,
the corresponding shares are 6, 9, 9, 11, and 11 percent. Taken together, we interpret these
results as indicating that SVAR models predict a relatively minor role for terms-of-trade
shocks as a source of aggregate fluctuations in poor and emerging countries.

3     SVAR Model with Interest Rate Spreads
A number of studies have shown that world interest rates play a role in driving business cycles
in emerging economies (among others, Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Uribe and Yue, 2006;
Garcı́a-Cicco, Pancrazi, and Uribe, 2010; Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón, Rubio-Ramı́rez,
and Uribe, 2011; and Akinci, 2013). For the purpose of the present study, it is therefore of
interest to ascertain the robustness of our results to expanding the SVAR system to include
some measure of the international cost of funds. In choosing such a measure, we follow
Akinci (2013) who shows that the Baa corporate bond spread is a more relevant variable
for emerging countries than less risky global interest-rate measures such as the U.S. Federal
Funds rate. The Baa corporate spread is defined as the difference between Moody’s seasoned
Baa corporate bond yield and the federal funds rate (see the appendix for details). As before,
the SVAR system takes the form given in equation (2), where the vector xt now includes, in
addition to the six variables considered in section 2, the interest rate spread, denoted b
                                                                                         st and
expressed in deviations from trend.
    As in the related literature, we assume that the typical emerging economy takes the
terms of trade and the U.S. interest-rate spread as exogenously given. We consider two
identification schemes for the terms-of-trade shock. The first provides continuity with respect
to the identification strategy of section 2. It assumes that terms of trade shocks affect the
spread contemporaneously, but spread shocks affect the terms of trade only with a one-period
lag. Formally, the first two equations of the SVAR model are assumed to take the form
                 "          #       "             #"             #       "             #"         #
                     ct
                     tot                a11 a12        tc
                                                        ott−1                π11   0        1t
                                =                                    +                                .   (4)
                      sbt               a21 a22         sbt−1                π21 π22        2t

As in the baseline identification, this scheme implies that the innovation to the terms-of-
trade equation, 1t , is the terms of trade shock. In addition, the innovation to the spread
equation, 2t , has the interpretation of a spread shock. This ordering gives the terms of trade
the highest chance to be an important source of fluctuations in domestic variables, as it
attributes any innovation in the terms of trade to terms of trade shocks.
   We also consider the alternative specification in which the terms of trade are placed
second in the SVAR, that is,
                 "          #       "             #"             #       "             #"         #
                      sbt               a11 a12         sbt−1                π11   0        1t
                                =                                    +                                .   (5)
                     ct
                     tot                a21 a22        tcott−1               π21 π22        2t

In this case, 1t represents an interest-rate shock and 2t a terms-of-trade shock. We estimate
the SVAR system by OLS equation by equation.

    Table 3 displays cross-country medians of the estimated shares of the variances of the vari-
ables included in the SVAR explained by terms of trade shocks. The results obtained under
the baseline SVAR specification are robust to including interest-rate spreads. Independently
of whether the terms of trade are ordered first or second in the SVAR, their contribution to
explaining movements in key macroeconomic aggregates is around 10 percent. We interpret
the results presented here as further evidence that, when viewed through the lens of an SVAR
model, the contribution of terms-of-trade shocks to business-cycle fluctuations in emerging
and poor economies is modest. What do theoretical models have to say about this? This is
the subject of the following sections.


4     The Theoretical Model
The model includes three sectors, an importable sector (the m sector), an exportable sector
(the x sector), and a nontradable sector (the n sector). We refer to this framework as
the MXN model. The structure of the model is similar to Mendoza (1995), with three
generalizations. First, we assume that employment in the importable and exportable sectors
is not fixed, but can vary endogenously over the business cycle. This feature adds realism to
the model, since these sectors represent a nonnegligible source of employment fluctuations.
Second, we allow for capital accumulation in the nontraded sector. This assumption is
guided by the fact that investment in the nontraded sector displays sizable volatility over
the business cycle (McIntyre, 2003). Third, we assume that investment goods are not fully
imported and can have nontraded components. Again, this modification is introduced to
make the model more realistic, since a large fraction of investment is made up of nontraded
goods (Bems, 2008).
   The reason why we choose to study this particular model is that, to a large extend, it
has given shape to the conventional wisdom that terms of trade shocks are a major driver of
business cycles. A natural question is why bother re-computing the predictions of this model.


                                               11
Our contribution in this regard is to parameterize the model in a way that we believe gives
it a greater chance to match the data. In particular, (i) We use country specific estimates of
the exogenous driving forces; (ii) we estimate key structural parameters of the model country
by country; and (iii) we place particular emphasis on expressing variables in the same units
in the MXN and empirical models by using deflators defined in a consistent fashion.


4.1    Households
The model economy is populated by a large number of identical households with preferences
described by the utility function

                                         X

maximize their lifetime utility subject to the sequential budget constraint

wage, and the rental rate of capital in sector j, for j = m, x, n with the superscripts m, x,
and n denoting the sector producing, respectively, importable, exportable, and nontraded
goods. The functions Φj (·), j = m, x, n, introduce capital adjustment costs and are assumed
to be nonnegative and convex and to satisfy Φj (0) = Φ0j (0) = 0. The variable pτt denotes the
relative price of the tradable composite good in terms of final goods (to be formally defined
below), dt denotes the stock of debt in period t, expressed in units of the tradable composite
good, and rt denotes the interest rate on debt held from period t to t + 1. Consumption,
investment, wages, rental rates, debt, and capital adjustment costs are all expressed in units
of final goods.
    The capital stocks obey the familiar laws of motion

It is clear from these expressions that the rates of return on capital may display cyclical
differences across sectors, but are equalized in the steady state. By contrast, sectoral wage
differences may persist even in the steady state.


4.2     Firms Producing Final Goods
Final goods are produced using nontradable goods and a composite of tradable goods via the
technology B(aτt , ant ), where aτt denotes domestic absorption of the tradable composite good,
and ant denotes domestic absorption of nontraded goods. The aggregator function B(·, ·) is
assumed to be increasing, concave, and homogeneous of degree one. Final goods are sold to
households, which then allocate them to consumption or investment purposes. Producers of
final goods behave competitively. Their profits are given by

                                        B(aτt , ant ) − pτt aτt − pnt ant ,




                                                       13
where pnt denotes the relative price of nontradable goods in terms of final goods. The firm’s
profit maximization conditions are

                                       B1 (aτt , ant ) = pτt                            (18)

and

These expressions define the domestic demand functions for nontradables and for the tradable
composite good.


4.3    Firms Producing the Tradable Composite Good
The tradable composite good is produced using importable and exportable goods as inter-
mediate inputs, via the technology

                                       aτt = A(am    x
                                                t , at ).                               (20)

where am      x
       t and at denote the domestic absorptions of importable and exportable goods, re-
spectively. The aggregator function A(·, ·) is increasing, concave, and linearly homogeneous.
Profits are given by
                                pτt A(am    x      m m     x x
                                       t , at ) − pt at − pt at ,

where pm                                                                             x
       t denotes the relative price of importable goods in terms of final goods and pt
denotes the relative price of exportable goods in terms of final goods. Firms in this sector
are assumed to behave competitively in intermediate and final goods markets. Then, profit
maximization implies that
                                     pτt A1(am    x      m
                                             t , at ) = pt                              (21)

and
                                     pτt A2(am    x      x
                                             t , at ) = pt .                            (22)

These two expressions represent the domestic demand functions for importable and ex-
portable goods.

4.4    Firms Producing Importable, Exportable, and Nontradable
       Goods
Importable, exportable, and nontradable goods are produced with capital and labor via the
technologies
                                     ytm = Am F m(ktm , hm
                                                         t )                             (23)

                                       ytx = Ax F x(ktx , hxt ),                         (24)

and
                                       ytn = An F n (ktn , hnt ),                        (25)

where ytj and Aj denote, respectively, output and a productivity factor in sector j = m, x, n.
The production functions F j (·, ·), j = m, x, n, are assumed to be increasing in both ar-
guments, concave, and homogeneous of degree one. Profits of firms producing exportable,
importable, or nontraded goods are given by

                                 pjt F j (ktj , hjt ) − wtj hjt − ujt ktj ,

for j = m, x, n. Firms are assumed to behave competitively in product and factor markets.
Then, the first-order profit maximization conditions are

                                      pxt AxF1x (ktx , hxt) = uxt                        (28)

                                     pxt AxF2x(ktx , hxt ) = wtx                         (29)

                                     pnt An F1n (ktn , hnt ) = unt                       (30)

These efficiency conditions represent the sectoral demand functions for capital and labor.
Together with the assumption of linear homogeneity of the production technologies, they
imply that firms make zero profits at all times.

4.5    Competitive Equilibrium
In equilibrium the demand for final goods must equal the supply of this type of goods

    ct + i m    x    n        m      m          x      x          n      n        τ    n
           t + it + it + Φm (kt+1 − kt ) + Φx (kt+1 − kt ) + Φn (kt+1 − kt ) = B(at , at ).   (32)

Also, the demand for nontradables must equal the production of nontradables

                                                ant = ytn .                                   (33)

   Imports, denoted mt, are defined as the difference between the domestic absorption of
importables, am                           m
              t , and importable output, yt , or


                                          mt = pm   m    m
                                                t (at − yt ).                                 (34)

The price of importables appears on the right-hand side of this definition because mt is
expressed in units of final goods, whereas ytm and am
                                                    t are expressed in units of importable
goods. Similarly, exports, denoted xt, are given by the difference between exportable output,
ytx , and the domestic absorption of exportables, axt,

                                           xt = pxt (ytx − axt).                              (35)

Like imports, exports are measured in terms of final goods.
   Combining the above two definitions, the household’s budget constraint, and the defini-
tions of profits in the final- and intermediate-good markets, and taking into account that
firms make zero profits at all times, yields the following economy-wide resource constraint

                                          dt+1
                                   pτt          = pτt dt + mt − xt.                           (36)
                                         1 + rt

   To ensure a stationary equilibrium process for external debt, we follow Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2003) and assume that the country interest rate is debt elastic,

                                         rt = r∗ + st + p(dt+1 ),                             (37)

where r∗ denotes the risk-free world interest rate, st denotes the global component of the
interest-rate spread, and p(d) denotes the domestic component of the interest-rate spread.
We assume that p(d) ¯ = 0 and p0 (d)
                                  ¯ > 0, for some constant d̄.
   Given the definition of the terms of trade as the relative price of exportable goods in


                                                    16
terms of importable goods, we have that

                                                    pxt
                                           tott =       .                                   (38)
                                                    pm
                                                     t


As in the empirical analysis of section 3, we assume that the country is small in international
product and asset markets and therefore takes the evolution of the terms of trade, tott , and
the global component of the interest-rate spread, st , as exogenously given. Also in line with
the empirical analysis of section 3, we assume that tott and st follow the joint law of motion
given in equation (4), with totc t ≡ ln(tott /tot), sbt ≡ st − s, and tot and s denoting the
deterministic steady-state values of tott and st , respectively.
    As explained earlier, the real exchange rate is defined as the ratio of the foreign consumer
price index to the domestic consumer price index. Formally,

                                                    Et Pt∗
                                        RERt =             ,
                                                     Pt

where Et denotes the nominal exchange rate, defined as the domestic-currency price of
one unit of foreign currency, Pt∗ denotes the foreign price of consumption, and Pt de-
notes the domestic price of consumption. Dividing the numerator and denominator by
the domestic-currency price of the tradable composite good, denoted Ptτ , yields RERt =
(Et Pt∗ /Ptτ )/(Pt /Ptτ ). We assume that the law of one price holds for importable and ex-
portable goods and that the technology for aggregating importables and exportables into
the tradable composite good, A(·, ·), is common across countries. Then, the law of one price
must also hold for the tradable composite good, that is, Et Ptτ ∗ = Ptτ , where Ptτ ∗ denotes the
foreign price of the tradable composite good. This yields RERt = (Pt∗ /Ptτ ∗)/(Pt /Ptτ ). We
assume that the terms of trade shocks that are relevant to our small open economy do not
affect the relative price of the tradable composite good in terms of consumption goods in the
rest of the world. We therefore assume that Pt∗ /Ptτ ∗ is constant. Without loss of generality,
we normalize Pt∗ /Ptτ ∗ to unity. Finally, noting that pτt ≡ Ptτ /Pt , we have

                                          RERt = pτt ,                                      (39)

which says that the real exchange rate equals the relative price of the tradable composite
good in terms of final goods. It can be shown that there is a one-to-one negative relationship
between pτt and pnt . That is, the tradable good becomes more expensive relative to the final
consumption good if and only if the nontradable good becomes cheaper relative to the final
consumption good. This means that we can express the real exchange rate as a decreasing
function of the relative price of nontradables, RERt = γ(pnt ), γ 0 < 0.

4.6        Observables
In the present model, ct denotes consumption expressed in units of final (consumption)
goods. GDP, investment, and the trade balance expressed in units of final consumption
goods, denoted yt , it, and tbt, respectively, are given by

                                           yt = pm  m    x x     n n
                                                 t yt + pt yt + pt yt ,                                             (40)

                                                 it = im    x    n
                                                       t + it + it ,

and
                                                   tbt = xt − mt.

The data used in the empirical analysis of section 2, however, is not expressed in terms of final
consumption goods. A meaningful comparison of the model predictions with data requires
expressing theoretical and empirical variables in the same units. In the SVAR analysis of
section 2, data on GDP, consumption, investment, and the trade balance are deflated by a
Paasche GDP deflator. In this section we derive the corresponding theoretical counterparts.
In the theoretical model, GDP at current prices is given by

                                             Ptm ytm + Ptx ytx + Ptn ytn ,

where Pti denotes the nominal price of good i in period t, for i = m, x, n. The data source
(WDI) uses a Paasche index for the GDP deflator, defined as the ratio of current-price to
constant-price GDP. That is, the GDP deflator in period t is given by

                                             Ptm ytm + Ptx ytx + Ptn ytn
                                                                         ,
                                             P0m ytm + P0x ytx + P0n ytn

where t = 0 indicates the base year. Real GDP is nominal GDP divided by the GDP deflator,
that is,
                                             P0m ytm + P0x ytx + P0n ytn .

The nominal prices in the base year, P0m , P0x , and P0n , as well as all other nominal prices in
period 0 are indices without a real unit attached. Therefore, without loss of generality we


                                                           18
can set one nominal base price arbitrarily. Thus we set the nominal price of consumption in
period 0 equal to 1, P0 = 1. This means that P0i = pi0 for i = m, x, n (recall that pit is the
relative price of good i in terms of final consumption goods, for i = m, x, n). Real output in
period t is then given by
                                          pm  m    x x     n n
                                           0 yt + p0 yt + p0 yt .

Finally, we must take a stance of what the state of the economy looked like in the base
period. We assume that in the base period the economy was in the deterministic steady
state, so that pi0 = pi for i = m, x, n. Then, the theoretical counterpart of the observed
measure of real GDP, which we denote by yto , is given by5

                                    yto = pm ytm + px ytx + pn ytn .                              (41)

Similarly, the theoretical counterpart of real consumption is the ratio of nominal consump-
tion, Pt ct , to the GDP deflator, or

                                               P0m ytm + P0x ytx + P0n ytn
                                 cot ≡ Pt ct                               .
                                               Ptm ytm + Ptx ytx + Ptn ytn

Recalling that pit ≡ Pti /Pt and that P0i = pi for i = m, x, n, we can write the theoretical
counterpart of observed real consumption as

                                               pm ytm + px ytx + pn ytn
                                   cot = ct                             .
                                               pm   m    x x      n n
                                                t yt + pt yt + pt yt


The theoretical counterparts of observed real investment and the trade balance can be ob-
tained in a similar fashion, that is,

                                              pm ytm + px ytx + pn ytn
                                    iot   = it m m
                                              pt yt + pxt ytx + pnt ytn

and
                                               pm ytm + px ytx + pn ytn
                                  tbot = tbt                            .
                                               pm   m    x x      n n
                                                t yt + pt yt + pt yt

When comparing the predictions of the theoretical model to the data, we use predictions
regarding yto , cot , iot , and tbot as opposed to the corresponding measures in terms of final goods,
yt , ct , it, and tbt. This ensures congruency of the data with the model in the definition of
variables. As we will see in section 6, it makes a significant difference for the share of
variance explained by terms of trade shocks whether one uses data consistent measures of
  5
   In the SVAR, real variables are expressed in per capita terms. In the theoretical model, there is no
population growth, so real GDP and real GDP per capita are the same.

5     Calibration, Estimation, and Impulse Responses
The MXN model is medium scale in size and lies at the intersection of trade and business-
cycle analysis. The characterization of the steady state is complex–even numerically. The
calibration of the model inherits this complexity.
    Tables 4 and 5 summarize the calibration and estimation results. The time unit is
meant to be a year. We denote the steady-state value of a variable by dropping the time
subscript. The equilibrium conditions (7)-(39) evaluated at the steady state and adopting
the assumed functional forms represent a system of 33 equations in 52 unknowns, namely
the 33 endogenous variables listed in the definition of equilibrium given in section 4.5 and
19 structural parameters, namely, Am , Ax , An , δ, ωm , ωx , ωn , β, χm , µmx , χτ , µτ n , αm , αx ,
αn , r∗ + s, d̄, tot, and σ. (The structural parameters ψ, aij , πij , for i, j = 1, 2, and φj , for
j = m, x, n do not appear in the steady-state system. We will address the values assigned
to these parameters shortly.) Therefore, we must add 19 calibration restrictions (which we
enumerate in parenthesis). (1) We set σ = 2, which is a common value in business-cycle
analysis. (2)-(4) ωm = ωx = ωn = 1.455. This value implies a sectoral Frisch elasticity of
labor supply of 2.2, which is the number assumed in the one-sector model studied in Mendoza
(1991). Lacking sector-level information about this elasticity, we assume the same value in
the three sectors. (5) We assume a depreciation rate of physical capital of δ = 0.1, which is a
standard value. (6) r∗ +s = 0.11 (the split of this value between r∗ and s is immaterial). This
value is taken from Uribe and Yue (2006) and reflects the relatively high average interest rate
faced by poor and emerging countries in world financial markets. (7) µmx = 1. There is a
vast literature on estimating the elasticity of substitution between exportable and importable
goods, µmx . One branch of this literature uses aggregate data at quarterly frequency and
estimates µmx in the context of open-economy DSGE models. This body of work typically
estimates µmx to be below unity. For instance, Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc (2008), Gust,
Leduc, and Sheets (2009), and Justiniano and Preston (2010) all estimate µ to lie between
0.8 and 0.86. Miyamoto and Nguyen (2014) estimate µmx to be 0.4. A second branch of the
literature infers the value of µmx from trade liberalization episodes using average changes
in quantities and prices observed over periods of five to ten years. This approach typically
yields values of µmx greater than one, in the neighborhood of 1.5 (see, for example, Whalley,
1985). It is intuitive that studies based on low frequency data deliver values of µmx higher
than studies based on quarterly data. For it is natural to expect that agents can adjust
more fully to relative-price changes in the long run than in the short run. Because SVAR
analysis section 2 uses annual data, it is sensible to adopt a value of µmx in between those
stemming from the two aforementioned bodies of work. Accordingly, we set µmx equal to


                                                 21
1. (8) tot = 1. (9) Am = 1. (10) An = 1. (11) β = 1/(1 + r∗ + s). Restrictions (8)-(11)
are normalizations, with (11) ensuring that the steady-state level of debt coincides with the
           ¯ (12) The average of the ratio of value added exports to GDP across poor and
parameter d.
emerging countries computed using data from the OECD’s TiVA database is 20 percent.
Therefore, we impose x/(pm y m + px y x + pn y n ) = 0.2. (13) In our sample of 38 countries, the
average trade balance-to-GDP ratio is 1 percent, or (x − m)/(pm y m + px y x + pn y n ) = 0.01.
(14) Na (2015) estimates an average labor share for emerging countries of 70 percent, so we
impose (wm hm + wx hx + wn hn )/(pm y m + px y x + pn y n ) = 0.7. (15) It is generally assumed
that in emerging and poor countries the nontraded sector is more labor intensive than the
export or import producing sectors. For instance, Uribe (1997), based on Argentine data,
calculates the labor share in the nontraded sector to be 0.75. We follow this calibration and
impose the restriction wn hn /(pn y n ) = 0.75. (16) Lacking cross-country evidence on labor
shares in the import and export sectors, we assume that the importable and exportable
sectors are equally labor intensive, that is, we impose wm hm /(pm y m ) = wx hx /(px y x ). (17)
We follow the usual practice of proxying the share of nontraded output in total output by
the observed share of the service sector in GDP. Using data from UNCTAD’s Handbook of
Statistics on sectoral GDP for poor and emerging countries over the period 1995 to 2012, we
obtain an average share of services in GDP of slightly above 50 percent. Thus, we impose the
restriction pn y n /(pm y m + px y x + pn y n ) = 0.5. (18) Using data from UNCTAD, we estimate
that in emerging and poor countries the exportable and importable sectors are of about the
same size. Therefore, we impose the restriction px y x = pm y m . (19) Finally, Akinci (2011)
surveys the literature on estimates of the elasticity of substitution between tradables and
nontradables in emerging and poor countries and arrives at a value close to 0.5. Thus we set
µτ n = 0.5. This completes the calibration strategy of the 19 parameters appearing in the set
of steady-state equilibrium conditions.
    The parameters aij , πij for i, j = 1, 2, φj , for j = m, x, n, and ψ do not appear in the
steady-state equilibrium conditions but play a role in the equilibrium dynamics. We assign
values to aij and πij for i, j = 1, 2 country by country using the econometric estimates
presented section 6 of the online appendix. We use a partial information method to estimate
the capital adjustment cost parameters, φm , φx , φn , and the parameter ψ governing the
debt elasticity of the country premium. Specifically, we set these parameters to minimize a
weighted difference between the impulse responses to terms of trade and interest-rate-spread
shocks of output, consumption, investment, the trade balance, and the real exchange rate
implied by the SVAR and MXN models. We consider the first five years of each impulse
response function and use as weights the reciprocal of the width of the 66 percent confidence
interval associated with the SVAR impulse responses. Formally, letting Θ ≡ [φm φx φn ψ],

country by country.
   Table 5 displays the estimated parameters. There is substantial cross-country dispersion
in the estimated parameter values, especially for φm and ψ, which have median absolute
deviations almost as large as the estimated medians themselves. This suggests that the
strategy of estimating parameters country by country is preferred to the standard practice
of one parameterization for all countries.

impulse responses to a terms-of-trade shock in the estimated SVAR and MXN models. As a

exchange rate predicted by the MXN model are similar in magnitude and shape to those
implied by the SVAR model. However, the MXN model predicts a much larger median
response of output, consumption, and investment than observed in the data.
    To facilitate the understanding of the transmission of terms-of-trade shocks in the MXN
model, figure 3 considers the responses of the variables included in figure 2 along with other
variables that were not included in the SVAR system. The figure displays cross-country
medians of the response to a 10 percent improvement in the terms of trade implied by
the MXN model. In line with the data, the MXN model implies that an improvement in
the terms of trade appreciates the real exchange rate, that is, it makes the country more
expensive vis-à-vis the rest of the world. The explanation behind this prediction has to
do with substitution and income effects. An increase in the relative price of exportables
induces a substitution of importable and nontraded absorption for exportable absorption.
At the same time, the increase in the price of exportables produces a positive income effect
that boosts the domestic demand for all types of goods. Both effects drive up the price of
nontradables, because the expansion in the demand for this type of goods must be met by
domestic producers, who require a higher price to produce more. The top right panel of
figure 3 shows that indeed nontradables become more expensive after the positive terms-of-
trade shock. In turn, the increase in the price of nontradables translates into an increase in
the price of the final good relative to the price of the tradable composite good, that is, pτt
falls.
   The increase in the terms of trade produces an expansion in exports and imports and
an improvement in the trade balance (second row of figure 3). Imports increase because as
these goods become cheaper relative to exportable goods, consumers increase demand and
domestic producers cut back supply. The net effect on the trade balance turns out to be
positive. Thus, the MXN model is in line with the Harberger-Laursen-Metzler effect present
in the SVAR model.
    Like the SVAR model, the MXN model implies that output expands in response to an
improvement in the terms of trade (left panel on the third row of figure 3). This expansion is
the result of increased activity in the export and the nontraded sectors, which is only partially
offset by a contraction in the importable sector (row 4 of figure 3). Sectoral investment
mimics the behavior of sectoral production. The improvement in the terms of trade induces
firms to increase investment in the export and nontradable sectors and reduce investment
in the import sector (bottom row of figure 3). The reason investment in the exportable and
nontradable sectors increases is that the improvement in the terms of trade is persistent,
which induces an expected increase in the profitability of these sectors.

6     How Important Are Terms of Trade Shocks? Theo-
      retical Predictions
In this section we address the question how important are terms-of-trade shocks from the
view point of the MXN model and compare the answer to that obtained from the SVAR
model. We compute the share of the variance of output explained by terms-of-trade shocks
as the ratio of the variance of output conditional on terms-of-trade shocks implied by the
MXN model to the unconditional variance of output implied by the SVAR model of section 3.
  The first two columns of table 6 show that like the SVAR model of section 3, the MXN
model assigns a small role to terms-trade-shocks in explaining the variance of output. In
both the SVAR and MXN models, the cross-country median of the share of the variance of
output explained by terms-of-trade disturbances is less than 10 percent. This result is at
odds with the findings in the related literature that uses theoretical models similar to the
MXN model studied here, which attributes a major role to terms-of-trade disturbances as
drivers of business cycles in poor and emerging countries.
    What could account for this discrepancy? As discussed earlier, our estimate of the terms-
of-trade process is quite similar to those used in related studies, suggesting that this is not
the source of the discrepancy. The third column of table 6 suggests one possible explanation
for the discrepancy between the small role of terms of trade documented here and the large
role that is conventionally assigned to this source of uncertainty in the context of theoretical
models similar to the MXN model. As mentioned in section 4.6, the empirical measure of
output in the WDI data base is the result of deflating nominal output by a Paasche GDP
deflator. Its counterpart in the theoretical model is output measured at constant prices, yto,


                                               28
as defined in equation (41). Conventionally, however, theoretical studies measure output in
units of final goods, yt, as defined in equation (40). Table 6 shows that the importance of
terms of trade shocks is quite sensitive to the specific deflator used to define real output in
the theoretical model. When output is measured in units of final goods, the MXN model
predicts that terms of trade shocks explain on average almost 30 percent of the variance
of output, which implies a sizable role for the terms of trade as a source of business-cycle
fluctuations. However, this conclusion would be misplaced, since it is based on a number
that lacks the interpretation of a variance share. To see this, recall that the denominator of
this variance share (i.e., the unconditional variance of output implied by the SVAR model)
is computed using a measure of output deflated by a Paasche GDP deflator, whereas the
numerator is computed using a measure of output expressed in units of current final goods.
  The reason the variance of output conditional on terms-of-trade shocks is predicted to be
higher when output is measured in units of final goods than when it is deflated by a Paasche
GDP deflator is as follows. Recall that when output is deflated by the Paasche GDP deflator,
quantities are weighted by time invariant prices. By contrast, when output is measured in
units of (current) final goods, quantities are weighted by time varying prices. Depending
on the correlation structure of prices and quantities, the two measures can in principle
give rise to different results. Consider a simple example of an economy that produces only
exportable goods and consumes only importable goods. In this case, we have that ŷto = ŷtx
and ŷt = p̂xt + ŷtx, where a hat denotes log-deviation from the steady state. Then we have that
var(ŷto ) = var(ŷtx) whereas var(ŷt ) = var(p̂xt )+var(ŷtx )+2cov(p̂xt , ŷtx). The covariance between
p̂xt and ŷtx has the same sign as the covariance between the terms of trade and p̂xt , since in
this economy one can show that p̂xt depends only on and is increasing in the terms of trade.
Also, the production of exportables increases with the terms of trade. This implies that
the variance of ŷto conditional on terms-of-trade shocks is smaller than that of ŷt. In words,
since prices and quantities move in the same direction in response to terms-of-trade shocks,
the conditional variance of output is higher when the quantity of exportables is multiplied
by current prices than when it is multiplied by steady-state prices. To the extent that the
effects of terms-of-trade shocks in the MXN model are dominated by the dynamics of the
exportable sector, the intuition derived from the simple economy will carry over.


7     The Terms-of-Trade Disconnect
The first two columns of table 6 might give the impression that the SVAR and MXN models
speak with the same voice, as both predict that on average terms-of-trade shocks explain less
than 10 percent of the variance of output. This conclusion, however, would be misplaced,

because the picture that emerges from a country-by-country analysis suggests a different
interpretation.
    Figure 4 plots the share of the variance of output explained by the terms of trade according
to the empirical SVAR model of section 3 (horizontal axis) against the corresponding share
according to the MXN model (vertical axis). Each point in the figure represents one of the
38 countries in the sample. If the predictions of the theoretical model were in line with
the data, all points would lie on the 45◦ line. However, not only does the cloud of points
fail to trace out the 45◦ line, but it does not even suggest a positive relation between the
predictions of the empirical and theoretical models. The correlation between the variance
shares predicted by the SVAR and MXN models is -0.1. This result is not limited to output.
A similar lack of correlation between theory and data obtains for consumption, investment,
the trade balance, and the real exchange rate, as shown by figure 5. These findings lead
us to conclude that there is a disconnect between data and model when it comes to the
importance of terms-of-trade shocks as a source of business cycles.

8    Conclusion
In this paper, we argue that when one looks at the data through the lens of SVAR models,
terms-of-trade shocks play a modest role in generating aggregate fluctuations in emerging
and poor countries. A panel of 38 countries containing annual data from 1980 to 2011 yields
a median contribution of terms of trade to the overall variance of output of less than 10
percent.
   This result is at odds with the standard view, built on the predictions of calibrated mi-
crofounded dynamic business-cycle models, according to which terms-of-trade disturbances
explain at least 30 percent of movements in aggregate activity. We formulate a more flexible
specification of this framework and estimate key structural parameters using country-level
data. We find that when macroeconomic variables are measured in the same units in the
theoretical model as in the data on average across countries this specification predicts that
terms-of-trade shocks also explain less than 10 percent of movements in aggregate activity
which is broadly in line with the predictions of the SVAR model. However, while the impor-
tance assigned to terms-of-trade shocks by the theoretical model is on average similar to that
predicted by the empirical SVAR model, the predictions of the two models at the country


                                                                       31
level are far apart. For output, consumption, investment, the trade balance, and the real
exchange rate, there is a near-zero cross-country correlation between the share of variance
attributed to terms-of-trade shocks by the theoretical model and by the empirical model.
   The resolution of the disconnect is likely to involve a combination of better empirical
and theoretical models as means to interpret the data. For example, an improvement in
the empirical model could stem from entertaining the hypothesis that commodity prices are
a better measure of the terms of trade than aggregate indices of export and import unit
values—the measure used in the present study. At the same time, the theoretical model
could be amended by assuming that the government uses tax or commercial policy to isolate
the country from swings in world prices. In this case, movements in the terms of trade
will elicit attenuated incentives to change the domestic allocation of output and absorption.
A related reason that fluctuations in the terms of trade may have different effects across
countries could be the presence of different degrees of nominal rigidities, which may introduce
country-specific wedges between domestic and world prices.
    Finally, in the present study we produce country-specific estimates of several but not all
of the structural parameters of the theoretical model. Expanding the number of parameters
estimated at the country level may ameliorate the terms of trade disconnect. This task,
however, is not an easy one. The reason is that all of the parameters that we left out of
the country-specific estimation affect the deterministic steady state of the model. In turn,
multiple-good general-equilibrium models, like the MXN model studied in this paper, deliver
steady states that are highly non-linear making their numerical solution time consuming. At
the writing of this paper, this complication renders the application of econometric techniques
that rely on repeated solutions of the steady state of the model, such as likelihood-based or
GMM methods impractical.

Appendix: Description of Data Sources
Unless noted otherwise the data source is the World Bank’s World Development Indicators
(WDI) database. The raw data from this source consists of the following annual time series.
       Ptx
  1.   Ptm
           ,   Net barter terms of trade index (2000 = 100), TT.PRI.MRCH.XD.WD

  2. yto , GDP per capita in constant local currency units, NY.GDP.PCAP.KN.
       Pti It
  3.    y
       Pt Yt
              ,   Gross capital formation (% of GDP), NE.GDI.TOTL.ZS.
       Ptm Mt

       Ptx Xt
  5.   Pty Yt
              ,    Exports of goods and services (% of GDP), NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS.
       Ptc Ct
  6.   Pty Yt
              ,   Household final consumption expenditure, etc. (% of GDP), NE.CON.PETC.ZS.

  7. GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2005 international $), NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD.

  8. Consumer price index (2010 = 100), FP.CPI.TOTL.

  9. Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average), PA.NUS.FCRF.

 10. Real effective exchange rate index (2005 = 100), PX.REX.REER.

The criteria for a country to be included in the panel is to have at least 30 consecutive
annual observations on all components of the vector xt and to belong to the group of poor
and emerging countries. We define the group of poor and emerging countries as all countries
in the WDI database with average PPP converted GDP per capita in U.S. dollars of 2005
over the period 1990 to 2009 below 25,000 dollars. Forty two countries satisfy these criteria.
However the final sample has 38 countries as we exclude four (Gambia, Swaziland, Gabon,
and Panama) because of faulty terms-of-trade-data. We quadratically detrend each series
on the longest available sample for that series. The SVAR is then estimate using the longest
sample for all components of xt, which turns out to be 1980-2011, with three exceptions:
Algeria 1980-2009; Indonesia 1981-2011; and Madagascar 1980-2009. The terms of trade
data in WDI begin in 1980 and hence dictate the beginning of the sample.
   The WDI does not provide CPI data for Argentina. The Argentine CPI index was taken
from INDEC until 2006, and from IPC-7-Provincias from 2007 to 2011 due to systematic
underreporting by INDEC during this period.
   The data source for the corporate bond spread in the United States is Federal Reserve
Economic Data, available online at https://fred.stlouisfed.org. We use the series BAAFFM,


                                                 33
which is defined as Moody’s Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield minus the Federal Funds
Rate. The spread is monthly and covers the period July 1954 to August 2016. We drop the
years for which we do not have twelve monthly observations, which are 1954 and 2016, and
then compute the annualized (gross) spread for the years 1955-2015 as the geometric average
of the monthly spreads before detrending it.
