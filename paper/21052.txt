                                              ABSTRACT

In earlier work (Bénabou, Ticchi and Vindigni 2013) we uncovered a robust negative association between
religiosity and patents per capita, holding across countries as well as US states, with and without controls.
In this paper we turn to the individual level, examining the relationship between religiosity and a broad
set of pro- or anti-innovation attitudes in all five waves of the World Values Survey (1980 to 2005).
We thus relate eleven indicators of individual openness to innovation, broadly defined (e.g., attitudes
toward science and technology, new versus old ideas, change, risk taking, personal agency, imagination
and independence in children) to five different measures of religiosity, including beliefs and attendance.
We control for all standard socio-demographics as well as country, year and denomination fixed effects.
Across the fifty-two estimated specifications, greater religiosity is almost uniformly and very significantly
associated to less favorable views of innovation.

Nihil Sub Sole Novum. (Ecclesiastes 1:9)



1         Introduction
It would be surprising –perhaps even a miracle–if a social phenomenon as complex as
religion had unambiguous e¤ects on economic growth and welfare, rather than relating
to it through numerous channels and generating tradeo¤s.1 Two main mechanisms
have been emphasized in the economics literature, both with generally positive e¤ects:
social norms and trust on one hand, literacy and education on the other. In this and
related work we explore a novel one, namely the relationship between religiosity and
innovation –both as an individual propensity and as an aggregate outcome–and …nd it
to be robustly negative.
        Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2003), using the World Values Survey (WVS), found
more religious persons to be more trusting –of other people, public institutions, and
market outcomes– as well as more trustworthy: less willing to break the law, accept
a bribe, cheat on taxes, and the like. Theoretical models, similarly, have emphasized
how beliefs in divine rewards and punishments (or a Calvinistic desire to self-signal
one’s predestined fate) can induce individuals to behave less opportunistically and more
cooperatively, which can in turn make such beliefs self-sustaining at the social level.2
        Religiosity thus seems to be associated to what Guiso et al. describe as certain
“societal attitudes... conducive to higher productivity and growth.”3 The ultimate driver
of long-run growth, on the other hand, is technical progress and more generally the
whole spectrum of innovation: from advances in basic science to the di¤usion of new
technologies (e.g., Mokyr (2004)), economic practices and even social change, such as the
inclusion of women in production and idea-creation. It therefore seems equally important
to examine the extent to which religious beliefs, values and institutions may be conducive

    1
     In a cross-country analysis, Barro and McCleary (2003) …nd mixed results: belief in heaven and
hell has a positive e¤ect on growth, whereas religious attendance has a negative one.

     The relationship with education is much more contrasted and complex; see Section 5 for details.

or detrimental to creativity and innovation. Doing so means, in a sense, revisiting
with modern methodologies the age-old theme of religion’s often tense relationship with
science, free thought and disruptively novel ideas.



2     Religion and Innovation: Countries and U.S. States
In Bénabou, Ticchi and Vindigni (2013), we uncovered a striking fact: across countries as
well as across U.S. states, there is a signi…cant negative relationship between religiosity
and innovation, where the latter is measured by (log) patents per capita. Although
previously unnoticed in the literatures on growth/innovation and on the economics of
religion, this …nding is very robust: the results hold for alternative measures of religiosity
(the same …ve that will be used here) and persist after controlling for income per capita,
population, fraction with tertiary education, patent-rights protection, foreign investment
and (across countries) religious freedom.
    To analyze the coevolution of religious beliefs and scienti…c-economic development,
we then developed a model with the following key features: (i) the recurrent arrival of
discoveries which, if widely di¤used, generate productivity gains but sometimes erode
existing religious beliefs (a source of utility for some agents) by contradicting important
aspects of the doctrine; (ii) a government, endogenously re‡ecting the interests and
strengths of religious versus secular classes, that can allow such ideas and innovations
to spread, or act to censor them and impede their di¤usion; (iii) a Church or religious
sector that can invest in adapting the doctrine to render it more compatible with the
new knowledge.
    Three types of long-term outcomes emerge. The …rst is a “Secularization”or “Western-
European” regime, with declining religiosity, unimpeded scienti…c progress, a passive
Church and high levels of taxes and secular public spending or redistribution. The sec-
ond is a “Theocratic” regime with knowledge stagnation, extreme religiosity, a Church
that makes no e¤ort to adapt since its beliefs are protected by the state, and also high
taxes but now used to subsidize the religious sector. In-between these two is a third,


                                              2
“American”regime, which generally (not always) combines unimpeded scienti…c progress
and stable religiosity within a range where the state does not block new knowledge and
the religious sector …nds it worthwhile to invest in doctrinal adaptation. This regime
features lower taxation than the other two, together with speci…c exemptions or other
policies (e.g., laws regulating behavior) bene…ting religious activities and citizens. Ex-
amining how strategic coalitions form across both economic and religious/secular lines,
we also show that, in this “American” regime, a rise in income inequality can lead
the rich to form a “Religious-Right” alliance with the religious poor and start blocking
belief-eroding discoveries and ideas.



3         Religiosity and Openness to Innovation: People
In this paper we turn to the relationship, at the individual level, between religiosity and
a broad set of pro- or anti-innovation attitudes. Working with large-scale individual
datasets avoids some of the standard problems of cross-country regressions, and the use
of a wide spectrum of attitudinal values broadens our investigation of religiosity and
innovation beyond patent outcomes, as well as beyond the political-economy channel
emphasized in our earlier work.


3.1        Data and Key Variables

Using all available waves of the World Values Survey (1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005),
we regress eleven attitudinal measures of openness to innovation on …ve alternative
measures of religiosity, together with a large number of sociodemographic controls.4
        The measures of individual religiosity used are: identifying as a Religious Person,
Belief in God, Importance of Religion and Importance of God in your life, and …nally

    4
     Our focus is with attitudes within the general public. There is also a (highly US-centered) sociology
literature on the religious beliefs of scientists and other academics (who, as a whole, are considerably
less religious than average), including how these may or may not di¤er across disciplines, remain stable
over time, or result from self-selection versus training. Ecklund and Scheitle (2007) o¤er a good recent
survey and empirical study.


                                                    3
Church Attendance. All signs are (re)normalized so that higher values correspond to
being more religious. Individual-level controls for which we will report estimated co-
e¢ cients include Age, Gender, self-identi…ed Social Class, Education level and Income
level.5
       We also include religion-speci…c dummies at the very …ne level of detail provided by
the WVS (almost 90) but do not report them in this version, for two reasons. First, our
primary aim is to examine the e¤ects of religiosity as a general phenomenon, and only
later on detail possible di¤erences across faiths.6 Moreover, the latter step will require
aggregating the WVS’s numerous denominations of the WVS into a more manageable
10 or so major religions. Further controls in all our regressions (coe¢ cients also not
reported) include dummies for the size of the town in which the individual lives, country
dummies, and year dummies.7
       Turning now to left-hand-side variables, we use three main categories, corresponding
roughly to concentric circles around the core issue of scienti…c and technical innovation.

1. Attitudes toward science and technology. We use respondents’levels of (dis)agreement
with the following three questions:

       (i) “We depend too much on science and not enough on faith”(E220).

       (ii) “Science and technology make our way of life change too fast”(E219).

       (iii) “The world is better o¤ because of science and technology” (E234).

2. Attitudes toward new ideas, change, and risk-taking. The next …ve variables capture
a person’s more general openness or aversion to novelty and change, originating from
themselves or others.
       The …rst two focus on general novelty and personal creativity:

       (i) Judging which are better, “Ideas that stood the test of time” or “New ideas”
(E046).

   5
     For the last three we use the cardinal value of the WVS index (as in, e.g., Guiso et al. (2003)).
Including separate a dummy for each category leads to similar results.
   6
     Our results on religiosity are robust to including or dropping the denominational dummies.
   7
     The regression results including all the coe¢ cients on all (nearly 100) control variables and dummies
are not reported here due to space constraints, but are available from the authors upon request.

                                                    4
    (ii) Self-recognition in a hypothetical other described as “It is important to this
person to think up new ideas and be creative; to do things one’s own way”(A189).

    The next two questions deal with attitudes toward general change and risk-taking:

    (iii) “I worry about di¢ culties changes may cause”, versus “I welcome possibilities
that something new is beginning”(E047).

    (iv) Self-recognition in a hypothetical other described as “Adventure and taking risks
are important to this person; to have an exciting life”(A195).

    The …fth variable captures the respondent’s perceived “locus of control”:

    (v) Agreement with “Everything is determined by fate”, versus “People shape their
fate themselves”(F198).

    3. Child qualities. WVS respondents were given a list of eleven “Qualities that
children can be encouraged to learn at home,”and asked to pick the …ve they considered
“especially important”. We selected those most directly related to our inquiry, namely
Imagination (A034), Independence (A029) and Determination / Perseverance (A039).
    For convenience, all eleven attitudinal variables are (re)normalized so that higher
values correspond to being more open to science, innovation, change, imagination, etc.



4     Results

4.1    Science and Technology

For two of the three attitudinal variables examined in Table 1, all …ve measures of
religiosity are consistently associated with more negative views of scienti…c progress. As
shown in Columns 1-8, someone who identi…es as a Religious Person, or who reports a
greater Importance of Religion, Importance of God or Church Attendance, is signi…cantly
more likely (p < 1%) to think that “we depend too much on science and not enough on
faith” and that they “make life change too fast”. For the third question –whether the
“world is better o¤ because of science and technology”–on the other hand, the estimated

see Columns 9-12.
       Among the main controls, having higher Income, a lower Age and being Male always
have the expected “pro-science”sign, with high signi…cance. So does Education in seven
out of the twelve columns, but in one it has the opposite sign and in four others it is
not signi…cant. Social Class has an inconsistent sign and is often not signi…cant.


4.2       New Ideas, Change and Risk-Taking

We turn in Tables 2a-2b to …ve more general indicators of openness to new ideas, change,
risk-taking and agency. Of the …ve pro-novelty attitudes, four have a consistently neg-
ative and almost always highly signi…cant relationships to each of the …ve indicators
of religiosity. Such is the case for “New Ideas Better than Old Ones”, “Importance of
Risk Taking”, belief that “People Shape their Own Fate” and “Welcoming vs. Worrying
about Change”. The one exception is self-identi…cation with a person described as at-
taching high importance to “Having New ideas and Being Creative”, for which religiosity
measures have a positive and signi…cant e¤ect.
       While it should certainly be kept in mind as a caveat to the other results, this is
in fact the only one among the eleven “innovation-friendliness” variables analyzed in
the paper for which the negative relationship with religiosity reverses, thus representing
somewhat of a puzzle.8
       Throughout Tables 2a-2b, Income, Education and Social Class always have the pre-
dicted signs and high signi…cance. Similarly, Female is always associated with a lower
taste for risk (in line with the experimental literature) and novelty-seeking. Note, …nally,
that the last …ve columns of Table 2b use the same variable (Welcome Change) as the
preceding …ve, but with a more restricted set of control variables, for which we are able

   8
    One also notes that: (i) the raw correlations of E047 with religiosity indicators are signi…cantly
negative; (ii) Unlike the other ten attitudinal questions, its distribution is highly skewed: 75% of people
respond “very much like” to “somewhat like”, far fewer “a little like”, and almost none “not like/not
at all like”. Whether this variable’s extreme skewness bears some relationship to the atypical results
obtained with it, or whether the reason lies elsewhere, will be worth examining further.

4.3        Shaping The Minds of Children

We turn now to the traits and qualities which adults think are most important to im-
part to children. As emphasized in the theoretical and empirical literatures, the most
important channel of persistence in cultural beliefs, values and attitudes, is parental
transmission –whether directly at home or indirectly through the choices of school (e.g.,
secular vs. religious) and extracurricular activities, available sources of information
(books, media) and residential location determining the set of local role models and
peers.
        The results, across all …fteen speci…cations in Table 3, are very clear-cut: all …ve
measures of religiosity are negatively and signi…cantly associated (p < 1%) with the
importance attached to children having Imagination, Independence, and Determina-
tion/Perseverance. Among the main controls, Age, Education and Income have the ex-
pected positive and signi…cant coe¢ cients; social class has mostly positive coe¢ cients,
but they are often not signi…cant. Women appear to value a child’s independence more
than males, but their imagination and determination/perseverance less.

    Tolerance and Creativity. Acceptance of new ideas, change, risk, imagination or per-
sonal independence is arguably related to the tolerance of di¤erences, be they in beliefs,
cultural practices, or lifestyles. Florida (2005) argues for a link between “social diver-
sity”and innovation, showing that, in the contemporary U.S., the share of coupled gay
households in a city’s or region’s population is a strong predictor of the local concentra-
tion of high-tech industries, relative to the national average.9 At a …ner level of detail,

    On the theory side, Corneo and Jeanne (2009) model the equilibrium degree of tolerance in society,
while Esteban, Levy and Mayoral (2014) study the economic consequences of religious restrictions
imposed on everyone’s consumption choices.

they also …nd that religious individuals are less risk-tolerant than atheists, and Muslims
less than Christians.
  Risk-Aversion. A willingness to take risks is clearly important to undertake invest-
ments, both individual and collective, especially in new technologies and social arrange-
ments. Using panel data on immigrants to Germany, Bartke and Schwarze (2008) …nd
religiousness to be a signi…cant predictor of risk aversion, whereas nationality of origin
is insigni…cant. At a …ner level of detail, they also …nd that religious individuals are less
risk-tolerant than atheists, and Muslims less than Christians.
  Views and knowledge of science and technology. Gaskell et al. (2005) analyzed surveys
conducted in the United States, Canada, and Europe about what rules should govern
science and technology. Religious beliefs were found to be signi…cantly related to think-
ing that decisions should be: (i) based on the views of the public, rather than left to
the experts; (ii) based on moral and ethical issues, rather than on scienti…c evidence of
risk and bene…t. Focusing on views about nanotechnology, Brossard et al. (2009) found
religiosity (“how much guidance religion plays in your everyday life”) to be negatively
related with support for funding of these technologies. In the 2006 General Social Sur-
vey, respondents were given a 13-item test of basic scienti…c knowledge and reasoning.
Controlling for demographics, education, income, region, and rural residence, Sherkat
(2011) found greater religiosity to be clearly associated with lower scienti…c literacy.10
  Human capital. Across people as well as places, the strength of religious belief is
strongly negatively correlated with education (especially for “literalist” beliefs in mira-
cles, the devil, or the inerrancy of the Bible; e.g., Glaeser and Sacerdote (2009), Sherkat
(2011)). Religious attendance, on the other hand, is shown by Glaeser and Sacerdote
to be positively correlated with education (except in former communist countries), par-
ticularly in the U.S.11 All our regressions control for education, and using attendance
always leads to the same results as the four other, belief-based, measures of religiosity.

  10
     In experiments, Gervais and Norenzayan (2012) and Shenhav, Rand and Greene (2011) show that
priming analytical thinking reduces feelings of religiosity and belief in God.
  11
     Rather than a speci…cally religious phenomenon, this is seen as re‡ecting the general impact of
education on “sociability”, as also measured by most forms of secular social capital.

                                                 12
    Historically, religion often played an important role in the spread of general literacy
and education (see, e.g., Becker and Woessmann (2009) for Protestantism and Botticini
et al. (2012) for Judaism), though this is no longer true after the mid-19th century.
Since more educated individuals generally tend, as we showed earlier, to be more open
to new ideas, change, risk, etc, this might be seen as an o¤setting factor to the direct
negative relationship between religiosity and innovativeness –albeit a self-limiting one,
since religiosity itself declines with education.
    One should also keep in mind that education and openness to novelty do not always
go hand in hand, particularly where ideology or doctrine intervenes. For instance, be-
tween the 16th and 19th centuries the Jesuits were one of the main forces behind the
spread of schools and education through Catholic Europe, but also among the most vig-
orous opponents of many of the new theories, empirical …ndings and even mathematical
methods of the Scienti…c Revolution and Enlightenment which they perceived as incom-
patible with Church doctrine (e.g., Alexander 2014). In a number of Islamic countries
education in madrasas still consists largely of rote memorization, and even universities
are often high constrained in what can or cannot be taught, or debated.



6     Conclusion
Using all …ve waves of the World Values Survey, we examined the relationships between
eleven indicators of openness to innovation, broadly de…ned (e.g., attitudes toward sci-
ence and technology, new versus old ideas, general change, personal risk taking and
agency, imagination and independence in children) and …ve measures of religiosity, in-
volving both beliefs and attendance. Across the …fty-two regression speci…cations (with
controls for sociodemographics, country and year), greater religiosity was almost uni-
formly and very signi…cantly associated to less favorable views of innovation. In follow-up
work, we plan to examine di¤erences in these attitudes across denominations. Mecha-
nisms of causality and/or self-selection remain of course very much open issues at this
stage, and deserving of further investigation.
