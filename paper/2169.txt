       Permanent and Transitory Components in Macroeconomic Fluctuations




                                   ABSTRACT




      Fluctuations in real GNP have traditionally been viewed as transitory

 deviations from a deterministic time trend. The purpose of this paper -is to

 review some of the recent developments that have led to a new view of output

 fluctuations and then to provide some additional evidence. Using post-war

 quarterly data, it is hard to reject the view that real GNP is as persistent

 as a random walk with drift.

      We also consider the hypothesis that the recent finding of persistence

 are due to the failure to distinguish the business cycle from other

 fluctuations in real GNP. We use the measured unemployment rate to decompose

 output fluctuations. We find no evidence for the view that business cycle

 fluctuations are more quickly trend-reverting.

      Permanent and Transitory Components in Macroeconomic Fluctuations

                    John V. Campbell and N. Gregory Mankiw*


      A "stylized fact" is sometimes defined as an empirical claim that is

widely believed but the evidence for which is only mixed.     Seen in this

light, it is perhaps not surprising that one of the principal stylized

facts of macroeconomics has undergone a substantial reexamination over the

past five years. The purpose of this paper is to review some of the

recent developments that have led to the new view of output fluctuations

and then to provide some additional evidence.

      According to the traditional view, fluctuations -in real GNP primarily

reflect temporary deviations of production from trend. Only a few years ago,

economists as diverse as Olivier Blanchard (1981) and Finn Kydland and

Edward Prescott (1980) subscribed to the then uncontroversial suggestion

that the logarithm of quarterly real GNP is well represented as a stationary

second—order autoregressive process around a deterministic time trend.

Blanchard estimated the following process for detrended log real GNP:


(1)           =   1.34   'ti — 0.42   't-2 +


This AR(2) process implies that the effect of a shock to output increases for
a few quarters, but the effect dies out soon thereafter. Only 8 percent of a

shock to output remains after 20 quarters.1 These authors, along with many

others, viewed this dynamic response of output to an innovation as an

important phenomenon to be explained by macroeconomic theory.

      The reexamination of this traditional view was motivated in part by
                                     —2—

developments in the econometrics of non-stationary time series (e.g., David

Dickey and Wayne Fuller, 1981). In one of the first applications of the new

econometric techniques to standard macroeconomic data, Charles Nelson and

Charles Plosser (1982) argued that most of these time series, including real

GNP, are not stationary around a deterministic trend. Instead, these series

should be considered stationary only after differencing. Nelson and Plosser

suggested that the data for output are well approximated by simple stochastic

processes that imply no trend reversion at all.

     Much disagreement remains over exactly how persistent are shocks to

output. Nonetheless, among investigators using post-war quarterly data, there

is almost unanimity that there is a substantial permanent effect. In a

previous paper (1986), we estimated unconstrained ARMA models for GNP growth.

We found that a negative one percent innovation lowers the level of GNP by

over one percent over any foreseeable horizon. Moreover, when the

non-parametric procedure suggested by John Cochrane (1986) is applied to this

data, the same finding is obtained. Authors using unobserved components

models (Mark Watson, 1986; Peter Clark, 1987) have typically found less

persistence. Even so, the long-run impact of a shock to GNP is usually

estimated to be about 0.6. Hence, almost all recent studies have rejected the

traditional view that output shocks have little or no permanent effect.


I. Two Concepts of Persistence

    What is persistence? For some purposes, a shock to an economy may be

considered persistent if it lasts for more than one period. Here, however, we

take persistence as meaning "continuing for a long time into the future."

More formally, suppose that the change in log of GNP is a stationary process

with moving average representation
                                             —3—

(2)             t =   A(L)   £
where A(L) is an infinite polynomial in the lag operator, and              is white

noise. The impact of a shock in period t on the growth rate in period t+k is

Ak. The impact of the shock on the level of GNP in period t+k is therefore

A0+A1+. .   .+A.    The ultimate impact of the shock on the level of GNP equals the

infinite sum of these moving average coefficients, which is A(1). The value

of A(1) is the measure of persistence we used in our previous paper. For a

random walk, A(1) equals one; for any series stationary around a deterministic

trend, A(1) equals zero.

      Cochrane has recently proposed another measure of persistence.            His

measure can be written either as a ratio of variances or as a function of

autocorrelat ions:


(3)         1    Var(Y+k+l_Y)        1 + 2    E (i -
        k+1                                  j=1
                   Var(V1_Y)
where p is the j—th autocorrelation of                 If   follows   a random walk, then

the variance of the (k+1)-lagged difference is (k+1) times the variance of the

once-lagged difference. Hence, for a random walk, the above ratio is one. For

any stationary series, the variance of the (k+1)-lagged difference approaches

twice the variance of the series. Hence, for any stationary series, the above

ratio approaches zero for large k. Cochrane therefore proposes using the limit

of the variance ratio as a measure of persistence. We call this limiting

variance ratio V.

      For two simple cases--a stationary process and a random walk--the two

measures of persistence produce the same number. More generally, however, the

two measures are not the same. Define R2           1 -   Var(c)/Var(M),   the fraction
                                      —4—

of the variance that is predictable from knowledge of the past history of the

process. Then A(1) can be expressed as


(4)        A(1)      _____


Equation (4) shows that the square root of Cochrane's measure of persistence
is a lower bound on A(1). The more highly predictable is the differenced

process, the greater is the disparity between the two measures.


II. Approaches to Estimating Persistence

      At least three general approaches have been proposed for estimating

persistence. Here we provide a brief overview.

      A. The ARMA Approach

      In our previous paper (1986), we modeled the change in log GNP as a

stationary ARMA process. That is,


(5)        4(L) t = 0(L) e,

where q(L) and 0(L) are finite polynomials in the lag operator. The moving

average representation A(L) equals q,(L)O(L), from which we computed the

persistence measure A(1).

      If     is in fact stationary around a deterministic trend, then the ARMA

model in equation (5) is overdifferenced. This overdifferencing induces a

unit root in the moving average component 0(L). For the ARMA approach to be

able to detect stationarity, it is therefore necessary to allow for the

possibility of a unit MA root by including at least one moving average

parameter. Long autoregressions do not provide an adequate approximation in
                                       —5-

this case. Moreover, it is important to avoid estimation of the ARMA model

via quasi-maximum likelihood techniques, since these may not provide good

approximations when there is a unit MA root.    In our previous paper, we

estimated all models up to ARMA(3,3) using exact maximum likelihood.

       We concluded that an ARMA(2,2) model well approximates post-war,

quarterly, real GNP growth. The ARMA(2,2) model and most of the other models

produce similar impulse response functions, A(L). After a unit shock, the

maximum impact on the level of real GNP is about 1.6 after a few quarters,

followed by a slight (and perhaps insignificant) decline. The long-run impact

A(1) was estimated to be about 1.5.

       B. The Nonparametric Approach

       One can estimate the persistence measure V very simply by replacing

the population autocorrelations in equation (3) with the sample

autocorrelat-ions.2 The estimator is


(6)        k E     1 +   2E   (i -


As long as k increases with the sample size, this estimator consistently

estimates V.

       It is also possible to compute nonparametrically an approximate estimate

of A(1), called Ak(l), as



(7)        k(1)          ______


The estimate of A(1) is computed by replacing the R2 in equation (4)

with the square of the first autocorrelation. Since p is an underestimate of

      except for an AR(1) process, this estimate tends to understate A(1).
                                    -6--


     In any given sample, it is of course necessary to choose k, the number

of autocorrelations to include. Including too few autocorrelations may

obscure trend reversion manifested in higher autocorrelations. Including

too many autocorrelations may tend to find excessive trend reversion, since

as k approaches the sample size 1, the estimator approaches zero. Since the

sample mean has been removed from the data, vk is identically zero at

k=T-1. Hence, while large k appears preferable, k must be small relative to

the sample size.

     To examine more precisely the choice of window size (k), we have

performed a small Monte Carlo experiment. The true process is, alternatively,

a random walk with drift or a stationary AR(2) process around a deterministic

time trend. The parameters for the AR(2) process are those estimated by

Blanchard for detrended real GNP (equation 1). There are 500 replications,

and each has 130 observations, which is the number of post-war quarterly

observations we use below. Table 1 reports the mean of the two persistence

estimates for various k, as well as the standard deviation of the estimates.

     The results in Table 1 show clearly that the window size k must be small

relative to the sample size. For k = 50, the mean estimate of V for the

random walk is 0.59, in contrast to a population parameter of unity. There is

thus severe downward bias for large k.3

     The results in Table 1 also show how difficult it is to distinguish

between the two representations on the basis of these nonparametric

persistence estimates. For k = 40, the mean estimate of V is 0.67 for a

random walk and 0.43 for the stationary AR(2). Moreover, the associated

standard deviations are substantial. One cannot make inferences from these

persistence estimates with great confidence.
                                     —7—


     In Table 2 we report vk and Ak(l) for the log of quarterly real GNP from


1952:2 to 1984:3 for various values of k. The results are consistent with

those obtained with the ARMA approach. A comparison of the estimates in Table

2 with the Monte Carlo results in Table 1 shows that real GNP appears more

persistent than the stationary AR(2) process in equation (1). For k=40, the

estimate of V is 0.85, which is about two standard deviations above the 0.43

mean of the AR(2) process. Similarly, the estimate of A(1) of 0.98 is about

one standard deviation above the 0.69 mean of the AR(2). Indeed, the

estimates for real GNP slightly exceed the mean persistence estimates for a

random walk.

     C. The Unobserved Components Approach

     An alternative way to model output is as the sum of two or more

components. These components are not directly observed, but their relative

importance, and the implications for persistence, are inferred from the time

series behavior for output. Authors such as Beveridge and Nelson (1981),

Watson, and Clark have used this approach.

     Obviously some restrictions must be imposed on the components if they are

to be identifiable from a single time series for output. Beveridge and Nelson

proposed a decomposition into two components, a random walk and a stationary

component, whose innovations are perfectly correlated. For any output

process, these components are just identified.

     The two measures of persistence can be interpreted in terms of the

Beveridge-Nelson decomposition. Cochrane points out that the measure V is

the variance of the change in the random walk component divided by the

variance of the total change in output. It follows from equation (4) that the
                                           —8-

measure A(1) is the standard deviation of the change in the random walk com-

ponent divided by the standard deviation of the univariate innovation to out—

put.    It is tempting to conclude that V and A(1) convey information about the

relative importance of "trend" and "cycle" components in output growth. But

of course, one usually thinks of trend and cycle as having a low or zero

correlation, while the Beveridge-Nelson components are perfectly correlated.

       An alternative type of unobserved components model, estimated by Watson

and Clark, expresses output as the sum of two independent processes. The

independence of the two components implies that the measure V can be

written as a weighted average of the equivalent measures for the two

components. Formally, if V1 and V2 are the persistence of components 1 and 2,

and the changes in these components have variances          and a, then


(8)         V =   A V1 +   (1-A)   V2

where A =
             a/(a +a)      = cr/Var(hY).

       Watson and Clark assume that the first component is a random walk and the

second component -is    a stationary    AR(2), so that V1=1 and V2=O. Since the sum

of a random walk and an AR(2) process can be represented as an ARMA(2,2)

process in the growth rates, the Watson-Clark model can be viewed as imposing

restrictions on this ARMA model. As in the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition, V

equals the share of the random walk in output variability. Note, however, that

V and A(1) must now be no greater than unity to be consistent with the model.

Watson and Clark thus rule out highly persistent processes a priori.

       Watson and Clark estimate the parameters of the unobserved components

model via maximum likelihood and then infer V and A(1). Watson, for example,
                                     —9--


finds that V=O.36 and A(1)=O.57, suggesting that both the permanent and

transitory components of GNP are important. Clark's results are comparable.


III. Using the Unemployment Rate to Measure the Business Cycle

     The unobserved components models, in contrast to the unrestricted

ARMA models or the non-parametric approach, suggest that there is a

substantial temporary component to real GNP. The results with these models,

therefore, are easier to reconcile with standard theories of the business

cycle. One is tempted to interpret the permanent component as the natural

rate of output, and the temporary component as the deviation of output from

the natural rate. Indeed, the appeal of the restrictions imposed by Watson

and Clark comes largely from the long tradition of separating issues of

long-run growth from issues of short-run fluctuations.

     The purpose of this section is to examine whether one can decompose

output fluctuations into a transitory component associated with the business

cycle and a persistent component unrelated to the business cycle. The

decompositions of Watson and Clark are completely univariate. In contrast, we

use the unemployment rate as a measure of the business cycle.4

     We begin by examining the persistence of fluctuations in the rate of

unemployment. Table 3 presents estimates of V and A(1) computed as in

equations (6) and (7) using quarterly data from 1952:2 to 1984:3. The results

for V indicate that shocks to unemployment are no more persistent than the

AR(2) process simulated in Table 1. Yet since p1 is much larger for

unemployment, the estimates of A(1) are larger.

     We next use the unemployment rate to separate the cyclical and trend

components of real GNP. As in the unobserved components models discussed
                                     -10--


above, we make the identifying assumption that these two components are

uncorrelated. In contrast to these models, we do not assume the two

components are unobserved. Instead, we assume that the cyclical component is

that part of GNP correlated with unemployment at leads and lags, while the

trend component is that part of GNP uncorrelated with unemployment. Hence,

one might refer to our decomposition as an "observed components model."

     We accomplish this decomposition by regressing the change in log real

GNP on eight leads, eight lags, and the contemporaneous detrended unemployment

rate. This regression yields an R2 of about 0.6. We take the fitted value of

this regression as a measure of the change in the cyclical component of real

GNP. The residual is a measure of the change in the trend component.

     Table 4 presents estimates of the persistence of the cyclical and trend

components of real GNP. The persistence of the two components of GNP appears

roughly equal. Indeed, to the extent that the two components differ, the

cyclical component of GNP appears somewhat more persistent.

     These results call into question the identifying assumptions underlying

unobserved components models. These models are based on the premise that

fluctuations in output associated with the business cycle are less persistent

than other fluctuations in output. Yet when the unemployment rate is used as

a measure of the business cycle, it is hard to find a significant difference

in the persistence of these two components.

     If one imposes some restrictions on the regression decomposing GNP

growth, it is possible to find some evidence for the view that the cyclical

component is less persistent than the trend component. In particular,

including fewer leads and lags of the unemployment rate, or including the
                                     —11—

unemployment rate only in differenced form, tends to make the fitted value

of the regression somewhat less persistent. In these cases, the estimated V

for large k is smaller for the cyclical component, while the estimated A(1)

remains larger for this component. If there were reason to believe these

constraints a priori, then the sort of decomposition suggested here might be

interpreted as providing weak evidence for the use of unobserved components

models.


IV Conclusions

     Not very long ago, it was widely believed that shocks to output

almost fufly dissipate in four or five years. The research summarized here

has challenged that stylized fact. Fluctuations in output appear far more

persistent. Indeed, it hard to reject the view that post-war real GNP is

as persistent as a random walk with drift.

     Of course, in any finite set of data, it is impossible to reject the

view that output eventually returns to a deterministic time trend. The

sort of evidence presented here can only demonstrate that such trend reversion

does not occur as quickly as was once believed.

     Some economists have dismissed the recent findings of persistence in real

GNP because these findings do not distinguish the business cycle from other

fluctuations. We have attempted to make such a distinction by using the

unemployment rate as a measure of the business cycle. In contrast to what

many economists have assumed, fluctuations associated with the business cycle

are not obviously more trend-reverting than other fluctuations in output.

1.   This dynamic pattern also revealed itself in explanations of the

business cycle. Barro and Rush (1980), for example, estimated that

unanticipated money has its greatest effect with a lag of three quarters,

but has no effect after ten quarters.

2.   We compute the j-th sample autocovariance as the sum of the T-j cross

products divided by T-j. This computation does not guarantee that the

estimate of the variance ratio is positive, however. Dividing the T-j

cross-products by T would guarantee a positive estimate. In practice, as long

as k is small relative to the sample size, the difference is not important.

3.   It appears that, for the random walk, this bias can be approximately

corrected by multiplying by T/(T-k).

4.   George Evans (1986) also studies persistence in a bivariate model of

output and unemployment. His use of restricted and unrestricted vector

autoregressions is very different from the approach taken here.
