                 DARBY,   M. R. --The Consumer Expenditure Function

        A consumer expenditure function which integrates pure consumption and
    household investment in durable goods is formulated and estimated. Because

    of reduced reliance on the official classification of conmiodities as durable

    or nondurable, a considerable increase in ability to explain consumer expen-

    ditures results as compared to multiequation models. Further empirical in-

    vestigation provides strong evidence that:          (1) private sector income is

    significantly better than disposable personal income for explaining consumer

    expenditures,   (2) the    definition     of money is similarly superior   to both
       and    definitions, and   (3)   the   weight   of current income in permanent   in-

    come is about 10% per annum. Data appendix included.

                        THE CONSUMER EXPENDITURE FUNCTION

                     National Bureau of Economic Research


                            I.    Introduction and Summary
      The functional     relationship of aggregate consumer expenditures to in-

come and    other   variables is one of the central elements of macroeconomic

dynamics. Yet       some time back in the 1950's, consumption theorists seem

to   have lost interest in this relation and began to concentrate on models
of the pure consumption of service flows. This is not surprising perhaps,
as explanations of pure consumption could be fairly directly derived from
interteinporal choice theory and are sufficient to explain the broad move-
ments of consumer expenditures.' But most cyclical variation in consumer
expenditures    would appear to arise in       the adjustments of the stocks of con—
umer durable and semidurable goods and not in fluctuations in the growth
of pure consumption. So macroeconomists should be concerned with a con-
sumer expenditure      function integrating the asset adjustment function and

the pure    consumption function.

       The usual approach of those few         economists   who have concerned them—

selves with these distinctions has been           to formulate a model in which in-
vestment    in consumers' durable goods is estimated in a separate equation

or equations from the determination of pure consumption. Empirically con—

suniption   is estimated   as    consumer expenditures less consumer expenditures
on durables plus the estimated rental value of the stock of durable goods.
                                 —2—

Such an approach depends critically upon the completeness of the empirical

definition of consumer expenditures for durable goods. To the extent that

coods which are behaviorally durable are in fact classified as nondurable,

the model will be miaspecified and omit a portion of the cyclical varia-

tion in consumer expenditures. In my restatement of the permanent income

theory (1974), it was shown that on the order of half of the behaviorally

defined durable goods are classified in the official data as nondurable

goods and services.2 So the standard approach indeed suffers from speci-

fication biases.

     The most obvious approach is to correct the definition of durable

goods so that the two or more equation approach can be directly applied.

As a practical matter such a correction is impossible because of both a

lack of finely disaggregated data and the generality of durability in a

behavioral sense. To take a simple example related to the concept of

human capital, surely a vacation is a durable good yielding benefits for

nany years in the form both of memories and of inflicting slide shows on

relatives. A more promising approach followed in this paper is to formu-

late a model in which the role of specification bias Is minimized. As it

happens, an integrated consumer expenditure function not only serves this

role but also refocuses attention on the basic macroeconomic concept.

     The integrated consumer expenditure function is derived in Section II

by inverting the standard theoretieal definition of pure consumption so

that consumer expenditures are defined in terms of pure consumption, house—

hold net Investment In durable goods, and the yield on the stock of dur-

able goods existing at the beginning of the period. This definition is

converted into a consumer expenditure function by substitutions based upon

the permanent income theory of pure consumption and a generalized stock
                                            —3—

adjustment model of household durables investment.             Consumer expenditures

are determined primarily by permanent income, transitory income. t.e '.i

money stock, and         the   stock of consumers' durable goods with the 1on-ter'

interest rate and relative price of durables playing minor roles because

of their effect on stock demands. The             model provides expected SignS for

i.iost   of these variables and explicates the -relationships amonr. their co-
efficients.
         Section   III   applies the model to postwar U.S. data with rer.arkably
favorable results. The estimated coefficients do not differ significantly

from expectations and are consistent with the secular relation of consump-

tion to saving. The            most   surprising finding is that the   marginal pronen

 sity     to spend (excess) real money balances is somewhat larger than the
rar-'inal propensity to spend current income for a one—year              period. The

 theoretica]- model is shown to hold up well when disaggregated by use of
 estimated      pure consumption and household durables investment.         The exnlana—

 tory     power of the integrated model is considerably better than one based

 on separate consumption and household durab].es investment equations.

          In   section IV, the     consumer expenditure function is used to investi—

  'ate three outstanding empirical questions: (1) Is disposable personal

  income or Drivate sector income better at explaininc' consumer expenditures?

  (2)    Thich of   the money definitions——fl1, N2, or N3——is best at explaining

  consumer      expenditures? (3) what is the weight F        of current income in the

  formation      of permanent income? These questions        were studied siwultaneously

  by     maximum likelihood estimation for each combination of income and money
  (lefinitions for both quarterly and annual data. The data provided             the

   followinc     answers: The private sector income and            (currency plus demand
   deposits) money definitions do s1nificantly better than the alternative
                                                                                     4   r


                                     —4—


definitions. The likelihood function is rather flat for values of the          t
veiiit between   0 and 20 per annum but falls sharply for higher values of

   so the     weight of lW per annum previously estimated for a r'ure con-

sumption model is retained.

     Concluding remarks and suggestions for future research are contained

in Section V. The Data Appendix makes available to other researchers a

considerable investment in constructing private sector income, permanent

income, and   the stock of household durable goods from the national income
accounts as   well   as   monthly   data   on the   Federal Reserve definition for
1947 through 1958.

                               II.    The Theoretical Model


       This section presents an elaboration of the integrated vodel. cf cc-

sumer expenditures presented in Darby (1975). First a general franework

is derived suitable for integrating all three—equation models of pure

consumption c, household investraent in durable goods           and the (end—

of—period) stock of consumers' durable goods cit. A specific——but enpiri—

cally quite general——model is then substituted into this frarteworktO ob-

tain the basic equation used in the empirical investirations.

       The real stock dt of consumers goods ("the durables stock") at the end

of period •t Is computed by applying a depreciation rate of 6 par period:


(1)            d - (1      - 0.5     6)      + (1 - 6)


where the coefficient of durable goods expenditures c adjusts for intra—

period depreciation on gross investment.3 It follows directly that the

net investment In durables                 is



 (2)
                     — (1 —    0.5 6) d —        6d1
The usual definition of pure consumption c is total consumer expenditures

 less the net investment In durables plus an imputed yield at the rate r

 per period on the average durables stock for the period:


                c —        —         +    r 0.5 Cdt   +
 (3)                                                      d1)
                       x
                 f
                c c —          (1 —0.5r)        dt + rdj

 Solving forc shows that consumer expenditures equal pure consumption plus

 net durables investment (adjusted for intraperiod yield4) less the yield

 on the beginning durables stock:
                    =c     ÷ (1 — C.5r)       —
                                                  rdi.
       nuation     (4) j   converted    from an identity to a theory by sustitu—
tin'   behavioral functions in the right hand side. Since the real value
st—i of the durahies stock at the beginning of period t            is   predeteniined
by past changes in the       stock,    functions must be specified only f or nure

consumption    c and household investment in durable goods Ad.
        ror aggregate time—series data, the strict permanent income hypothe-
sis    has great   theoretical   and empirical appeal as an      explanation of pure
consumption:

(5)                c =   kv.
Pure consumption is assumed to be a constant fraction k of permanent in-

come y. The use of permanent income is preferred to the life—cycle

apnroach for two reasons:         (1)   Permanent   income apnears a more accurate

method for estimating aggreate wealth (inclusive of human carital) in

time series anplications.5 (2) This specification allows further empiri-

cal study of the reformulated permanent income theory presented in flarby

 (l74). Hiiether the life—cycle approach might in Fact produce superior

 et'irical results is an open issue for future research.

        The change in the stock of durable goods is         of   the nature of a port—

 c1io adjustment problem. Households will increase their holdis's of dur—

 able goods in response to the increase in total assets from normal saving,

 in order to make up part of          any remaining discrepancy between the desired

 mid beginning stocks, in response to unexpected saving due to windfalls

 (transitory income              and as a temporary response to disproportionately

 large money balances:

The    nodel   captures the main elements that are generally sunposed to affect

hriges     in   the stock of durable 'oods.6

       The   uodel   is completed by specifvin? the long—run durables stock de—

mand   d, the planned change in durable goods (Ad)e,                            and   real money demand
m. Durables stock demand is assumed to be a linear function of permanent
income, the      relative price of durable goods FDt,                      and the long—term interest
ratei:                                                          •Dt

The planned change in durable goods through normal                          saving is    approximately

pronortional to permanent income:

expenditure function. Alternative routes could be used to derive the

same equation with somewhat different interpretations placed on the co-

efficients, but the current approach seems the most atractive to this

       i3asic estimates of the model and a comparison with the multiequa—

tiort approach are presented in this section. Discussion of some impor-

tant empirical issues with respect to the computation of permanent income

and the definitions of income and money is postponçd for fuller considera-

tion in Section IV.


Data Definitions8

       A major empirical finding of this paper is that data definitions of

durable goods, income, and money make a real difference in the ability to

explain consumer behavior. So it is necessary to devote particular atten-

tion to the precise definitions of date sources used. Some important data

series have been copstructed and are made available in the Data Appendix

for use by others.

       Four basic series are available directly:



c        Personal consumption exnenditures in constant (1958) dollars

         (quarterly data at seasonally adjusted qarter.1. rates (SAQR)).


c        Personal consumption expenditures for durable goods in constant

         (1958) dollars (quarterly data at SAQR).


         Money   supply N1    (average of monthly data) deflated by the implicit

         price   deflator    for personal consumption expenditures.

        Yield on long—term U.S. government bonds (average of monthly data).


       The stock of durable goods at the end of the quarter t is computed

according to equation (1) for 6 =         0.05,   so9


(12)             d = 0.975 c + 0.95 di.
                                     — 11 —


Annual regressions use the end of the year (fourth quarter) data extracted

from the quarterly estimates.

       iwo alternative current income measures are compared in Section IV,

one corresponding to the accrual of purchasing cower and the other to cash

receipts. Each is adjusted for an imputed 10% per annum real yield r on

the beginning durables stock)0 The basic accrual concept of income is

private sector income y——see Darby (1976, Chapter 2)——which is the amount

(iriplicit in the national income accounts) available to the private sector

(ultinately consumers) for consumption or addition to wealth.11 The cash—

receipts concept is based on disposable personal income y". Both series

are deflated by the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expen-

ditures and quarterly observations are at SAQR. Thus, on the accrual def i—

nition current income is


                         + r

rates in the cuarter1y regression.15 The low                  quarterly   Durbin—Watson sta-

tistic supgests autocorrelation of the residuals not present in the annual

regression, however. This nutocorrelatlon may be due either to correlated

data errors such as from the seasonal adjustment or else to an omitted

variable such as lagged transitory income which is not important at the

annual level. Since autocorrelation suggest overly optimistic standard

errors, the discussion below will emphasize the more reliable annual re-

gression.
                                       — 14 —


      Because of the important trend element, the adjusted          is a meaning—
                                        16
less measure of explanatory power.           More useful is the ratio of the

standard error of estimate to the mean value of dependent variable. This

value is 0.58 percent for the annual regression and 0.86 percent for the

quarterly regression. If the consumer expenditure functions were conver-

ted to private saving functions by use of the identities (see Darby (1975),

equation (12)), the standard errors would be 5.0 percent of mean private

saving for annual data and 7.5 percent for quarterly data. Further the

annual standard error of estimates is only 34.0 percent of the standard

error for the naive model of footnote 16 and 50.5 percent of the standard

error for a Keynesian consumption function.

      In the annual regression, the coefficient of           exceeds unity be-

cause the effect operating through the stock demand for durables Is large

relative to the offset due to the demand for money. The long—run effect

of   permanent income    would include induced effects on the durables and

money stocks. Of special interest are the implied long—run values for

the ratio k of pure consumption to total accrued income and the ratio a

of private saving to private sector income (exclusive of the inmuted

yield on the durables stock). These values are estimated at 0.90 and

O.O respectively on the basis of regression (18).17 In view of the non—

linear   transformations rind auxiliary information used in their computa-
tions, these values arc better regarded as rough checks        on the consistency

of the regression than as good estimates of k and a.

quarterly value reflects the smaller impact of current income on permanent

income within a quarter as compared to over a year. The estimates of this

E weirht bracket the 0.1 per annum (0.025 per quarter) value which was

estimated in 1)arby (1974) on the basis of pure consumption. They will be

analyzed further in Section IV.

       The coefficient of real money balances is quite si!nificant in both
the economic and statistical senses. Its high value would appear to sup-

port the substitution hypothesis of the real balance effect. This may be

interpreted in two equivalent ways: (1) Bonds and durables are øubsti—

tutes in the household portfolio and       the   demands for both are affected by

an excess supply of money. (2) oney supply, given its demand, is a good

.roxv    for the    unavailable real yields on substitutes for durable goods.

 .notcr    possibly    complementary liquidity hypothesis would stress the cr1—

tical    role   of cash balances in providing down    payments   for the purchase

ef    consumers'   durable goods because of the illiquidity of other forms of

nssets. A substantive iriplication of the effect of real money balances

on consumer expenditures is that——in terms of the Hicksian cross——an

increase in the money supply shifts the IS (as well as the L!!) curve          to

the right.

        The   negative   coefficient on the real durables stock is significantly

 1arcer than       the yield on the stock. This indicates that both     the direct

 sitb;titutlon     of durables yield for nondurable good.and     services and the

 Indirect adjustment of the       clurahics stoc1• affects consumer expenditures.
 Abnormally hi'h durrtblcs sales during a boom imply       a period   of abnormally

 sales later.
                                 — 16 —


     The coefficient of the relative price of durable goods is insigni-

ficant and of the wrong sign. Although not surprising——given that about

half of behaviorally defined thirable goods are represented in the denomi—

nator——this result is disappointing. An unsuccessful attempt was made to

estimate durables stock and price series inclusive of clothing and shoes.

Although the relative price coefficient became negative, insurmountable

difficulties in estimating the initial stock and depreciation resulted in

a slight deterioration in the standard error. Even were a definitionally

Tpure" estimate available, there would be two other factors making for an

insignificant——or even perversely signed——coefficient for the relative

price of durables: (1) The behavior of the relative price of durables is

dominated by a downward trend over the postwar period. Given the costs

of maintaining current price information on infrequently purchased Items,

the price as perceived by consumers not actively in the market would be

better represented by a trend than by the actual price. Since permanent

income is trend—dominated, the high implicit coefficient on permanent in-

come in the durables stock demand will reflect not only the true income

effect but also the effect of the negative trend in prices. (2) If——con-

trary to the usual macroeconomic assumption——the supply curve of durable

-'oods Is not infinitely elastic at a given price, the relative price co-

efficient would reflect the interaction of demand and supply effects and

be of indeterminante sign.

     The nominal interest rate coefficient is slightly positive. This

indicates that the positive effect (from decreasing the demand for money)

slightly outweighs the negative effect (from decreasing the durable stock

demand). Since no attempt was made to adjust for expected inflation, the

nominal interest rate would not be expected to have much effect in the
                                   — 17 —


                                                                         is
durables stock demand. It is perhaps surprising then——if money demand
significantly interest elastic——that the interest rate coefficient does

not more substantially exceed zero.

     The early part of the period, say from 1947 through 1953, appeared

suspect for three possible reasons: (1) the constraint on durables goods

purchases during World War II, (2) possible inaccuracies in the starting

benchmarks for permanent income and the durables stock, and (3) the effect

on the demand for money of the abandonment during 1951—1953 of pegged in-

terest rates on government bonds. The equations were restiinated for 1954—

1973, but there was no hint of a structural change or even a significant

change   in any of the coefficients.'8 So the entire period is retained for

the statistical analysis.

     It is customary   to include in consumer expenditure functions——or rather
consumption functions fitted to consumer expenditure data—the lagged de-
pendent variable. The usual justification is the Koyck transformation in

which    lagged consumption serves as a proxy for lagged permanent income.
This justification does not hold for lagged consumer expenditures however,
since    it has been seen above that short—run fluctuations in consumer expen-

ditures are due primarily to fluctuations in transitory income, real money,

and durables stock. Although estimatIon of regressions such as (18) by

 a maximum likelihood search routine is somewhat costly, the resulting

 standard errors and Durbin—Watson statistics do not suffer from the biases

 anticipated in regressions inclusive of the lagged dependent variable.

 Where the precise estimate of the weight 8 of current income in permanent

 income is not of concern, regressions can be run conditional upon a par-

 ticular 8 weight.

Disaret1on into Consumption and Durab1esInvesmentjuations
       It   serves as a useful check on the derivation and interpretation of

the integrated consumer expenditure function (11) to estimate the under-

lying pure consumption function (5) and household durables investment

function (10). The difficulty in doing this is that the main reason for

using the inter,rated approach is a lack of good data on household durables

investment and pure consumption. Nevertheless for illustrative purposes,

the official definition of durable goods was used to construct estimates

(as explained under "I)ata Definitions') of pure consurrntion c and house—

hold   durables investment Mt.
       Table   1 presents   the   regression   results. Equation (5)   is   estimated

by   regressions   number 1 and 4 for annual and quarterly data respectively.

The previous indirect calculation of k as 0.90 corresponds well to the

direct estimate of 0.88. Since it was argued that a pure consumption

estimate based on the official durables definition would in fact include

considerable household investment in misclassified durables, regression 2

and 5 apply the consumer expenditure function to the estimated "pure con—

sumption.' Regressions 3 and 6 apply the household durables investment

function (10) to the estimated net investment in (officially classified)

durables good.

        In comparing regressions 2 and 3, it is clear that the estimated net
investment contains on the         order   of half of total net investment in a

behavioral sense.'9 The           only   significant problem——not present in the

cuarter1y regressions——is the larger coefficient on the lagged durables

stock   in   regression 2 than in regression 3. This apparently offsets a

slightly high      estimated      weight of current income in permanent income

uhule the      quarterly   regressions 5 and 6 display the opposite bias due to
                                        — 19 —


a   low 8    weight.20 The signs of the coefficients of the relative price of

durables are just the reverse of what would be expected, but not much can

be made of the statistically insignificant results for that variable.

           In stun, the disaggregated version of the model is very much as would

be guessed from the derivation of the model and the estimates of the inte-

grated       consumer expenditure function. The only significant divergence
between the annual and quarterly results——autocorrelation aside——are ap-
parently due       to the use of a slightly too high value of 8 in the annual

regressions and slightly too low a value of 6 in the quarterly regressions.

           The disaggregation done in Table 1 takes advantage of the estimated

8 weight of current income in permanent income from the integrated con-

sumer expenditure       function. A standard multiequation model   would make

separate estimates of equations (5) and (10) and combine them by use of

the identity (4) if a prediction of total consumer expenditures were re-

quired. The 8 estimate of the durables investment function will be un-

biased but imprecise because of the low coefficient of permanent income.

Since the estimates of pure consumption include elements of durables in-

vestment, the demonstration of upward bias of 6 from Darby (1974) applies

directly. Nevertheless the biased permanent income estimates will provide

more accurate predictions of c than regressions 1 and 4. In practice an

even       more favorable estimate of C based on   the Koyck transformation would

likely be used       instead of equation (5):

                     f —                  f
    (21)                   a1   + 82t + a3C.

Table 2 compares the root mean squared errors of these two disaggregate
    estimation techniques with the root mean squared error of the consumer

    expenditure function. The integrated consumer expenditure function does

    much better than either disaggregated approach for the annual data. But
                                   — 20 —


for   ciuarterly data, the method utilizing the Koyck transformation does

nearly as well. The quarterly national income accounts data appear to

spread receipts and expenditures over adjacent quarters however, so that

the IZoyck transformation in this case displays a spurious accuracy.

      The consumer expenditure function has been successfully estimated in

this section with no significant departures from expected signs or magni-

tudes of coefficients. The estimated coefficients are internally con-

sistent. The disaggregated estimates are consistent with the original

hypothesis that all coefficients other than permanent income enter because

of household investment in durable goods but that nearly half of durable

oods in a behavioral sense are included in the official data on nondur-

able goods and services. As a result, disaggregate estimates of consumer

expenditures derived from separate models of pure consumption and house—

:o1d durables investment compare poorly with the estimates of the inte-

grated consumer expenditure function.

                   IV. Analysis    of Three Empirical Issues


        The consumer expenditure function is used in this section to investi-

gate further three empirical issues: (1) the definition of current income

which best explains consumer expenditures (2) the definition of money

which best explains consumer expenditures; and (3) the value of the weight

  of current income in the determination of permanent income.

        The two income definitions which are compared are the accrual con-

cept and the cash—receipts concept.21 These two definitions reflect the

two basic alternative conceptions of consumer behavior. The accrual con-

cept is harmonious with a view of the consumer as a rational decision—

maker constrained by total wealth. The cash—receipts concept is sensible

if consumer behavior is more a matter of spending nearly all that is re-

ceived. Until recently, the use of a cash—receipts concept (disposable

personal income) was the standard, traditional practice. A number of

studies in the last decade have moved toward the accrual concept by adding

undistributed corporate profits (as an estimate of accrued capital gains).

        There are many other competing income definitions which could be con-

sidered. ror example, Jarro (1974) and Kochin (1974) have recently ar-

gued——following David Ricardo——that government bonds are not viewed by

the private sector as net wealth.      Iii that case an accrual definition of

income would be essentially net natJonal product less government expendi-

tures    for goods and services plus the increase in high—powered (base)
money.22 Feldstein (1974) on the other hand argues for inclusion of an
etitate of     increases in   "social security wealth." Another issue concerns
the transfer of purchasing power to the         government through inflation. This

would suggest subtraction of the     rate of inflation times high—powered money
and governiient bonds (if     government bonds are net wealth). In view of the
                                        22 —


hig1 estimation     costs of dealing with many alternative incorie definitions

simultaneously with the other two main empirical issues, it was decided

only to compare the basic accrual and cash—receipts definitions, leaving

for further research comparison of finer differences conditional on a par-

ticular money definition and weight.

       section III only discussed the          (currency plus demand deposits) de—

finitic-n of mone'. To other money definitions have received considerable

attention 1w monetary economists: N2 0l plus time deposits at cormiiercial

an:s23) and T3 (M', plus savings and loan and mutual savings hank deposits).

These alternative money definitions are compared with           in this section.

       The 2 data used are an average of the monthly data deflated by the

inlicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures. Unfortu-

nately Federal Reserve data for        is available only from January 1959

onward while the Friedman and Schwartz (1970) data contain no series usinc

the official        definition. Monthly estimates of N3 for 1947 through 1958

:ere made on the basis of the Friedman and Schwartz data on savings and

loan and mutual savings bank deposits.           The N3 data used in this series

are averages of this monthly data deflated by the implicit price deflator

for personal consumption expenditures.

       In Darhy (1974), removal of the   specification    bias resulted in an es-

timated     weight of 0.1 per annum in terms of an essentially pure consump-

tion model. This section examines whether that estimate stands u for the

consumer expenditure function under alternative definitions of income and

money. Were       not estimated for each combination it could bias the choice

of the best combination of income and money.


       These   three empirical issues are examined simultaneously by    the regres—

;ion    reporte(! in Tables 3 (annual (lata) and 4 (quarterly data)      The
                                   — 23   —




message of these tables is very clear The accrual income concept and the

   money concept do much better in explanatory power (as judged the sum

of squared residuals or standard error of estimate criterion) than the

alternative definitions. Further the          weight of 0.1 per annum previously

estimated on the basis of pure consumption continues to hold up for the

consumer expenditure function.

     Consider first the definition of income For each money         definition
and for both annual and quarterly data, the accrual definition of Income

does better than the cash—receipts definition.25 The sum of squared resi-

duals    of the best cash—receipts definition regression exceeds that of the
corresponding accrual definition by 41.8 percent for the annual data and
10.6 percent for the quarterly data.26 It        would have been surprising,
given    the success of the model which is based on rational consumers faced

with a wealth constraint, had the accrual definition not done considerably

better than the cash-receipts definition of income.

        As to the empirical definition of money, the results are similar. For

either definition of income, the N1 definition does better than either

or 13. Comparing the best N1 estimate with the best alternative (N3),

the alternative definition's sum of squared residuals is 32.9 percent high-

er for annual data and 11.1 percent    higher for quarterly data. The     coeffi-
cients of real money balances would    be expected to decline in moving from

    to   12 to 13 (because of the increasing absolute magnitudes), but the
 fact that the standard errors decline less rapidly (so tLat t—values fall)
 is suggestive that U2 and 113 are properly interpreted as proxies for
 The fact that h3 does a bit better than N2 is suggestive that consumers
 find bank and nonbank tirie deposits much better substitutes for each other
 tItan tiey find all kinds of time deposits for N1.

         As already discussed in Section III, the estimates of the weight

brachet—--ut       in no case sinificantly differ from——the previous estimate

of .1 -,er annum or . CJ25 per quarter. As discussed in footnote 20 above,

the neighborhood of 0.1 per annum (0.025 per quarter). This is illustrated
in Figures 1 and 2 which are graphs of the sum of suared residuals as a
function of the     wei'ht for annual and quarterly data, respectively. The

that the minimizing I weights of 0.15 and 0.01, respectively, are little
better     than   any other value within that range. From 0.2 to 0.6 per annum

       Strong evidence has been presented In this section for the following

empirical propositions: (1) The accrual (private sector income) definition

of income explains consumer expenditures better than the cash—receipts (dis-

posable personal income) definition. (2) The narrow                    definition of money

is an important determinant of consumer expenditures and significantly

better in explanatory power than either broad definition                    or M3. (3)

The weight    of current income In permanent income lies in the range from

o   to 20 per annum.

                             V.     Concluding iemarks


         The central theme of this paper is the empirical value of an inte-

 grated consumer expenditure function in explaining consumer expenditures.

 The theoretical value of the consumer expenditure function is that it con-

 centrates directly on the       variable   of prime interest to macroéconomjsts.

 j3ut the alternative treatment of household investment in durable goods as

 a component of an enlarged definition of total investment does not lack

 theoretical appeal either. The basic attraction is therefore the
                                                                           empiri-
 cal one; The integrated approach is much less subject to biases intro-

duced by the essentially arbitrary classification of coimiodities between

durable and nondurable goods and services.

     An empirical question can be answered only by examination of the data.

An unusually clear answer was provided by the research reported here: The

consumer expenditure function explains the data well and significantly

better than the multiequation pure consumption—household investment ap-

proach. The reason for this superior performance is found in the fact that

the official data on durable goods expenditures include only about half of

total durables expenditures as defined behaviorally.

     The data also provided strong evidence that (1) an accrual (private
sector) definition of income better exi)lains consumer expenditures than a
cash—receipts (disposable) personal income defInition: (2) tile narrow N]
definition similarly does better than either 2 or 113. and (3) the i
weight of current income in the formation of permanent income lies some-
where in the range from 0 to about 20% per annum. While there Is no a
priori presumption about the best money definition, the results on the
income   definition and the 13   weight reinforce the basic conception
                                   — 27   —




underlying the model——that consumers are rational decision—makers con-
strained by total (human and nonhuman) wealth as estimated by permanent
income. The rationality of consumers would certainly be questionable       if
they responded to cash receipts rather than accrued income. A 8 weight
of about 10% per annum——which is the estimated real yield on total wealth——
is certainly more acceptable than the higher weights estimated in many
previous    studies.29

      The   empirical advantages of an   integrated consumer expenditure func-

tion seem clear. Future research might be directed at substituting a

life cycle model for the permanent income explanation of pure consumption

to   compare their explanatory powers. Other areas for possible improvement

would be either the generalized stock adjustment hypothesis (6) or the

underlying stock demand functions (7) and (9). A somewhat different line

of   research would utilize the consumer expenditure    function to .r*ln(ne

finer   definitions of accrued income adjusted for increases in government
debt,   in social security wealth, or the inflationary tax    on base money

and possibly    government debt.

        Several data series of general applicability were estimated in the

course of this project. In order to make them available for future re-

search by others in this and other areas, the most important are repro-

duced here with instructions for updating as revised data become avail-

able.

        Table 5 presents annual data for nominal and real private sector in-

come, the current and permanent (real) income on the accrued definition,

the real durables stock, and the nominal M3 money supply. Table 6 con-

tains quarterly data for the same series. Table 7 presents the monthly

nominal M3 data through 1959 when they tie in with the Federal Reserve

System's published data.

     'The    old vaudeville joke comes to   mind: First drunk—-"Why    are   you look-

ing for your wallet here if you     lost it    over   there?" Second drunk——"The

light's    much better here by the lamp post."

     2A rough definition of behavioral durability is responsiveness to

transitory income. Consumer expenditures for durable goods and for clothing

and shoes are about equally responsive to changes in transitory and perma-

nent income, but all other expenditures are only about one quarter as re-

sponsive to changes in transitory income as to permanent income. Thus the

official Commerce Department definition does appear to capture goods signi-

ficantly more durable than those classified as nondurable goods and ser-

vices (with the exception of clothing and shoes). Given the relative mag-

nitudes, however, the remaining durable elements in "nondurable goods and

services" are nevertheless quite significant.

     31n my earlier work (1972, 1975), this adjustment was neglected be—

cause of the small difference from unity for quarterly data (with 5 —           .05,
1 — 0.5.   .5 —   0.975).

     4This adjustment too is small for quarterly data. Using r — 2.52 per

quarter or 10% per annum,    1 —   a.5r     0.9875 for quarterly data or 0.95 for
annual    data.

       5Darby (1974) demonstrates the    interpretation   of permanent income as

a   perpetual inventory of wealth.
       6Other   possible influences have been omitted either here or    below in
coipleting the specification because of the difficulty in obtaining good
data and the paucity of true degrees of freedom. The empirical results
that follow do not seem to have suffered much.

       7The coefficient of permanent income will capture the effect of wealth
and of secular trends in institutions, payments technology, and so forth.
The coefficient of transitory income      reflects both effects of windfalls
on   portfolio adjustment and   of   cyclical variations in transactions (see

Darby (1972)).

       8Basic data series were all drawn from the N.B.E.R.'s data bank.

       9This   amounts to the usual 10—year—life, double—declining—balance
method. The initial value for December 31, 1946, was computed from Raymond
Goldsmith's (1962) data as 72.43 billion 1958 dollars. See Darby (1972,
pp. 931—32) for details. This calculation requires that c be measured at
juart rates in order to integrate flows into stocks.
      10A theoretically more attractive definition would base the imputation
on the average durables stock for the period       dtl + O5    6db. As zkinight
impart   spurious correlation——particularly in the disaggregated estimation

of the dt equation——this was not done.

details) as:

     13This series is the most problematical. It was pointed out in the

introduction that roughly half of behaviorally durable goods are included

among nondurable goods and services. Thus their prices will be Included

     18The estimates of the   weight of current income In permanent income

were a bit closer to the value of 0.1 per annum estimated in Darby (1974).

The only other noticeable——though statistically insignificant——changes

were generally higher (in absolute value) estimates for the coefficients

of money and the durables stock. All these changes are consistent with

the hypothesized shift, but the standard errors of estimate actually de-

teriorated slightly in the truncated period.

     '9The smaller coefficient of transitory income Tt in regression 3

than in 2 reflects the larger offset due to the higher money coefficient.

Note that, roundingerror aside, regressions 2 plus 3 less 0.1 dt_l equal

regression equation (18). SImilarly, regressions 5 plus 6 less 0.025

equal regression equation (19).

     20 am indebted to Tom Mayer for the observation that for low B

weights permanent income and the durables stock are closely related be-

cause of the high correlation between transitory income and fluctuations

in household durables investment. A high estimate of B applies too low a

weight to past transitory income and can be offset by a ire negative co-

efficient on the durables stock. This correlation is the probable explana-

tion for the relatively flat likelihood function at the low end of the B

range as discussed in Section IV below. In regressions based on the B

weight of 0.1 per annum (but not reproduced here), the coefficient of

d1 is —0.092 for the c dependent variable and —0.102 for the

dependent variable. Consumer expenditure functions for 8   0.1 per

annum and 0.025 per quarter are presented in Section IV.

                2l explained     in   the first part of Section III, the accrual concept
        is   private sector income adjusted for the yield on the durable. stock
        while   the cash—receipts concept is disposable personal income with the
        same adjustment.       The conclusions as to the relative merits of the        two

        concepts   are not affected by omission       of   the durables yield adjustment.
               22To be precise, transfers to foreigners and         the   statistical discre-
        pancy   should also be subtracted.


               23Exclusive of large negotiable certificates of deposits.


               24The monthly N3 data for January1947 through December 1959 are re-

        ported in the Data Appendix. Monthly savings and loan deposits were inter-

        polated between annual (1947—1949) and quarterly (1950—1954) bent,harks

        by   the use   of mutual savings bank deposit..

               25The   quarterly sums   of   squared residuals are biased downwards by the
        autocorrelation indicated by the low        Durbin—Watson    statistics. Note that
        this   statistic   is 1.08 for the accrual definition and 0.94 for the cash re-

        ceipts definition (regression 13 and 14 respectively). Only regressions 17

        and 18 for the quarterly M3 comparison are close to a dead heat. That pre-

        sumably reflects some peculiarity in the data which           also   accounts for the

        unusually high estimate of 0.06 per quarter in regression 17.

               261fl   comparing definitions such as these, the hypotheses are not
        strictly nested and no generally acceptable significance test exists.

        Consider the following, however. If the difference between the accrual

        and the cash—receipts definitions were allowed to enter with a            weight   u

        (to be estimated) between 0 and 1, the cash—receipts definition would be

        nested (with the restriction p •        1) in the more general hypothesis that
                                     - 48   -




income is. the stun of the accrual concept plus j.i times the difference.

For this model, the sum of squared residuals could not be greater than

the sum of squared residuals for 31      0 (the accrual income definition).

If we suppose that this upper limit on the unconstrained sum of squares is

the actual value-—which is favorable to accepting the cash—receipts defini—

tion——the likelihood ratio test could be used. The critical value at the

5% significance level for the excess sum of squares would then be 15.3%

for annual data and 3.6% for quarterly data. So even on this apparently

generous test, the cash—receipts definition is significantly worse than

the accrual definition. The same argument and critical values would apply

to the money definitions discussed below.

sumption model.
