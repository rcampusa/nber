                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we analyze the link between corruption money laundering and round-trip investment
via offshore jurisdictions utilizing Russian firm-level data. In particular we empirically explore location
strategies of round-trip investors (namely, from Cyprus and British Virgin Islands) across Russia and
compare them with the benchmark group of genuine foreign investors in Russia. We further study
the determinants of the fraction of round-trip investment in total foreign investment in Russian regions.
We find that round-trip investors tend to locate in more corrupt Russian regions than their genuine
foreign counterparts and the fraction of round-trip investment is also significantly higher in corrupt
regions. Taking into account that a large fraction of round-trip investment in Russia is concentrated
in real estate and financial sectors, our results point to the conclusion that there is a strong link between
round-trip investment and corruption money laundering.

    1. INTRODUCTION



        Corruption has obvious connection with money laundering. As it is argued in Financial Action Task

Force (FATF) report 2011 “the stolen assets of a corrupt public official are useless unless they are placed,

layered, and integrated into the global financial network in a manner that does not raise suspicion”. It is

further argued in the report that corrupt public officials would seek to move financial proceeds of corruption

outside of their home jurisdiction. An examination of the corruption case studies revealed that in nearly

every case foreign bank accounts were being used in part of the scheme. The proceeds of corruption may be

laundered in jurisdictions which have not enacted strict anti-money laundering measures and in countries

which uphold very strict bank secretary laws or regulations (Rossidou-Papakyriacou, 1999). Offshore

financial centers are widely recognized as such jurisdictions.

        Corruption money laundering in offshore financial centers is further connected with another largely

unexplored phenomenon in the world economy – round-trip investment, i.e. the transfer of funds abroad in

order to bring some or all of the investment back to home country as foreign investment. E.g. as has been

recently noted in press: “Most foreign investment in BRICs isn`t foreign at all – it`s tycoons using tax

havens”1. Each BRIC country has its own offshore jurisdiction largely used for capital round-tripping. For

China it is the tiny “bolthole” of the British Virgin Islands, for India – Mauritius, for Russia – Cyprus and for

Brazil – the Netherlands.

        The consequences of such round-trip investment for national economies can be quite dramatic. E.g.

in China the bulk of these round-trip investments is from shell companies, which are registered by corrupt

Chinese officials in offshore jurisdictions. Since round-trip investment mainly flows to real estate

speculation, it distorts China`s entire economic structure2.

        Though there are numerous journalist articles and opinions of leading economic analysts and

politicians on the link between corruption money laundering and round-trip investment via offshore

jurisdictions, this issue is practically unexplored in academic literature. In this paper we empirically analyze

the link between corruption money laundering and round-trip investment utilizing Russian firm-level data.

           A distinctive feature of foreign investment patterns for Russia is the correlation of inward and

outward investment flows between Russia and key offshore financial centers (OFCs) such as Cyprus and

British Virgin Islands (BVI)3. According to Russian statistics, the key offshore destinations of Russian

registered capital outflows, Cyprus and BVI, are persistently among the major source countries of inward

foreign investment into Russia. And as in accordance to Perez et al. (2012) study over 20% FDI to money

laundering countries from a selection of transition countries were made to facilitate illicit money flows, it is

plausible to suggest that there should be a strong relationship between corruption money laundering and

round-trip investment in Russia.

        In empirical test we utilize a sample of firms with foreign ownership that have been registered in

Russia during the period 1997-2011. The data comes from ROSSTAT – the Russian State Statistical Agency

– the most reliable data source of economic statistics on Russia.

        In this study we consider two groups of foreign investors. The first one is represented by foreign

investors from Cyprus and British Virgin Islands, i.e. the OFCs which are very popular with round-tripping

activities of Russians. The second, benchmark group for comparison, consists of genuine foreign investors

and includes investors from such countries as Germany, Sweden, Finland and USA among the others.

        First, using knowledge-capital model of the multinational enterprise of Carr et al. (2001), we provide a

formal (empirical) analysis of the phenomenon of round-trip investment in the Russian economy. In

particular we find very strong evidence that the amounts of foreign investment into Russia from Cyprus and

BVI cannot be explained within traditional international investment theory which confirms round-trip

investment hypothesis.

        Second, we empirically study the differences in location strategies between round-trip and genuine

foreign investors across Russian regions. Here we find rather convincing evidence that round-trip investors

tend to invest into Russian regions with higher levels of resource potential and corruption. The explanation

for the result for resource potential is two-fold. On the one hand it points to the restrictions for genuine

foreign investment in Russian resource sector. On the other hand it reflects the circulation of money earned

3
  According to the most popular and recognized definition, OFC is a centre which provides some or all of the following services: low or zero
taxation; moderate or light financial regulation; banking secrecy and anonymity. Though in general both Cyprus and BVI satisfy this definition, we
should mention that Cyprus’s future as an offshore financial centre has been in serious jeopardy when the island adopted full EU membership in
2004. However, due to cleverly adjusted taxation policies in the interests of corporations and foreign retirees, Cyprus remained an offshore tax haven
of some note. Source: http://www.shelteroffshore.com/index.php/offshore/more/positive-developments-cyprus-offshore-financial-centre-10519
                                                                                                                  4


by Russians in exploitation and export of natural resources via OFCs. The reasons of such circulation might

include tax avoidance (on profits from export of natural resources).

      The result for corruption holds both in manufacturing and combined real estate and financial activities

sectors. However, we argue that the explanations can be different. On the one hand, for manufacturing sector

the preference of round-trip investors to locate in more corrupt Russian regions might reflect their better

abilities to deal with corrupt Russian regional authorities. On the other hand, the result that round-trip

investors tend to establish firms in real estate and financial sectors in more corrupt regions, in our view, just

reflects the corruption money laundering via round-trip investment hypothesis as these sectors are largely

associated with corruption.

       Third, we empirically analyze the factors which determine the fraction of round-trip investment in

total foreign investment across Russian regions. Here we find very strong evidence that the share of round-

trip investment is considerably higher in more corrupt Russian regions. This result holds for all main

industrial sectors and gives further support for corruption money laundering hypothesis.

      In general our empirical results give a strong support that round-trip investment is an important

channel of corruption money laundering in Russia. This suggests that offshore jurisdictions indirectly

facilitate corruption in the world economy. The existence of such jurisdictions makes the process of

laundering of money earned in dishonest activities (corruption or criminal) considerably easier.

      The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 and 3 describe the data and empirical methodology,

respectively. Section 4 presents the empirical results. Finally, section 5 discusses the results and concludes.



    2. DATA DESCRIPTION

        Our empirical analysis makes use of Rosstat (Russian State Statistical Agency) dataset,

which provides information on the location choice of 20,165 firms with foreign capital registered in

Russia in the period between 1997 and 2011 and provided financial reports to Rosstat in 2011. This

dataset includes information on firms of two ownership types: full ownership of foreign entities and

joint ventures of foreign owners (foreign entities and foreign citizens) with Russian private owners

(Russian entities and citizens). For each firm, we use data that Rosstat records on:
                                                                                                      5


      Industry information, including the six-digit OKVED code (Russian equivalent to SIC six-

       digit codes) of the primary industry in which a firm operates;

      Ownership structure, including information about firms` owners (country of origin,

       company`s name, share in capital) and ownership status;

      Location information, including a region;

      Year of registration;

      Charter capital size at the moment of registration;

      Annual gross revenues in the period of 1998-2011 (when available).


       From this dataset we extract two types of firms. First group consists of firms which foreign

ownership is represented by offshore owners (i.e. OFCs). In this study the offshore owners are

represented by investors from Cyprus and BVI. We assume that this group represents round-trip

investors. The second group consists of firms for which foreign ownership is represented by

genuine foreign owners. The genuine foreign (non-offshore) owners are more diversified: main

investors are Germany, USA, Finland, China, Turkey, France and Sweden. We should note here

that we do not include firms established by investors from Netherlands, Luxemburg, Liechtenstein,

Switzerland, Austria and Great Britain in either of these two groups. On the one hand, these

countries can be considered as offshore countries popular with Russian flight capital. On the other

hand, a large portion of foreign investment from these countries might have “real foreign” origin.

       Our final sample consists of 15, 174 firms (5,712 (38 %) firms are established by investors

from Cyprus; 1,688 (11 %) – by investors from BVI and 7,774 (51%) – by genuine foreign

investors). More than 70% of firms are concentrated in three sectors: trade and repair (28,5%), real

estate (29%) and manufacturing industries (12, 7%). On figure 1 we present the distributions of

firms in these sectors (plus financial sector due to its popularity with round-trip investors) by origin

of foreign investor.

           As we can see around 70% of firms in manufacturing industries and around 67% - in trade

and repair sector - are established by genuine foreign investors. On the other hand around 70% of

firms in real estate sector and around 80% of firms in financial sector are established by round-trip

investors. This evidence already reflects a corruption nature of round-trip investment as real estate

and financial sectors are commonly associated with corruption money laundering.

           In manufacturing sector, around 18% of Cypriot firms are established in manufacturing of food and

beverages, around 11% - in chemical production and around 9% - in publishing and polygraphic activities.

Around 22% of BVI firms are established in manufacturing of food and beverages, around 16% - in

publishing and polygraphic activities and around 9% - in wood processing and manufacturing goods from

wood, except furniture. Finally around 15% of firms established by genuine foreign investors are in

manufacturing of machine and equipment, around 11% - in manufacturing of food and beverages and around

9% - in manufacturing of non-metallic mineral goods.

           Micro and small firms strongly dominate in our sample. This pattern is slightly stronger for

firms established by genuine foreign investors. There can be several explanations for this fact. First,

small firms are more flexible than larger ones to changing environment in an unstable transition

economy. Second, establishing small firms requires fewer permissions, bureaucracy work, etc. than

for larger firms which might be also important for investors in such a corrupt and bureaucratic

country like Russia. The largest firms are established in trade sector followed by manufacturing and

financial sectors. The relative patterns do not differ much between the groups of investors except

that round-trip investors establish significantly larger firms in the financial sector compared to

genuine foreign investors.
                                                                                                       8


             Both round-trip and genuine foreign investments are highly concentrated in three Russian

regions, namely, Moscow city, Saint-Petersburg city and Moscow region. 65% of firms established

by investors from Cyprus are registered in Moscow city, 13% - in Moscow region and 7% - in

Saint-Petersburg. The corresponding shares for BVI are 76, 10 and 7% and for genuine foreign

investors – 56, 12 and 12%. The dominance of established firms in Moscow city is partly explained

by the fact that companies have their head offices in Moscow but real production activities are

located in regions. Unfortunately, from our data we cannot separate those firms that conduct real

business in other regions but locate in Moscow.

             On figure 3 we plot the number of firms established by round-trip investors (Cyprus and

BVI) against the number of firms established by genuine foreign investors across Russian regions.

We exclude Moscow, Moscow region and St. Petersburg because of scale problem.

             From the figure we can see that though there is positive relationship in distribution of the

two types of firms across Russian regions, it is far from being perfectly identical (i.e. 45 degree

line). This evidence indicates that there are substantial differences in location strategies between

round-trip and genuine foreign investors across Russia.

    3. EMPIRICAL STRATEGIES



    3.1. Knowledge-capital model of the multinational enterprise frameworks

First, we estimate the knowledge-capital model of the multinational enterprise suggested by Carr et al.

(2001) with offshore dummies (adapted to our case of one host country (Russia) and multiple home

countries). We suggest that if offshore dummies are statistically significant and positive, then foreign

investments from OFCs exceeds the amounts predicted by traditional economic theory which gives support

for round-trip investment hypothesis (similar approach has been used by Rose and Spiegel (2007)). The

updated model is as follows:



RSALES j ,t   0  1SUMGDPjRUS ,t   2GDPDIFFSQ jRUS ,t   3 SKDIFF jRUS ,t 
 4GDPDIFFjRUS ,t * SKDIFF jRUS ,t   5 INVCRUSt   6TCRUS t   7TCRUS t * SKDIFFSQ jRUS ,t (1)
  8TCJ j ,t   9 DISTANCE jRUS  10OFFD  11OFF 2  u j  e jt



where RSALES j ,t is the sum of real annual gross revenues of firms established by foreign investors from a

parent country j in a year t (2002,…,2011). SUMGDPjRUS ,t is the sum of GDP of a parent country j and

Russia in a year t. GDPDIFF jRUS ,t is the difference between GDP of a parent country j and GDP of Russia

in a year t. GDPDIFFSQ jRUS ,t is the squared GDPDIFF jRUS ,t . Annual gross revenues values which are

originally in Russian roubles and GDP values of all countries have been converted into 2005 US dollars

using an exchange rate adjusted local wholesale price index with exchange rates and price indices taken from

the International Financial Statistics (IFS) of the International Monetary Fund.

        The variable SKDIFF jRUS ,t is a measure of skilled labour abundance in a country j relative to Russia

in a year t. SKDIFFSQ jRUS ,t is the squared SKDIFF jRUS ,t . Skilled labour abundance is measured by Gross

Enrolment Ration (tertiary (ISCED 5 and 6)) of the World Bank database.
                                                                                                                10


         INVCRUS t and TCRUS t respectively measure costs of investing in, and exporting to, Russia in a

year t. TCJ j ,t measures trade costs in exporting to parent country j in a year t. Investment costs in Russia are

measured by Investment dimension of the Index of Economic Freedom of the Heritage Foundation. Trade

costs in Russia and parent countries are measured by taxes on international trade (% of revenues) of the

World Bank database. Taxes on international trade include import duties, export duties, profits of export or

import monopolies, exchange profits, and exchange taxes.

         Finally, to the baseline model we add two dummy variables. The first one, OFFD, equals to one for

Cyprus and BVI and zero otherwise. The second one, OFF2, equals to one for Austria, Liechtenstein,

Luxemburg, Netherlands and Great Britain and zero otherwise. The latter variable counts for the countries

which can be partly considered as popular with round-tripping activities of Russian investors.

         We estimate the equation (1) using panel data model with random effects. We do not use fixed

effects because our main variables of interest – two offshore dummies – are time-invariant and thus

subsumed by regional fixed effects.



    3.2. Location model framework: three dimensional panel data framework

The aim of our empirical analysis within location model framework is to determine if and to what extent the

role of regional factors in the location decisions of foreign investors across Russian regions differs between

round-trip and genuine foreign investors. More precisely, we estimate the following equation:


yitj   0  1 RESi ,t 1   2Corri   3 Porti   4 MSizei ,t 1   5 Mpoti ,t 1   6 RIRi ,t 1
  7 EDU i  8 RIPi ,t 1   9 Roadsi ,t 1  10OFFd j  11 RESi ,t 1 * OFFd j 
12Corri * OFFd j  13 Porti * OFFd j  14 Msizei ,t 1 * OFFd j  15 Mpoti ,t 1 * OFFd j             (2)
 16 RIRi ,t 1 * OFFd j  17 EDU i * OFFd j  18 RIPi ,t 1 * OFFd j 
19 Roadsi ,t 1 * OFFd j    tYear _ Dummies  ui  eit
                                t




where yitj is the number of established firms in a particular Russian region, i (i=1,…,76), in a given year, t

(t=1997,…,2010) by a j (1,2) type of investor (round-trip and genuine foreign). Hence, we deal with three-

dimensional panel data. The explanatory variables are described below in subsection 4.2.1; the time-varying
                                                                                                                                               11


control variables are lagged by one year. The use of lagged explanatory variables helps to solve possible

endogeneity problems and further relate to a simple hypothesis for the foreign investor`s decision-making

process: foreign investors are assumed to make an investment decision for a given year by referring to the

observable variables of the previous year (see, e.g., Ledyaeva, 2009).

              We also include an offshore dummy OFFd which equals to one for round-trip investors (Cyprus and

BVI in this study) and zero for their genuine foreign counterparts. We further include the interaction terms

between OFFd and all the explanatory variables in order to estimate the differences in the role of regional

factors in location decisions between round-trip and genuine foreign investors.

              Finally, we include time (year) dummies. ui is unobserved regional heterogeneity and e it is

idiosyncratic error.



        3.2.1.         Explanatory variables

RES, the natural resources` potential variable, is measured using an online Expert RA journal4 ranking5 for a

particular region, i, in a given year, t-1 (from 1 to 89/83: 1 corresponds to the highest potential and 89/83

corresponds to the lowest potential).

              Corruption CORR in a Russian region i is measured using the corruption dimension provided by the

Moscow Carnegie Center`s Index of Democracy for the period 2000-2004 (as average). It is measured on a

5-point scale, where 1 indicates the highest level of corruption and 5 indicates the lowest. This indicator

refers mainly to state corruption in a broader sense, that is, the interconnections between political and

business elites and their interventions in the political decision-making process. To our knowledge, this is the

only indicator of corruption that is available for all of the Russian regions.6

              The variable Port reflects the presence of a seaport in a particular Russian region (a dummy variable

that is equal to one if there is at least one sea port in a region and zero otherwise).

              MSize, the market size variable, is the first principal component of three variables (gross regional

product, total population, and population density) for a particular region, i (i=1,…,76), in a given year, t-1

    http://www.raexpert.ru/ - official webpage of Expert Rating Agency (RA), the most respected rating agency in the CIS and Eastern Europe.
5
    This indicator reflects the average weighted availability of balanced stocks of principal natural resources in the Russian regions.
6
 The only alternative is the index of corruption of Transparency International and Fund INDEM (2002). However, the index was only computed for
40 Russian regions, which would pose serious limitation on our study.
                                                                                                                                                         12


(t=1996-2007). This indicator for the market size in Russian regions was introduced previously in a study by

Iwasaki and Suganuma (2005). The proportion of variance of the first component can reach 80%, and

furthermore, its eigenvector and component loading show that this variable is suitable as a general index of

market size.

              We also include a surrounding-market potential variable, MPot (see Blonigen et al., 2007). For a

region, i, it is defined as the sum of the market sizes (measured using the MSize variable) of the surrounding

regions within a distance of 500 km (between the capital of a particular Russian region and the capital of a

neighbouring (but not necessarily bordering) region). This distance threshold between neighbouring regions

has been chosen based on the “trial-and-error” method. This variable is also lagged by one year.

              Regional investment risk, RIR, is an online Expert RA journal ranking7 ranging from 1 to 89/83 for a

particular Russian region, i, in a given year, t-1 (1 is assigned to a region with the smallest risk in Russia, and

89/83 is assigned to a region with the largest risk).

              The next variable is the educational background of population in a Russian region, EDU. It is

measured using a natural logarithm of the share of population with at least a medium level of professional

education compared to the share of population with no professional education in a particular Russian region

in the year 2002 (the data comes from the Rosstat Population Census for 2002).

              Regional institutional potential, RIP, is an online Expert RA journal ranking8 ranging from 1 to 89/83

for a particular Russian region, i, in a given year, t-1 (1 is assigned to a region with the highest potential in

Russia, and 89/83 is assigned to a region with the lowest potential).

              Finally, the variable Roads reflects the regional development of railways and highways and is

measured by the average density of railways and highways in a particular region, i, in a given year, t-1.



        3.2.2.     Econometric methodology

              The dependent variable in the location model is a count variable, and it takes on only non-negative

integer values. While a Poisson regression is appropriate for modeling the count data, our data is

significantly overdispersed, and hence, it violates a basic assumption of the Poisson model (Hausman, Hall,

7
  This is a qualitative indicator that simultaneously reflects political, economic, social, criminal, financial, ecological, and legislative risks for
investment activities in the Russian regions.
8
    This indicator reflects the level of development of principal market institutions in the Russian regions.
                                                                                                          13


and Griliches, 1984). Consequently, as recommended in the literature, we use negative binomial (NB)

regression to model the count data (Hausman et al., 1984). Since our data has a panel structure, we estimate

equation (1) using a negative binomial panel model. The negative binomial panel estimator accommodates

the explicit control of persistent, individual, unobserved effects through either fixed or random effects. We

employ regional random effects to control for unobserved regional differences. We do not use fixed effects

for two reasons. First, several our explanatory variables are time-invariant and thus subsumed by regional

fixed effects. Second, the maximum likelihood estimation – implemented using STATA – failed to converge

with the inclusion of region-specific dummies. The reason for this is that the Newton-Raphson method used

to estimate the likelihood functions in STATA is sensitive to the number of variables (see also Hedge and

Hicks, 2008). We also include year dummies to control for unobserved systematic period effects.

        The distribution of our dependent variable also contains a large number of zeros – nearly 31% for the

whole sample and up to 60% for subsamples. This suggests that our data may contain excess zeros relative to

the data generated using a standard negative binomial process. Failure to account for these extra zeros may

result in biased parameter estimates (Lambert, 1992). Accordingly, we also estimated equation (2) using a

zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model. Because we could not find a panel data version of the ZINB

model in the existing econometrics literature (see also Basu et al., 2011, p. 167), we employed a standard

ZINB estimator and computed standard errors that are robust for both clustering within regions and

heteroscedasticity. We should also mention that the ZINB model maximum likelihood estimation,

implemented in STATA, similar to the ordinary negative binomial model mentioned in the previous

paragraph, failed to converge when region-specific dummies (fixed effects) were included due to a

collinearity problem and an excessive number of explanatory variables. Hence, when using the ZINB model,

we estimated the reduced form of equation (1) by excluding ui , unobserved regional heterogeneity.

        The ZINB model assumes that the population is characterized by two regimes: One where members

are “not at risk,” and thus always have zero counts, and another where members are “at risk,” and thus have

either zero or positive counts (Greene, 2000). The likelihood of being in either regime is estimated using

logit specification, while the counts in the second regime are estimated using a negative binomial

specification. Potentially, the same set of explanatory variables can be used in each stage of the process
                                                                                                           14


(Basile, 2004). After different attempts, however, a subset of variables was selected to specify the splitting

function: Corr, Msize, RIP and Roads.



    3.3. Fractional dependent variable model framework

At this stage we analyze the regional factors of the fraction of round-trip investment in total investment

across Russian regions. In particular we estimate the following equation:



FRTit   0  1 RES it   2 Corri   3 Port i   4 Msizeit   5 Mpot it 
                                                                                            (3)
 6 RIRit   7 EDU i   8 RIPit   9 Roadsit  Year _ Dummies  eit



where FRTit is a fraction of the sum of gross annual revenues earned by firms with foreign ownership of

investors from Cyprus and BVI in the total sum of gross annual revenues earned by all firms with foreign

ownership (i.e. the sum of two considered groups in our study) in a Russian region i (1,…,76) in a year t

(2002,…,2011). At this stage we consider only firms established in the period of 1997-2001; i.e. the number

of firms is fixed for the analyzed period (2002-2011). The explanatory variables are the same as in location

model.

         We utilize a fractional logit pooled data model to estimate the equation (3) as recommended in the

relevant literature (for details see Papke and Wooldridge (1996; 2008)).

In table 1 we present estimation results of knowledge-capital model for our data (whole sample and

subsamples of main industrial sectors) using panel data model with random effects. Prior to estimation all of

the variables except dummies have been standardized.

             As we can see, both offshore dummies are highly statistically significant and have positive signs in

the whole sample and all the industrial subsamples which give strong support that these countries invest

significantly more into Russia than can be explained within the knowledge-capital model. Furthermore,

offshore dummy for Cyprus and BVI is significantly larger by magnitude than the offshore dummy for

Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Netherlands and Great Britain which indicates the higher importance of

the former countries as the centers for round-tripping activities of Russian investors. It can be also noted that

knowledge-capital model performs much better when the offshore dummies are included which further

points to the importance of analyzing the phenomenon of round-trip investment in the context of Russian

economy.

    4.2. Location choice of round-trip and genuine foreign investors across Russian regions

    4.2.1.   Baseline specification

In table 2 we present estimation results of the random effects negative binomial (RENB) panel data model

and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model for the whole sample. We also present estimation results

of equation (2) separately for the subsamples of round-trip and genuine foreign investors (then offshore

dummy and its interactions vanish) and for pooled data when the offshore dummy and its interaction terms

with explanatory variables are not included. Basic descriptive statistics and correlation matrix are presented

             From the results we can see that both round-trip and genuine foreign investors establish more firms

in Russian regions with larger market size, higher institutional potential, higher educational background of

population and better transport infrastructure (represented by railways and highways).
                                                                                                                18


        For the resource potential and port variables we find opposite results for the two groups of investors.

In particular, according to our findings, round-trip investors tend to establish more firms in Russian regions

with higher resource potential, while their genuine foreign counterparts – with lower resource potential. This

result might reflect restrictions for foreign investment in the Russian resource sector which are not applied to

(or can be easily overcome by) round-trip investors who are Russians by origin.

        We also find that while the presence of a sea port in a region stimulates genuine foreign investment

into it, it is not an important factor of location decision of round-trip investors. We suggest that this indicates

a higher orientation of round-trip investors towards the local market (both in inward and backward linkages)

compared to their genuine foreign counterparts.

        From the results for interaction terms with offshore dummy we further conclude that there are

significant differences between location strategies of round-trip and genuine foreign investors. In particular

we find that round-trip investors establish more firms than their genuine foreign counterparts in resource

abundant Russian regions, regions with larger market size, regions with higher institutional potential, regions

without sea ports and regions with lower educational background of population.

        The result for regional resource potential variable indicates that round-trip investors win genuine

foreign investors in competition for natural resources. This result is expected. Round-trip investors being

Russians by origin have better knowledge and connections with local business networks and regional

authorities. These business networks and regional authorities play a crucial role in gaining access to natural

resources. Moreover round-trip investors might be themselves full or partial owners of Russian companies in

resource-based industries (e.g. they utilize offshore schemes to hide export revenues from local taxes) and

hence, round-trip investment is simply the reinvestment of their incomes into the same company and region

(e.g. in case of using offshore tax evasion schemes in export operations).

        The finding that round-trip investors establish more firms than their genuine foreign counterparts in

Russian regions with larger market size indicates that round-trip investment is more oriented towards local

markets compared to genuine foreign. Furthermore this might also indicate that genuine foreign investors

tend to export goods produced in Russia rather than sell them at local market.

        The finding that round-trip investors establish fewer firms than genuine foreigners in regions with

sea ports also has a plausible explanation (which is quite related to the explanation for the interaction with
                                                                                                             19


market size variable). As sea port is a convenient mean for international transportation, this result enables us

to suggest that genuine foreign investors more often than round-trip investors rely on imported intermediate

goods and export the produced goods to home or third countries.

        The result that round-trip investors establish more firms than genuine foreigners in Russian regions

with lower educational potential indicates that genuine foreign investment is more qualified labour intensive

than round-trip investment.



    4.2.2.   Micro versus small, medium and large firms

As has been shown in Section 2 (data description) around 50% of firms in our dataset are micro firms

according to the Russian classification of company`s size (with annual gross revenues less than 1.5 million

Euros). In order to determine if foreign investors pursue different location strategies in Russia when

establishing firms of different size we estimate the location model for subsamples of micro firms and bigger

firms (small, medium and large altogether according to the Classification). The estimation results of equation

(2) are presented in table 3. The estimation period ends in 2008 as there are only few firms established in the

years 2009, 2010 and 2011 which reported annual gross revenues.

In general the results do not differ much from the baseline and between the subsamples. However, we have

mixed results for the corruption variable. In particular for bigger firms (i.e. when micro firms are excluded)

we find that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in less corrupt Russian regions compared to their

round-trip counterparts. This result could be expected. But for micro firms we found an opposite and

unexpected result that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in more corrupt Russian regions and

furthermore they invest more into more corrupt Russian regions compared to round-trip investors.
                                                                                                             21


        After checking the structure of firms in our data by country we found that many firms established by

investors from developing and transition economies are micro firms. As a rule these countries are much more

corrupt than developed ones. Investors from corrupt countries may be more equipped to cope with corruption

(Cuervo-Cazurra, 2006), and, hence, they may have a competitive advantage over investors from non-corrupt

countries when entering corrupt economies. In our earlier study using the same database as in this paper we

also found that foreign investors from more corrupt countries tend to establish firms in more corrupt Russian

regions (Ledyaeva et al. forthcoming). To account for this issue we estimate our model excluding from the

genuine investors` group firms established by investors from developing and transition countries. The results

are presented in the last two columns of Table 3. As we can see the unexpected result for corruption

variable in the sample of micro firms disappears: the coefficients of the corruption variable and its

interaction term with offshore dummy are not statistically significant anymore. Moreover, in the

subsample of bigger firms the result that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in less

corrupt Russian regions becomes stronger.



    1.1.1.   Industrial patterns

Next we estimate our location model for two sectors of the Russian economy, namely, manufacturing and

combined financial and real estate sectors. We focus on these sectors because the first one largely reflects the

real sector of the economy and its development is an important issue for Russian economy. The second one

might be associated with corruption which is the main focus of this paper. The estimation results are

presented in table 4. Here we use cross-sectional data as in panel data the number of zeros is extremely high

and it is impossible to get reliable estimates even with zero-inflated models. For estimation purposes we

utilize Poisson and negative binomial (NB) models.

Results` discussion

Manufacturing sector

First, as in estimations for the whole sample we find that in the subsample of bigger manufacturing firms

genuine foreign investors invest more into less corrupt regions compared to round-trip investors.

             Second, for the subsample of micro firms we find that round-trip investors tend to establish more

firms in regions with higher resource potential compared to their genuine foreign counterparts. This indicates

that round-trip investors invest more than genuine foreigners into resource-based manufacturing industries

which further confirm that they have better access to Russian natural resources than genuine foreign

investors.

             The interaction term of market size and offshore dummy is also positive and statistically significant

indicating that round-trip investors invest more into regions with larger market size compared to genuine

foreign investors. This result indicates that manufacturing firms established by round-trip investors are more
                                                                                                                23


likely to sell their goods at local (Russian) market while genuine foreign investors have higher propensity to

export produced products.

        We also find evidence (albeit marginally statistically significant) that in the subsample of bigger

firms round-trip investors establish fewer firms in the regions with sea port compared to genuine foreign

investors. This result indicates that in manufacturing sector firms established by genuine foreign investors

are more oriented towards import of intermediate goods and export of produced products.

        Finally, we find that both round-trip and genuine foreign investors tend to invest into regions with

higher institutional potential and higher density of automobile and railway roads.



Financial and real estate sector

First, for larger firms, the coefficient of the interaction term between offshore dummy and corruption

variable is statistically significant and its sign indicates that round-trip investors establish more firms in more

corrupt regions compared to genuine foreigners. And as this is widely accepted that financial and real estate

activities are largely associated with corruption money laundering, this result might reflect the corruption

money laundering hypothesis of round-trip investment in Russia.

        Second, for the subsample of larger firms the interaction term between offshore dummy and port

variable is statistically significant and its sign indicates that genuine foreign investors establish more firms in

regions with sea port compared to round-trip investors. This indicates that financial activities of genuine

foreign investors might be largely associated with export-import transport operations.

        There is also evidence that in the subsample of micro firms genuine foreign investors establish more

firms in regions with higher educational potential of population compared to round-trip investors.

Preliminary we suggest that this result indicates that genuine foreigners tend to establish financial and real

estate firms in regions with more developed service sector (which might be partly reflected by higher

educational potential of population).

        Finally we find that market size, institutional potential and transport infrastructure are important

location factors for both genuine foreign and round-trip investment.

           First, the share of round-trip activities is higher in corrupt Russian regions. This result is highly

statistically significant in the whole sample and in both industrial subsamples. The result has been expected

and in general confirms that 1) round-trip investors are better equipped to cope with corruption than their

genuine foreign counterparts and 2) round-trip investment might be an important channel for corruption

money laundering in Russia.

           Second, we find that the share of round-trip investment is lower in regions with ports. A similar

result has been found in the location model. Hence, our conclusion that round-trip investors are more

oriented towards local (Russian) market than genuine foreign investors is reinforced.

           Fourth, the results for educational background of population are mixed. First, in manufacturing and

combined financial and real estate sector the fraction of round-trip investment is higher in regions with

higher educational background of population. We argue that though the result is the same for these two
                                                                                                               25


sectors, the explanations might be different. In particular, while in manufacturing industry it can be largely

explained by the need of local qualified personnel, in combined financial and real estate sector, educational

background of population might reflect a better development of the service sector in general. However, in the

whole sample we find that the share of round-trip activities is higher in regions with lower educational

background of population. In our preliminary estimations we found that this result for the whole sample

largely reflects the result for trade and repair sector. In general it might point to the higher technological

level of genuine foreign investment compared to round-trip investment in this sector.



    5. CONCLUSIONS

This paper sheds light on a virtually unexplored phenomenon: round-trip investment from Russia to offshore

financial centers and back to Russia. In particular we empirically study the link between corruption and

round-trip investment. Our empirical test is based on the firm-level data on foreign-owned firms in Russia

obtained from Rosstat. Our main results can be summarized as follows.

           First, we find quite robust evidence that round-trip investors tend to invest into more corrupt Russian

regions than genuine foreign investors. This result gives support for the proposition of laundering the

proceeds of corruption via round-trip investment (in particular it’s high significance for the combined

financial and real estate sector). It further indicates that round-trip investors may indeed be better equipped to

cope with institutional deficiencies, e.g., corruption (in particular, the result`s significance in manufacturing

sector).

           Second, we find evidence that round-trip investors invest more into regions with higher resource

potential compared to their genuine foreign counterparts. This finding indicates that round-trip investors are

better able to exploit the business opportunities provided by the Russian natural resources than genuine

foreign investors. This often requires allying with authorities, which is obviously easier for round-trip

investors than for genuinely foreign investors. Furthermore, round-trip investors might be themselves the

representatives of the authorities who already have access to resources.

           Finally, our results enable us to suggest that round-trip investors favor the development of the Dutch

disease in Russia. In particular they are very highly concentrated in the service sector (real estate and

financial activities, in particular), seem to aim at exploiting natural resources in Russia, tend to establish
                                                                                                                                               26


manufacturing firms in resource-based industries and support the development of corruption in Russia by

investing into corrupt Russian regions. On the contrary, genuine foreign investments seem to work against

the Dutch disease as they are more concentrated in manufacturing industries and regions with higher

educational potential of population but are not tied to resource abundant and corrupt Russian regions.
