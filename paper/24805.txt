Reimbursement Rates for Primary Care Services: Evidence of Spillover Effects to Behavioral
Health

                                         ABSTRACT

We study spillover effects from the largest increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates in the
history of the program for primary care services to behavioral health and healthcare outcomes;
mental illness, substance use disorders, and tobacco product use. Much of the variation in
Medicaid reimbursement rates we leverage is attributable to a large federally mandated increase
between 2013 and 2014. We apply differences-in-differences models to survey data specifically
designed to measure behavioral health outcomes over the period 2010 to 2016. We find that
higher primary care Medicaid reimbursement rates improve behavioral health outcomes among
enrollees. We find no evidence that behavioral healthcare service use is altered. Previous
economic research shows that the mandated boost increased office visits. Thus our results suggest
that primary care providers are efficient in improving behavioral health outcomes among
Medicaid enrollees. Given established shortages of behavioral health providers, these findings are
important from a healthcare workforce and policy perspective.

1. Introduction

         Provider participation in insurance markets is a critical component to healthcare access.

In mixed-economy markets public payers, on average, offer lower reimbursement rates than

other payers to providers for the same services (Sloan, Mitchell et al. 1978, Berman, Dolins et al.

2002). This disparity in reimbursement rates can discourage providers from participating in

public markets, which likely reduces access to care and the value of insurance for enrollees.

Within the United States imperfect provider participation in public markets is a long-standing

concern among health policymakers (Decker 2012). The problem is particularly severe in the

Medicaid market. Medicaid, a joint federal and state program, is the primary insurer of low-

income individuals in the U.S., covering 77 million adults and children in 2017 (Sommers and

Grabowski 2017). The program has historically offered substantially lower reimbursement rates

than private insurance and other forms of public insurance; e.g., Medicare 1 (Berman, Dolins et

al. 2002, Zuckerman and Goin 2012, Zuckerman, Skopec et al. 2014, Zuckerman, Skopec et al.

2017). As prima facie evidence that low reimbursement rates deter provider participation, in

2013 over 30% of physicians were not accepting new Medicaid patients (Hing, Decker et al.

2015). For comparison, 16% and 15% of physicians were not accepting new Medicare or private

insurance patients while 5% were not accepting any new patients

         To address limited provider participation, between 2013 and 2014 as part of the

Affordable Care Act (ACA) the U.S. federal government mandated, and fully financed, a

generous increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate for 146 primary care services. Qualifying

providers included family physicians, internists, and pediatricians, as well as other physicians

who demonstrated substantial delivery of primary care services to Medicaid patients. This

 Medicare is a federal public insurance system for older adults and adults (regardless of age) with a set of severe
medical conditions (e.g., end-stage renal disease),

                                                          3
mandate is referred to as the ‘Medicaid fee bump.’ The fee bump was not re-authorized by the

federal government and ended December 31st, 2014. Some states used their own funds to

continue reimbursing Medicaid services at the enhanced rate beyond 2014. Thus, the fee bump

policy offers substantial variation in Medicaid reimbursement rates, a large initial increase

followed by a steep decline for most states.

       The objective of the fee bump policy was to induce new primary care physicians to enter

the Medicaid market and to support previously participating physicians, and thus increase access

to care for Medicaid enrollees in advance of ACA implementation which involved a large-scale

increase in the number of individuals eligible for the program. The cost of the fee bump policy

to the federal government is estimated to be $7B to $12B (Medicaid and CHIP Payment and

Access Commission 2015). Hence, understanding the value of this policy is important.

       Several studies show that the fee bump increased access to primary care providers and

office visits, and improved health. We extend this literature to study potential spillover effects

from primary care to behavioral health and healthcare service use outcomes. To the best of our

knowledge, we are the first to study this question. In particular, we examine mental illness,

substance use disorders (SUD), tobacco product use, and related service use. To this end, we

leverage rich survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) between

2010 and 2016 coupled with a differences-in-differences (DD) style design. We exploit variation

in the size of the fee bump in each state depending on its’ pre-2013 rate. The NSDUH is

designed and administered by the federal government to provide official estimates of behavioral

health outcomes and service use within the U.S, making this dataset ideal for our study.

       Our extension to behavioral health is important for several reasons. First, the Medicaid

population has elevated rates of mental illness, SUDs, and tobacco product use and unmet needs



                                                 4
for treatment related to these outcomes (Busch, Meara et al. 2013, Creedon and Cook 2016,

DiGiulio, Haddix et al. 2016). Second, behavioral healthcare provider participation in Medicaid

is particularly scarce (Buck 2011, Bishop, Press et al. 2014) and there are overall shortages in

behavioral healthcare workers in the U.S. (Hyde 2013).

       Third, behavioral healthcare is increasingly being delivered in primary care settings, in

particular treatment for mental illness and SUDs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services

Administration 2016). For instance, psychotropic medications to treat mental illness (e.g.,

Xanax which is indicated for anxiety), medication-assisted therapies to treat SUDs (e.g.,

buprenorphine which is indicated for opioid use disorder [OUD]), and smoking cessation

medications (e.g., Zyban and Chanitx) can be prescribed by primary care physicians and are

effective (Cahill, Stevens et al. 2013, Murphy and Polsky 2016, Olfson 2016). Primary care is

defined as including ‘…health promotion, disease prevention, health maintenance, counselling,

patient education, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses in a variety of health

settings’ (American Academy of Family Physicians 2018), and thus can include management

and prevention of behavioral health conditions. Indeed, over 20% of primary care visits have a

mental health component (Cherry and Schappert 2014) which highlights the importance of

primary care for behavioral healthcare delivery. Several recent studies suggest that the ACA

Medicaid expansion, which raised eligibility through 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) in

participating states, substantially (22 to 70%) increased prescriptions for behavioral health

medications that are commonly prescribed by physicians in primary care settings (Maclean,

Carson et al. 2017, Maclean, Pesko et al. 2017, Maclean and Saloner 2017, Wen, Hockenberry et




                                                 5
al. 2017). These findings imply that there is plausibly pent up demand for behavioral healthcare

services among Medicaid enrollees. 2

        Several findings emerge from our analysis. First, we document that the Medicaid fee

bump led to improvements in mental illness, SUDs, and tobacco product use among Medicaid

enrollees. Second, we find no statistically significant evidence that behavioral healthcare service

use changed following the fee bump. Combining our findings of improved behavioral health

outcomes with previous economic research that documents increased office visits post-fee bump

and clinical studies establishing the effectiveness of primary care in treating behavioral health,

we hypothesize that primary care providers are efficient in producing better behavioral health

among Medicaid enrollees. Given established behavioral healthcare workforce shortages, our

findings are relevant from a health economic, industrial relations, and policy standpoint.

        The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 offers a discussion of the Medicaid fee bump

policy. Data, methods, and variables are reported in Section 3. Results are listed in Section 4.

Section 5 presents extensions and sensitivity analyses. Section 6 offers a discussion.

2. Related literature and background on the ACA-related Medicaid fee bump

2.1 Related literature

        Several studies suggest that the ACA fee bump raised Medicaid reimbursement rates

(Kirby 2017), increased primary care provider participation in Medicaid (Polsky, Richards et al.

2015), increased prenatal care utilization among Medicaid enrolled pregnant women (Li, Pesko

et al. 2018), and increased office visits and improved health outcomes among Medicaid enrollees

(Alexander and Schnell 2017). When the federal fee bump policy ended in December 2014,

Medicaid appointment availability declined in states that did not maintain the previously


2
 While we note that many behavioral health conditions cannot be ‘cured’, they can be effectively managed as is the
case for other chronic conditions; e.g., diabetes and heart disease (McLellan, Lewis et al. 2000).

                                                        6
mandated higher reimbursement rates (Candon, Zuckerman et al. 2018). However, one paper

suggests limited effects of the fee bump on physician participation in Medicaid (Decker 2016). 3

         More generally, several studies leveraging pre-fee bump data show that higher Medicaid

reimbursement rates or capitation payments for primary care services increased access to primary

care. For instance, boosts in the reimbursement rate increased provider acceptance of Medicaid

patients (Decker 2012) and appointment availability for enrollees (Sharma, Tinkler et al. 2018).

In addition to improved access to care, higher reimbursement rates increased the likelihood of

patients reporting that physicians ‘listened and explained things’, which plausibly captures

patient-assessed quality of care, among Medicaid enrollees (Shen and Zuckerman 2005).

         On the patient side, higher Medicaid reimbursement rates increased appointment uptake

(Decker 2009, Callison and Nguyen 2018), the likelihood of a usual source of care (Shen and

Zuckerman 2005), and having at least one physician or health professional visit in the past year

(Shen and Zuckerman 2005, Callison and Nguyen 2018). Further, enhanced reimbursement

improved pre-natal and infant health outcomes (Gray 2001, Sonchak 2015). Hahn (2013)

documents that higher reimbursement rates increased enrollment in public insurance among low

income children. This finding suggests that improved access to and/or quality of healthcare can

encourage program participation among eligible individuals.

         To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of the ACA-related

Medicaid reimbursement fee boost on behavioral health outcomes and only one study examined

the effect of pre-ACA rate increases on these outcomes. In an extension of the main analysis of

general healthcare services, Decker (2009) used Medicaid reimbursement state-level variation


3
 We note that increasing the number of physicians participating in Medicaid is not necessary to enhance access,
service use, or health outcomes. For instance, if the fee bump induced increased participation among incumbent
physicians (i.e., the intensive margin) and/or improved quality of care, then we would expect to observe increased
access and utilization, and improved health among enrollees.

                                                         7
from 1993 to 2003 and found that decreasing the primary care reimbursement rate from 100% to

64% of Medicare payments resulted in a 43% increase in major depressive episodes being treated

in hospital outpatient departments compared to a physician’s office. While this study is both

important and interesting, it did not explore the effect of Medicaid reimbursement rates on the

overall amount of behavioral healthcare utilization and instead focused on treatment setting for

one condition. There are important differences across major classes of mental illness, SUDs, and

tobacco products in terms of propensity to seek treatment overall and in primary care settings

specifically (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017). Further, there have been

major advancements in behavioral healthcare treatment from the 1990s to the 2010s, in particular

for medication prescribing in primary care settings. Perhaps most importantly, the previous

study did not investigate the effect of reimbursement rates on behavioral health outcomes.

2.2 Medicaid reimbursement rates

           Medicaid has historically reimbursed providers at a lower rate than any other insurer. For

instance, in 2012 the fee-for-service Medicaid reimbursement rate for primary care services

averaged 59% of Medicare 4 rates (Zuckerman and Goin 2012). Moreover, there has been

substantial heterogeneity across states in reimbursement rates. In 2012, 5 state Medicaid

programs reimbursed primary care services at less than 50% of the Medicare rate and 35 states

reimbursed at less than 75% (Zuckerman and Goin 2012).

           Lack of provider participation in Medicaid was a major concern among policymakers in

the lead up to the ACA. As noted earlier, a core provision of the ACA was to expand Medicaid

eligibility to non-disabled and childless adults with incomes through 138% of the FPL. Pre-

ACA simulations predicted that this expansion would increase Medicaid enrollment by roughly

    Medicare regulations, including reimbursement rates, are set at the national level.

17M or 6.3% (Buettgens and Holahan 2010). 5 Section 1202 of the ACA required states to set

Medicaid fee-for-service reimbursement rates for 146 primary care services at least at parity with

Medicare in 2013 and 2014 (Tollen 2015). 6 The federal government financed the full amount of

the Medicaid reimbursement rate increase over this period. The objective of this policy was to

encourage primary care providers to participate, or increase participation, in Medicaid prior to

the major 2014 expansion of this program. While the reimbursement rate increase was effective

January 1st, 2013, the federal government did not release final guidance to state Medicaid

programs until November 2012 (Tollen 2015). 7 The delayed federal guidance led some states to

pay physicians retrospectively. The federal government was not able to re-authorize the fee

bump beyond December 31st, 2014. In January 2015, only 16 states and DC used their own

funds to continue to finance the enhanced reimbursement rates (Tollen 2015).

        Services subject to the ACA Medicaid fee bump policy included Evaluation &

Management (E&M) codes 99201 through 99449 in the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding

System (HCPCS) (Tollen 2015). These codes include primary care office visits, hospital visits,

and select vaccine administration codes. Importantly, the targeted E&M code range includes a

set of primary care services that are important in Medicaid but not reimbursed by Medicare.

Specifically, affected codes include new patient/initial comprehensive preventive medicine,

established patient/periodic comprehensive preventive medicine, counseling risk factor reduction

and behavioral change intervention, and E&M/non face-to-face physician services (Kaiser

Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2012).

  This estimate is for both Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
6
  Managed care plans often receive monthly capitation payments based on what states would have paid for care on a
fee-for-service basis (Zuckerman and Goin 2012), Thus, the fee-for-service reimbursement ratio that we use should
proxy managed care payments as well as fee-for-service payments.
7
  The delay in payments is attributed to difficulties in applying the fee bump to managed care Medicaid and the fact
that providers had to declare that they met requirements and these declarations had to be confirmed. Further, final
guidance from the federal government was issued less than two months of the effective date.

                                                         9
       Many of these services are plausibly related to behavioral healthcare. For instance, the

HCPCS for smoking cessation counselling are 99406 and 99407 (Centers for Medicare Medicaid

Services 2003). Preventive medicine codes 99381 to 99397 include ‘counseling/anticipatory

guidance/risk factor reduction interventions’ and thus can include counselling services for

behavioral health more broadly (e.g., screeners for depression and anxiety, and problematic

alcohol use or psychoactive drug use). Finally, improvements in general health (affected codes

clearly cover related services) can indirectly improve behavioral health.

       Appendix Table 1 reports the average Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement ratio in 2012

and the increase in this ratio that was induced by the fee bump policy for the period 2013 to

2014. There was a wide range of variation in the 2012 ratio across states, and hence the intensity

of fee bump policy. For instance, in 2012 the lowest ratio was 0.34 (Rhode Island) and the

highest ratio was 1.37 (North Dakota), with 2 states reimbursing Medicaid at or above the

Medicare rate (and hence receiving no federal funds for reimbursement rate increases). We

leverage this variation in our empirical models to identify fee bump effects.

       Increasing reimbursement rates to induce providers to participate in Medicaid is well

founded in standard economic theory of physician behavior. The seminal Sloan, Mitchell et al.

(1978) model describes the behavior of physicians operating in a mixed-payer market. In this

model, there are three types of patients that can be selected by providers based on their

reimbursement rates: privately insured (who are assumed to offer the highest reimbursement

rate), Medicaid patients, and uninsured patients (who are assumed to offer the lowest

reimbursement rates). The model abstracts from other forms of public insurance for tractability.

Physicians chose to participate in specific markets based on their marginal cost curves.

Physicians with the lowest marginal cost curves will participate in all three markets while those



                                                10
with the highest marginal cost curves will participate in the private market only. Physicians with

intermediate marginal cost curves will participate in the private and public markets.

           We can use insight from the Sloan model to predict how the fee bump policy will

influence physician participation in Medicaid. 8 Increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates will

make participating in Medicaid relatively more attractive for all physicians. However, the higher

rates will only induce changes in market participation for a sub-set of physicians; i.e., those

physicians on the margin of participating pre-policy. Some physicians who only participated in

the private market pre-Medicaid fee increase will opt to enter the Medicaid market when

reimbursement rates increase. Further, some incumbent physicians, participating only the private

and Medicaid markets or all three markets, will increase the number of Medicaid patients they

treat post-policy. We expect this increased participation by new and incumbent physicians to

improve access to primary care services and behavioral health among Medicaid enrollees. 9

3. Data, variables, and methods

3.1 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)

           Our primary dataset is the NSDUH. We use data from 2010 to 2016 and thus consider

periods before, during, and after the large federally mandated fee bump policy was effective.

The NSDUH is a large-scale survey dataset administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental

Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) which is used to produce the primary official

estimates of behavioral health in the U.S. (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality

2016). Indeed, the NSDUH is the largest behavioral health survey in the U.S.

           The NSDUH is a survey of individuals aged 12 or older in non-institutional settings and

is designed to be representative at the national and state level. Each year, the NSDUH surveys

    We note that we cannot test predictions from the Sloan model in our survey data.
9
    The Sloan model predicts the opposite pattern of results when the fee bump policy ends.

                                                          11
approximately 70,000 U.S. residents. The NSDUH contains items specifically designed to

measure behavioral health and healthcare utilization. Further, these data are commonly used by

economists to study behavioral health outcomes (Zarkin, French et al. 1998, Wen, Hockenberry

et al. 2015, Carpenter, McClellan et al. 2017, McClellan 2017, Alpert, Powell et al. 2018, Evans,

Lieber et al. 2018). We use the restricted access NSDUH with geographic identifiers which

allow us to link each state’s Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement ratio to the data. Following

NSDUH guidelines for use of the restricted data, all sample sizes are rounded to the nearest 100.

       We exclude Tennessee as this state did not a have fee-for-service Medicaid program over

our study period. Hence we cannot calculate a fee-for-service fee bump ratio for this state. We

note our inability to study Tennessee as a limitation. We retain respondents ages 19 to 64 years

old enrolled in Medicaid; NSDUH records insurance coverage at the survey interview.

3.2 Outcome variables

       We consider three measures of behavioral health and two measures of related healthcare

utilization. Our measures of behavioral health are indicators for a mental illness in the past year,

an SUD in the past year, and any tobacco product (tobacco cigarettes, smokeless tobacco [i.e.,

snuff, dip, chewing tobacco, or ‘snus’], cigars, or pipe tobacco) use in the past 30 days. Broadly,

the mental illness and SUD indicators are based on screeners used to capture individuals at

elevated risk for these conditions in survey settings. Tobacco product use captures self-reported

utilization of these products. Full details on the construction of these variables can be found in

the NSDUH Methodological Summary Report (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics Quality

2016). The validity of these measures in has been established by NSDUH administrators and

epidemiologists (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics Quality 2016).




                                                 12
        Our measures of behavioral healthcare are any mental illness treatment in the past year

and any SUD treatment in the past year. An important caveat to these measures is that they

reflect any type of care that a patient may perceive as behavioral healthcare; regardless of

whether or not such care was provided by physician affected by the fee bump, some other

provider, or informal care (e.g., self-help addiction treatment, or religious counselling). A

limitation of the NSDUH for our study is that the survey does not collect information on

smoking cessation treatment utilization.10 11

3.3 Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio

        For each year between 2010 and 2016, we construct annual, state-level primary care fee-

for-service Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratios using data from various think tank

reports (Zuckerman and Goin 2012, Smith, Gifford et al. 2015, Zuckerman, Skopec et al.

2017). 12 The Medicaid-to-Medicare fee index measures the ratio of each state’s average

Medicaid fee for primary care services to the Medicare fee for the same service. For each state,

these fee ratios are averaged across major primary care procedure codes, such as procedure codes

for new or established patient visits. Procedure codes are weighted by the share of total U.S.

Medicaid spending across the surveyed procedure. Previous studies have also used the ratio in

health and healthcare analyses (Decker 2009, Decker 2012, Polsky, Richards et al. 2015,

Callison and Nguyen 2018, Candon, Zuckerman et al. 2018, Li, Pesko et al. 2018).




10
   We note the possibility that some respondents may include tobacco cessation treatment with SUD treatment,
either because some respondents view tobacco as a substance or because many SUD treatment facilities offer
smoking cessation services (Friedmann, Jiang et al. 2008).
11
   There are some differences in respondent non-response rates across outcome variables. Hence, sample sizes vary.
12
   For 2015 values, we use data collected by Zuckerman, Skopec et al. (2017), unless Smith, Gifford et al. (2015)
note that the fee bump remained fully in place in 2015, in which case we use 100% for these states. For 2010 and
2011 values, we linearly impute Medicaid reimbursement ratios between 2008 and 2012 using data collected by
Zuckerman and Goin (2012). More details are available on request.

                                                       13
         The intensity of the federally mandated increase in Medicaid reimbursement rates

between 2013 and 2014 is determined by states’ pre-2013 ratio. Put differently, states with

relatively low Medicaid reimbursement rates vis-à-vis Medicare pre-2013 experienced a

comparatively large boost in the ratio over the period 2013 to 2014. The median increase

attributable to the fee bump was 30 percentage points (p.p.) between 2012 and 2013; with a

minimum of 0 p.p. and a maximum of 66 p.p. Similarly, the decline in Medicaid reimbursement

rates in 2015 (as the mandate was not re-authorized) was determined by states’ discretion in fee

rate setting. The median decline in the ratio between 2014 and 2015 was 29.5 p.p.

         The ‘look back’ period of our outcome variables is the past year or the past 30 days. 13

The NSDUH provides the exact date on which a respondent completed the survey. We use

survey date information to construct a past year moving average of the reimbursement rate. 14

         Although there were some delays in fee bump payment to physicians in early 2013, we

follow Alexander and Schnell (2017) and do not incorporate such delays into our matching of the

fee bump to the NSDUH data, besides using the look back period matching described above.

This decision is based on the assumption that affected physicians expected to receive payments

in the future from Medicaid. 15 However, we show that our results are robust to dropping year

2013 (the time period in which the enhanced rates were paid retrospectively).

3.4 State-level control variables




13
   We note that our tobacco product use variable has a 30 day look back period. Tobacco product use is a stock
variable determined by flows into (initiation) and out of (cessation) product use. We expect that in our sample of
adults cessation is the most likely flow variable as most tobacco product initiation occurs before age 18. Cessation
is a time-intensive activity and thus we argue that using the12 month moving average for the fee bump variable,
rather than more immediate measure, is reasonable.
14
   More specifically, we construct an average of the fee bump ratio in the survey month and the 11 months prior to
the interview. For instance, if a respondent was interviewed in January 2012, we calculate the average fee bump
over the period February 2011 through January 2012. More details available on request.
15
   Indeed, slow payments are commonly reported by physicians who treat Medicaid patients (Rosenbaum 2014).

                                                         14
           To minimize omitted variable bias, we control for several state-level variables in our

regressions that plausibly predict both behavioral health outcomes and the Medicaid-to-Medicare

fee ratio in a state. These variables are merged into the NSDUH from external sources on state

and year. First, we control for the state unemployment rate. Second, we account for state

policies plausibly related to behavioral health outcomes: tobacco cigarette tax per pack,

indicators for an e-cigarette tax and an e-cigarette public use ban (Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention 2018), 16 a prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) (Ali, Dowd et al.

2017), and a medical marijuana law (Sabia and Nguyen 2016). Finally, we include an indicator

for ACA-related Medicaid expansion following Maclean, Pesko et al. (2017). Inclusion of a

Medicaid expansion control is particularly important as this policy may have altered the

composition of enrollees. We examine this question further in robustness checks.

3.5 Empirical model

           We apply the differences-in-differences (DD) regression model outlined in Equation (1):

(1)         𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 = 𝜶𝜶𝟎𝟎 + 𝜶𝜶𝟏𝟏 𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓_𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜶𝜶′𝟐𝟐 𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜶𝜶′𝟑𝟑 𝑿𝑿𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚 + 𝜽𝜽𝒔𝒔 + 𝝉𝝉𝒚𝒚 +

𝜼𝜼𝒎𝒎 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚

           𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 is a behavioral health outcome for individual i in state s in year y and month m.

𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓_𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 is the 12-month moving average Medicaid-to-Medicare

reimbursement fee ratio in state s in year y and month m, which is heavily influenced by the

Medicaid fee bump in 2013 and 2014, and whether this policy was continued or not. 𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 is a

vector of individual characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, and marital status) and

𝑿𝑿𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚 is a vector of state level characteristics. 𝜽𝜽𝒔𝒔 , 𝝉𝝉𝒚𝒚 , and 𝜼𝜼𝒎𝒎 are vectors of state, year, and month


16
  States that have implemented an e-cigarette tax have done so in different ways. E.g., ad valorem or value-added
tax. To the best of our knowledge, there is no standardized approach to classifying e-cigarette taxes at this time.
Hence, we simply code states as implementing or not implementing such a tax.

                                                                     15
fixed effects. These fixed effects capture time-invariant state characteristics, factors that affect

the nation as a whole, and seasonality in behavioral health respectively. 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 is the error term.

We cluster standard errors around the state (Bertrand, Duflo et al. 2004) and apply NSDUH

survey weights. We estimate logit models and report estimates of average marginal effects.

3.6 Internal validity

        A necessary assumption for a DD model to recover causal estimates is that the treatment

and the comparison groups would have followed the same trend in outcomes in the post-

treatment period, had the treatment group not been treated. Our empirical specification is a

variant of the canonical DD as our treatment, the Medicaid-to-Medicare ratio, is a continuous

variable rather than an indicator. To provide some evidence as to whether or not parallel trends

exist, we classify states as ‘large’ and ‘small’ fee bump states depending on if they have above or

below the median increase in the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio of 30% between

2012 and 2013. 17 We first examine unadjusted trends in the pre-treatment period in our outcome

variables for large and small fee bump states. If outcomes appear to have trended similarly in

states that experienced large and small increases in the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee

ratio, then this pattern would provide evidence that the parallel trends assumption has been met

in the NSDUH data and support the validity of our design.

        Our second approach to explore the parallel trends assumption is to use data prior to the

fee bump (2010-2012) to estimate Equation (2):

(2)     𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 = 𝜸𝜸𝟎𝟎 + 𝜸𝜸𝟏𝟏 𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒔𝒔 ∗ 𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒚𝒚 + 𝜸𝜸′𝟐𝟐 𝑷𝑷𝒊𝒊,𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜸𝜸′𝟑𝟑 𝑿𝑿𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚 + 𝜽𝜽𝒔𝒔 + 𝝉𝝉𝒚𝒚 + 𝜼𝜼𝒎𝒎 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚

This equation is similar to Equation (1) with the exception that we replace the Medicaid-to-

Medicare reimbursement fee ratio with an interaction between the large fee bump state indicator


17
  Large fee bump states are: AL, AR, CA, FL, GA, HI, IL, IN, MA, MD, ME, MI, MO, NH, NJ, NV, NY, OH, PA,
RI, SD, TX, WA, and WI.

                                                                   16
and a linear time trend (𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒍𝒔𝒔 ∗ 𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒚𝒚 ). 18 If we cannot reject the null hypothesis that 𝛾𝛾1 is

zero, then this finding provides further support that the NSDUH can satisfy the parallel trends

assumption. To avoid difficulties in interpreting interaction terms in non-linear models

(Popovici, Maclean et al. 2018), we estimate Equation (2) with a linear probability model. 19

4. Results

4.1 Summary statistics

         Table 1 reports summary statistics for the 2010 to 2012 pre-ACA fee bump period for

Medicaid recipients. 30.8% and 11.6% of the sample met criteria for mental illness and an SUD

in the past year, respectively, while 41.6% used a tobacco product in the past 30 days. 20 In terms

of past year behavioral healthcare utilization, 23.4% reported any mental illness treatment and

4.5% reported any SUD treatment. The mean Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio

was 0.73 (compared to a median value of 0.70; not reported but available on request).

         Figure 1 reports the average, maximum, and minimum Medicaid-to-Medicare

reimbursement fee ratio over our study period. Prior to 2013 the average ratio was relatively

low, however in 2013 the fee bump-attributable boost is evident with the average ratio increasing

from 70.9% in 2012 to 101.3% in 2013. Similarly, the sharp decline in the fee bump in 2015 is




18
   This trend takes the value of 1 in January 2010, 2 in February 2010, 3 in March 2010, and so forth.
19
   A limitation of our explorations of internal validity is that both our ‘treatment’ (large fee bump) and ‘comparison’
(small fee bump) groups were both treated by the policy. The intuition of our testing is that effects should be more
substantial in states that experienced a larger ‘dose’ of the fee bump policy (i.e. the large fee bump state group).
However, we note that there is a monotonicity assumption that underlies this testing, that is the effects of the policy
increase with the size of the fee bump. This assumption may be violated due to physician or patient attributes and
preferences, features of healthcare delivery systems, patient health needs, and so forth. Thus, we interpret our
findings based on these analyses with some caution.
20
   We note that the share of the sample reporting any tobacco use is somewhat higher than the national average
cigarette smoking rate over our stud period, roughly 20% (National Center for Health Statistics 2017). However,
tobacco product use is more common among Medicaid enrollees, and our measure of tobacco product use is more
comprehensive than standard measures that capture only tobacco cigarette use.

                                                          17
evident as the federal mandate was not continued by the majority of states. The average rate

continued to decline through 2016 (the last year of our study period).

4.2 Internal validity

       Trend analyses of our outcomes are reported in Figures 2 to 6 for large and small fee

bump states. With the possible exception of SUD treatment, which is a relatively rare outcome

(4.5% of the sample reports this outcome) and appears noisy in the graphs, these figures show

similar trends over the period 2010 to 2012.

       We report regression-based parallel trends testing in Tables 2 (outcomes) and 3

(utilization). We cannot reject the null hypothesis that 𝛾𝛾1 = 0 in any of the five regressions.

Indeed, the coefficient estimates on the interaction between the large fee bump indicator and

time trend are small in magnitude and statistically indistinguishable from zero.

4.3 Behavioral health outcomes

       Table 4 reports fee bump regression results for behavioral health outcomes. We measure

reimbursement rates with the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio. Thus, our estimates capture the

effect of increasing this ratio from 57.2% to 100% (42.8 p.p.), which corresponds to the increase

from the average fee ratio among large fee bump states prior to the fee bump policy to Medicare

parity. For brevity, we refer to this change in the ratio as the ‘average increase’.

       We find that the average increase in the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio leads to a 2.9 p.p.

decrease in mental illness (9.7%; all relative effect sizes are calculated by comparing the

marginal effect estimate with the sample proportion prior to the fee bump), a 1.7 p.p. decrease in

SUD treatment (15.2%), and a 2.4 p.p. decrease in tobacco product use (6.0%).

       Our relative effects are somewhat large in size because the baseline proportions for some

of our outcomes are relatively small and we focus on a sample (Medicaid enrollees) with



                                                 18
elevated prevalence of behavioral health conditions. Finally, we consider an arguably non-trivial

treatment ‘dose’ (i.e., increasing the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio from 57.2% to 100%).

4.4 Behavioral healthcare outcomes

        Estimates of the effect of raising the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratio on

behavioral healthcare use are reported in Table 5. As noted earlier, NSDUH only allows us to

study mental illness and SUD treatment use. We find no statistically significant evidence that

increasing the ratio changes utilization of these services.

5. Extensions and sensitivity analyses

        We next report from extensions and additional analyses.

5.1 Effects on coverage

        We next explore whether the fee bump had any effect on the probability of Medicaid

coverage. We focus on a sample with family income less than 400% of the FPL to examine a

group that is plausibly eligible for Medicaid. 21 Information on insurance status in the NSDUH to

construct an indicator variable for Medicaid coverage. Increased ability to access providers, or

to receive higher quality care, may induce some Medicaid-eligible individuals to enroll in the

program (Hahn 2013). On the supply side, providers, when faced with a higher reimbursement

rate, may be more likely to enroll eligible uninsured patients in Medicaid. Finally, for some

privately insured patients who are eligible, higher quality Medicaid coverage may induce them to

drop private coverage and take up Medicaid (‘crowd out’) (Cutler and Gruber 1996). Further,

from a purely empirical standpoint, we define our sample based on Medicaid enrollment. If our

treatment variable influences the probability of Medicaid coverage, then we are selecting our

sample on an endogenous variable which can lead to bias (Angrist and Pischke 2009).


21
 We could have chosen a lower income threshold but we are concerned that individuals may target income to gain
Medicaid eligibility (Hamersma 2013).

                                                      19
         We report results in Table 6. We find no statistically significant evidence that the

Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio predicts the probability of Medicaid coverage. 22 This null

finding suggests that our treatment variable does not alter the composition of our sample and we

are not selecting the sample on an endogenous variable.

5.2 Alternative measures of behavioral healthcare service use

         Our measures of behavioral healthcare treatment capture any service use related to

behavioral health. However, these measures may not reflect improvements in the quality or

appropriateness of behavioral healthcare services that could have been induced by the fee bump

policy. To probe deeper into changes in other dimensions of behavioral healthcare service use

following the fee-bump, we consider proxies for perceived adequacy of care. To this end, we

use indicators for past year perceived unmet need for mental illness and SUD treatment. 23 These

measures capture broader concepts of acceptable/appropriate care from the patient’s perspective

that may be missed through the use of simple indicators for receiving any care. For instance,

seeing a physician but not feeling that the visit adequately treated healthcare needs would be

incorporated in a measure of any care receipt but, perhaps, not a measure of unmet need for care.

Utilization of healthcare could also paradoxically increase unmet need if it makes patients aware

of new diagnoses for which they are not immediately receiving desired treatment and/or




22
   We have also confirmed these findings in the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is a much larger
survey than the NSDUH, roughly three million respondents per year, and is designed to provide accurate estimates
of insurance outcomes. This survey does not record behavioral health outcomes or service use. Results are
comparable and available on request. Interesting, in the NSDUH (but not in the ACS) we find some evidence that
increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates raises the probability that a respondent is uninsured at the time of the
survey. We find no evidence for changes in private coverage. We are uncertain as to the mechanism that may lead
to this counter-intuitive finding for uninsurance status.
23
   Specific question wording for unmet mental illness treatment need is ‘Felt a perceived need for mental health
treatment/counseling that was not received.’ Specific question wording for unmet SUD treatment need is ‘Felt a
need for illicit drug or alcohol treatment or felt need for additional illicit drug or alcohol treatment in past year’.

                                                          20
improved knowledge of healthcare and health generally. Thus, the extent to which the fee bump

policy affects perceived unmet need is ex ante ambiguous.

       Results are reported in Table 7. We find no statistically significant evidence that the

Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio predicts the probability of either of these outcomes. The null

findings could reflect patients switching from specialty care to primary care as higher

reimbursement rates afford better access. Indeed, many patients report that they would prefer to

receive care in general healthcare settings rather than through the specialty behavioral healthcare

delivery system (Boone, Brown et al. 2004).

5.3 Alternative time horizons

       We next explore the robustness of our findings across various time horizons.

Specifically, we (i) drop 2013 (the year in which enhanced reimbursement rates were delayed to

some extent) and (ii) drop 2015-2016 (the period following the federal mandate for parity

between Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates for the 146 targeted services). Results are

reported in Tables 8A (outcomes) and 8B (service use). In terms of our behavioral health

measures, while we lose precision in some specifications (which is not surprising as we have less

variation with which to identify treatment effects), the direction and magnitude of the

relationship between the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio and outcomes is the same. Turning to

behavioral healthcare service use and in line with our preferred time period, none of the

coefficient estimates are statistically different from zero.

5.4 Alternative controls for between-state heterogeneity, weighting, and functional form

       Tables 9A and 9B show results generated in models that (i) include state-specific linear

time trends, (ii) exclude all individual and time-varying state-level controls, (iii) remove sample

weights, and (iv) apply a linear probability model. We note that there is some difficulty in



                                                  21
interpreting coefficients generated in non-linear models with different sets of controls (Norton

2012, Maclean, Webber et al. 2014), which is a study limitation.

        While we lose statistical significance in some specifications for behavioral health

outcomes (Table 9A), the direction and magnitude of our effect sizes are broadly comparable in

these sensitivity checks vis-à-vis our main specifications. Turning to our behavioral healthcare

utilization variables (Table 9B), as is the case in our preferred specification, no coefficient

estimates are statistically different from zero.

5.5 Heterogeneity by ACA-related Medicaid expansion status

        Medicaid expansion, among the 31 states and the District of Columbia that adopted this

policy by the end of our study period (January 2016), substantially increased the number of

program enrollees (Frean, Gruber et al. 2017). 24 Moreover, this expansion plausibly altered the

composition of Medicaid enrollees. For instance, pre-Medicaid expansion simulations suggested

that the newly eligible had higher rates of SUDs and greater unmet need for SUD treatment than

previously eligible populations (Garfield, Zuvekas et al. 2011, Busch, Meara et al. 2013).

Further, capacity may be particularly strained within expansion states as Medicaid rolls increased

substantially. However, in Section 5.1 we found no statistically significant evidence that the fee

bump, our treatment variable, lead to changes in the probability of enrollment conditioning on

Medicaid expansion and other factors.

        We dig deeper into these issues by stratifying our sample based on Medicaid expansion

status by January 2016. The sample of expansion states is subject to increased enrollment and

compositional shift while the samples of non-expansion states is less vulnerable to these factors

and may allow us to more cleanly identify fee bump effects. However, we note that ACA-related


24
  We note that, at the time of writing Maine and Virginia have passed legislation designed to expand Medicaid. To
the best of our knowledge, no implementation dates for these expansions have been set.

                                                       22
changes lead to other groups enrolling in Medicaid; i.e., welcome mat effects and changes in

Modified Adjusted Gross Income. Hence, non-expansion states may have been subject to similar

changes although we argue that any changes are likely smaller in non-expansion states.

       Results from this analysis are reported in Table 10A (outcomes) and 10B (service use).

While we lose precision across the subsamples (which naturally rely on less variation in the

Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio), the direction of magnitude and direction of the effects are

broadly comparable across expansion and non-expansion states. However, in terms of

behavioral healthcare service use, we find some evidence that mental illness treatment declined

in non-expansion states as the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio increased.

5.6 Heterogeneity by sex

       There are well-established differences in both behavioral health and service use. Women

are more likely to experience mental illness and are more likely to use both general and

behavioral healthcare services than men, while men are more likely to use substances (Center for

Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

2017). Given these differences across men and women, we explore heterogeneity in the

Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio across gender. Results are reported in Tables 11A and 11B.

       The fee bump has differential effects across sex in terms of behavioral health outcomes.

Increases in the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio lead to reductions in mental illness among

women, and SUDs and tobacco product use among men. Turning to measures of service use, we

observe no statistically significant evidence that women experience changes in behavioral

healthcare service use when the Medicaid-to-Medicare ratio increases. However, among men,

we document that increases in this ratio leads to a decrease in SUD treatment. One possible

explanation for this counter-intuitive finding is that men, who are more likely to be diagnosed



                                                23
with OUD (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017) which can be treated in

primary care office-based settings, substitute specialty care for primary care treatment.

5.7 Alternative samples based on income and insurance coverage

       We next test for spillovers to higher income groups following Alexander and Schnell

(2017). In particular we select a group of respondents that is unlikely to be Medicaid eligible at

any point over our study period (i.e., before or after the ACA Medicaid expansion): adults with

family incomes >400% FPL. Individuals with this income level are above all state Medicaid

thresholds for all years of our study (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured 2017).

On the one hand, capacity constraints (e.g., a physician can only work so many hours per day) or

income effects (e.g., higher income from Medicaid patients may lead some physicians to reduce

overall work time) may lead to worse care and outcomes for higher income patients through

reduced access and/or quality. On the other hand, previous work suggests spillovers across

patients with different insurance coverage within a practice (Glied and Zivin 2002, Finkelstein

2007, Glied and Hong 2018). For instance, increased delivery of targeted services (e.g.,

behavioral health counselling services) may lead to increases in these services for all patients

regardless of insurance status. Hence, the effects on non-targeted patients is ex ante ambiguous.

       Results are reported in the top panels of Tables 12A (outcomes) and 12B (service use).

While there are numerous hypotheses that suggest changes in our behavioral health outcomes

among higher income groups not likely eligible for Medicaid, we find no statistically significant

evidence that the outcomes are affected. We note that our null findings are in line with findings

for general healthcare services (Alexander and Schnell 2017).

       Medicaid coverage is likely reported with error by some respondents (Lo Sasso and

Buchmueller 2004, Kolstad and Kowalski 2012). To probe the sensitivity of our results (which



                                                 24
are based on a sample of reported Medicaid enrollees), we next expand our analysis sample to

include NSDUH respondents who report Medicaid or Medicare coverage (Hamersma and

Maclean 2018). Results are reported in the bottom panels of Tables 12A (outcomes) and 12B

(service use), and are very similar to our main findings. We interpret these findings to suggest

that our main results cannot be fully explained by reporting error in Medicaid enrollment.

5.8 Event-study design

           A standard concern in analyses of healthcare policies is that changes in outcomes prompt

decision makers to implement policies. In other words, healthcare policy evaluation may be

vulnerable to reverse-causality at the state-level. To explore this possibility we estimate an

event-study design in the spirit of Autor (2003). We use the large fee bump indicator (see

Section 3.5) and estimate Equation (3):

(3) 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚 = 𝜸𝜸𝟎𝟎 + ∑2011                                           2016                                            ′
                            𝑗𝑗=2010 𝜹𝜹𝒋𝒋 (𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑠,𝑗𝑗 = 1) + ∑𝑗𝑗=2013 𝝆𝝆𝒋𝒋 (𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑠,𝑗𝑗 = 1) + 𝜸𝜸𝟏𝟏 𝑷𝑷𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚 +


𝜸𝜸′𝟐𝟐 𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊.𝒔𝒔,𝒚𝒚,𝒎𝒎 + 𝜽𝜽𝒔𝒔 + 𝝉𝝉𝒚𝒚 + 𝜼𝜼𝒎𝒎 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑦𝑦,𝑚𝑚

The reference period in the event-study design is the year prior to the federally mandated fee

increased (2012). The vector 𝝆𝝆𝒋𝒋 reflects the effect of the fee increase in the post-mandate period

while the vector 𝜹𝜹𝒋𝒋 captures effects prior to the mandate. Studying estimates of pre-mandate

effects allow us to examine anticipatory behaviors and probe parallel trends after conditioning on

covariates. Results are reported in Tables 13A (outcomes) and 13B (service use).

           The coefficient estimates on the lead variables are imprecise which provides additional

support for the hypothesis that the NSDUH data satisfy parallel trends. However, turning to the

lag estimates, we lose power to detect effects except for a 5.7 p.p. decrease in mental illness.

Coefficient estimates for tobacco use in 2013 and 2014 are also large in magnitude but not

statistically different from zero, potentially because the event study does not provide sufficient


                                                                  25
power to detect even sizable increases in the post period. Moreover, as noted in Section 3.6,

both the large and small fee-bump states were treated by the policy. We suspect that a ‘treated’

comparison group may attenuate effects in the post-period. However, it is reassuring that our

event studies do not reveal evidence of differential pre-trends across groups.

5.9 Utilization of general healthcare services

       We next focus on a broader set of general services to further examine the extent to which

primary care can improve behavioral health; either as a substitute for specialty or informal care

and/or addressing unmet need for care. We consider the following past year outcomes: the

number of outpatient visits, the number of emergency department (ED) episodes, and the number

of hospitalizations. However, outpatient visit information, an important location in which

primary care services targeted by the fee bump are likely to be delivered, is only available from

2013 onward in the NSDUH. Thus, we cannot leverage the large variation driven by the fee

bump between 2012 and 2013 and earlier (smaller) within state changes. We apply Poisson

models given that the outcomes are counts. We convert beta coefficients to average marginal

effects. Results are reported in Table 14.

       We find no evidence that changes in the Medicaid-to-Medicare fee ratio leads to changes

in the number of office visits or the number of ED episodes. However, we do find that the

average increase in this ratio leads to 0.7 fewer hospital admissions in the past year. We have

also estimated logit models in which the outcomes are indicators for using any of these services

in the past year and results (available on request) are similar.

6. Discussion

       In this study we examine the effects of federal mandate that substantially increased

Medicaid reimbursement rates for a range of common primary care services. The rate boost



                                                  26
attributable to the policy we study is the largest federal increase within Medicaid; with pre-

mandate estimates suggesting that this policy would increase Medicaid rates by 73% (Zuckerman

and Goin 2012). Previous work had documented that this mandate was effective in increasing

Medicaid reimbursement rates, induced providers to participate in Medicaid, and increased use

of primary care visits and improved health among Medicaid enrollees (Polsky, Richards et al.

2015, Alexander and Schnell 2017, Kirby 2017, Li, Pesko et al. 2018). Our contribution to this

literature is to test for spillover effects to behavioral health outcomes and service use. To the

best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this question. Given the ability of primary care

providers to cost-effectively treat behavioral health conditions (e.g., prescribing medications,

patient education, counselling services, disease management) (American Academy of Family

Physicians 2018), testing for such spillovers is important.

       We show that the mandated increase in primary care reimbursement rates within

Medicaid had positive spillovers to behavioral health outcomes: mental illness, substance use

disorders (SUD), and tobacco product use. Following the fee boost, behavioral health outcomes

improved while behavioral health service use was not altered. Interestingly, our results may

imply that primary care is efficient in delivering services to Medicaid enrollees that improve

behavioral health, perhaps more efficiently than specialty care; where a substantial amount of

behavioral health, particularly SUD, treatment has been delivered historically (Substance Abuse

and Mental Health Services Administration 2016).

       Given established workforce shortages within the behavioral healthcare delivery system,

this finding is important as it suggests a feasible approach to addressing the behavioral healthcare

needs of Medicaid enrollees (Rosenbaum 2014). Further, patients who are reluctant to seek care

within the specialty delivery system may be more willing to receive treatment in non-specialty



                                                 27
settings such as primary care physicians’ offices (Boone, Brown et al. 2004). Allowing patients

to receive care in their preferred setting may, over time, allow for better treatment and in turn

outcomes. Indeed, an objective of the ACA was to better integrate behavioral health, in

particular SUD treatment, into general healthcare delivery (McLellan and Woodworth 2014).

       In extensions to the main analyses, we show that the fee bump had differential effects

across states that did and did not expand Medicaid with the ACA, and men and women. Further,

we find no statistically significant evidence that the fee bump led to changes in the probability of

Medicaid coverage. Hence, the value of better access to care and/or higher quality care was not

sufficient to lead individuals to enroll in Medicaid. Finally, we note that the temporary nature of

the fee policy may have muted such effects. Policies that permanently increase Medicaid

reimbursement rates may have larger effects on outcomes.

       The policy we study increased physician reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients

(albeit temporarily for many states). Low reimbursement rates have long been cited as a barrier

for participation in the program by physicians but increasing these rates is costly and politically

difficult. However, there are other aspects of treating Medicaid patients that may deter physician

participation in this market. For instance, physicians report that the administrative burdens (e.g.,

filling out numerous documents), delays in payment, and complex caseloads are barriers to

Medicaid participation (Rosenbaum 2014). If enhanced funding for elevated Medicaid

reimbursement rates is not feasible, either financially or politically, then policymakers may wish

to consider targeting other commonly cited barriers to program participation by providers. While

altering the health status of Medicaid enrollees is likely beyond the scope of near-term policies,

reducing administrative burdens and/or ensuring timely payments to physicians may be more

feasible. Providers consider both the costs and returns to treating patients. Hence both of these



                                                 28
objects could be targeted by policies and, in turn, potentially increase the number of providers

participating in Medicaid.

        While we emphasize the direct role of obtaining more (or any) primary care services

within a group of patients with established healthcare access challenges in improving behavioral

health, other mechanisms may also play a role in our findings. First, in addition to being able to

access services, Medicaid patients may receive higher quality care. Given the wide range of

services covered by the fee bump, either new or incumbent patients may have access to a broader

set of services that allows for better and more comprehensive care. Similarly, physicians may

spend more time with Medicaid patients, new or incumbent, and this extended interaction may

offer more time for behavioral health conditions to be diagnosed (e.g., physicians may ask more

probing questions about mental health and use of substances), the correct treatment regime (e.g.,

carefully discussing the importance of regularly taking medications at required times), and/or

lifestyle changes (e.g., avoiding situations that may prompt substance use or lead to anxiety). Or

higher reimbursement rates may simply improve patient-provider interactions in other intangible

ways. We explore this avenue to some extent through indicators for unmet need but likely

cannot capture all aspects of care quality. Second, akin to the benefits of ‘conditional coverage’

(Marton and Yelowitz 2015, Burns and Dague 2017), simply knowing that quality care can be

accessed if needed may improve behavioral health (i.e., less anxiety, less self-medication through

substances and tobacco products). 25 Third, improvements in general health outcomes as

documented by Alexander and Schnell (2017) may have spillover effects for behavioral health

(e.g., better management of chronic conditions such as diabetes may improve mental health).

Fourth, among parents, improved access to services and health outcomes among children


25
  However, we expect that an individual must be enrolled in Medicaid to experience the effects of the fee bump and
hence the phenomena we capture here is somewhat different from conditional coverage.

                                                       29
(Alexander and Schnell 2017) may have further health benefits (e.g., earlier diagnoses and

treatment of communicable illnesses such as the flu, less stress related to poor child health).

These pathways likely do not operate independently and instead interact to generate the

improvements in behavioral health that we observe.

       Our study has limitations. (i) We have imperfect information on the settings in which

targeted primary care services are likely to be received (i.e., outpatient visits) in the NSDUH.

(ii) We are not able to explore whether the fee bump induced new physicians to participate in

Medicaid, increased participation among incumbent physicians, and/or (iii) altered practice styles

(e.g., use of substitutes such as nurse practitioners). These are economically interesting and

policy-relevant questions that could be explored in other datasets. (iii) Our measures of

behavioral health are based on survey data and thus may be subject to reporting bias. However,

we note that the NSDUH measures have been validated and are collected by trained survey

administrators in a government survey designed to provide official statistics on behavioral health

for the nation. Moreover, we suspect that any reporting error is orthogonal to the fee bump

policy. (iv) The majority of our variation in Medicaid reimbursement rates occurred over a

relatively short period of time (two years) and the policy was temporary for many states, thus the

effects we observe may not reflect the effects of a permanent policy.

       Overall, our findings provide evidence that increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for

primary care services can substantially increase behavioral health outcomes among lower income

populations. While the costs of the federal Medicaid fee bump were non-trivial -- $7B to $12B

over a two year period (Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission 2015)) -- given

the enormous social costs of behavioral health, estimated to be as high as $1.31T per year in the

U.S. (Caulkins, Kasunic et al. 2014, Insel 2015) and the current opioid epidemic that leads to 116



                                                 30
deaths per day (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2017), our findings provide

suggestive evidence that this policy was potentially worthwhile financially. 26            27
                                                                                                Indeed, at the

time of writing, both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate had advanced legislation

designed to mitigate harms associated with the opioid epidemic (Kaiser Family Foundation

2018). While we do not study opioids directly, our results suggest that financially incentivizing

primary care physicians to treat Medicaid enrollees, who are at elevated risk for OUD (Center for

Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017), may be a potential policy alternative.

psychoactive drugs, and tobacco] in 2011) were inflated to 2018 dollars using the Consumer Price Index by the
authors.

   We acknowledge that we are not incorporating the full costs of treatment which extend beyond enhanced funding
to physicians (e.g., facility fees, medications) which Medicaid finances with some cost-sharing by patients.

Notes: Calculations based on Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement fee ratios for select primary care services
targeted by the Medicaid fee bump policy collected from various sources. Tennessee is excluded because it does not
have a fee-for-service component to its Medicaid program. See associated text for more details on calculations and
data sources. Large fee bump state = increase in the Medicaid-to-Medicare reimbursement rate > 30% (median
increase in the sample).
