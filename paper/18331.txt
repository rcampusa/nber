                                              ABSTRACT

Long half-lives of real exchange rates are often used as evidence against monetary sticky price models.
In this study we show how exchange rate regimes alter the long-run dynamics and half-life of the real
exchange rate, and we recast the classic defense of such models by Mussa (1986) from an argument
based on short-run volatility to one based on long-run dynamics. The first key result is that the extremely
persistent real exchange rate found commonly in post Bretton Woods data does not apply to the preceding
fixed exchange rate period in our sample, where the half-live was perhaps half as large. This result
suggests a reinterpretation of Mussa’s original finding, indicating that up to two thirds of the rise in
variance of the real exchange rate in the recent period is actually due to the rise in persistence of the
response to shocks, rather than due to a rise in the variance of shocks themselves. The second key
result explains the rise in persistence over time by identifying underlying shocks using a panel VECM
model. Shocks to the nominal exchange rate induce more persistent real exchange rate responses compared
to price shocks, and these shocks became more prevalent under a flexible exchange rate regime.

I. Introduction

        There is a long-standing and ongoing debate over what type of model best explains the

behavior of the real exchange rate, including its volatility, persistence, and comovement with the

nominal exchange rate. On one hand, sticky price models argue that shocks to the nominal

exchange rate are passed on to the real exchange rate because of sticky nominal prices. On the

other hand, advocates of real models of the real exchange rate – “real-real models” -- argue that

movements in the nominal exchange rate primarily reflect effects passed on from shocks to the

real exchange rate. In his 1986 Carnegie Rochester paper, Michael Mussa offered a highly

influential critique of real-real exchange rate models by observing that the volatility of the real

exchange rate is higher under a flexible nominal exchange rate regime than under a fixed

exchange rate regime, such as the Bretton Woods system. This finding often is used to support a

sticky price story, as it is thought that the more flexible nominal exchange rates prevailing in the

post-Bretton Woods period permitted a rise in the volatility of nominal shocks.

        Since the time that Mussa wrote his paper, the study of real exchange rates has shifted

from examining exchange rate volatility -- what Mussa referred to as “short-term fluctuations” -

-- toward the analysis of the long-run behavior of the real exchange rate.1 In particular, most

recent research has focused on asking if deviations in the real exchange rate from its purchasing

power parity (PPP) equilibrium level tend to disappear in the long run, and how long it takes the

real exchange rate to return to its long run level. Many of these papers have criticized sticky

price models for their inability to explain the evident persistence of real exchange rate deviations

from PPP.2 As a recent example of this debate, Steinsson (2008) argued that the hump-shaped

referred to his results as “short-term” fluctuations.

criticism, see Carvalho and Necchio (2010).

dynamics and long half-life of the real exchange rate in the flexible exchange rate period cannot

be explained by a sticky price model in terms of nominal shocks.

         In this paper we counter this argument with an updated version of the Mussa critique of

real-real exchange rate models. We ask whether recent findings regarding persistent dynamics in

the literature studying the standard post-Bretton Woods data set apply also to the preceding

Bretton Woods period of generally fixed exchange rates. In particular, we analyze whether the

dynamics or half-life of the real exchange rate are affected by a change in the nominal exchange

rate regime. If the real exchange rate is driven by real shocks, then the Mussa critique should

apply and a change in the nominal exchange rate regime should not affect the dynamics of the

real exchange rate. But if the change in the nominal regime does affect exchange rate dynamics,

then sticky price models potentially may provide an alternative explanation. To shed further

light on whether they do, we also decompose real exchange rate changes into underlying

movements associated with shocks to the nominal exchange rate and to relative national prices.3

         Our methodology takes advantage of recent advances in panel econometrics and applies

them to estimating the dynamics properties of the real exchange rate. Specifically, we adapt the

method of Pesaran (2006) to estimate an autoregression of the real exchange rate over the

Bretton Woods and post-Bretton Woods period for a panel of 20 industrialized countries using

the dollar as a common numeraire. This methodology controls for the contemporaneous

correlation across country pairs in the panel. We also estimate a two-equation vector error

correction model (VECM) that decomposes the real exchange rate into its nominal exchange

  Mussa (1996) reported a variety of statistics for the nominal exchange rate and price indices as well as for the real
exchange rate, including the variance, covariance, mean, and serial correlation. Interestingly, in his list of empirical
observations, he notes rise in persistence under flexible exchange rates: “Short-term changes in nominal exchange
rates and in real exchange rates show substantial persistence during subperiods when the nominal exchange rate is
floating.” We take it as reassuring that his observations coincide with our claim of greater persistence during the
post-Bretton woods period, even if his main focus was on short-run fluctuations rather than on long-run convergence
and half-lives of the real exchange rate to PPP equilibrium.

rates and the relative price components, and use this framework to identify distinct shocks to

these two components. 4

        Our paper contributes to the empirical literature on real exchange rates with two main

findings. The first contribution is the finding that the dynamic properties of the real exchange

rate differ between the Bretton Woods and post-Bretton Woods periods. The half-life we

estimate for the fixed exchange rate period, roughly two years, is about half as long as that for

the flexible exchange rate period of about four years. Further, the hump shape identified in the

real exchange rate dynamics during the flexible exchange rate period is not present during the

fixed exchange rate period. The finding is surprising, as theories going back to Friedman (1953)

maintain that a flexible exchange rate should be useful as an alternative adjustment mechanism

of relative prices when nominal prices are not free to adjust.5 This would suggest that the

imposition of a fixed exchange rate should raise the half-life of the real exchange rate rather than

lower it. The finding that the nominal exchange rate regime affects the half-live of the real

exchange rate offers a new stylized fact that models of the real exchange rate should account for.

        An additional implication of this finding is that it suggests a reinterpretation of the

original finding of Mussa (1986) regarding short-run volatility. Our estimates imply that about

two thirds of the increase in the variance of the real exchange rate under flexible exchange rates

was due to a rise in the persistence of the response of the real exchange rate to shocks (the

“intrinsic component,” to use the terminology of Obstfeld and Stockman, 1985), rather than a

rise in the variance of exogenous shocks themselves (the “extrinsic component”).The real



4
  Throughout the paper we analyze the real exchange rate in levels form rather than in first differences. Unit root
tests presented in the paper support the long-run stationarity of the real exchange rate, and our VECM methodology
makes use of the cointegrating relationship between the nominal exchange rate and relative prices in levels.

  Recent theoretical contributions show that Friedman’s conclusions are conditional upon assumptions such as
exports invoiced and sticky in the currency of the exporter. See Berka, Devereux, and Engel (2012) for a recent
discussion of Friedman’s claims.

                                                         3
exchange rate literature often views the stylized facts of high volatility and high persistence of

real exchange rate deviations as two observations that are difficult to explain together. Our

analysis suggests a role for dynamics in explaining both facts, and suggests that research focus

on searching for a model that explains persistence as a means of explaining volatility.

       The second contribution of the paper is to investigate why the persistence of real

exchange rate deviations has increased in the transition to the post-Bretton Woods period, using

a two-equation VECM estimation to identify underlying shocks to the nominal exchange rate and

to prices. Conditioning on these shocks turns out to be informative. First, simulation of impulse

responses shows that the half-life of real exchange rate deviations due to nominal exchange rate

shocks is four to six times larger than that due to price shocks, and this applies similarly to both

exchange rate regime periods. Second, variance decompositions show, not surprisingly, that the

share of real exchange rate fluctuations due to nominal exchange rate shocks rises during the

flexible rate period. The rise in volatility of nominal exchange rate shocks that imply greater

persistence seems to be the reason for the rise in overall real exchange rate persistence. When we

condition by shock, most of the difference in half-lives of the real exchange rate between the two

regime periods disappears.

       In sum, our findings reaffirm the broad conclusion of Mussa, in that the change in the

behavior of the real exchange rate during the fixed and flexible exchange rate regime periods can

be attributed to a change in the incidence of shocks to the nominal exchange rate. We would

emphasize that the basis of this reaffirmation differs in two respects from Mussa’s analysis. First,

we study dynamics, rather than the volatility, of exchange rate changes. Secondly, while the past

literature has spoken only vaguely about the possible role of an increase in exchange rate shocks




                                                  4
since the demise of the Bretton Woods system, we employ time series tools to identify such

shocks econometrically in order to evaluate this claim.

         This paper is related to the very large literature estimating half-lives of the real exchange

rate, though typically only using post-Bretton Woods data.6 A number of studies use long

horizon data that encompasses the Bretton Woods period and earlier, but they generally do not

compare half lives across regimes, nor do they employ panel estimation methodology.7 Only a

very small number of papers in this literature have estimated half-lives for different exchange

rate regimes, but they are not motivated by the question of evaluating real versus monetary

models, and they do not use panel methodology (see Taylor, (2002; and Sarno and Valente,

2006).8 Taylor (2002) is most similar in spirit, in that it tries to explain the rise in volatility of

the real exchange rate under flexible exchange rate regimes, and decomposes this real exchange

rate volatility into persistence and size-of-shock components.

         Our methodology for decomposing real exchange rate changes into their underlying

components is also closely related to Cheung, Lai, and Bergman (2004), who first showed that

the response of the real exchange rate to a nominal exchange rate shock was more persistent than

that to a price shock using a VECM. However, they are interested only in the flexible exchange


6
  See Imbs et al (2005) as a prominent example and for discussion.
7
  For example, Abuaf and Jorion (1990) find average half lives of 3.3 years for bilateral real exchange rates between
the United States and eight countries for 1900 to 1972. Murray and Papell (2002)) find an average half life of 3.6
for six countries over the period 1900 to 1996. Frankel (1986) uses a 116-year-long data set for the dollar/pound
real exchange rate and reports a half-life of 4.6 years. Lothian and Taylor (1996) find a half live of 4.7 years for the
dollar-pound rate using two centuries of data. In contrast to our analysis, none of these papers compare the behavior
of the real exchange rate across periods.
8
  Our results differ from Taylor (2002), who found only a modest increase in the half-lives of countries between the
Bretton Woods period and the floating period that followed: the median half-life among his sample countries rose
from 2.1 years to 2.6 years, while the mean rose from 2.4 to 2.6 years. Sarno and Valente (2006) differ in finding
faster convergence under fixed exchange rate regimes, defined as the Bretton Woods period together with the Gold
Standard (they do not report separate results for the latter period). The differences may be attributable to different
time spans (both use samples more than a century in length, country samples (Taylor’s dataset consists of dollar-
based bilateral exchange rates for 19 countries, including for several emerging markets; Sarno and Valente sample
consists of dollar-based bilateral exchange rate rates for 4 countries), or methodologies (neither employs panel
estimation).

rate period, and their empirical analysis examined data only for 5 currency pairs. Further, they

estimate separate VECMs for each individual currency pair, while we estimate a panel VECM by

adapting Pesaran’s (2006) CCEP estimator to a VECM setting. Bergin, Glick, and Wu

(forthcoming) also applied this estimation strategy, but with the objective of comparing the

dynamics of disaggregated goods-level data to that of aggregates, rather than comparing across

exchange rate regimes.

        The paper is organized as follows. The data and preliminary analysis involving

stationarity tests are presented in Section II. The main empirical results are in Section III.

Section IV concludes the paper.



II. Data and Preliminary Analysis

        The data set consists of bilateral nominal exchange rates with the U.S. dollar as the

numeraire and consumer prices indices, for 20 industrialized countries, taken from the

International Financial Statistics.9 The benchmark sample is annual in frequency and covers the

period 1949 to 2010. We also show the robustness of results using monthly data, though this

limits the data range to starting in 1957.

        Define the real exchange rate, q j ,t as the relative price level between country j and the

base country (here the U. S. dollar) in period t, computed as q j ,t  e j ,t  p j ,t , where e j ,t is the

nominal exchange rate (currency j per U.S. dollar), and p j ,t  pUS ,t  p j ,t is the log difference
                                                                           *

  The full list of 20 countries is: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United
Kingdom. For the monthly sample, sufficient data are available only for 17 countries, with Australia, Denmark, and
New Zealand being excluded. Other studies of PPP using aggregate data during the post Bretton Woods period use
similar country samples (e.g. Papell 2002). The nominal exchange rate data are defined as yearly averages.

variables are expressed in logs.10

           As preparation for the main analysis later, we first establish that international relative

prices are stationary. We apply the cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test

provided by Pesaran (2007). Consider the following regression:

                              q j ,t  a j  b j (q j ,t 1 )  c j (qt 1 )  d j ( qt )   j ,t
                                                                                                                        (1)
                                    j  1,..., N , and t  1,..., T

where qt   q j ,t is the cross-section mean of q j ,t across the N country pairs and qt  qt  qt 1 .
                 j 1



The purpose for augmenting the cross-section mean in the above equation is to control for

contemporaneous correlation among  j ,t . The null hypothesis can be expressed as H 0 : bij  0

for all ij against the alternative hypothesis H1 : b j  0 for some j. The test statistic provided by

Pesaran (2007) is given by

                                                                       N
                                          CIPS ( N , T )  N 1  t j ( N , T )
                                                                       j 1



where t j ( N , T ) is the t statistic of b j in equation (1).

           The top panel of Table 1 indicates rejection of nonstationarity at the 10% level for all

subsamples of the annual data: the Bretton Woods sample, 1949-1971; the post-Bretton Woods

sample, 1973-2010; and the whole sample combined.11 Further, the longer data length afforded

by the whole sample rejects nonstationarity even at the 1% significance level. We will use the

annual data as our main data set. Using higher frequency monthly data further improves power to

reject nonstationarity for the Post-Bretton Woods sample. But it reduces power for the Bretton

Woods sample since the monthly data begin in 1957, significantly shortening the time span. The

bottom panel of the table shows that the shorter monthly sample is not able to reject

nonstationarity for the Bretton Woods period.



III. Results

A. Conditional on Regime: Single equation Autoregressions

        We first estimate the speed of convergence toward stationarity by estimating an

autoregressive model of real exchange rates with panel data. To control for contemporaneous

correlation of residuals, we apply the pooled common correlated effects (CCEP) regressor of

Pesaran (2006) to estimate the autoregressive coefficients of real exchange rates. More

specifically, we estimate the equation:

                                                     M
                                   q j , t  c j    j , m ( q j ,t  m )   j , t                          (2)
                                                    m 1



augmented with cross-section means of the left-hand and right-hand variables ( qt , qt 1 ,...qt M ).12

To control for potential bias in CCEP estimators, we employ the standard double bootstrap

procedure of Kilian (1998) with 1000 replications to obtain bias-adjusted estimates.13

Specification tests based on AIC suggest one lag is optimal for annual data (M = 1), but we also

report results for two lags (M = 2) to demonstrate that our conclusions are robust.14


12
   STATA code to conduct CCEP estimations used throughout the paper are available upon request.
13
   See Bergin, Glick, and Wu (forthcoming) for a Monte-Carlo study of the bias of the CCEP estimator when applied
to models with a lagged dependent variable as well as for details of the bias correction procedure we employ.
14
   We applied the AIC in two ways: (i) to the full system of residuals from the panel estimation, and (ii) to the
residuals of individual AR equations estimated for each currency pair individually. The first approach indicated an
optimal lag length of 1 year for both the Bretton Woods and post Bretton Woods periods, The second approach
yielded a median estimate across countries of 1 year for the post Bretton Woods period and of 2 years for the
Bretton Woods period. We chose to use a common length of 1 year for both periods in our benchmark case using
annual data.

                                                                 8
         Table 2 reports half-lives of the real exchange rate for an autoregession with one lag,

computed on the basis of simulated impulse responses.15 The half-life estimated for the fixed

exchange rate Bretton Woods period is 2.27 years (with a 5%-95% band of 1.43 to 3.39 years).

That for the more flexible exchange rate post-Bretton Woods period is 4.31 years (with a band of

3.44 to 5.24). The latter number is within the “consensus” range in the empirical literature of

between 3 to 5 years.16 We find that the half-life under fixed exchange rates was distinctly

smaller than under the flexible rates, being just about half the size. A similar result obtains when

we consider two lags in the autoregression: with half-lives of 2.75 and 4.27, respectively.

         Figure 1 plots the impulse responses associated with these half-lives. Observe in the

lower panel that when two lags are included in the autoregression a hump-shaped response can

be detected for the post-Bretton Woods data, as observed in Cheung, Lai, and Bergman (2005)

and Steinsson (2008). However, the upper panel reveals no hump-shaped response in the Bretton

Woods period. If the hump-shaped dynamics are a reason for the high degree of persistence in

recent real exchange rate data, as Steinsson conjectures, then the lack of this hump may help

explain the lower degree of persistence in the Bretton Woods period.

         As an additional robustness check, we report results for data at a higher, monthly

frequency. Since the monthly data start in 1957 instead of in 1948 for the annual data, the length

of our Bretton-Woods sample is severely restricted.17 As noted in Section II, the shorter sample

for monthly data is unable to reject nonstationarity of the real exchange rate for the Bretton


15
   The half-life is computed as the time it takes for the impulse responses to a unit shock to equal 0.5, as defined in
Steinsson (2008). We identify the first period, t1, where the impulse response f(t) falls from a value above 0.5 to a
value below 0.5 in the subsequent period, t1+1. We interpolate the fraction of a period after t1, where the impulse
response function reaches a value of 0.5 by adding (f(t1) - 0.5))/ (f(t1) - f(t1+1)).
16
   See Rogoff (1996) and Imbs et al (2005). Our estimated half-life for the post-Bretton Woods period is larger than
that found in Bergin, Glick, and Wu (forthcoming). As explained in that paper, the faster convergence speed is
attributable to the use of product-level data that restricts the sample to the period 1990-2007.
17
   Using quarterly data during the Bretton Woods period suffer even more from this problem, as the start date is later
than with monthly data, implying even fewer observations.

Woods period. Because estimating equation (2) is meaningful only when q is stationary, we

chose to use annual data for our main results. But given the success of the annual data in

rejecting nonstationarity, we conjecture that the failure to reject nonstationarity in the monthly

frequency is due to the power loss from a much shorter time span. We nonetheless report results

for monthly data to demonstrate the robustness of our claims.18 The bottom panel of table 2

reiterates the conclusion from annual data: the half-life is about half as long during the Bretton

Woods period as afterward. Impulse responses in figure 2 show a pronounced hump-shaped

response for post-Bretton Woods data, but a clear lack of any hump during Bretton Woods.

         This shorter half-life during the Bretton Woods period is surprising, as theories dating

back to Friedman (1953) posit that a flexible exchange rate should be useful as an alternative

adjustment mechanism of relative prices when nominal prices are not free to adjust. This

suggests that the imposition of a fixed exchange rate should raise the half-life of the real

exchange rate rather than lower it. It is also surprising in the context of nonlinear models like

Taylor, Peel, and Sarno (2001) and Sarno and Valente (2006), since they predict that large

shocks should be corrected more quickly, and nominal exchange rate shocks tend to be larger in

magnitude than aggregate price shocks. As we show below, the effect of a flexible exchange rate

as an adjustment mechanism is outweighed by its effect as an additional source of shocks.

         The finding of greater persistence after Bretton Woods ended also provides a new

interpretation for the long-standing finding regarding the rise in the variance of the real exchange

rate in this period. The variance of the real exchange rate can be decomposed into the extrinsic

and the intrinsic components, to borrow the terminology from Obstfeld and Stockman (1985).

The former represents the exogenous shock to the autoregression in equation (2), and the latter is

transforms equation (2), in the case of a single lag, by subtracting the mean of the real exchange

rate from each side, squaring, and taking expectations, one derives:

This formula provides a clean decomposition of the variance of the real exchange rate, where

component. In our dataset the variance of the real exchange rate, var  q j ,t  , doubled in the post-

Bretton Woods sample compared to the Bretton woods sample, with the percent change

averaging 102.45% across countries with annual data. Using the estimates of the autoregression

from table 2, we compute that the term 1/ (1   2j )  increased by 66%. (See table 3 for details.)

Together, this indicates that nearly two thirds of the rise in real exchange rate variance under

flexible exchange rates in our data was due, not to a rise in the extrinsic shocks to the real

exchange rate, but instead to the rise in persistence under the flexible rate regime. This

underscores the importance of understanding the reason for the change in dynamics between the

two regimes. Not only is the change in dynamics due to the change in exchange rate regime a

potential new stylized fact of interest, but it also is important for understanding the rise in

volatility itself, which long has been identified in the literature as a key stylized fact.19

         This result is robust when applied also to the other estimations and samples discussed

previously in the paper, although the derivation of the decomposition is more complicated than

for the simple autoregression with one lag. Applying the decomposition to the autoregression

Substituting in the autoregressive parameter values from the AR(2) estimation, the result is that

 = 2.68 for the Bretton Woods period, and in the post-Bretton Woods period it rose 47% to

3.95. Recalling that the variance of the real exchange rate rose 102% between the two periods,

this means that the change in dynamics summarized in  explains a bit under one half of the rise

in the variance of the real exchange rate, with the remainder explained by the rise in exogenous

innovations to the equation. While less than the share computed from the first-order

autoregressive estimates, this still indicates an important role played by dynamics in generating

greater real exchange rate volatility in the post-Bretton Woods period.

       We apply the same method to derive the decomposition for monthly data. With 5 lags it

is not possible to present a tractable analytical expression analogous to equation (4), but after the

autoregressive parameter estimates are substituted, the numerical value of Ψ rises from 19.30

during Bretton Woods to 52.37 afterwards, a rise of 271%. The variance of the actual real

exchange rate data in our sample, measured at a monthly frequency, rose by 453% after the

Bretton Woods period. Together this implies that 60% of the rise in variance of the real exchange

rate data is due to a rise in the intrinsic dynamics, which is very similar to the results for annual

data above.



B. Conditional on Shock: Vector Error Correction Estimation

       We now investigate the source of the increase in persistence, using a vector error


                                                       12
correction model. This approach permits us to decompose the real exchange rate into its two

underlying components, the nominal exchange rate and the price level differential, as well as to

identify the shocks to each component.20 Mussa conjectured that the rise in short-run real

exchange rate volatility under flexible exchange rates might have arisen from an increase in the

prevalence of shocks to the nominal exchange rate permitted by such a policy regime. We

conjecture this same phenomenon may have contributed to the rise in real exchange rate

persistence. If the dynamics of real exchange rate adjustment differ depending on which of the

two shocks is at work, and if the mix of these two shocks differs by policy regime, this could

explain the change in the observed half-life of the overall real exchange rate.

         The stationarity of real exchange rates implies cointegration of nominal exchange rates

(e j ,t ) and relative prices ( p j ,t ) with the cointegrating vector (1, 1). The adjustment process of

nominal exchange rates and relative prices can be studied using the following panel vector error-

correction model (VECM):

                  e j ,t  e, j  e, j (q j ,t 1 )  ee, j (e j ,t 1 )  ep, j (p j ,t 1 )   je,t          (5a)

                  p j ,t   p, j   p, j (q j ,t 1 )   pe , j (e j ,t 1 )   pp, j (p j ,t 1 )   jp,t .   (5b)

This two-equation system decomposes the real exchange rate, q j ,t , into its two components, the

nominal exchange rate, e j , and the relative price level, p j . It regresses the first difference of

each of these components on the lag level of the real exchange rate, which summarizes the

degree to which the data deviate from PPP. Other regressors in (5) control for level effects and

short-run dynamics of the variables. The coefficients e, j and  p , j reflect how strongly the


20
  We employ this methodology in Bergin, Glick, and Wu (forthcoming), which documents the asymptotic
properties of this estimator for an vector error correction model and describes a bootstrapped bias correction
approach suggested by Kilian (1998). Our results employ this bias-corrected estimation methodology.

                                                                      13
exchange rate and prices respond to PPP deviations. Because negative movements in these

variables work to reduce PPP deviations, they provide a measure of the speed of adjustment of

nominal exchange rates and relative prices, respectively. To allow for possible cross section

dependence in the errors, we computed CCEP estimators of the parameters by including as

regressors the cross section averages of all variables ( et , qt 1 , et 1 , and pt 1 ) and

( pt , qt 1 , et 1 , and pt 1 ) for the eij ,t and pij ,t equations, respectively.

         Table 4 reports speed of adjustment coefficients on the lagged real exchange rate in each

equation. Estimates are all significant at the 5% level, which supports the presence of co-

integration between e and p, and the interpretation of equation (4) is a VECM. For both regime

periods the response coefficient of the nominal exchange rate to PPP deviations, e, j is much

larger than the response coefficient of prices,  p , j . For the post-Bretton Woods period the

exchange rate response coefficient is 3 times larger than the price coefficient (-.168 vs. -.045);

for the Bretton Woods period the factor is 2 (-.223 vs. -.102). This distinction between exchange

rate and price responses lends support to the relevance of decomposing the real exchange rate

into these two components.

         The VECM also provides a basis for identifying distinct shocks to the system. We use a

Cholesky ordering of the variables e then p, which identifies as an exchange rate shock any

innovation in the nominal exchange rate that is not explained as an endogenous response to the

lagged values in the regression equation (5a). A price shock is then identified as an innovation in

the price level not associated with a contemporaneous movement in the exchange rate. This is

the identification strategy used in Bergin, Glick, and Wu (forthcoming). It has several advantages

in the present context over the alternative ordering. First, it avoids imposing an assumption of



                                                         14
price stickiness (implying no contemporaneous movement in price), but rather allows the data to

speak about the degree of price rigidity in response to shocks. Second, as we will show in

robustness checks below, the alternative ordering, where contemporaneous comovements of the

nominal exchange rate and price shocks are classified as price shocks, leads to price shocks that

appear to be contaminated by exchange rate shocks.

       Figures 3 and 4 plot impulse responses to the two shocks in both sample periods, and

Table 5 computes the half-lives of the real exchange rate for each shock based on these impulse

responses. Recall from the single-equation autoregression results in Table 2 the finding that the

half-life in the Bretton Woods period was roughly half that during the post-Bretton Woods

period (2.27 vs. 4.31). As shown in table 5, the difference is much smaller once we decompose

by shock. Conditioning on an exchange rate shock, the half-lives of the real exchange rate for the

two periods are 2.38 and 3.57 years, respectively. Also, conditional on a price shock, the half-

lives for both periods are similar and both quite small, 0.61 and 0.54 years, respectively. Among

these four numbers, the contrast between the two periods seems small in comparison to the

contrast between the two shocks. In other words, the half-life in response to nominal exchange

rate shocks is fairly long regardless of regime period, whereas that to price shocks is short

regardless of regime.

       The impulse responses in figures 3 and 4 illustrate this point, as well as offering

additional lessons about the mechanism of adjustment in the real exchange rate. Figure 3 shows

that the real exchange rate adjusts gradually in response to a nominal exchange rate shock, both

for the Bretton Woods and post Bretton Woods periods, whereas figure 4 shows the real

exchange rate adjusts very quickly to a price shock in both regimes. In addition, note in figure 3

that the path of adjustment in the real exchange rate seems to mirror the adjustment in the



                                                 15
nominal exchange rate, with very little movement in relative prices. This offers some support to

the idea that prices are sticky in responding to nominal exchange rate shocks, particularly given

that our choice of identification assumptions did not impose any such restriction on the ability of

price to respond contemporaneously. In the case of price shocks, there appears to be significantly

more movement in the price level, with the price component contributing to the adjustment path

of the real exchange rate.21

         These lessons regarding the mechanism of adjustment can be formalized using the

decomposition of Cheung et al (2004). Defining the impulse response of variable m to shock n as

 m,n (t ) , note that  q,n (t )   e,n (t )  p,n (t ) . Then geq,n (t )   e,n (t ) /  q,n (t ) measures the

proportion of adjustment in PPP deviations explained by nominal exchange rate adjustment, and

g qp,n (t )   p,n (t ) /  q,n (t ) measures the proportion explained by price adjustment, such that

geq,n (t )  g qp,n (t )  1 . The results in Table 6 indicate that adjustment of the real exchange rate to

nominal exchange rate shocks at most horizons is accomplished through changes in the nominal

exchange rate. An exception is that at a horizon of 10 years a greater fraction of adjustment

occurs through price movement than through the exchange rate, but this number has little

meaning, since figure 1 shows that the total amount of adjustment occurring at this horizon is

very small in magnitude. Adjustment to price shocks is attributed nearly equally to adjustment in

the nominal exchange rate and the price level. Again, the overall conclusion is that once we

decompose by shock, the quantitatively important differences are attributable to the type of

shocks, not the nature of the exchange rate regime.

21
  Appendix figures A1-A2 report impulse responses for the alternative identification ordering (p, then e). For
exchange rate shocks, the impulse response looks almost the same as for the benchmark identification. The impulse
response to price shocks looks different. Oddly, in the post-Bretton Woods period the contemporaneous response of
the exchange rate is actually larger than the movement in price, which calls into question the naming of such a shock
as a price shock. This suggests the alternative identification may lead to contamination of price shocks with
exchange rate shocks, probably because the latter are more frequent and larger than the former.

                                                             16
         All this brings us back to the question of how it can be that the overall half-life of the real

exchange rate from the single equation autoregression could be so much larger in the post

Bretton Woods period than in the Bretton Woods period. One conjecture is that nominal

exchange rate shocks were more prevalent in the later, flexible exchange rate period. Given that

exchange rate shocks imply more persistent real exchange rate dynamics than do price shocks,

the greater prevalence of exchange rate shocks in the post Bretton Woods period would imply

greater persistence in the real exchange rate overall.

         Table 7 reports variance decompositions, which confirm this conjecture. The variance of

real exchange rate forecast errors is almost entirely due to nominal exchange rate shocks during

the post Bretton Woods period . During the Bretton Woods period, exchange rate shocks account

for 76% to 87% of variability in the real exchange rate.22 While this is a surprisingly substantial

share given that this is supposed to be a fixed exchange rate regime, it nonetheless is smaller in

every year than the very large shares close to 100% for the flexible exchange rate regime period.

         Our finding that exchange rate shocks explain a great proportion of real exchange

variability during the post-Bretton Woods period is similar in spirit to the claim by Mussa and

others that a flexible exchange rate regime allows more nominal exchange rate shocks,

generating higher volatility. However, we note that our analysis generalizes and extends the

argument of Mussa in two important respects. First, we focus on persistence as well as on the

volatility of exchange rates, showing a new stylized fact regarding persistence. And second, we

identify nominal exchange rate shocks separately from price shocks using formal econometric

method s. This reveals that the primary driver of the contrasting behavior of real exchange rates


22
  Variance decompositions for the alternative identification ordering (p then e) are reported in the appendix. For the
Bretton Woods period, the exchange rate and price shocks split almost exactly 50-50, with extremely wide
confidence bands. This is further evidence of the inability to identify distinct shocks under the alternative identifying
strategy.

                                                           17
across the two regimes is the contrasting dynamics of the two shocks in combination with the

greater role of exchange rate shocks in the later period.

       Lastly, we note that we intentionally do not take a stand on the possible sources for

exchange rate shocks in our analysis. The rise in nominal exchange rate shocks may arise from

money supply shocks unleashed by the relaxation of policy constraints during the Bretton Woods

period. But they may also represent shocks to capital flows or to risk premia in the foreign

exchange market. We leave it to future research to further decompose our nominal exchange rate

shocks into these alternative sources, avoiding the inherently controversial identification

strategies necessary to do so. Our main point regards the distinction between exchange rate and

price shocks, as this distinction is found to imply quantitatively large and economically

important differences in real exchange rate dynamics.



IV. Conclusions

       In this study we estimate how exchange rate regimes affect the long-run dynamics and

half-life of the real exchange rate. We obtain two main results. First, we find that the speed of

convergence of the real exchange rate to PPP is slower in the post-Bretton Woods period.

Associated with the result, we find that up to two-thirds of the rise in measured short-run

volatility during the more post-Bretton Woods period can be attributed to this increase in

persistence. Second, when we identify nominal exchange rate and price shocks to the real

exchange rate separately, we find that the half-lives and dynamics of the real exchange rate are

essentially the same across regimes, and instead the key distinction is the differential response to

these two shocks.




                                                 18
       Our analysis offers a reinterpretation of the classic finding of Mussa (1986) concerning

the increase in real exchange rate volatility after the demise of the Bretton Woods system. The

overall conclusion is that the rise in real exchange rate volatility observed by Mussa worked

substantially through a rise in persistence, which in turn was driven by the fact that nominal

exchange rate shocks are more persistent than price shocks.

       These findings have implications for the ongoing and fundamental debate over the source

of real exchange rate fluctuations. Mussa used the fact that short-run real exchange rate

volatility as affected by the nominal exchange rate regime to argue in favor of nominal shocks as

an important driver of real exchange rates. It the same way we counter recent arguments against

the role of nominal shocks in explaining real exchange rate persistence by pointing to the

observation that real exchange rate dynamics are also affected by the nominal exchange rate

regime.

       Our findings also have lessons for the broader literature studying PPP convergence,

suggesting that the literature should adopt a convention of conditioning results by shock. A

standard univariate study of the real exchange rate will tend to conflate the distinct shocks to

nominal exchange rates and price components of the real exchange rate, which seem to have very

disparate dynamics.

Derivation of equation (4):

       Rewrite the second-order autoregressive equation with autoregressive coefficients 1 and

 2 as a two-equation first-order vector autoregression yt  Ayt 1   t , where yt   qt qt 1  ,
                                                                                                   '

                       0        0

written as follows:

                                                  
                              E  yt yt '      BDi B 1   BDi B 1  '
                                                  i 1


where D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and B is the matrix of eigenvectors of A. This can

be computed:

                                              BKB '

where the typical element (i,j) of K is

                                                1  di  1  d j  M ij

and where

                                             M  B1[ B1 ]'.

The variance of the real exchange rate is element (1,1) of the resulting matrix. This system was

solved analytically for equation (4) using Matlab’s symbolic toolbox.
