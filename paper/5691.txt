        This paper considers the importance of dynamic complementarities         as an endogenous source

of propagation   in a dynamic stochastic economy.       Dynamic complementarities      link the stocks of

human and organizational        capital, which are influenced by past levels of economic activity, to

current levels of productivity.   We supplement an otherwise standard dynamic business cycle model

with both contemporaneous          and dynamic complementarities.      The model is calibrated     using

estimates   of these effects.     Our quantitative   analysis identifies empirically   relevant dynamic

complementarities    as a source of propagation for both technology and taste shocks.

I. Introduction

         This paper seeks to address a major difficulty in the current literature on business

cycles: the lack of endogenous propagation            of aggregate shocks.   As is documented    in

numerous studies (e. g, King, Plosser and Rebelo [1988a]), the propagation              mechanism in the

standard neoclassical growth model is qui (e weak: transitory technology shocks imply that the

serial correlation in output is less than .03. This is quite low relative to the observed serial

correlation of output in U.S. data.       This problem affects not just models of the real business

cycle genre but others that rely on quite different sources of fluctuations,         such as demand side

impulses caused by monetary disturbances,

         One remedy, adopted in many real business cycle models, is to simply build in the

serial correlation through the exogenous process,            Reported statistics for real business cycle

models with serially correlated shocks are much closer to those obsewed for the U.S.

economy.

         An alternative,    which is more attractive if one wishes to study temporary demand

variations,     is to search for endogenous    mechanisms beyond the process of physical capital

accumulation      that generate serial correlation.     This paper contributes   to this effort by

investigating     a stochastic growth model supplemented by contemporaneous            and dynamic

complementarities      in the representative   agent’s production function. The main point is to

provide a quantitative     analysis of dynamic complementarities        with emphasis on the propagation

               This paper complements                          the work by Baxter and King [1991] who provide a

quantitative evacuation of the influence of contemporaneous                                                                 complementarities                 operating

through a production                      spillover, following the example by Bryant [1983].                                                         The theme here is

that individual agents are more productive the higher the production level of other agents.                                                                                        The

Baxter and King analysis emphasizes the magnification                                                          of shocks through contemporaneous

complementarities.

               Our model induces propagation                                  from dynamic complementarities:                                        i.e. the presence of

strategic complementarities,                             discussed in Cooper and John [1988], that operate through time

rather than contemporaneous                                 y. These dynamic complementarities                                           are intended to capture

aspects of learning-by-doing                             spillovers and changes in the stock of organizational                                                     capital that

take place at business cycle frequencies.2                                         Moreover,                 we focus on complementarities                                 that are

external to the production process of an individual agent.                                                           Our analysis allows for the presence

of both forms of complementarily                                  and, as we demonstrate below, their interaction produces

rich dynamics.

               The next section of the paper provides a theoretical overview of dynamic

complementarities                    with reference to papers that provide explicit models of these interactions.

The third section discusses our approach to the quantitative analysis, including the estimation

of these interactions,    The fourth section presents our results which indicate that relatively

small dynamic linkages can create substantial serial correlation in the aggregate variables.

        Overall, we find empirical support for the presence of both contemporaneous                and

dynamic complementarities       from both aggregate and plant-level data.       The aggregate empirical

evidence comes from estimation of the parameters using sectoral (2-digit) output and input

measures. The validity of the estimation routine is evaluated using Monte Carlo techniques

with data simulated from a real business cycle model without complementarities.              The plant-

level data comes from the Longitudinal      Research Database (LRD) and documents the presence

of complementarities     for automobile assembly plants,

        When these aspects of the production process are included in the version of the

stochastic growth model used by King, Plosser and Rebelo, the contemporaneous

complementarities      magnify shocks and the dynamic complementarities         propagate them.          For

example, con sider an economy in which fluctuations are driven by iid technology shocks.                   In

an economy without any complementarities,        there is little serial correlation in output.      When

both complementarities     are present, the standard deviation of output increases by a factor of

almost 5 and the serial correlation in output increases to .95 from .02.

       We also consider fluctuations driven by demand variations,         modeled here as shocks to

an agent’s marginal rate of substitution between consumption        and leisure.     In a competitive

economy with no externalities,     iid taste shocks have quite counterfactual      implications:

consumption   and investment are negatively correlated and there is no consumption            smoothing.

As discussed by Baxter and King, these effects are somewhat attenuated by the introduction                     of

contemporaneous     complementarities.    When both complementarities       are set at empirically
                                                                                                              4

relevant levels, the economy displays rather rich dynamics in response to an iid taste shock.

Initially, investment and output expand as in the economy without complementarities.                 After

the initial expansion,    the rise in the stock of human capiti     implies a rise in productivity    which

sustains the boom for some time.       Eventually,   the human capital effects are overwhelmed          by

the transition of the ~onomy      back to its steady state. However, investment remains negatively

correlated with output and the standard deviation of consumption           remains above that of output.




II. Theoretical      Structure

        Our approach is to focus on a fairly general specification of a dynamic complementarily

rather than to assess any particular formulation.      We first present the basic model and then turn

to interpretations   found in papers that motivate our analysis.

        Consider an economy in which the representative           agent solves the following dynamic

optimization   problem:




where Y[ is average aggregate activity in period t. In the objective function, current utility

depends on consumption       in period t (cJ, a taste shifter (AJ and leisure (1 -nJ, so that hours

time periods, are standard.                        The production function allows two forms of interactions                                              across

agents.       The first is through the influence of current aggregate activity (YJ on the output of an

individual producer (yJ, parameterized                                    by ~. This is the complementanty                           that forms the basis

of Baxter and King [1991].                          The second influence is through lagged activity (Y~.l) and is

parametenzed           by y. Stated in terms of this model, the goal of the paper is to estimate                                                           ●   and Y

and then to evaluate the quantitative implications                                          of the model with particular emphasis on the

propagation         of shocks.

             This form of a production                        function has been used extensively in both the business cycle

and growth literatures.                    For business cycles, the influential paper by Bryant [1983] described a

coordination         problem in which multiple Pareto ranked Nash equilibria could emerge due to the

presence of complementarities                           in the production process.                       That example was static but serves

as motivation for the contemporaneous                                     production complementarities                       found in Baxter and King

[1991] and Klenow [1991].3

             As discussed in Cooper and John [1988] and Cooper and Haltiwanger                                                             [1994], this

representation         nests other forms of interactions.                                   As in Hewitt [1985], one can consider costs

of transactions            that fall as the level of activity increases.                                These “thick market” effects can be

viewed as arguments in a production process that converts inputs into consumption                                                                   without

being spwific about the trading process.                                      Further, in models of monopolistic                           competition,           as in

Blanchard and Kiyotaki [1987] or Kiyotaki [1988], the demand curve facing an individual

producer depends on the level of demand for that period which, in turn, will depend on the

aggregate level of economic activity.                               This would again yield a similar specification                                             though

the interpretation             of the parameters would relate more to preferences than technology.

               In terms of the lagged output term, Durlauf [1991] considers dynamic

complementarities                which are motivated by learning-by-doing                                        interactions         within and across

sectors of activity.              In Durlauf’s formulation,                      complementarities                    are local in that a single

sector interacts with only a subset of other sectors.                                        Still the aggregate economy is affected by

sectoral shocks through the local interactions.                                      In our formulation,                    the distinction between

local and aggregate complementarities                               is lost since we do not explicitly focus on sectoral or

plant-specific            shocks.4 Thus the lagged output term in our technology represents the learning

spillovers in Durlauf’s models.                          However, in our empirical implementation,                                          we follow Durlauf

and consider the dynamic complementarily                                     as reflecting local linkages associated with learning

by doing.           Gale [1996] also uses the assumption of lagged complementarities                                                         to study the

timing of investment decisions.

               In a related paper, Stadler [1990] considered very similar effects of past production on

current productivity               though in his formulation                         current human capital depended on past human

capital, lagged average labor productivity                                and lagged labor input.                           This specification is

rationalized          by arguments concerning the accumulation                                     of organizational                 capital,         the

acquisition of new skills and so forth.                             As with our analysis, Stadler’s main point was to

understand           the propagation           of shocks.           A central difference in the papers concerns the

underlying economic model.                        Stadler focuses on the specification of the technology and

assumes particular forms for labor supply and a quantity equation for aggregate demand while

our model is identical to the stochastic growth model except for the specification of the

technology.

            Finally, Drazen [1985] explores the effects of output fluctuations on the natural rate of

unemployment.         In this modeI, workers must train to become productive          at the firm.     By

causing working-firm        separations,    fluctuations reduce the aggregate stock of human capital and

thus have longer run effects.

            In the growth literature,   considerable attention has been paid to externalities        in the

accumulation       and utilization of knowledge,    as in Lucas [1988] and Romer [1986] and the

literature that followed.      In Romer [1986], the accumulation         of knowledge is financed by

foregone consumption         while in Lucas [1988] human capital is accumulated         by schooling rather

than working and there is a human capital externality in the production             function at the

individual level.

            If we interpret Y,.l in the production function as a proxy for human capital, then our

model can be viewed as an attempt to focus on the higher frequency implications                of a specific

version of these human capital accumulation           models.   In particular,   our stock of human capital

is determined solely as a function of the previous period’s level of aggregate economic

activity.     Of course Y,., incorporates     information about all the past levels of output through the

dynamic complementarily.          Klenow [1993] considers a related model in which there is both

exogenous human capital depreciation           as well as accumulation    related to the level of

employment.        Both our paper and Klenow’s take the view that current employment             levels can

have an immediate impact on the efficiency of individual workers in an economy,                  In contrast,
                                                                                                                8

King, Plosser and Rebelo [1988b] specify a business cycle model in which the accumulation                  of

human capital provides an alternative use of time rather than a byproduct of the production of

goods.

         More generally, high activity inthepast          isawayto     cr~teorganizational   capi@l which

goes beyond the idea of a single worker learning how to undertake a particular task.             Some of

this capital is undoubtedly     internal to an organization but in periods of high activity, links are

created with suppliers and customers (as in a more dynamic version of Hewitt’s transactions

cost model) that reduce costs of marketing in future periods.

         Our approach is not to rely specifically on one of these particular models but rather to

use the specification of technology as primitive and determine the quantitative influence of

these interactions.   If there is no support for these effects in the empirical analysis or if the

propagation    effects from the simulations are relatively minor, then we would argue that this

class of model is not worth exploring further.        Alternatively,    if these effects are significant and

economically    meaningful,     then further work developing and testing the various models

described here seems justified.

         In this optimization   problem, the representative      agent takes as given the state dependent

level of average aggregate output since agents are small relative to the economy.             The first

order conditions are:


                 ul(ct-At, l-nt )
                                    = A,a nt’-’k:Y,cY;,                                                   (2)

               As there are no idiosyncratic                              shocks, finding an equilibrium                        simply requires imposing

equality between individual and aggregate variables in the system of first order conditions.                                                                                  In

particular,             y,= Y, so that, in equilibrium,                          the production relationship                      becomes

The underlying economics should be clear from this system.                                                            First, the presence of a

contemporaneous                          production complementarily                       serves to magnify shocks to the system.                                   This

comes about because variations in A, have an exponent of n >1 and the marginal returns to

variations in inputs is also influenced by this production externality parameter,                                                                      as in (5) and

(6). Second, the marginal products of labor and capital (again in (5) and (6)) are affected by

the level of activity from the past, parametrized                                                by y >0.        This effect is the source of

propagation             in our economy.                     Thus, not surprisingly,                   the key to the analysis is the magnitude

of these two parameters.

              Following King, Plosser and Rebelo [1988a], we analyze the equilibrium                                                                       path of the

economy by constructing                           a log linear approximation                        around the steady state. b Ultimately,                                  this

gives us a linear system dependent on the state vector (A,, A,, y,.,, ~.l) and the initial values of

the capital stock and output.                           This linear system can be analyzed and paths for the aggregate

variables determined.                         For given stochastic processes for A, and A,, conditional                                                    expectations

are then used instead of future values of these random variables in determining                                                                     the evolution of

the system.             All relevant moments can then be computed from this linear system.                                                                  Details on

this approach are given in King, Plosser and Rebelo [1988a].




III. Parameterization                           and Estimation

              To perform the quantitative analysis, we must specify and parametrize                                                                 functional

forms for the utility and production functions and set other parameters of the model economy.

As our goal is to understand the effects of dynamic complementarities                                                               relative to models

without this feature, we specify our model so that the real business cycle framework used in

King, Plosser and Rebelo is a special case. In particular,                                                   we assume that utility is log(c~ +

~log(l).         For the production                    function, we have already specified a Cobb-Douglas                                                  form

implying constant factor shares.                               We first discuss the parameterization                                 of our production

function since it represents the main difference between this and related exercises and then

summarize our choices of the other parameters.

A. production      Function Est imation

          This sub-section is devoted to estimating the production       technology of the model

specified above. This involves estimating the external returns parameter as well as the dynamic

complementarities      parameter along with the return to own inputs. We consider two alternative

procedures for estimating the production        function.    The first involves direct estimation of the

production function using aggregate (2-digit) data while the second obtains estimates from

plant-level data. These are discussed in turn.

(i) Aggregate Production Function Es?inlarion

          Consider the following Cobb-Douglas        production function in logs, which corresponds

to the technology specified above,


                                                                                                       (8)



where ~ is the productivity      index.

          One approach is to estimate this aggregate production function using data on output and

inputs.    While simple, this approach has three well known drawbacks.            The first is the

identification    of the parameters,   the second involves the correlation between productivity y

shocks and the inputs and the third relates to the measurement          of capital services.

          To understand the identification    problem, recall that in the representative       agent

framework,       a necessary condition for equilibrium      was y,=YL for all t. Using this, the

production function reduces to:
                                                                                                                            12

                  1-E   l-e    1-6        l-E’          t’t-


Notice that it is not possible to disentangle the returns to own inputs from the external effect

using aggregate data. In terms of (9), it is possible to obtain estimates of a * and O* but these

cannot be separated into a, $, and ~. If attention is restricted to aggregate data, an identifying

assumption is required to determine the parameters.

        Baxter and King [1991], for example, identify                          ●   by imposing constant returns to scale.

Hence they estimate


                                      1
                                 Y,=— Xt+”t                                                                           (10)
                                     1-E



where x, is an index of inputs weighted by their long run sample average factor shares.

        Instead of imposing such restrictions,                     it is possible to overcome the problem of

identifying these parameters by taking advantage of the cross sectional variation available at

the two digit industry level. To do so requires us to depart slightly from the theoretical model

we have specified since the identification                 rests on the existence of sector specific movements in

productivity.

        Consider an economy in which aggregate manufacturing                               is divided into sectors indexed

by j = 1,... ,J, each with a share ~j of total value added. Then the sectoral production                        functions

can be written as



                          Y$=a n ~t”+kjt+~yt*yyjt-l+afl                                                              (11)


where E captures the externality from aggregate manufacturing                             to the two digit sector and Y
                                                                                                                                                                            13

captures the impact of last period’s production within the sector,7                                                               Summing over the j sectors

gives exactly the aggregate production function specified in equation (8), as long as the shares

do not vary from one period to another.                                         Assume that the productivity                           shock can be

decomposed into a sector specific shock and an aggregate shock which are orthogonal,


                                                        ‘#- a f“”jt                                                                                                      (12)



then (11) can be written as


                                     Yj~m

The key element from the perspective of disentangling                                                          ●   from a and $ is the presence of sector

specific elements in the disturbance term. In the absence of these, the sectoral production

functions are identical and, using y,= ~aj yjt in (13), the same identification                                                                  problem arises as

in the aggregate data.

            The second problem is common to this literature and arises from the correlation

between the productivity                       shocks and the inputs.                           The nature of the problems created by this

correlation depends on the amount of serial correlation in the productivity                                                                     shock. a In

particular,         if the serial correlation of the productivity                                          shock is low, then the labor input should

be highly correlated with the shock reflecting intertemporal                                                          substitution effects.                 At the other

extreme, a highly serially correlated technology shock implies a much smaller labor response

but more movements in capital.                        The biases produced by an OLS regression will then reflat

the amount of serial correlation                     in the shock through the responses of labor and capital.

            The usual procedure,                which we follow, for dealing with this problem is to use

instrumental           variables. Following Burn side, Eichenbaum and Rebelo [1995] and Christian,

Eichenbaum and Evans [1996], we use lags of monetary policy innovations as instruments.

The procedure for obtaining these innovations is discussed at length in these papers.9                                              The idea

is to use as instruments                 the innovations to monetary policy variables (specifically nonborrowed

reserves and the federal funds rate) obtained by regressing these policy instruments                                           on

variables in agents’ information                     sets. These information                    sets are constructed    so that the

innovations          to the policy variables are not likely to be correlated with productivity                                shocks.    As

discussed by Burnside, Eichenbaum                            and Rebelo, these instruments                are highly correlated with

inputs into the production process.

            These instruments are constructed using quarterly data.                                    For our annual data, we follow

Burnside, Eichenbaum                    and Rebelo and use the values of the quarterly shocks from the previous

year. That is, the instruments                    used in year t are the 4 quarterly innovations                       to nonborrowed

reserves and the 4 quarterly innovations                           to the federal funds rate from year t-1.

            The third problem encountered in this type of estimation is the measurement                                        of capital

services.          Frequently,        estimation of a value added production                         function with capital and labor

inputs results in a zero or even negative coefficient for capital.                                     This contrasts with the long

run capital share of around .36.                      One longstanding               interpretation     is that the flow of capital

services is not the same as the capital stock and instead reflects the utilization of this factor.

Recently, Burn side, Eichenbaum                                       and Rebelo dd                    with this point by using electricity

consumption                as a proxy for capital services.                                   We follow this approach in our estimation as well

though we also report results using the capital stock.

               Our data-set was obtained from a variety of sources. Annual 2-digit value added,

capital, and labor series were obtained from Hall and are discussed in detail in Hall [1988].

These series run from 1952 to 1986. The annual 2-digit data on sectoral electricity

consumption                runs from 1972 to 1992 and was obtained from Burn side, Eichenbaum                                                                                 and

Rebelo. The quarterly series on innovations                                                 to the federal funds rate and to non-borrowed

reserves runs from 1960 to 1992. These series were also obtained from Bum side, Eichenbaum

and Rebelo.                Thus, unless reported otherwise, our results use annual data for 1972-86.

              Using data for US manufacturing,                                         we estimate (13) for a number of different

specifications              using Seemingly Unrelated Regressions.’0                                                  For all of these regressions,                              all

coefficient except the constants are forced to be equal across sectors. 11 Here we use value

added as our output measure as it conforms to the theoretical model we have specified.

Further, the model assumes perfect competition and thus we are not interested in estimating

markups.            Therefore,              some of the criticisms of Hall [1988] raised by Basu-Fernald                                                                  [1995] do

not directly pertain.                      However, for completeness                                   we also report results using gross output

rather than value added data. Also, in keeping with a deterministic                                                            growth model, we linearly

detrend the data. 12 Though again we include some results from a specification in growth rates

for comparison with related work in the literature.

               Table 1 summarizes our empirical results.                                       The first row of Table 1 reports the results

obtained from using ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate our system of sectoral production

functions with electricity consumption                                    used as a proxy for capital services. Note that both

forms of complementarities                              are significant. The estimate of the contemporaneous

complementarily                 is fairly large and we find decreasing returns to scale with regards to own

inputs with a labor coefficient of only .31. Burnside, Eichenbaum                                                              and Rebelo also find

relatively low values for the labor coefficient (see their Table 4) using annual manufacturing

data. However,                the results are not directly comparable as we are using a value added measure

of output and our data is linearly detrended while they use gross output and first difference

their data.

               Though it is likely that these results are biased due to the correlation between inputs,

aggregate output and the productivity                                     shock as well as the presence of a lagged dependent

variable among the right hand side variables, we include the OLS results for completeness.

The next row attempts to correct for these biases by using an instrumental                                                                  variable procedure.

               Row 2 presents results from the three stage least squares estimation where all

coefficients across sectors are constrained to be equal. The use of the instruments                                                                     raised the

coefficient on labor and lowers the coefficient on electricity considerably.                                                                The external effects

parameter,            ●,     is .62 which is still quite high relative to other studies (summarized below) while

the dynamic complementarily                               parameter is basically unaffected by the use of instruments.

             One concern with these results is that the lagged output term is simply picking up the

serial correlation in a productivity                             shock.           However,             the contemporanwus                       and lagged output

terms are being instrumented                              with lagged measures of monetary innovations which are, by

construction,              independent of the lagged technology shocks.                                            We investigated                this further by

lagging the instrument set an additional year. The results are reported in Table 1 in row 3,

IV-lagged.              Here again we find significant complementarities                                               though the coefficient estimates

are clearly sensitive to the instrument list. 13

             Row 4 (Dyn. Only) focuses attention on the dynamic complementarily                                                                    by forcing            ●   =0.

Here too, the instruments                         are lagged two years as in row 3. In this case, we find constant

returns to scale with the coefficients on labor and electricity much closer to the observed factor

shares for labor and capital.                          Note that again there is evidence of a significant dynamic

complementarily.

             We also investigate the importance of proxying for capital services through the

inclusion of electricity.                      Row 5, IV-capital, presents the instrumental                                        variables estimates when

the capital stock is used instead of electricity.                                        Here, as expected the coefficient on capital is

essentially zero and that on labor is lower than in the row 2 specification while the estimates of

the complementarities                      are a bit larger. A natural conjecture would be that the contemporaneous

complementarily                   was partially picking                    Up   unmeasured factor utilization so that the inclusion of

electricity would bring down the estimate of that coefficient a lot. That is, the row 2 estimate

of the contemporaneous     complementarily         coefficient should be much lower than the row 5

estimate.   It is quite surprising that the estimate drops so little, though it is possible that there

still remains unmeasured     factor utilization.    One way of addressing this issue further is to force

constant returns to scale in own inputs and see if the coefficient on the contemporaneous

externality remains significant.

        The final row in Table 1, IV-CRS, is a regression in the spirit of Baxter-King                   [1991]

that forces constant returns to scale.     To do so, we create an input measure from a weighted

average of labor (.64) and electricity (.36).         This input measure is subtracted from output to

create a measure of the Solow residual which is then regressed on the two complementarities.

The results provide additional support for the presence of both complementarities:                 the

coefficient estimate for the contemporaneous          complementarily     is .24 (.024) and .32 (.018) for

the dynamic complementarily.

        Overall the results reported in Table 1 paint a fairly consistent picture in terms of the

magnitudes of the production complementarily            parameters.     In particular,   there is evidence in

favor of both dynamic and contemporaneous             complementarities     in all of the specifications.

Put differently,   we reject the hypothesis of no complementarities           in all specifications.     The

estimate of the dynamic complementarily            seems fairly robust to specification     while the estimate

of the contemporaneous     complementarily         is much more sensitive. It should be recognized

though that this evidence simply shows that these complementarities              are present in a very

reduced form sense.     Clearly, there is no attempt here to discriminate          the many potential

sources of complementarily      as alternative models.
                                                                                                                19

(ii) Con~parisonto other S!udies

        A number of other studies have attempteci to estimate production                   functions with

productive complementarities.            These are of the general form of (8), however they all force

y =0. This corresponds     to the assumption that there is no dynamic complementarily.

        One approach that is closest to ours is Caballero-Lyons                [1992] who report estimates of

three stage least squares exercises for the following system


                              Yj/=e ‘jf+ ‘Y ,“ ‘j,                                                          (14)

They report an estimate of      ●   = .32.

        Baxter-King    [199 1] estimates (10) using data on total private industry rather than

manufacturing.    Their OLS estimate of ~ was .33 under the restriction of constant returns to

scale. Using a variety of instruments                they obtain estimates of ~ ranging from .09 to .45.

        Braun-Evans    [1991], use seasonal variations in order to jointly estimate a

contemporaneous     production complementarily                along with labor hoarding.    Using a method of

moments procedure they jointly estimate their model and find ~=.24.                    Note that their model

did include unobserved variations in the utilization of labor.
                                                                                                                                                              20

             Cooper-Hal tiwanger [1996] also use seasonal variations (the data was monthly) as an

instrument in regressions of sectoral output (industrial production)                                                on labor input find evidence

of short run increasing returns to labor in total manufacturing                                               and in many 2-digit sectors.

Further, adding manufacturing                         output as another independent variable, Cooper-Haltiwanger

find large and statistically significant contemporaneous                                        complementarities               in many sectors.

Note though that these results did not include electricity or other proxies for capiti                                                        utilization.

             In a recent paper, Burnside explores the presence of complementarities                                                   acting through

employment             rather than output.             He finds no evidence for this form of a complementarily,

Basu-Fernald             [1995] presents similar findings using aggregate input growth as the externality.

We have experimented                     with a specification using lagged employment                                   and contemporaneous

output as reported in the first row of Table 2. Again we find support for complementarities

though the lagged complementarily                               through labor is quite small. 14

             One concern with our evidence and that provided in these other studies is the use of

value added as a measure of output.                              As noted earlier, Basu-Fernald                        [1995] argue that in the

presence of imperfectly competitive markets, value added production                                                     functions may be

misspecified.             We considered two specifications                          (rows 2 and 3 of Table 2,1V-Gross and IV-

Gross-Growth)               in which the output measure was gross output rather than value added using,

again, labor and electricity as inputs.                            The data covers the 1972-92 period. The two

specifications differ in the method of detrending,                                       where Iv-Gross           used linear detrending and

IV-Gross-Growth                  uses growth rates. The main problem with this regression is that materials is

excluded though it is a significant input into gross output.          Burnside, Eichenbaum        and Rebelo

assume that gross output is a hontief       function of value added and materials.           Under this

assumption,     the regression is not misspecified.     There are two things to note from our

regression results.    First, as in our other specifications,      the hypothesis of no complementarities

is rejected.    Second, note that the results from the IV-Gross specification and those reported in

row 2 of Table 1 should, under the fixed coefficient hypothesis,              be the same but clearly this is

not the case. This seems, to us, to indicate problems with the fixed coefficient hypothesis.

(iii) Microccononjic    Evidence

        To supplement our estimates based on aggregate data, we have also explored the

relevance of contemporaneous       and dynamic complementarities          at the plant level.    The data set

is the Longitudinal    Research Database (LRD) which provides plant level data for U.S.

manufacturing.      For this analysis, we estimated the production           functions for automobile

assembly plants (sector 3711).      Our panel consisted of the 48 plants that were continuously

operating over the 1972-89 period.       We used real value added as our dependent variable, total

production worker hours as a measure of labor input and electricity consumption                  at the plant as

a proxy for the flow of services from capital.

        The use of panel data is particularly     challenging due to the presence of structural

heterogeneity    across the plants and the measurement of capital services.             For the estimation,

we assume that the basic production function for real valued added is Cobb-Douglas                  with

capital and labor as inputs.    This production function may, in general, be subject to plant

specific and common shocks.        Further, the plant   specific    shocks    can   represent, at one extreme,

structural heterogeneity    and, at the other, temporary plant specific shocks to the production
                                                                                                                                                                     22

process. In our estimation,                     weallow          forplant        specific unobsemable                heterogeneity             througha

fixed effects estimation strategy.

            In terms of the measurement                         of capital services, we use elwtricity                       consumption                 at the

plant as a proxy. Thus, a plant that utilizes its capital more intensively,                                               say due to the addition

of a second shift, would then require more electricity input. This proxy may still miss

improvements             to capital quality which make the machines more productive                                               without requiring

additional energy input, Our measure of output is real valued added which we construct at the

plant level given data on shipments and changes in finished goods inventories,                                                         deflated by a

shipments price index, less deflated material purchases. The data are in logs and are not

detrended.

            The results are summarized in Table 3. All of the specifications                                               included fixed effects

through the use of plant specific dummies as indicated in the table. The first specification had

labor input as the only independent variable. The point estimate of .86 indicates some short

run increasing returns in that this coefficient exceeds labor share in this sector.                                                         Without the

fixed effects included, this point estimate is .99 with a standard error of .02 (not reported in

the table) indicating the expected omitted variable bias.’5 The second column provides

estimates from a specification                       that is close to that used in our aggregate regressions:                                        labor and

electricity are the only inputs.                         Here we see that the coefficient on labor input is lower

presumably          because it was reflecting unmeasured utilization of capital. The point estimates of

these coefficient sum of 1.06 and we are unable to reject constant returns to scale.                                                            This

                                                                                                          23

evidence seems quite consistent with that presented by Burn side, Eichenbau m and Rebelo

[1995].

          The next two columns present our estimates of contemporaneous           and lagged

complementarities     for this sector using xctoral    output as the source of this external effect.

Here we see additional support for both types of complementarities           in this sector.   In fact, the

point estimate of the coefficient on contemporaneous         output seems incredibly large.        This

could reflect the presence of common shocks,          a common trend or unobsened         factor

utilization that is not correlated with electricity use,

          On the issue of detrending,    the estimates thus far are for raw data. Thus, a common

deterministic    trend in productivity   could lie behind the estimated complementarities,         To

capture this, we added a time trend to our set of independent variables. Thus the sectoral

output measures would reflect complementarities          that are not perfectly correlated with time.

The last two columns of Table 3 show our results.          For both columns (5) and (6), the

contemporaneous      complementarily     IS significant and reasonably close to the aggregate results.

The coefficient on the lagged complementarily         terms is now much lower than in the

regressions without the time trend and is also not significantly different from zero.           Thus it

appears that the inclusion of the year drives the coefficient on lagged sectoral output to zero.

Interestingly,   the coefficient on electricity has also fallen to zero.

          We also experimented     with a specification that is outside of our model in which the

lagged level of plant output is included instead of lagged sectoral output.         This captures

learning by doing that is internal to the plant.      For this regression,   which included the time

trend as well, the coefficient on own lagged output is .2 (.02) and the coefficient on
                                                                                                                                                            24

contemporaneous              sectoral output is .26 (.06).                       Thus we sw evidence of internal learning by

doing. ]b Bahk and Gort [1993] find evidence of learning in their study of plant level data as

well.

(iv) Monle Carlo fiercises

           To evaluate our estimation procedure,                            we carried out a Monte Carlo exercise. Since we

use the standard real business cycle model as the data generating mechanism,                                                            it is best to

contrast these results with the more aggregate evidence provided in Table 1, Put differently,

our simulations do not include the rich heterogeneity                                      prevalent in the plant level data and in

the results reported in Table 3.

           Our objective is to address the following concern.                                       If the economy had neither

contemporaneous             nor dynamic complementarities                              would an OLS estimation procedure on

aggregate data nonetheless find significant complementarities?                                                  Though we have stressed

results using IV estimation,                 the OLS results in this and other papers are also interesting to the

extent that there is concern over the validity of the instruments.

           To address this question, we use the basic neoclassical real business cycle model with

p~             technology shocks (eg. King, Plosser and Rebelo [1988a]) and no complementarities

in production         to generate 100 simulated series on capital, labor and output, each of length 100

periods.’7       A number of regressions were run with these data. The results reported below are

the means and standard deviations of the parameter distribution.

           With these data, we followed Baxter and King by regressing output on an index of

inputs (x).            Using an OLS procedure we find an average coefficient on inputs of 2.16 with a

standard error of .0785. This implies a value of the contemporaneous                                                          complementanty                 (~) of

.54 even though the data was generated by an economy without any contemporaneous

complementarily.18                     The bias reflects the contemporaneous                               correlation betw~n                    the shock and

xl.

               In a second regression using the same data, we added lagged output as another

explanatory variable.                     The coefficient on lagged output was estimated at -.0344 which was not

significantly different from zero, while the estimate of contemporaneous                                                            effects was .55, again

sign ificantl y different from zero,                          Overall, there is a tendency to find a contemporaneous

complementarily                  when it isn’ t there but no such bias in the estimate of the dynamic

complemen tarity.

               As one might expect, if the data is generated using a taste shock instead of a technology

shock, there is no correlation between capital and labor and the errors so that the production

function is estimated without bias.                             This just confirms the point that in the presence of

powerful instruments,                     there would be no bias in the estimation of the production                                              function

directly.

(v) Summary

               In summary,             using either aggregate or plant level data, we see evidence against the

hypothesis that neither contemporaneous                                   nor dynamic complementarities                             are present. This is

true for 2-digit data and at the plant level for sector 3711. In terms of the parameterization                                                                      of

our production     function, we work with a number of different specifications        and discuss how

sensitive the results are to alternative parametenzations.      While the parameters of the

production     function change across treatments,    the other parameters of the model remain

unchanged. These are reported in the following section.

b. Other Parameters

        As noted earlier, since our goal is in part of evaluate the effects of dynamic

complementarities     relative to a well-known benchmark,       we have chosen our parameters to be

close to those used by King, Plosser and Rebelo.         In particular,   we set the utility function

parameter (x) so that the average fraction of time spent working is .2 Further,            6 equals     10%

and ~ is chosen so that the real rate of interest is 6.5% on an annual basis,

        The model includes two stochastic variables: technology and taste shocks.              For

comparison purposes,      we set the standard deviation of the both the technology and taste shocks

at .0075.    The level of this standard deviation is actually immaterial      since we only report

correlations and relative standard deviations and make no attempt to compare the level of

volatility in our economy with observation.

v. Results


        In what follows we use three estimates of the production technology.            The first is the

conventional    model without complementarities       and assuming constant returns to scale with

labor’s share set at .64. The other specifications retain internal constant returns to scale but

allow for external effects.    In particular,   the second specification is from. row 4 of Table 1 in

which the dynamic complementarities         parameter is estimated at .37 and there are no
                                                                                                                       27

contemporaneous     effects.   The final specification is from row 6 of Table 1 where we force

constant returns to scale and allow for both forms of externalities                to be present.

        For each of these parameterizations,                 there are two treatments:    iid taste shocks and iid

technology shocks. Our principal findings are summarized in Tables 4 and 5, for technology

and taste shocks respectively.       In addition, Figures 1-6 present the impulse response functions

for the various treatments.

        Our analysis emphasizes the main macroeconomic                     variables of interest: consumption,

investment,   hours, output and the capital stock,               In addition, we focus on the implications        of

our economies for the “SOIOWresidual”.                 Previous real business studies typically calculate a

Solow residual from a production         function without any complementarities,                i.e.


                    SR ~-log(Y,)-$ log (Kt)-   a log (Nt).                                                       (17)



These studies generally find a highly persistent productivity                shock process which is positively

correlated with output. As we shall see, this Solow residual will display considerable

persistence even if the true exogenous process is iid when there are dynamic complementarities

in the production   technology which have been ignored. Since we are emphasizing                         endogenous

mechanisms of persistence,       we present the moments of SRt for various models.

(i) Technology Shocks

       Row 1 of Table 4 summarizes the moments for the basic real business cycle model with

iid technology shocks. As is well known, this model reproduces some of the basic features of

the business cycle such as procyclical productivity                and consumption       smoothing.    It also does

well in capturing the stylized fact that investment is more volatile than output, which is more
                                                                                                       28

volatile than consumption.    However, the baseline model does poorly on a number of accounts.

Compared to the moments for postwar US data (last row), hours are too procyclical and

consumption    not enough. Further, the model generates virtually no endogenous persistence;

thus the need to rely on persistent shocks to match the data better.      The impulse response

functions for this parameterization   and a 1% technology shock, Figures la and lb, confirm

this basic feature:   the only significant action in the variables occurs in the period of the

temporary shock.      As explained below, note that employment      is actually below steady state as

capital is above its steady state value during the transition.

        As seen from row 2 of Table 4, the economy with dynamic complementarities              displays

a significant amount of persistent:    the serial correlation in output has risen to .72.   As

expected, the increased persistence increases the standard deviation of consumption         relative to

output while reducing the volatility of employment      relative to output.   Note from the table that

the Solow residual is highly correlated with output and has an autocorrelation        coefficient of

.69. The propagation     of the initial technology shock comes from the effects of accumulated

human capital on the production process.      That is, the burst of activity caused by the initial

productivity   shock increases the stock of human capital in the following period and thus creates

a basis for increased work, consumption     and investment in future periods.

        The impulse response functions in Figures 2a and 2b indicate this richer response to the

temporary productivity    shock.   From Figure 2a, note that output and the Solow residual all

remain above stead y state levels for at least 15 periods.   Employment       is above steady state for

the first 8 periods and then drops below the steady state. This behavior of employment           reflwts

the interaction of the two state variables, physical and human capital.       As seen in Figure 2b,
                                                                                                             29

the burst of productivity     causes both physical and human capital to rise and both are above

steady state for the 15 periods shown in the figure.       However,    the impact of these variables on

employment is somewhat complicated.           As is well understood (see King, Plosser and Rebelo

[1988a] for a detailed explanation),     employment     is below steady state during the transitional

dynamics of the neoclassical growth model if the physical capital stock is above steady state.

This is essentially the response of employment        to the relatively low intertemporal       return caused

by the large capital stock.     For the economy with dynamic complementarities,           there is an

additional influence from the large stock of human capital:         the increased human capital causes

agents to work more.        Thus, for the initial 7 periods, the employment    increasing effect of the

larger stock of human capital dominates and then the transitional dynamics take over.

        The economy with both con temporaneous          and dynamic complementarities           contains both

elements of magnification      and propagation.    As in the Baxter-King economy,         the

contemporaneous      complementarily     magnifies the technology shock.      From row 3 of Table 4,

the standard deviation of output is much larger for this economy than the others.               Further,   the

propagation     of the shock is actually stronger even though the parameter of the dynamic

complementarit y is lower in this parameterization       than in the previous economy.          Not

surprisingly,   consumption    is even more volatile and employment      less volatile.

        The interaction of these two influences is brought out in the impulse response functions

for this economy, Figures 3a and 3b. Note first that, relative to Figure 2a, the effect of the

technology shock in period 1 is much larger for the economy with both types of

complementarities.      Further, we see that employment       stays above its steady state value longer

for this parameterization     reflecting the large buildup in the stock of human capital (Figure 3b).
                                                                                                          30

(ii) Taste Shocks

        Table 5 reports the implications   of an iid taste shock instead of an iid technology shock.

A taste shock causes changes in the marginal rate of substitution between consumption               and

leisure. The increased urgency to consume should lead to more volatile consumption              and

relatively less procyclical labor hours as well as a tendency to substitute consumption         for

investment,   compared to the results from an iid technology shock.        This intuition is borne out

in row 1 of Table 5 and in the impulse responses, Figures 4-6.

        This effect of a taste shock is clear from the behavior of consumption         and investment

given in Figure 4. At the time of the taste shock, consumption         rises sharply to the point that

investment is negative (agents consume their capital).     At the same time they substitute

between consumption     and leisure: hours worked increases and output is higher.         In the periods

after the shock, consumption    is below steady state levels and investment is above, in an effort

to build up the capital stock. The lower than steady state capital stock yields lower output

despite hours worked remaining above their steady state level along the transition path.              These

negative correlations are brought out in the statistics reported in Table 5. Further,        note that

both consumption    and investment are more volatile than output.        Similar patterns are reported

by Baxter-King though they focus too on an economy with serially correlated taste shocks.

       In the model with dynamic complementarities,       the propagation      effect is displayed once

more as the serial correlation in output rises to .85. Further,   the serial correlation in the

Solow residual (mismeasured     as it ignores the complementarities)      is also .85. Still, the

negative correlations   from the baseline model remain.     From the impulse responses shown in

Figure 5, the dynamic complementarities     actually prolong the expansion associated with the
                                                                                                       31

taste shock as output is above steady state for 3 periods.      Hours stay above steady state

throughout reflecting the fact that capital is below steady state following the reduction in

investment at the time of the taste shock,

        The model with both dynamic and contemporaneous            complementarities   displays much

richer dynamics around the steady state.       As indicated in Figure 6, in the impact period, hours,

output and consumption        rise while investment is negative, Despite the lower capital stock,

output remains high for about 12 periods because of the presence of the increased stock of

“human capital”.        From Figure 6a, the measured Solow residual is well above steady state

through 12 periods as well.       At the same time, consumption    is below, and investment above,

its steady state level during the transition in order to build back the capital stock as in the

neoclassical model.       Since both hours worked and human capital are falling, output eventually

goes below its steady state level while the capital is being built up. This can be seen clearly in

Figure 6b,

VI. Conclusions


        Our goal in this paper was to explore the quantitative implications       of dynamic

complementarities.       In our economy, the standard dynamic stochastic growth model is

supplemented    by the presence of two complementarities.       One, as in Baxter and King, acting

as a contemporaneous        link across agents and a second, as in Durlauf, providing an

intertemporal   link.    To us, the key question was whether this type of model could generate

endogenous propagation        of shocks for empirical 1y reasonable parameters.

        As a consequence,      the paper contains a lengthy discussion of the estimation of these
                                                                                                         32

parameters,   including some Monte Carlo exercises.        Overall, we do find evidence of a

dynamic complementarily       that we are able to distinguish from persistence in technology

shocks.    Our quantitative   exercises indicate that these complementarities,      working together,

can magnify and propagate shocks to technology and tastes.

          There is much more work to be done along these lines.       First, the construction    of

explicit models in which dynamic (rather than static) complementarities           play a role is clearly of

important to go beyond the “black-box” specification employed here.              Second, these effects

should be integrated into richer models of a demand impulse rather than relying on taste

shocks as a source of fluctuations.     Finally, an alternative model in which learning by doing is

internal [o the firm bears some consideration      in light of our empirical findings at the plant

level and those reported by Bahk and Gort [1993],
