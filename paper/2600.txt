              Promises,   Promises:   Credible Policy Reform via Signaling

                                         ABSTRACT

     Empirical experience and theory both suggest that policy reforms con he

aborted or reversed if they lack sufficient credibility.         One reason for such

credibility    problems   is the legitimate   doubt regarding how serious the

government really is about the reform process.         This paper considers a

framework in which the private sactor is unable to distinguish between a

genuinely reformist governmant and its nemesis, a government which simply

feigns interest in reform because        it is a precondition for foreign assistance,

The general conclusion is that the rate        t which reforms   are introduced any

serve to convey the government's        future intentions, and hence act as a signal

of its "type".     More specifically, credible policy reform may require going

overboard: the governmentwill have to go much farther         than it would have

chosen to in the absence of the credibility problem.

                                    Dani Rodrik



I. Introduction

    A   government initiates a series of important reforms, including trade and

financial liberalization    and disinflation policies.   But the private aector

(and poaaibly foreign creditors) do not fully believe that the reforms will

peraiat.    Should the government attempt to enhance its credibility?    How can

it do ao?   What are the consequences for the economy and the reform process if

it is unable to?

     Experience and theory both suggest that lack of credibility can be very

coatly indeed.     For an important example, conaider orthodox policiea of

disinflation that rely on sharp reductions in monetary growth.      Unlesa the

private sector remaina fully convinced that the monetary contrection will

continue, the result may well be wages and prices sut    t   tuo high a level

relative to the future stock of monetary aggregates      The consequent reduction

in real liquidity will then exert strong recessionary litres.      A conceptually

similar outcome obtaina in the case of trade- liberalizing reforms lacking

credibility.     When a future reversal of the liberalization   is anticipated, the

private aector will tend to over-borrow from abroad, running "too large" a

deficit on the current account (Calvo, 1986; see also van Wijnbergen, 1985).

In both caaea, the adverse consequences of the lack of credibility could be

serioua enough to force even the best-intentioned    government   to abort the

reform proceaa, thereby validating    the suspicions of the private sector.

     More generally, as Calvo (1986) has pointed out, lack of credibility ia

functionally equivalent to a distortion    in the structure of intertemporal

relative pricea: economic agenta baae their actions on pricea which differ
                                            -2-
from   those that will materielize if the refotm is carried out to fruition.

The presence of this distortion in turn otestes e second-best environment,

with all the ususl second-best complications.           Hence the reform itself, while

beneficial on its    owrt,   may lead to losses in overall welfare if perceived as

lacking sufficient    credibility.     Similarly,   there may he a second-best role

for introducing additional       distortions in the economy to the extent that these

either offset the distortions associated with the problem or enhance the

government   s credibility.

                 the appropriate policy stance in such a context requires
       Deterrining

knowledgs of the sources of the credibility gap. The question is: why would
the public fear that the policy reforms will be reversed dssfljqf the
governmenc'a assurances to the contrary?          Answers   to this question based   on

rational behavior fall under three broad categories,1
     First, the government's reforma may be inconsistent          with other polities

being pursued simultaneously,       and be recognized    as auth by the puhlic.

Examplea of auth situations       abound.   Trade reform in the presents of pegged

exchange rates (with prices sticky downwards) will not be viable, as the

thilean case has demonstrated.        Similarly, disinflationary     policies which do

not concurrently tackle the public-sector budget deficit will lank

credibility,   irrespective of whether orthodox or heterodox         measurss are

utilized.    The establishment of "target zones" for major currencies will not



1, Salvo (1986, pp. 27-29) suggests an additional explanation not considered
here, namely that policy announcements can never be as complete ma the
complications of the economy dictate, and hence must almost always auffer from
an inherent lack of credibility. I exclude this consideration hers because it
seems to me to be of second-order importance compared to the others to be
discussed.
                                       -3-


be a solution to exchange-rate volatility unless the governments concerned

undertake the requisite monetary-fiscal      policy combinations to maintain their

exchange rates within the appropriate bands.       In all these cases, policy

reform does not pass the credibility test because the public understands that

it violates budget constrainta or accounting identities.

     Secondly,   there might be a genuine time-inconsistency    problem for the

government: its optimal ex-post strategy may differ from its optimal ex-ante

strategy.   For example, once the private sector sets wages and prices, the

authorities may find it tempting to disinflate less than they had promised in

order to get some output gains (Barro and Cordon, 1983).       Similar temptations

to "surprise" the private sector may exist with trade policy as well (see

Staiger and Tabellini, 1987).    In circumstances where    the authorities have an

ex-post incentive to renege on their promises, it is of course perfectiy

rational for private agents to discount announcements of future policy

reforms--or assurances of the continuation of present reforms.        Potential

solutions to the time-inconsiatency   problem can be found in commitments and

reputation-building,   neither of which, however, will do the job costleasly.

Commitments have the disadvantage of tying the government's hands against

unforeseen contingencies   in which freedom of action would have been desirable

cx ante (see Rodrik and Zeckhauser, 1987).       Reputations can be built only by

using up valuable time.

     The final source of credibility problems is incomplete or asymmetric

information: private agents may not be able to tell how serious the government

really is about the reform process.    In other words, they may be in the dark

about the true objectives of the government in power, or may "confuse" it with

an alternative government whose objectives differ.       Imperfect   information of
                                        -4-

this sott is likely to he particulsrly prevslent        in countries where

governments (and finance ministers)    rotate rapidly, and in developing

countries in particular.     Notice that this is radically different from the

time- inconsistency case above where the private sector understands          the

government's motivations    only too well.    The resolution of the credibility

problem in such instances will requite the government to "signal" its true

type.     Whether this is good policy or not will in turn depend on the cost of

investing in the appropriate signal.

        The present paper is concerned with this lest type of ccedibility

problem.     The framework I will consider is one in which the private sector is

unable to distinguish between a govemnment intent on trade reform end one

which simply feigns interest in reform because this is a precondition for

direly needed foreign aid.     The general message that will come acroee is that

the rate at which the reform is introduced may serve to convey the

government's    future intentions, and hence act as a signal of ita "type".        Note

specifically, credible policy reform will requite going overboard: the
govetnment will have to go much further than it would have chosen to in the
absence of the credibility problem. In the case considered here, the reform-
minded    government will buy credibility by not only eliminating protection, but

actually subsidizins imports (exports)   .    This   provides a solution to the

credibility problem in that the reformist government's nemesis would never

find it advantageous to go as far.     Signaling in this faahion is of course

costly, and its ultimate desirability will depend on a number of factors.

But, and this is the key point, achieving credibility will always require a

igrggr policy reform than would have been dictated in the absence of the

credibility problem.2

     The model to be analyzed below contraata the behavior of a "libetalizing"

government with that of a "rediatributive"    government.   The former valuea

trade reform because of the uaual allocative efficiency gains to derived

therefrom, and intends to atick with the liberalization.     The latter uaea

tariff revenues to redistribute income to favored groups in society, end, due

to the absence of alternative policies, prefers some protection to none.        I


sssume, as is usually the case, that trade liberalization    is supported by

foreign assistance from mulrilsrersl    institutions, with the aid conditional on

rhe launching of the reform.   This is a crucial part of the story.     Since

foreign assistance may well provide a motive for the "redistributive'

government to mimic the "liberalizer" for awhile, the puhlic csnnot be

entirely sure in the initial stages of the reform ss to which sort of

government it faces.   Consequently,   governmentsl assursnces thst the reform

will not be reversed in the future are taken with a reasonable grain of salt.

Notice that foreign aid results in s hidden cost: by skewing the incentives of

the "redistributive"   government, it makes it more difficult for the

 liberalizing" government to reveal its true iype.

     The outline of the paper is as follows,    Section TI lays out the basic




2. This conclusion is consistent with the apparent empirical regularity that
trade reforms are more likely to be successful when they are undertaken
wholesale and in such a wey as to create a major break with the past. A
recent review of 37 liberalization episodes in 19 tountries concludes that
"the likelihood of survival of a liberelization atterpt is substantially
higher where the initial policy measures undertsken are major and significant:
halting or hesitating policy sctions leading to s very gradual liberalization
are much more likely to cause a collapse. This is particularly true in
instances of countries (characteristic of most of Latin America) in which the
history restrictions on trade is long and pervasive" (Papageorgiou, Michaely
and Choksi, 1986). The authors conjecture that this sight be partly due to
reasons having to do with crsdibility.

model and discusses          the costs engendeced by the lack of ccadibility.         In our

case,    the costs are roflected in sub-optimal levels of investment, aa private

savings fall in anticipation of higher prices for imported goods in the

future.     In section III, the sources of the credibility problea ace examined

by introducing a "redistributive" government with an objective function that

differs fcom that of the "liberalizer".                  Section IV analyzes the circumstances

under which "separating" and "pooling" equilibriawill occur, and discusses

the likely benefits          (and costs) of achieving credibility        for the

"liberalizing"      government via signaling that leads to "separation".

Concluding observations are offered in section V.



II. The Costs of Lsck of Credibility

        We start with a stylized model of an economy that allows a relatively

straightforward          analysis of credibility issues.         To focus on the new issues,

we will abstract from many real-world aspects.                  In particular, the assumption

will be that the domestic economy produces a single good which is not consumed

at home, and that all consumption and investment goods are imported.                  To

incorporate the dynamic considerations              raised above, we will look at a two-

period model.       Since trade reform will typically take place under conditions

of either capital-account restrictions or credit rationing abroad, capital

flows will be assumed to be non-existent save for the possibility of foreign

aid.     The domestic economy is taken to be small in world markets, and all

world prices will be fixed at unity by an appropriate choice of units.

        Let f(k,   .2)    and F(k+i,   .2)   be the production functions for domestic output

in the first and second period, respectively, and i be first-period

investment. (Given the two-period horizon, there will be no investment                 in the
                                                           -7-

second period.)              The economy's fixed and fully-employed initial endowments of

capital and labor are denoted by k and 1.                          The level of investment   in the

economy is determined by maximizing the present discounted value of net

benefits of investment:


        max      (SF(k+i,        .2)
                                       -
                                            i],
         1.




where    S is the domestic discount factor (one over one plus the nominal

interest rate).              I   will assume throughout that imports of investment goods are

not subject to tariffs, so that the domestic and world prices of investment

goods are identical and fixed at unity.                          Notice that since all producer prices

are fixed (and independent of tariffs), changes in & will correspond directly

to changes in the                 j. interest rate relevant to investment decisions.

Solving the above maximization problem yields


(I)     &F1(k+i,       .2)
                             -
                                 1         0,


where    the     numbered subscript denotes a partial derivative with respect to the

relevsnt variable.                   This defines an implicit investment function of the form

i     i(S), with


        di/d&         i'(.) —          -F1/(&F11) >   0,

since the production function is concave in N.                          Desired investment rises mm

the discount factor increases                     (or the interest rate falls) since future gains

in output become more valued relative to present consumption.

        Consumers are represented by a two-period expenditure function E(l+t,

&(l+T),       IJ),   where W denotes welfare, and t and T denote first- and second-
                                                         -8-

period tariffs, resperrively.                  This function gives the present discounted

value of expenditures required to achieve welfere level P when first- and

second-period          prices are       l+t   and LeT.    Notice that the second-period price is
discounted by 8, and that the                        discount factor for consurers              is given by

        q         8(l±T)/(l-4-t).

The    consumption rate          of interest is in turn           a    negative function    of    q, and can
be expressed as (l/qi               -
                                        I),   This interteaporal          relative price will play a

cruciel role throughout the analysis, as it                       is    the chief detorrinant of

savings behavior.

        The levels of consumption in the two periods can be derived by taking the

appropriate partial derivatives of the expenditure funcrioc:


(2)     c     E1(.)        (first-period consumption),

(3)     C     E2C)         (second-period       consumption).


Since       all    consumption goods are imported, a              tariff is here       equivalent to an
economy-wide consumption tax.                  And   since     tariff   revenue will he     redistributed
in    lump-sumfashion back to the private sector,                       tariffs will    not give       rise to
their usual static efficiency costs in the present framework. As the costs of
protection are well known, little harm is done in abstracting from them in
order       to concentrate on intertemporsl sources of welfare losses arising purely

from    credibility problems.             Of course,      in   the absence      of static efficiency
coats,      the "liberalizing"          government would have formally no reason to remove

protection.           Keeping such costs        in   the background,       we   will   assume   that    it will
want to pursue          trade reform nonetheless.

        Equilibrium        in   the economy requires intertemporal equality between
                                                    -9-


aggregate      income (net of investment           spending> and consumption expenditures:


(4)   E(.) —


where Y represents the present discountedvalue of net income:


(5)   Y   —   f(k,2)   -   i + tc + B +     8[F(k+i,2) + TGJ.


First-period      income consists of production revenues net of investment

expenditures      plus tariff revenue                a foreign transfer of amount B which is

contingent on first-period trade reform.                   Notice that foreign assistance is

taken to come in the form of a grant rather than a loan (i.e. it is not paid

back>; this is to simplify the algebra only and will not affect the

qualitative results.             Second-period     income in turn consists of second-period

production and tariff revenues.

      Since foreign borrowing/lending               is ruled out, equilibrium also requires

equality between income and expenditure                   in each period separately.   Given   (4),

one of these two conditions              is redundant      and we choose to express the first-

period constraint only:


(6)   (l+t)c =     f(k,.2)   -    i   + tc + S.


This equates first-period domestic savings to investment expenditures.

Equations (4) and (6) together will determine                   the welfare level W and the

discount factor & (or the interest rate).

      Now consider a trade reform,                The government reduces t to zero and

promises that in the second period T will be zero as well.                    This clears the

way for foreign aid.          But suppose that the public does not believe that the

reform will be maintained.              The underlying determinants of this lack of
                                                -10-

credibility will be discussed later.             For the moment, assume rbat consumers

are risk-neutral, and char they act in the certainty that the future level of

tsriffs will be given by t >          0.    We will first treat T parametrically, and

then endogenire it in the sections to come.

      What are the consequences of the lack of credibility?                The anticipation

that tariffs will increase in the future reduces the real consumption rate of

interest (raises the reel consumption discount factor)                 and hence depresses

first-period     savings.      In response, investment has to fell, and welfare is

reduced due to a sub-optimal level of investment.

      T.o   see these effect at work, we analyze the comparative statics of the

model (with r=0),        Differentiating      (4) end (6) end making the appropriate

substitutions,    we first express the response of the reel discount factor                 (q)

to changes in t:


(?)   0 <    dq/dt — (S/[l±])       < 6,


where


             ({l+t/i'] N6E22(l             t(SE2w/[E1w + EE2w]flì >0.

due to a reduction in          5.   (In the absence of changes in 6, dq/dt would have

equalled 6,)      That   is,    S   8(t) with dS/dt < 0.         The welfare level, in turn,

is directly related to the consumption rate of interest:

(9)      dW/dt —                          s    0.



This expression is unambigiously                    negstive whenever evaluated st sn initially

positive level of t.            But when the credibility problem is "small", the

associated welfare losses are of second order of importance.                                An explicit

expression for the welfare losses associated with the lack of credibility can

he found via a first-order Taylor approximation.3                           Letting Ak a W(t)      -

producers make           jl    of rheir decisions in rhe iirst period; the second period's

consumption level is entirely determined by previous investment snd saving

decisions.            Consequently,       no changes in consumption or investment behavior are

possible when the government's true intentions are revealed in the second

period.         The economy suffers from an anticipated but unrealized reversal in

the trade reform in exactly the same way that it would from an actual

reversal.0            Lack of credibility          is functionally   equivalent      to unsuccessful

reform.

             Notice in addition that no time-inconsistency problems arise for the

"liberalizing" government.                 Once the second period comes around, the

government's best strategy remains to follow its original promise of zero

tariffs, irrespective of the anticipations harbored by the public.

             For later reference,         it will also be useful to perform the comparative

statics of the system with respect to changes in the foreign transfer, B.

Differentiating           (4) and (6) once again (with           tC)   ,   we are   left   with:

The determinant (Det) can be shown to be positive, so we have (after

simplifying by using the homogeneity properties                      of E(.fl:


                                               -

B.  In a richer model, the private sector would normally heve the ability to
adjust some of its behavior once the expectations upon which it acted is
proved wrong. This would then drive a wedge between the ex-ante and ex-post
levels of welfare. For an interesting analysis of such issues in a different
context see Persson and Svensson (1983). See also below.

        d5/dB     (l/Det)&E2 >   .

Notice    that an increase in the transfer raises the discount factor and

therefore stimulates investment.       The effect comes about as the increase in

first-period income leads to a less than equal increase in desired first-

period consumption.



III.   The "Redistributive"   Government

       The discussion above has taken for granted the existence of a credibility

problem for the government       (as in Calvo, 1986, and Froot,   nd.).    In order to

partially endogenize credibility it is convenient       to conceptualize    the problem

as arising from an inability on the part of the public to identify the true

motives of the government     in power,    Why should the new regime's promises be

any more credible than the previous regime's?        The development process is

littered with half-hearted       reforms, and the public eventually learns:      pjg
pa change, plus p'est la meme chose.       Absent significant signs to the

contrary,   the public will generally be safe in discounting promises of lasting

reform.

       This sort of situation can be modelled by assuming that the private

sector maximizes    its expected utility given its prior beliefs regarding the

likelihood that the reform will be aborted.       Let TR denote the value of the

tariff that will obtain if the reform is reversed, and       it   be the prior

probability attached to the reform being maintained.        The expected value of

the second-period    tariff, denoted exp(T), can be written as follows:


       exp(T) =         (lit).TR.
                                             -14-

When the public is unable to tell the "type" of the government in place, a

will be generally indeterminate and will depend on history and ether

characteristics      of society; I will therefore treat it as exogenously given.

In a "separating" equilibrium, on the other hand, a will be known to be either

zero or unity.       In this sense, a is a direct measure of the credibility of

reform.

       We define the "certainty-equivalent"         level of the second-period   tariff as

that level which, if known with certainty, would make consumers behave in

exactly the same fashion as in the expected utility maximization described

above.       Denoting the certainty-equivalent      level of the second-period   tariff by

     we can show that t and exp(T) are related in the following manner:


(11)     t    exp(T) +


where        is a composite term involving first- and second-order derivatives of

the indirect utility function, and has an indeterminate sign (see Appendix).

Since the second term involves the square of the second-period           rariif, it is

of second-order importance competed to the first term.6            In vhst follows, I

will generelly ignore it.          Notice that, as expected, t is linked positively

to TR and negatively to      ir.




       Completing    the model now requires description of the behavior of

alternative governments that would find it profitable           to abort the reform

process.       The list here is endless.     I confine myself to a case which is




6.  The certainty-equivalent tariff is close, but not identical, to the
expected value of the second-period tariff, even though consumers are assumed
to be risk-averse in income. This follows from the fact that the indirect
utility function is not linear in prices.
                                                       -15-

fairly general in ita applicability.                   Consider a governmentwhose objectives

are primarily distributional:              to redistribute income to a favored group in

society from a less-favored group.7                    Suppose further that tariffs are the sole

means of raising revenue for this purpose.                    Than, this "rediscribucive"

government will attempt to achieve its distributional aim at least cost to

overall efficiency.         Letting superscripts denote the two groups in society, we

could visualize      its objective function aa being the following:


        Max W1      s.t.            W,
        t,T


whara         —   V(l+t,   5(l+T),       y1)
              —   V(l÷c,   &(l+T),

         yl       7iy      i—l,2,    .11   +   2   —

         Q    —   cc2 + ETC2.


V(.) denotes an indirect utility function, and                      is the shara of aach of tha

two groups in total income before redistribution.                    We will treat individuals

in the two groups as being identical in all raspecca but chair label, and will

assume that intartemporal demand functions ara homothatic.                    This way,

aggregate behavior--aggregate              levels of consumption and the discount rate- -

will   be independent of income distribution.

       The "rediscributive"         government arrives to maximize cha welfare of the

first group subject to a minimum welfare level for group 2.                    Ic does so by



7. This is somewhat reminiscent of the framework consideredby Aleaina (1987)
in which the existence of two political parties with different crade-offa
between inflation and unemployment is shown to generate a business cycle that
accompanies the political cycla.
                                                -16-


redistributing   all tariff revenue to the former group; henre group                 1   receives

in lump-sum fashion the tariff payments made by group 2 (Q)              to      supplement    its

income.   The higher the level of tariff revenues, the more redistribution                     this

government can undertake.            The tariffs that solve the above problem will be

denoted by    t and TR.     Notice that as long as the constraint            V           continues
to hind, no time-inconsistency           problems arise, since once t is chosen the only

way of guaranteeing W to the second group is by selecting the level of T
which is optimal   etc   ante.       But when the constraint does not hind,         the pre-

cormitment and time-consistent           policy paths may diverge (sac the next

section) ,g

      Consider first the case where foreign assistance             is non-existent         (B=C)

Then, provided that the constraint           W1W     is not binding at t1=O,      the

"redistributive" government will choose to have positive levels of protection

so as to benefit group 1.            What will be the optimal levels of the tariffs?

Given its objective function, the "rediatributive" government has the

incentive to transfer income from one group to the other at least cost in

terms of efficiency.      This can be achieved by setting the tariff rates in the

two periods equal to each other, i.e. tP_TR.              This allows the economy to

remain intertemporally efficient.            Denote the common level of the tariff as

t.   Since t keeps group 2 just at         ,    it must be   the case that


       E(l+t, S*(l4t), Th        —
                                     (l÷)E(l,   8,   )

8. In this case, the maximization problem of the redistributive government
has to be stated differently, involving a two-stage decision: first maximire
over T, given t; secondly, choose t given second-period derision rule linking
T to t.
                                 12(f()    -   i
                                               -17-

                                                   + 6*F(k+*      ))


where the starred variables are fixed at the levels that obtain in the absence

of intertemporal distortions (i.e. when tT).               This allows us to derive an

explicit expression for the "optimal" tariff:


(12)     t —   (72[f(.>   i   + 6*F(k+i*   .fl   ÷   E(l,8*,w))   -
                                                                      1.


We could think of this as the pre-existing level of the tariff before the

reformist      government takes over.

        So far, the "redistributive" government and the "liberalizer" would

necessarily reveal themselves by their choice of trade policies in the initial

period: the first settles on t—t, the second on t—O.                  In practice, there will

occasionally be reasons for the "redistributive"             government     to act out of

character.      In the context of developing countries, this will be typically the

case when balance-of-payments       dIfficulties force the government          to seek the

"green light" from multilateral         organizations such as the IMF or the World

Bank.     Obtaining the requisite foreign assistance will then require a number

of reforms which the government will undertake to appease its foreign

creditors, but will not particularly feel committed to maintaining.                 Indeed,

once the foreign-exchange constraint           is alleviated, back-tracking      will be the

natural temptation.




9.  Witness the recent case of Zambia, which is described in the colorful
prose of The Economist as follows: "Now Mr Kaunda has told the IMF to get
lost. He wants to service no debts, get no new loans and have no new
policies.   Instead he is imposing on his people a new, tighter version of the
bad old policies that led to the trouble in the first place, and whose only--
bogus--merit is that they are nor imposed by foreign bankers" (May 9, 1987, p.
13)
      In the present framework, rhs foreign transfer B serves to highlight the

problem.   I essume thet the trensfer is contingent on trede reform being

osrried out in the first period, with tariffs lowered to zero.              In the serond

period, no additional transfers are made, and the government can freely chooee

its policiesj°      Will the "redistributive" government reduce teriffs in the

first period?     If B is large enough, it clearly will.         Setting   tO   has the

coat of preventing income redistribution         in the first period.      But thia coat

can be more than offaet by the relaxation of the overall budget conatreint aa
a consequence of the foreign transfer. In fact, the transfer may also allow
the "redistributive" government to impose a higher tariff in. the      period   od
thao it gould otherwise have been able to. The letter follows from the fact
that the relaxation of the overall budget constraint allows the second group
to be squeezed to a greater extent than before. The next seotion provides
more detail on these issues.

    I will first consider the charaoteristica of pooling and separating
equilibria, and then use these to discuss how the government can successfully

10. The question arises: why would foreign lenders not extract commitments
for longer-term reform? The general answer is that they would like to bun
can't. Once the domestic crisis is abated, the need for multilateral aid is
reduced and conditionality becomes inoperative. This points to an important
dilemma: the governments that are the most deserving of assistance from the

types of government both set first-petiod                     ariffs equal to zero, and hence

become indistinguishable.         Foc this to be an equilibrium, the "redistributive"

govecnment has to find it preferabe to fotsake cedisttibutive                     policies in the

frrsc period.     Let the maximum-value           furction associated witn this

government's optimization ptohlem be wtitten as                    W(r, T1.     In the absene of

pooling,    t   will be non-zero, and foreign assistance wil' not he forthcoming.

Then tR           c as discussed shove,               in a pooling equilibrium, by contrsst,

(13)   W1(O, TR(B, z); B>O,          W1(t             B—U;.


it ought to be clear that 1(U, TR(B, m)) is an increasing function of                         B:   as

the amount of foreign aid increases,              the intectemporal budget constraint              is

relaxed, and the potential welfare of both groups in society rises.                       Hence the


larger is B, the greater the likelihood that a pooling equilibrium will

result.     The borderline level of B, denoted by 8mm, is defined implicitly by

the relation W'(U, TR(Bmmn,         );        B_Bmin) —   Wm,      t; B—U).

       hat us suppose thmt the level of B indeed exceeds Bmin, so that the

eronomy is sturk in a pooling equilibrium.                     We can now characterize this

equilibriummore fully.        We already know that t—U, and that t is linked to

TR via expression     (Il).   To determine TB in turn, we hava to bear in mind that

the ex-ante and ex-poat levels of second-period                    consumption (and hence of
                                               -20-

welfare) will differ for each group.              That is because first-period decisions

are based on T, whereas the actual outturn will be eithar 0 or               T.    This

affects the actual redistribution         to take place in the second period, and

drives a wedge between the ax-ante and ax-post levels of welfare for each

group.

        Consider the situation from the perspective of the second group.                Let

6(t, B) be the function linking the discount factor to the (certainty-

equivalent) second-period tariff rate and the foreign transfer (see secticn

IT).     Distinguishinganticipated from actual outcomes by using
                                                                 "S"              with    the

former, and letting superscripts distinguish the two groups, we first have:


(14)     E(l, 8(.)(l+t). Q2)        72(f(.)   -   i(5(.))   + B +   SflF(k+i(5(.),.)3

This ensures that planned expenditures are consistent with the present

discountedvalue of resources available to the second group.                  However, if in

the second period the government in power reveals itself as the redistributive

type, T is set at TR >    t,   and this group's real income and consumption              fail.

To represent the situation, define a restricted expenditure functicn E(.)

which yields the minimum expenditure level required to reach a given level cf

welfare when first-period consumption (c2) is pre-determinsd:


(15)     E(l÷T, W°; c2) —   mm      ((l+T)C2 st.       TJ(c2, C2)     H2),
                               C2

where:


 (16)    2 - El(1,   5(J(1+t),      2)

Then, second-period    equilibrium requires

                             —
(17)     E(1+TR, W2; c2)


i.e.    that consumption expenditures be in line with the higher-than-anticipated

second-period     tariff,     Given T, equations j4), (16), and (17) jointly

determine first-period consumption          (c2), ex-ante welfare         (2), and ex-post

welfare    (N2) for the second group.        An analogous act of equations ran be

written alao for tne first group.

       Notice that a time conaister.t path of policy scold require that the

constraint    N   '-   N be bind4ng fcc the "rediatributive"        government in

equilibriom.      This ia bacaue the       snmond  group cau a.ways cc a.jucezed to the
limit in the second pertod- - once        afl aa;inga and investment decisiona hate
been made--without incurring any efficiency coats. Hence, the equations aoove
can be used to solve for the optimal choice of            T.    To do      so,   we   fix   W   at
and    let the three equations determine      T,     c2, and   .     This    defines an

implicit function        T          a).

        Of particular interest is the nature of the linkage              bet-aeen     B and     T    in

such a pooling equilibrium.         While the algebra here gets messy, the basic

story is clear.         An increase in B raises real income        it.   the economy both

through its direct effect and through the induced increase in investment                            'the

latter being at a sub-optimal level given               > 0).   That in turn stimulates

first-period consumption, and makes room for a greater squeeze of the less-

favored group through a larger tariff in the second period.                      Hence a larger

amount of foreign aid will result in a greater interteeporal distortion.

        Foreign sasiatance therefore has two important hidden coats in terms of

the credibility of the reform process.              First and foremost, it aakea a pooling

equilibrium more likely, and increases the probsbility that a genuinely
                                            -22-

reform-minded    government will be confused with one whose motives are

ambiguous.     Secondly, by relaxing the economy-wide budget constraint,        it

permits a larger redistributive        role for a government so inclined, and a more

generous application of distorting policies to that end.

     Notice, however,    that the "redistributive" government pictured here also

cares about efficiency.     This sets a natural limit to how far it would like to

pursue an intertemporal wedge.         In particular, it is possible that for

sufficiently high levels of       T,   further increases in B will be welfare-

reducing for this government, as the added costs of the intertemporal

distortion    (since TR is increasing in B) may be severe enough.         In such a

case, it would prefer to allow the constraint        on P2 not to bind.     But this

would require an ability to pre-cormit to a level of the second-period tariff

which is lower than that required by time consistency.         Short of such pre-

commitments, the redistributive        government will always be tempted to tax the

second group to the maximum extent, as there are no efficiency costs of doing

so once the second period starts.

        Sezarating equilibrium.    Let us now turn to   pgan       equilibria.       In

such equilibria the "liberalizing" government will not face a credibility

problem.     It is clear from the above discussion that this will be the case

whenever B < gmmn      The more interesting questions arise when B          Bmln, yet

the "liberalizing"    government can successfully signal its type in order to

achieve separation.     How can it do so, and will it went to?

        In general, governments will have a multitude of signals available to

them.     But the better signals are the ones that can communicate the desired

message moat directly.     In the present framework, the most direct signal of

the government's    future intentions is the first-period tariff itself.         The
                                             -23-

appropriate    signal can be communicated by implementing a negative tariff, or

an import aubaidy.        (A poaitive tariff would clearly not do the job since it

makes the "rediatributive" government oniy keener to imitate.)           Such a signal

conveys irpoctant information to tha public since an import subsidy increases

the cost to the "rediatrihutive" government          of mimicking the "liberalizer"

And the "libecaliring" government can profitably aend aoch a signal, even

though the subsidy policy        a going to be coatla to it too.

      To ace thea' points, it ía uaetol to detecz.ine ficat tne costa of an

import subsidy to the "radiatcibotive' government.           Baaed on this, we can then

argue that with a sufficiently       arge    first-period subsidy, pooling will no

longer remaIn an equilibrium.        Finaily, we can check to see whether this

signaling    strategy is a profitable      one for the 'liberalizing" government.

      To start with, conaidec the effect of a first-period subsidy on the

"redistributive" govecnment'a welfare.           The aubaidy makes the relative price

of second-period conaumption even higher, i.e. it reduces the consumption rate

of interest further,        in addition,   wth   the aubaidy in place, the resources

available    to the government for rediacributive purpoaea will be lower: some of

the second-period    tariff revenue now goes to subsidize       the first-period

consumption of the lees-favored group, and cannot be used to transfer income

to the favored group.       To offset this, the government may want to raise       T
further, but at the margin the coat of doing this haa increased as well: the

aubsidy exacerbates the intertemporal distortion, and on this account makes a

jgg TR      preferable.    Hence the "rediatributive" government is caught in a

bind, which will be reflected in a lower level of welfare for the favored

group -

     Notice    that the ex-ante and ex-post levels of welfare will move in the
                                                      -24-

same direction in response to the imposition of a first-period subsidy.                             This

is because      the amount by which the ex-post and ex- ante tedistributions differ

is unaffected.      We can therefore safely confine the analysis to ex-ante

welfare.     In analogous fashion to equation                 (14),    the anticipated level of

welfare for the first group               ()    can be implicitly defined by the following

expression:


(18)   E(l-s, 8(l+t), Q1)

                        -
                             i(S)    +   B +   SF(k+i(8),j)     +     [-so   + STCJ,


where s is the rate of subsidy and                8   is once again a function of the exogenous

variables.       This makes cleat that first-period subsidy payments subtract

directly ftom the income transfer made available to the first group.                             To see

the effects of      s   on   &,     we can differentiate        this    expression     while   holding

   (and hence t) constant.


(19)    EWdQ1      -c2ds + [tC2d8 - ado2 + StdC2] +                   f-sdc1   +   8td01J.

Notice that, since only relative prioes matter, changes in a and t have

qualitatively similar effects on endogenous variables.                             Therefore an increase

in a reduces the consumption rate of interest and lowers 8, as we already know

from aection II that dq/dt > 0 and d8/dt                     < 0. Without further algebra,

then, the effects on                can be easily deduced.

       The first term of (19) captures the direct effect of s on the income

transfer to the first group. and is negative.                       The terms in the first braoket

are the distributional            effects induced by intertemporal substitution.                  These

amount to a loss for the first group as well since: (a) the subsidy re-

allocates the second group's consumption from the seoood period (in which it
                                              -25-

is taxed) to the first period (in which it is subsidized)           ,   end hence narrows

the base for the income transfer between the groups; and (b)              &   fells (as d&/ds

< 0) thereby reducing the present discounted value of the redistribution.

Finally, the terms in the second bracket cepture the share of the first group

in the overall efficiency iosea borne by the economy as a consequence of the

exacerhation    of the intertempor'l distortion.

       Hence the first-period     subsidy i,a both listributional and efficiency

costs fot the "radistributiva" govetnuent.           Notice that   adjting      T will not
make the problem go away entirely, sInce while this can reduce the

intertemporal    distortion it can never make up for the inrome rratsfer lost

through the subsidy.     Effectively, the subsidy worsens the trade-off between

efficiency and distrihution       for thia guvernnent.     Its valce aa a signal of the

reformist government's       intentions resides precisely    in thIs fact.

       The fact that the first-period subsidy increaaea the coat to the

"redistributive"   government of imitating the         Liberalizer" implies that

pooling wiLl no Longer be an equilibrium for a sufficiently high level of s.
Denote by a* the minimum level of the subsidy needed to achieve separation.

This level is implicitly defined by the following equality;


(20)   Wl(a*, TR(a*,    B,   );   B>0)   W1(E, E; B—0).


where W1(.) is onte again the maximum-value function for the "rediatributive"

government.     Past a certain level     s,    thia government will prefer to give up

the foreign aid B and will revert to its aeparating strategy of impoaing a

uniform tariff      in both periods.

       When will the "liberalizing" government signal?         The queation now becomea

whether the "liberalizing"        government will find it in its interest to aeparate
                                           -25-

via signaling in this fashion.        The answer has to he asibiguous in general

since signaling    is costly: it imposes efficiency costs on this government as

well.     In the present framework, such costs could be avoided in principle hy

subsidizing imports in the aecond period also.         This way, the intertemporal

distortions induced by the first-period subsidy could be eliminated (or, more

generally,    reduced).   But the problem with this strategy is that it is tire-

inconsistent.     Once the aecond period comes around, the "liberalizing"

government will no longer have the incentive to implement the aubsidy, as it

generally prefers to avoid trade distortions, and the private sector will have

already irrevocably allocated its consumption intertemporally.           This in turn

implies that the "promise" of a second-period        subsidy will not be credible,

and hence will not yield the desired pattern of intertemporal        substitution.

        Oiven that the "liberalizer" cannot avoid the costs of signsling, how far

will it be able to go?      Notice that the marginal efficiencycoat of the first-

period subsidy is    jpgr   for this government than it is for the redistriburive

government, provided separation       is achieved.   The reason is simple.   Once the

signal is communicated, the expected second-period tariff falls to zero, and

the welfare coat of the first-period subsidy is therefore lowered.           In effect,

s "small" enough subsidy, which is successful        in separating the two

governments, will lead to only second-order welfare losses to the reformist

government.     Since the reduction    in the intertemporsl distortion    achieved by

credibility is a source of first-order welfare gain, the balance will be in

favor of stgnalrng whenever     a   is small enough.    In other words, crediole

reform will have a hiss towards overshooting its target.

        More can be said.   To the reformist government, the cost incurred by lack

of credibility is proportional to the distortion in the consumption rate of
                                              -27-

interest caused by it (see section II) .             A credible   signal via the subsidy
creates an equivalent distortion in the consumption race of interest in the

same   direction.    Now   the government will clearly pursue the second strategy
provided   it is the lesser of the two evils.11             Denote by 5max the rate of the

subsidy thet causes a level of distortion             identical to any given t(B,     it),


This level    is defined implicitly     by

(21)    &/(ism5X) —   8[l+t(B,

This expression equates the consumption rate of               interest resulting from     a

first-period subsidy       (end no credibility problem) with that emerging in s

pooling equilibrium (with no subsidy).           Or


(22)    max      t(j/il +
This cells us the maximum rote of subsidization the "liberalizing" government
is willing to undertake, provided separation is thereby achieved. (Notice
that the subsidy has been defined throughout in specific rather than ad-
valorem rerms. In the        latter case,    5m3u would     be defined simply by   5msx       —


t.)
             the signal will be employed end a separating equilibrium will
       Whether

result can now be easily determined. The answer depends on the relationship
between       and   5m,    As   long ss 5m5i >          ic will pay to signal,   and the


11.  This abstracts from additional problems chat can be created by the
subsidy. Typically, governments will be revenue-constrained in the sense chat
additional caxes can be collected only at high cosc. This will make the
"liberalizing" government look more like the "rediscributive" one:    will       it
make the former more hesitant to employ policies which lead to reduccions in
available revenue.
                                              -28-

reformist    government will   select   a =   s.     When 5max <        effective signaling

will be too costly, and the government will resign itself to living with the

credibility problem and choose      s   =            In   the unlikely case that   5m
the government will be indifferent between the two strategies.

                                                               would be willing
       Finelly, consider whether the "liberalizing" government

to ask its foreign creditors      to curtail their assistance          so as to reduce the

incentive of the "redistributive" government to mimic.                Provided     is small


enough, this will not be a profitable          strategy since the income losses due to

reductions    in B will be first-order and large relstive to the costs of

incressing s.      But with large s' (i.e. costly signaling) there will exist a

tradeoff st the mergin between B and s.




)/.   Concluding   Remagks

       The purpose of this paper was to mske precise an intuition that is

                                                                              linked to the
commonly shared: the credibility of policy reform is intimately

                                           out.                The argument offered here is

 in turn has the effect of rendering the reform process more credible than it

would otherwise have been, alleviating many problems introduced by the

 credibility gap.      To be sure, the speed of reform is not the only signal that

 will generally be aveilable to policy-makers.13               But such a signal has the

advantage that its measage    is carried within the policy itself, and hence is

relatively easily decoded by its recipients.         Other, less direct signals will

often require that the publi. disentangle corplic.ted
                                                      general-equilibrium

relationships.

      While many   of the connlusin',s drawn in the preceding sections are
specific to   the model analysed,    the basic argument is a robust one.      At the
outset of snv reform, the publit will typilallr he unable to fathom the trae

motivations nf the government undertaking the refnrn          Since the distorting

policies in question have been put in place by thuse in puwer to begin with,

what reason is there to believe that the authnrities now 'see tne light"?

The confusion becomes worse when, ss is often the case, the policy freedom of

the government is temporarily restricted as a consequence of a crisis whose

resolution requires the cooperstion of actors in favor of reform.          In the
present model, such a situation was created by the availability of foreign

assistance contingent on trade reform.       gut ctearly such instances are more

general.   For lack of alternatives,     a temporary .risis will frequently require

incoherent and ill-intentioned      policy-makers   to ant (temporarily) just lIke

coherent and well-intentioned    ones.    Signaling via policy-overshooting    tan

then help reduce the confusion.

      With respect to trade reform proper, the conclusions of the present paper

run against much conventional wisdom regarding the advantages of gradualism.

While I have not considered any of the usual justifications        for gradualism,14



the possibility that wage-price controls may act as a signal of a

                                                APPENDIX



       This sppendix derives the certainty-equivalent            tsriff expressed in

equstion (Il).       Let p snd P denote the prices for the two periods.             P is   :-,e


second-period      prire--a random vsrishle under our sssursptions.           P is its

certainty-equivalent.          The    genersl problem is to find ths level of P     that is

implicitiy defined by the following expression:


(Al)    V(p, P, 1)        EV(p, P. I)


where   VC)   and NV;   ..    stand   for the indirect utility function and its expected

velue, end I is income.             Notice that income is non-random, as it is completely

determined once first-period choices are made                If consumers   are risk-neutral

in income, we can write


(A2)    V(p, P, I)      v(p, P)l,


hence (Al) becomes:


(Al')    v(p, P) -    Ev(p,    P).


Now we epproximete both sides of the equality by a second-order Taylor

expansion around (p. P),            where   P denotes the expected value    (average) of the

second-period      price.


       w(p, P) -   w(p,      P) +   v2(P-P) +

Therefore,

where c2 is the variance of the aerond-period price.                          Notice that all partial

derivativea of v(.) are evaluated at (p, P).                       In turn,


(A4)    v(p, ?)           v(p,      P)   v2(P-P) +


The laat term can he ignored here as it will he of the order                                  Setting   (A3)


and    (A4)       equal to each other, we can solve for ?:


              =     +
(A5)                    (l/2v2)(v,2 + v22)a2.


Since o2 =          var(P)       exp(P2)
                                              -
                                                  fexp(P)]2,   it is straightforward   to show thor


(A6)     o2 =       r(la)fSTh2.

Denoting                                            and substituting (A6) into     (AS) yields
                        (l/2v2)(v12          v22)

equation (11) in the text.

       While          cannot be signed in general, the interested reader can verify

that (when P > p) a sufficient condition for                         to be negative is for

consumers to prefer price stabilization to price variability,                          i.e.    for v(.) to

be concave.
