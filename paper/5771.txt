       This paper aims at assessing the relationship between the exchange value of the Chinese

Renminbi   (RMG) and China’s trade balance by means of some recent econometric            techniques

designed to evaluate the existence and the direction of causality. We find strong evidence suggesting

that changes in the trade balance and each of its components Granger-cause changes in the exchange

rate but no evidence indicating a causal link running from the exchange rate to the trade balance.

Our results seem to be rather supportive of the accommodative    role of the exchange rate proposed

by the modem theory of the trade balance determination and not supportive of the existence of a J-

curve in China’s trade balance.   Our finding of a bidirectional causal relationship between the real

exchange rate and the price variables confirms the presence of a vicious circle hypothesis following

currency devaluation.   This has important implications for the discussions of impacts of the RMB

devaluation on China’s trade balance.

1. Introduction




        In comparison with the transitional economies of Eastern Europe, China’s experience

of economic reforms is to some extent unique in that its economy, instead of sharp decline,

grew rapidly in the context of the reform process that transformed the economy from a rigid

central-planning     system to an increasingly    open and market-oriented     economy.    Equally

remarkable,      started in 1978, China has successfully   broken through the state monopoly     of

foreign trade by decentralizing     management power from state corporations and introduced the

responsibility    system or agency system into various levels of foreign trade institutions. On the

other hand, the portion       of foreign   trade under direct administrative   controls   has been

substantially    reduced while more subject to the market forces. By 1991 exports and imports

subject to mandatory      planning had fallen to 30 percent and 20 percent of their respective

totals, while the guidance plan accounted for 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively.      As the

role of trade plan has declined, direct control over exports and imports has continued through

a licensing system which covered 55 percent of exports and 40 percent of imports in 1991

(Bell et al., 1993).

        In line with its foreign trade system reform, China has repeatedly devalued its currency



                                                   1
as a means of promoting exports and the balance of trade in the 1980s and the early 1990s.

In 1991, China altered its foreign exchange policy from the relatively large, one-step currency

devaluation    of the past to more frequent, small-scale adjustments as ways of fine tuning the

Renminbi’s     (RMB) value according to prevailing conditions. The unification of China’s two

main currency      rates in the beginning     of 1994 and the deregulation     on foreign invested

enterprises    in exchanging      funds freely at selected banks without approval from the State

Administration     for Exchange Control (SAEC) early this year drive the RMB a step further

toward the full convertibility.     China’s foreign exchange system has been, since the mid- 1980s,

classified as a more flexible management         system. ]

          In this paper we shed light on the relationship      between the exchange value of the

RMB and China’s trade balance by means of some recent econometric              techniques designed

to evaluate the existence and the direction of causality. This will generate some important

implications    as to the discussions   of impacts of RMB devaluation on China’s trade balance.

We follow an empirical methodology           applied by Mahdavi and Sohrabian (1993) to test for

causality in the relationships      between the nominal and real exchange rates of the RMB and

China’s    balance of trade as well as its price and quantity components           over the period

1991: M01-1996:M02.

          This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we briefly review the major changes

of China’s foreign exchange policy. Section 3 is devoted to the empirical methodology          and

the theories     to explain the relation between exchange       rate and trade balance. Section 4

describes the data and the empirical results, and the final section wraps up the analysis with

some concluding      remarks.




     1 Since 1987 the exchange rate of RMB has been formally classified by IMF as a more
flexible anangement (other managed float).

2. Foreign Exchange Policy: An Overview




       The pre-reform       exchange   system of China was characterized    by strict control of

foreign exchange transactions and rigidity of the RMB exchange rate. It could neither respond

flexibly to the change of price parities between China and the rest of the world, nor make

prompt adjustment       according to the changing supply and demand of foreign exchange. At

most, it acted as an accounting tool, and failed to adjust the trade volume. This is actually

associated with the state monopoly of China’s foreign trade regime under which all import

and export contracts with foreign firms could only be signed by a few authorized import and

export corporations.2     Conspicuously,   traders under this regime had no incentives   to make

trade adjustments   in response to prices changes and exchange rate policy.

       During the early stages of the reform, various arrangements       were tested for sharing

foreign exchange with the objective of improving incentives for exports. A retention system

emerged,   under which exporters surrender their actual foreign exchange earnings and are

issued retention quotas by the SAEC equivalent to a portion of such earnings. This system

has evolved with a complex set of regulations on allocating foreign exchange according to

industry and location before a uniform retention rate for enterprises was set throughout     the

country by 199 1.S Other measures to promoting exports include various export subsidies4 and



     2 The number of the specialized foreign trade corporation had risen and fallen over the
entire pre-reform period, partly due to the structural changes of the administrative ministries.
By 1978, on] y 10 national import and export corporations under China’s trade ministry had
been solely authorized to sign import and export contracts with foreign firms.

     s The new rules announced in February 1991 allows exporters (other than foreign-funded
enterprises) to receive retention quotas for 80 percent of their foreign exchange earnings,
while 100 percent for mechanical and electronical products. These retention quotas are
distributed to foreign trade corporation (60 percentage points), the supplying enterprises (10
percentage points), and the local government (10 percentage points). The practice of the
foreign exchange retention system has been terminated in 1992 due to considerable distortions

                                                  3
decentralization     of decision-making    to the trading units or foreign trade corporations    which

had soared to more than 6000 in existence by 1989 (World Bank, 1990), The introduction               of

the responsibility    system or agency system into various levels of foreign trade institutions in

the mid- 1980s further increased the freedom of these economic agents in response to the

market forces in managing international trade. The foreign trade system reform has no doubt

contributed to the rapid expansion of China’s foreign trade. In 1978 the total trade amounted

only to US$20.6 billion and it rose to US$ 165.5 billion in 1992, an increase of over eight

times. Exports grew at a similar pace, rising from US$9.75 billion in 1978 to US$84.9 billion

in 1992 (Zhang, 1995).

        In 1981 China        introduced    a dual exchange       rate system:   one is for non-trade

transactions   at a rate of about RMB 1.5 yuan per dollar; and another rate is more favorable

for the internal settlement of trade transactions. The dual rate system was abandoned in 1985

but re-emerged       in 1986 with the establishment      of the foreign exchange adjustment     centres

(FEACS) or swap centres at which approved enterprises               were permitted   to buy and sell

retention quotas. After freer trading was permitted in 1988, the premium on exchange rates

in the swap centres rose to about 80 percent, reflecting an increased number of participants

at the same time as aggregate demand was surging. The swap markets had come to dominate

China’s foreign-currency       transactions,   representing   an estimated 80-85 percent of all such

activity at over 100 swap locations. The exchange rate at the swap centres had been set by

a combination of market forces and government intervention, although such interventions were




and unfair regional competition,

     4 The practice of export subsidies to foreign trade corporations was abolished in 1991
when China deepened its foreign trade system reform in the early 1990s, focusing on
increasing the transparency of the system and moving closer to the international conventions
in conducting trade.

rare. In 1989, the premium fell sharply in the wake of a devaluation of the official exchange

rate, and thereafter the differential between the two rates narrowed to about 8 percent before

it widened     again to about 45 percent by early 1993 (Bell et al. 1993). This depreciation

occurred against the background           of strong import growth stemming from rapid economic

growth,      an investment      boom,   and trade liberalization   initiatives.   Figure   1 displays    the

movements       of both nominal and real exchange rates during the reform period.

          With the more flexible exchange arrangements in 1986, the official exchange rate was

in effect pegged to the US dollar. In 1991, the exchange policy was altered to small-scale,

more frequent adjustments in the official rate according to the prevailing conditions from the

relatively    large, one-step    currency   devaluations   of the past, following       the two currency

devaluations     in 1989 (21 percent) and 1990 (9 percent). The new policy kicked off with a

devaluation of 0.95 percent on April 9, 1991 to RMB 5.2935 per dollar, and another on May

20, bring the value to RMB 5.3066 per dollar. Several additional                  small adjustments     were

made throughout      the year, taking the value to around RMB 5.4 per dollar by the end of 1991.

By April 1993, the real effective exchange rate of the official exchange rate had depreciated

33 percent more than in 1986 and 70 percent more than in 1980 (Bell et al. 1993). One key

reason for those continuous currency devaluation is to reduce the price distortion and promote

exports. This seems to be true in some sense that there did exist certain relationship between

exchange      rate and trade flows in the 1980s.s One must note however that the Chinese

authority has been very cautiously to devalue its highly over-valued currency over time. It is

mainly due to the consideration         of the inflationary effect of currency devaluation.




     s Wang (1993) find that there is a positive relationship between real exchange rate and
exports. Using quarterly data for 1980:1 to 1989: IV, Brada, Kutan and Zhou (1993) find that,
in both the short-run and the long-run, devaluation of the RMB serves to improve the balance
of trade.

       One notable step in the foreign exchange reform was the unification        of China’s two

main currency rates (the swap rates and the official rates) and allowed the exchange rate

limited room to freely float from the beginning of 1994. This led to a substantial devaluation

of the currency to RMB 8.7 yuan to the dollar, a rate quite close to that in the black market.

Since then the exchange      value of the RMB has been remained stable, while appreciated

against the US dollar in the last two years by about 5 percent in nominal terms and 22

percent in real terms. As a matter of fact, China’s exports during this period grew rapidly by

24 percent in 1994 and 23 percent in 1995 with a trade surplus of US$5. 1 billion and

US$ 16.7 billion, respectively.   This raised a question over the relationship   between the real

exchange rate and the balance of trade in the transitional economy of China. However, it has

no doubt that the exchange rate in the Chinese economy plays a major role in the level and

composition     of exports and imports (World Bank, 1990).

        Since March 1996, restrictions on the foreign exchange transfers of foreign invested

firms in 4 cities (Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dalian and Jiangsu) have been removed such that they

could exchange funds freely at selected banks without approval from the SAEC. This program

is expected to be extended to the rest of the country and also granted to the local firms soon.

The ultimate     goal of the reform is convertibility   of the currency   and integration   of the

economy with international     currency market. Although full RMB convertibility     is less likely

achieved by the end of the century, current account convertibility    could be a reality as early

as next year.




3. The Theoretical     Framework     and Methodology




        There are mainly two competing theories put forward to explain the relation between



                                                 7
exchange rate and trade balance. The first one is based on “the J-curve hypothesis” according

to which, following      a devaluation   of the nominal exchange rate, the nominal trade balance

initially deteriorates   before it improves. The empirical results of some recent studies do not

provide a clear-cut answer regarding the validity of the J-curve hypothesis.       Rosenswieg   and

Koch (1988), Mead (1988), and Mahdavi and Sohrabian (1993) find evidence of a “delayed

J-curve pattern” consisting of a number of overlapping         standard J-curve. Some others even

find no statistically reliable evidence of a stable J-curve (Rose and Yellen, 1989). The central

points of these studies seem to suggest a slow and partial pass-through          of changes in the

exchange rate into import prices and even a relatively quicker and larger pass-through          into

export prices.

        The second theory to explaining the relation between exchange rate and trade balance

is the so-called “modern theory” of trade balance determination          (Greenwood,   1984; Razin,

1984; McKinnon and Ohno, 1986). This theory gives great weight to intertemporal shocks and

exogenous supply shocks in explaining trade imbalances. The empirical consequences           of this

modern theory are twofold: first, because exogenous factors affect the movements of both the

real exchange rate and the trade balance, the change in one variable can only partially explain

the change in the other variable; second, the relationship between the two variables may be

bidirectional    (Hill, 1990). However, empirical studies of the nexus between real exchange rate

and the trade balance have usually assumed a unidirectional causal relationship in the opposite

direction (Himarios,     1989).

        The theoretical    discussion    of the J-curve hypothesis   can be better described by the

following equation:b




   b For the discussion of a J-curve effect following devaluation,          see Melvin (1985), and
Mahdavi and Sohrabian (1993).

                             BOT=PX.          QX-Ph4.         QM                (1)


where BOT is the trade balance in local currency, PX is unit price of exports, QX is volume

of exports, PM is unit price of imports, and QM is volume of imports. Assume that the

economy’s       export and import contracts         are mainly written in local currency and dollars,

respectively.    A devaluation of the exchange rate will raise the imports value of the economy

in local currency due to the rising of import price, while the export value will remain

unchanged.      In the short run, the trade balance will be deteriorated.        Over a longer period of

time, the export and import volumes will react to the changes in the relative prices following

the devaluation. Downward adjustment in import volume is expected while export volume will

rise as the export prices expressed in dollars become more competitive. This will result in an

improvement       in the trade balance. Thus, a devaluation          of the exchange rate will affect the

trade balance through both price effect and volume effect, the former effect of the devaluation

leads to the deterioration     of the trade balance, i.e. the declining segment of the J-curve, while

the latter effect contributes to the improvement            of trade balance, i.e. the rising part of the J-

curve. In this study, we attempt to examine the dynamic relationship                  between the exchange

rate and the trade balance as well as the nature and direction of causal relationship                between

the exchange rate and the price and quantity components of the trade balance. The existence

of certain dynamic links between these variables may provide explanatory                    evidence to the

understanding      of how the trade balance responds to the changes in the exchange rate.

        Testing for causality between variables in the Granger sense of the world implies the

specification of the dynamic relationships which link them. In order to correctly specify these

dynamic relationships,       one needs first examine the behaviour of each variable over time to

determine       whether   it is stationary.   Failure to do so can lead to a problem             of spurious

regression      whereby    the results    suggest    that there are statistically      significant   long-run

                                                        9
    relationships     between the variables in the regression model when in fact all that is being

    obtained is evidence of contemporaneous            correlations rather than meaningful causal relations.

    If non-stationary     variables are found, then one needs to find out whether they are cointegrated

    in order to infer a causal long-run relationship between non-stationary            time series.

            We have therefore         investigated     the dynamic properties     of the time series of the

    variables, firstly if they are stationary in levels or in differences, by means of the well-known

    “augmented Dickey-Fuller         test” (ADF) (Dickey and Fuller, 1981). If stationarity for a time

    series is achieved with d times of differences, then it is said to be integrated of order d or

    I(4. To test whether a time series, X,, is nonstationary           ( or contains a unit root), we set the

    following regression model:



                AXt = a + ~Jt_l          + ~ ~iAX,_i + yTr + W,                                 (2)
                                           1=1

    where Tr is a time trend, and p is an error term. The null hypothesis that X~contains a unit
f
    root is set at Ho: PO= O, against the alternative HJ: PO<0. The null            hypothesisis rejected if

    POis significantly negative, Even though each individual variable is found to have a unit root,

    it is still possible to infer a causal long-run relationship(s)        between non-stationary     variables

    if they are cointegrated.

            We use two methods to examine if the exchange rate and the trade balance as well as

    its component       variables are cointegrated. The first method uses the Engle-Granger           two-step

    approach in which the first step tests whether each of the variables of interest has a stochastic

    trend and then tests whether stochastic trends in these variables are related by examining if

    the residual of the cointegrating         regression has a unit root or not. If the residual does not have

    a unit root, then the variables            of interest are cointegrated     (Engle and Granger,      1987).

    However,        despite its popularity,     there are other serious problem     with the Engle-Granger


                                                            10
approach such as small sample bias and the inability to test statistical hypotheses. The second

method employed to test for cointegration               is the maximum likelihood (ML) method provided

by Johansen      (1988, 1992) and Johansen and Juselius (1990), which is more efficient and

powerful in estimating and testing the cointegrating                 vectors in a multivariate     setting.

        The Johansen method to test for cointegration                 is based upon a vector error-correction

(VECM) system with a Gaussian error term:


                                                  p-1

                   AZ,   =   a.    +   IT.Zt_p+ ~ OiAZ,_i + Q,             (t=l,...,~        (3)
                                                1=1

where Zt is a column vector of m endogenous                     variables, H and e are m by m matrices of

unknown parameters,          and Of is a Gaussian error term. All long-run information                   about the

relationship    between variables is contained in the impact matrix H. When the matrix H has

full column rank, it implies that all variables in Z, are stationary. When the matrix H has zero

rank, the system is a traditional           first-differenced       VAR involving        no long-run     elements.

However,       when the rank of H is intermediate                 or O < rank(~)        = r < m, there exist r

cointegrating     vectors    that make       the linear         combinations    of Zl become        stationary      or

cointegrated. In this case, H can be decomposed into two m by r matrices, @ and Q, such that

the reduced rank r < m of H is hypothesized               as H(r): H = -~~’.        The vectors of Q represent

the r linear cointegrating        relationships     such that Q ‘Z~is stationary, The matrix @ represents

the error-correction     parameters.      The ML estimation procedure provides an likelihood                     ratio

(LR) test called trace test that evaluates the null hypothesis of, at most, r cointegrating                   vectors

versus the general null of m cointegrating              vectors. Another test derived by Johansen (1988)

is the maximum eigenvalue test which is a more powerful LR test. This test is to evaluate the

null hypothesis     of r cointegrating        vectors against the alternative            of (r+ 1) cointegrating

vectors. Rejection of this hypothesis suggests the existence of the maximum r cointegrating

vectors.

           Finally, totestfor      causality between twovariables,                            X,and Y,, we follow the classical

procedures of Granger (1969, 1986) and Engle and Granger (1987). The methodology                                              differs

whether the variables           are cointegrated     or not. If X~ and Y~are not cointegrated,                              then the

standard Granger-causality          tests is used to examine the causal relationships                                 between them.

This test is based on the estimation               of the following                   dynamic relationships              between the

variables (if individually        1(1) processes):


                                             m                              n

                           AXt = KO + ~ 6iAXt_i + ~                             pjAyt-j+v1,            (4)
                                      1=1                             j=l




where   (vJt,Vzt) is a   serially independent random vector with zero mean and finite covariance

matrix. To ascertain the presence of unidirectional,                            bidirectional        or no causal relationships

between variables of interest, we can test the joint significance of coefficients                                      of the causal

variables in each equation by means of a classical F-test.

           However,      if the two time series appear to be cointegrated,                                   causality     has to be

investigated within the framework of an error correction model (ECM) which incorporates the

information provided by cointegrating relationships into causality analysis that usually focuses

on short-term      dynamics.       The ECM is given by the following                                 form (if individually       1(1)

processes):


                                      m                      n

                                      1=1              j=l

differences of Y, regressor do not enter the above equation, the lagged level of Y, might still

Granger-cause      the variable X, through    the residual.   The existence   of one cointegrating

relationship    between the two variables ensure there exists at least one causality link (in the

Granger sense) between them. A statistically significant L1 indicates such a causal link even

when the coefficients      of lagged changes of the causal variables       are jointly   insignificant

(implying no causality according to the standard Granger-causality       tests) (Miller and Russek,

1990).




4. Data and Empirical       results




4.1. Data




         The methodology     described in the last section is employed to investigate the dynamic

relationships   between the exchange value of Chinese RMB and China’s trade balance as well

as its price and quantity components.       The period under investigation    ranges from January

1991 to February 1996, a more flexible, relatively floating rate era. This period witnessed the

rapid expansion of China’s foreign trade and FDI flows. Besides data availability,            one key

reason to limit our tests to this period is that this period covers the most notable events in the

process of China’s foreign trade system reform. These include for instance the abolition of

export subsidies     in 1991 and of the foreign exchange retention        system in 1992, and the

unification of its dual foreign exchange system in 1994. Following the implementation         of deep

structural reforms, it is more evidenced that China has begun to conduct its foreign trade in

accordance with its comparative       advantage and the international   conventions   rather than the

use of administrative    measures. Therefore, it will be more interesting to evaluate if the new


                                                  13
foreign trade regime can make the balance of trade response to the exchange rate, in other

words, if the devaluation   of the Chinese currency improves the balance of trade. The major

sources of data are IMF: International Financial Statistics, the Statistical Yearbook of China,

the Monthly Statistics of China, and Hong Kong Monthly Digest of Statistics. The variables

involved in the analysis are measured as follows:




        BOTN: nominal trade balance defined as the difference between the nominal values

of exports and imports.

        BOTR:   real trade balance defined as the nominal trade balance deflatored        by the

China’s consumer price index.

        EXCHN: nominal exchange value of the RMB as measured by the trade-weighted

exchange rate index of the RMB against the four countries (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore,

and the United States) as they are the largest trading partners of China, taking a share of 60

percent in China’s total foreign trade. Their average shares in China’s foreign trade from 1991

to 1996 were used as weights in calculating the index.

        EXCHR: real exchange rate defined as the nominal rate of RMB multiplied           by the

relative price ratio of the world price level over that of China. The consumer price indexes

are used. The index of the world price level is taken to be the trade-weighted    consumer price

index of the four countries.

        PX and PM: China’s export and import prices, respectively,         as measured by export

(import) -weighted unit value of import and export indexes of China’s four largest trading

partners.

        QX and QM: export and import volumes, respectively,         calculated   by dividing the

values of exports and reports by the corresponding     unit value index.

4,2. Testing for Unit Roots




        The results of the ADF test for the eight variables are presented in Table 1. They

support the presence of a unit root in all of the series, while stationarity is achieved after first

differencing     of the levels for trade balance and the volume of exports and imports, and after

the second differencing       of the levels of exchange rate and export and import prices. These

results are particularly important in order to avoid spurious regression problems as observed

in many earlier studies of the exchange rate and trade balance nexus. They are also important

to the understanding      of those controversial     issues regarding the RMB devaluation             and its

impact on China’s trade balance, as studies based on the conventional method without taking

unit root into account will generate divergent, even opposite conclusion as those taking some

transformation     (e.g., first-differencing)   before stationarity is achieved.7

     7 For instance, Rose and Yellen (1989) find little or no evidence of the existence of a J-
curve in the U.S. trade balance, while the use of data in levels would have led to an opposite
result.

4.3. Testing for Cointegration


         Testing for cointegration is carried out by employing both the Engle-Granger    approach

and the Johansen procedure. For the Engle-Granger        procedure, the levels and changes of all

of the variables have been used. The ADF tests are applied for detecting a unit root in the

residuals of the relevant cointegrating   regressions,   which involves regressing the following

equations:



                          Act = do + dlc,.l    + ~diAc,_i      + T,   (7)
                                                  1=1




wheres    is the residual from the cointegrating regression. These unit root tests show that while

the residuals from the regressions    of the levels of the variables have unit roots, those from

the first difference regressions do not (Table 2 and 3). These results are consistent with the

inference that while levels of exchange rate and trade balance as well as its components       are

not cointegrated, changes of these variables are cointegrated, implying the presence of a long-

run stable linear relationship   between exchange rate and trade balance and its components.

         Table 4 displays the results of the Johansen procedure used to test for cointegration.

With only a few exceptions, the Johansen procedure yields a quite similar result as the Engle-

Granger method, implying the presence of a long-run stable linear relationship        between the

(real) exchange rate and the (real) trade balance and its quantity components. The results also

suggest a weak long run relationship      between the (real) exchange rate and the export price

but no long-run relationship     between the exchange rate and the import price variable. Our

findings contrast with those obtained in similar studies on OECD countries such as Rose and

Yellen (1989), Mahdavi and Sohrabian (1993), and even Gruen and Wilkinson             (1994). The

latter find weak evidence of a stable relationship between the Australian real exchange rate

                                                 16
and the terms of trade in 1969-1990.

4.4. Testing for Causality




         As the results of the Johansen test statistics do not seem to suggest that the real

exchange rate of the RMB is cointegrated                    with the import price variable and the nominal

exchange rate is cointegrated with import and export prices variables, the dynamic equations


                                                             18
used for the purpose of the Granger-causality              tests may be specified in the first-difference

form according to the standard methodology                such as equations 4 and 5. As for the rest the

results from both the Engle-Granger        method and the Johansen procedure indicate that the

exchange     value   of the RMB is cointegrated                with the trade balance      and its quantity

components     as well as the export price (for the real exchange rate), the causal links between

these variables in the Granger sense can be specified in the first- and second-difference                 forms

by including an error-correction     term as in equations (6) and (8).


                                 m                    n

                             1=1                j=l




where AZis the second difference operator, and & is the error-correction              coefficient. As stated

earlier if AX and AY are cointegrated then there should be Granger-causation                     in at least one

direction, i.e. tiO. Hence, even if the second differences of X and Y regressors do not enter

equation (8), first differences might through the residual and hence Granger-cause                    Y and/or

X variables. The results of the Granger-causality              procedure using nominal measures of the

exchange rate and trade balance are reported in Table 5, and those using real measures in

Table 6,

        These results seem to be more supportive of the modern theory of trade balance than

of the standard      J-curve hypothesis.   First, we found strong evidence                (k is significantly

negative)    suggesting   that changes in the (nominal               or real) trade balance      Granger-cause

changes in the (nominal or real) exchange rate. Thus, the accommodative                  role of the exchange

rate proposed by the modem theory of trade-balance determination                 has received support from

our results. The results obtained provide no support for the presence of a J-curve in China’s

trade balance, since no evidence of a causal influence from the exchange rate to the trade

balance was found. This finding is somewhat consistent with Brada, Kutan and Zhou (1993)



                                                          19
that the J-curve effect did not appear in China’s trade balance following a devaluation in the

short run. A tentative explanation for this result may lie in the weak effects of exchange rate

on the quantity side of the trade balance. There is no evidence of the presence of Granger-

causality from exchange rate to the volumes of imports and exports. Their causal relationship

is unidirectional,    only from the import and export volumes to the exchange rate. To move a

step further we performed some additional causality tests for the prices and the volumes of

imports      and exports    since exchange    rate affects the volumes     through     the prices.      Not

surprisingly     we found no causal effect running from the price variables to the volumes of

imports and exports but the opposite relationships       held. This finding confirms our belief that

prices are not yet the key factor in China’s foreign trade management.                This seems to be

consistent      with the causal observation   of China’s foreign trade behaviour under which the

planners     set the targeted volumes of imports and exports without much caring about the

fluctuations     of prices. Even though the foreign trade reform has brought down the proportion

of the planned trade, about half of China’s imports and exports were still under the direct

control or the administrative      control in the early 1990s. This portion of the foreign trade is

less responsive to changes in import or export prices due to the administrative           restraints.

           On the other hand, it is interesting to note that a strong bidirectional    causal link from

the real exchange rate to the price components          of trade balance was found, implying that

exchange rate of the RMB is causally related to the movements             of the prices. This finding

seems to be supportive to the argument that the devaluation of the Chinese currency is rather

inflationary,     and may not improve exports.8 It partially explains why in the past China has

been very cautiously to devalue its highly over-valued currency, especially when China was

facing a high inflation. Our empirical results indicate that, although China has achieved a

great success with its economic reform program, its foreign trade management                               and the price

system    are still not yet market-oriented.           Such systems             would undoubtedly           hamper      the

adjustment and the responsiveness           of its balance of trade to changes in exchange rate policy

as well as the pace to integrating the economy into the world financial market.

5. Concluding      Remarks




         This paper focuses on the dynamic relationships                     between the exchange rate of the

RMB and China’s trade balance and its price and quantity components                                   over the period

1991 :MO1- 1996:M02, apparently an era of more flexible exchange arrangement in China. For

this purpose we applied the Engle-Granger              method and the Johansen procedures to test for

cointegration    and the Granger techniques to identify the causal relationship between variables


                                                        22
of interest.

          Our results seem to be rather supportive to the accommodative      role of the exchange

rate proposed by the modem theory of the trade balance determination         as emphasized by the

strong causal links running from the trade balance and each of its components to the exchange

rate. We did not find evidence suggesting that changes in the (nominal and real) exchange

rate Granger-cause     changes in trade balance and its quantity components.    The absence of a

J-curve in China’s trade balance is supported by the causally unidirectional     relation between

the prices and the volumes of imports and exports. This result is consistent with Brada, Kutan

and Zhou (1993) that in the short run the J-curve does not appear. Our findings imply that,

although China has achieved a great success with its economic reform program, its foreign

trade management      and prices system are still not yet market-oriented.   Such systems would

undoubtedly     hamper the adjustment and the responsiveness    of its balance of trade to changes

in exchange rate policy as well as the pace to integrating the economy into the world financial

market.

          Our findings of a bidirectional   causal relationship between the movements in the real

exchange rate and the prices variables confirm the presence of a vicious circle hypothesis,

implying that the devaluation of the Chinese currency sets in motion inflationary effect on the

prices which in turn cause further devaluation of the currency. This partially explains why in

the past the Chinese government has been very cautiously to devalue its highly over-valued

currency. Our results also suggest that the changes in exchange rate are much a consequence

as a cause of trade movements.       Changes in the exchange rate of the RMB alone seem less

likely improve the trade balance. Under the current economic system, an RMB devaluation

can improve China’s trade balance only if it is accompanied by other policies.
