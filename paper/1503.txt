          Recent Work on Business Cycles in Historical Perspective:
                       Review of Theories and Evidence


                                   ABSTRACT



     This survey outlines the evolution of thought leading to the recent
developments in the study of business cycles. The subject is almost
coextensive with short-term inacrodynamics and has a large interface with
economics of growth, money, inflation, and expectations. The coverage is
+-)y.Pry' kg4h      v4r 4      ii4 c,1 ,i4 4 tT

     The paper first summarizes the "stylized facts" that ought to be
explained by the theory. This part discusses the varying dimensions of
business cycles; their timing, amplitude, and diffusion features; some
international aspects; and recent changes.

     The next part is a review of the literature on "self-sustaining"
cycles.   It notes some of the older theories and proceeds to more recent
models driven by changes in investment, credit, and price-cost-profit
relations. These models are mainly endogenous and deterministic.

     Exogenous factors and stochastic elements gain importance in the part on
the modern theories of cyclical response to monetary and real disturbances.
The early monetarist interpretations of the cycle are followed by the newer
equilibrium models with price misperceptions and intertemporal substitution of
labor.  Monetary shocks continue to be used but the emphasis shifts from
nominal demand changes and lagged price adjustments to informational lags and
supply reactions.  Various problems arise, revealed by intensive testing and
criticisms.  This prompts new attempts to explain the persistence of' cyclical
movements and the roles of uncertainty and financial instability, real shocks,
and gradual price adjustments.

     One conclusion is that business cycle research will profit most from (a)
the updating of findings from the historical and statistical studies, and (b)
using the results to eliminate inconsistencies with the evidence and to move
toward a realistic synthesis of the surviving elements of the extant theories.

                                  I.   Introduction

     Interest in business cycles is itself subject to a wave—like movement,

waxing during and after periods of turbulence and depression, waning in

periods of substantial stability and continuing growth.1      At times, confidence

in government institutions and actions persuaded many that cyclical insta-

bility had ceased to be a serious problem.      Thus in 1922—29, the early heyday

of the Federal Reserve System, monetary policies were expected to help main-

tain prosperity.   In the 1960s, the late heyday of Keynesian economics, fiscal

fine tuning evoked similar hopes.

     The present is another time of disillusionment--now extending to both

types of stabilization policy.     The sequence of serious worldwide recessions

in the last decade soon refuted the perennially attractive idea that business

cycles had become obsolete.     Beyond that, the credibility of both Keynesian

and monetarist explanations has diminished.     Once again, the apparent failure

of old solutions prompts the profession to pay more attention to the continued

existence Of business cycles.

     The rediscovery of an important subject is always welcome, even if long



      1This is well illustrated in the early literature, which focused on the
episodes of commercial crises, but it is also reflected in the timing of
later, classical studies of the nature and causes of business cycles at
large.   There is little doubt about the impetus provided in this context by
the major depressions of the late 1830s, 1870s, 1890s, 1907-08, 1920-21, and
most strikingly the 193Os.

 overdue.    However, much of the recent work has neglected the long history of

 both the phenomena of major economic fluctuations and their interpretations,      con-

 centrating instead on contemporary theoretical and policy controversies, mainly in

 the United States.    An overview of selected literature will attempt to demonstrate

 that this myopia is costly and needs to be corrected.

        The study of business cycles is almost coextensive with short—term macrody—

 namics and it has a large interface with economics of growth, money, inflation,

and expectations. The literature is huge, its level of difficulty is in general

high.     This survey attempts to provide a historical background and outline the

evolution of thought leading to the recent developments in the theory and related

evidence.     The coverage is extensive, yet of necessity much is left out.    This

includes theories that are largely concerned with unemployment and inflation, much

less with business cycles directly.2

        In particular, no attempt can be made here to discuss in any detail the sta-

tistical. and historical work on the observed regularities and idiosyncrasies of

business cycles and their possible long-term changes.       This empirical literature

is rich and important:    it deserves a separate review.     After all, it is the "sty-

lized facts" which it provides that ought to be explained by the theory.       The main

such facts are summarized in the next part (II), but with a minimum of'     references
and commentary.

     Part III discusses the main elements of older theories, before and after the

Great Depression, and proceeds to more recent models driven by changes in

investment, credit, and price-cost—profit relations.       Most of these theories and

models are primarily endogenous and deterministic.     Exogenous factors and




     2Two sets of writings should be mentioned in this context, namely the the-
ories of the new radical economists and those embodied in some of the recent "dis—
equilibrium" models. For summaries or surveys, see Sherman, 1976, Malinvaud,
1977, and Drazen, 1980.
     Also, the early mathematical models and the more recent theories of the "po-
litical business cycle", receive little attention in the present paper; monographs
surveying this literature are Rau,   197)4; Gapinski, 1982; and Muilineux, 198)4.
                                          -3—

 stochastic   elements are introduced early in Part IV.

      The sections that follow deal first with the monetarist interpretation of

 business cyc'ies, then with the newer equilibrium models with price

 misperceptions and intertemporal substitution.        The route leads generally from

 "adaptive" to "rational" expectations.     The approach is generally monetarist

 in the sense of relying on monetary shocks, but the emphasis shifts from

 nominal demand changes and lagged price adjustments to informational lags and

 supply reactions.   Various problems and complications arise, revealed in large

part by intensive testing and criticism.        This leads to new attempts to

explain the persistence of cyclicaLmovemerits, the role of uncertainty and

financial instability, real shocks, gradual price adjustments, etc.

Conclusions are drawn in the last section (V), which stresses the need for a

realistic synthesis.


                                II.   Stylized Facts


1.   The Overall Aspects and Varying Dimensions of Business Cycles

      The term "business cycle" is a misnomer insofar as no unique period—

icities are involved, but its wide acceptance reflects the recognition of

important regularities of long standing.        The observed fluctuations vary

greatly in amplitude and scope as well as duration, yet they also have much in

common.   First, they are national, indeed often international in scope, show-

ing up in a multitude of processes, not just in total output, employment and

unemployment.   Second, they are persistent--lasting as a rule several years,

i.e., long enough to permit the development of cumulative movements in the

downward as well as upward direction.     This is well established by the his-

torical chronologies of business cycles in the United States, Great Britain,

France and Germany, a product of a long series of studies by the National
                                              _14_


 Bureau of Economic Research (Burns and Mitchell, 19146; Moore, 1961, 1983;

 Moore and Zarnowitz, 19814).       For all their differences, business expansions

 and contract-ions consist of patterns of recurrent, serially correlated and

 cross—correlated movements in many economic (and even other) activities.

      Seasonal movements, which are periodic but often variable in size and

pattern, may obscure the cyclical developments to an observer of current

changes in individual time series.           The same applies to short erratic

movements which are similarly ubiquitous.             But looking back across monthly or

quarterly data representing many different variables, business cycles can be

clearly distinguished from the other fluctuations in that they are as a rule

larger, longer, and more widely diffused.             They dominate changes in the econ-

omy over spans of several years, in contrast to the seasonal and other varia-

tions which spend themselves over spans of a              year or less.   They reflect, and

interact with, long growth trends which dominate developments across decades.

     Peacetime expansions in the United States averaged about three years in

the last half-century, two years in the earlier periods containing ten cycles

each (Table 1).    Each of the wartime expansions was much longer.              Contractions

averaged close to one year since 1933, about twice as long in the earlier

periods.    Thus a definite shift toward longer and more variable expansions and

shorter and more uniform contractions is evident since the "great contraction"

of the early 1930s.    Before 1933, recessions were on the average only a few

months shorter than expansions; since then, expansions lasted more than three

times as long as recessions.        The mean duration of full peacetime cycles re-

mained approximately stable at four years.

     The individual phase and cycle durations show considerable variability

over time, as shown by the standard deviations in Table 1.                However, when the

relatively rare outliers are discounted, fairly clear central tendencies

emerge.    Thus the ranges of   1     to 3   years,   1   to 2 years, and 2    to 5 years

  account for three fourths or more of the peacetime expansions, contractions,
  and full cycles in the United States, respectively.

Note:  All means and standard deviations (S.D.) are rounded to full months.
Expansions are measured from troughs (T) to peaks (P), contractions from P to T, the
full cycles from T to T. Figures in line 14 exclude the expansions during World War
II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War and the immediately following contractions.
Figures in line 6 exclude also the expansions during the Civil War and World War I
and the immediately following contractions.   For references and the underlying
detail, see Moore and Zarnowitz, 19814.


          The amplitudes of cyclical expansions vary as much as their durations,

  with which they tend to be well correlated.           The rates of change (velocities) and

  diffusion show less variability across the cycles.               Table 2 provides some evidence

  in support of these generalizations.

           In the 20 years between the two world wars three major depressions occurred,

  including the uniquely deep one of 1929-33.               Since then no general declines of corn—

  parable magnitude happened, notwithstanding the gravity of recent conditions of

  rising and high unemployment in some countries such as the United Kingdom.                   On the

  whole recessions became not only much shorter but also shallower and                   less dif-

  fused.     Table 3,   using a sampling of measures for the U.S. business contractions of
   1920-82, illustrates the contrasting dimensions of major depressions vs. other

  declines and the much smaller but consistent differences between              the "severe" and

   "mild" recessions.

 2.   Main Features of Cyclical Behavior3

       Most industries and sectors of the economy participate in the general

 business cycles with substantial regularity, that is, exhibit high conformity

 or coherence, but some do not (e.g., agriculture, which depends heavily on the

 weather, and production of naturally scarce resources).     Durable producer and

 consumer goods tend to have high conformity and large amplitudes of cyclical

 movements in production, employment, and inventories.     The amplitudes are much

 smaller for nondurable goods, and still smaller for most of the (nonstorable)

 services.   Manufacturers' sales move with greater amplitudes than wholesalers'

 sales, and the latter with greater amplitudes than retailers' sales.     In many

 industries, particularly manufacturing of durables, production is in large

measure guided by advance orders which show large fluctuations followed with

variable lags by much smaller fluctuations in outputs and shipments.     The re-

sulting changes in backlogs of, unfilled orders and average delivery lags are

themselves procyclical.

      Private investment expenditures, while much smaller in the aggregate than

consumer spending, have much larger cycles in percentage terms.     Aggregate

production typically fluctuates more widely than aggregate sales, which

implies a procyclical behavior of inventory investment.     Business profits show

very high conformity and much greater amplitude of cyclical movements than

wages and salaries, dividends, net interest and rental income.




      3mis section is based primarily on studies of U.S. economic history, but
many of the qualitative features of cyclical behavior summarized here are
found as well in the data for other major industralized countries with private
enterprise and free markets.   See Mitchell, 1913, 1927; Schumpeter, 1939;
Frickey, 19Lt2; Burns and Mitchell, 19146; Abramovitz, 1950; Mitchell, 1951;

     The level of industrial prices tends to have wider fluctuations than the

levels of retail prices and wages.    Virtually all U.S. business contractions

before World War II were associated with declines in wholesale prices.14

However, the last recession to be accompanied by a significant deflation was

that of 19148—49.   Since then the price level never fell cyclically, but each

of the seven U.S. recessions of 1953-82 resulted in a temporary reduction of

the rate at which prices rose, that is, in some disinflation.    But, in con-

trast to the general price indexes for consumer and producer goods, prices of

industrial commodities and new materials traded in organized auction markets

continued to show high sensitivity to business cycles, often turning down

early in slowdowns as well as contractions.

      Narrowly and broadly defined monetary aggregates usually experience only

reduced growth rates, not absolute declines, in connection with ordinary re-

cessions.     Only in cycles with severe contractions do substantial downward

movements interrupt the pronounced upward trends in these series.     The income

velocity of money, i.e., ratio of income to the stock of currency and commer-

cial bank deposits held by the public, tends to move procyclically (up in

expansions and down in contractions), allowing for its long trends (downward

before World War II, then upward for some time).

      Short—term interest rates display high positive conformity and generally

large amplitudes of' movements relative to their average level in each cycle.

However, when measured in basis points, cyclical changes in these series are

typically small when the interest-rate levels are low.     Long—term rates

usually lag behind the short-term rates, have much lower conformity and much




      4This is true for both the periods of long-term inflationary trends
(18143-614,1896-1920) and for those of long-term deflationary trends (18614-96,
1920-32).
                                                -10-


 smaller   amplitudes.    The relative movements in both short-term market rates

and bond yiei1s increased very significantly in the recent past as compared

with their historical averages.       Near cyclical peaks, short rates tend to come

close to or exceed the long rates; near cyclical troughs, they tend to be much

lower.

     Along with these conformity and amplitude characteristics, the recurring

features of business cycles include an array of timing sequences.       Months be-

fore total employment, output, and real income turn down, activities marking

the early stages of investment processes begin to decline.       These include the

formation of new business enterprises; corporate appropriations for capital

expenditure; contracts for commercial and industrial construction; new orders

for machinery and equipment; new bond and equity issues.       Investment

realizations —-   construction    put in place, deliveries and installations of

euipment —- keep increasing long after the decline in these investment commit-

ments as work continues on the backlog of orders accumulated during the busiest

stages of expansion.       Indeed, business expenditures for new plant and equipment

often peak when the overall economic contraction is already well underway.         At

business cycle troughs, with lower levels of capacity utilization, the delivery

lags are generally shorter, but investment commitments still tend to lead and

expenditures coincide or lag.

     Long before the downturn in total sales, profits per unit of sales

decline.    Total profits (a product of margins times sales) also lead but by

shorter intervals.       Stock prices move early as well, reflecting expected changes

in corporate earnings.      Bond prices tend to turn earlier yet (bond yields are

generally lagging).

     Labor productivity (output per hour) fluctuates procyclically around a

secularly rising trend, generally with leads.      Money wages often rise less than

prices in recoveries and more than prices in late expansion stages.         This
                                                                —11—




combines with the marked and persistent productivity changes to induce a

procyclical and lagging movement in labor costs per unit of output.

        Met changes in consumer installment credit and in mortgage credit

outstanding have similar procyclical, leading behavior patterns.                               So has the net

change in bank loans to business, but here the leads tend to be shorter and less

consistent.      Compared with the overall credit flows, the rates of growth in

monetary aggregates show in general lower cyclical conformities and amplitudes

and more random variations.              They have historically led at business cycle turns

long as to produce strong elements of inverted behavior in the monetary growth

rates, that is, extended declines during expansions and rises during short

recessions.

        Consumers' "sentiment," i.e., anticipations concerning their economic and

financial fortunes, also has a predominantly leading pattern.                            Recent recessions

in the United States have been more often than not preceded by downturns, and

recoveries by upturns, in consumer buying plans and actual expenditures on

automobiles, housing and related durable goods.                         Residential construction

commitments such as new building permits and housing starts have particularly

long leads at peaks and often also at troughs of the business cycle.                                Here the

gestation periods are fairly short so that the expenditures themselves show

sizable leads.

       Change in business inventories not only conforms positively to cycles in

general economic activity but is highly sensitive and volatile, often leading,

albeit by variable and on the average short intervals.                         Total manufacturing and

trade inventories, on the other hand, are dominated by long trends and tend to

lag.     Inventory investment plays a very important role in short and mild cycles,

whereas fluctuations in fixed investment acquire a greater weight in the longer

and larger cycles.

  typical of business cycles.

  3.   Some Internationai Aspects and Recent Developments

        Business cycles have tended to be shorter       in the United States than in
  Europe (e.g., the 1851t-1938 period witnessed 21 U.S. cycles averaging
                                                                         four years
 and only 16 British cycles averagine 5 1/3 years).
                                                            However, before World War
 II, more than 60 percent of the cyclical turning points can be matched for all

 four countries covered by the NBER chronologies, and only 10 percent
                                                                      cannot be
 matched at all (Moore and Zarnowitz, 198L).      After World War II, an era of great

 reconstruction in Western Europe and Japan set in, which witnessed first
                                                                          a res-
 toration of sound currencies and free markets, then rapid growth.
                                                                           For some time
 cyclical setbacks in these countries assumed the form of retardations of
                                                                          growth
 rather than absolute declines.     However, these slowdowns and the intervening

 speedup phases continued to show a high degree of international diffusion.
                                                                                       Then
 growth slackened and the "classical" business cycles (with absolute
                                                                     declines in
 total output and employment) reappeared everywhere in the 1970s.
                                                                         The tendency
for these cycles to be roughly synchronized across the major trading
                                                                     countries
became visible again, even without allowances for discrepancies in
                                                                   the longer
growth trends.4a

       In a large economy dominated by production for domestic
                                                               markets, business
cycles are likely to be induced primarily by internal mechanisms (e.g.,
                                                                               fluctua-
tions in spending on durable goods endogenously and elastically
                                                                financed) but
they are then transmitted abroad through the movements in imports
                                                                  that are a
positive function of production and income.     For small and, particularly, less
developed countries, fluctuations in exports usually call the
                                                              tune.        'Of course,

 United States of the OPEC oil price boosts     in 1973_7L and 1979—80 through

  increased co5ts and prices (leftward shifts in the aggregate supply schedule)

 and reduced real disposable income (hence presumably also some leftward shifts

 in the aggregate demand schedule).   Such worldwide supply shocks, although

 clearly of major importance in the context of contemporary problems of

 productivity, growth and development, are new and rare phenomena whose role in

 business cycles generally is modest but in danger of being overemphasized.5

 The more persistent effects come from changes on the demand side.     Thus the
 volume, prices, and value of U.S. exports show fluctuations that correspond

 well to the cycles in the dollar value of imports by the outside World (Mintz,

 1967).   The demand changes are powerfully reinforced when the links between

 the major countries convert their independent cyclical tendencies into

 fluctuations that are roughly synchronized.

      These links result not only from international trade --   current-account
transactions in goods and services -- but also from international lending and

investment --   capital—account transactions in assets.   The latter factor

became particularly important in recent times when asset markets became highly

integrated worldwide.   Interest rates (adjusted for the anticipated exchange

rate movements) are now linked across the open economies and capital flows
                                                                           are
extremely sensitive to the risk—adjusted differentials in expected rates of

return.

     Partly because of the increased capital mobility, the shift from fixed to

flexible exchange rates in the early 1970s provided much less insulation

against foreign disturbances than was hoped for, and also much less autonomy

U.S. recessions after World War II.   It should be noted that many recessions
are preceded by upward cost pressures and supply restrictions associated with
the boom-and-slowdown sequence of mid- and late expansion stages. On the
developments in 1973—76, see Zarnowitz and Moore, 1977.

for effective national macroeconomic policies.       The price levels adjusted for

exchange rates (that is, the "real exchange rates") show large and persistent

movements over time:   the purchasing power parity does not hold over time spans

relevant for the study of business cycles.       The recent fluctuations in real

economic activity show a very considerable degree of international convergence,

which presumably reflects not only the exposure to common disturbances but also

the increased interdependence among (openness of) nations.6

     In the 1960s, when it appeared that business contractions in Europe and

Japan are being replaced by mere retardations, there was a revival of interest

in cycles defined in terms of deviations from long trends rather than levels of

economic aggregates.   For lack of a better term, the alternations of above-

trend and below-trend growth phases caine to be called "growth cycles."         These

short fluctuations are defined by the consensus of detrended indicators just as

business cycles are defined by the consensus of the same time series with no

allowance for their long-term trends.     The trends are estimated only to be

eliminated from each series separately.        Growth cycles in this sense are thus

sharply different from, and should not be confused with, any fluctuations in

the long—term growth rates themselves.

     They also need to be clearly distinguished from business cycles.           Most

persistent and pervasive economic slowdowns begin with much reduced but still

positive growth rates, then develop into actual declines --       recessions.      Thus

the high—growth phase typically coincides with the business cycle recovery and

mid-expansion, the low-growth phase with late expansion and contraction.           But

some slowdowns stay in the range of positive growth rates and issue in renewed

expansion, not recession.   Thus growth cycles are more numerous than business

cycles and more symmetrical, being measured from rising trends.




     6See Whitman, 1976; P.A. Klein, 1976; Moore, 1983, ch.6.

      One can imagine a lengthy period of low, positive growth that would be

associated with as much deterioration in business conditions and rise in

unemployment as a short and moderate recession - and more.    But it is also

possible for a slowdown mainly to reduce inflationary excess demand created in

the preceeding boom, without causing much surplus capacity and real

hardship.    The policy implications of such a deceleration in economic growth

are entirely different from those of a recession which always depresses real

incomes and spending, outputs and employment.

      In actual experience, those decelerations in growth that have not led to

absolute declines in aggregate economic activity (in the recent U.S. history,

1951-52, 1962-64, and 1966-67) occupy an intermediate position between the two

hypothetical cases considered above.   Their adverse effects were felt

primarily in areas of particular sensitivity, notably as declines in housing

activity and stock prices.   Unemployment would cease falling rather than rise

substantially, and profits would weaken rather than tumble.   Thus the overall

impact of any of these slowdowns on economic activity was definitely less than

that of even the mildest of the recent recessions.

     Some economists focus on the nature and sources of expansions and con-

tractions, that is, on the business cycles.   Others, by abstracting from the

long-run trend, actually address growth cycle phenomena while aiming at an

analysis of business cycles; that is, they fail to differentiate between the

two categories.   The latter treatment, frequently implicit in the theoretical

literature of recent years, may not be a good practice.   General business

contractions need to be distinguished from periods of low but positive

growth.   However, mild recessions and severe depressions are also quite

different.   Also, many important regularities described in the previous

section are to a large extent observed in the context of growth cycles as
                                          —17—




well.    Thus when the series that tend to lead at business cycle turns are

adjusted fortheir own long trends, the resulting detrended series are

generally found to be leading at growth cycles turns.       An analogous statement

can be made for the roughly coincident and lagging indicators,.      Systematic

differences among the series with respect to their conformity and amplitude

characteristics are likewise largely retained after the necessary

transformations.

                      III.   Theories of Self-Sustaining Cycles

1.   Disparities and Common Elements in Some Early Theories

        The classics of business cycle literature made lasting contributions to

the description and analysis of the motion of industralized market

economies.    They addressed the cumulative processes of inflationary expansions

and deflationary contractions induced by bank credit fluctuations constrained

by the availability of reserves under the gold standard (Hawtrey,      1913).     The

role of discrepancies between the market and the "natural" interest rates in

this process was much explored following Wicksell, (1898) 1936.       At below—

equilibrium market rates, excessive bank credit creation produces over-

investment in capital goods industries and imposes "forced savings" on those

whose incomes lag behind inflation (Hayek, 1933).       But banks will have to

curtail the supply of credit and individuals will tend to restore their old

consumption standards.       As the demand and resources shift back to consumer

goods industries, undersaving or real capital shortage and losses to the

producers of capital goods result, causing a decline in these industries which

cannot be compensated elsewhere in the short run.       A deflationary downturn

cannot be avoided.     Here the monetary changes are linked to real "vertical

maladjustments", that is, imbalances between production of capital and

consumer goods or between aggregates of investment plans and savings decisions

(Tugan-Baranovskii (1894) 1913; Spiethoff (1925) 1953).

  acceleration principle (Aftalion,    1913; J. M. Clark, 1917, 1931).       Schumpeter
  (1939) saw economic growth itself as a cyclical process reflecting

  technological progress and spurts of innovations -- opening

  include the failure of foresight, intersectoraj. shifts, and

 relative prices.     Thus, under uncertainty,   interdependent expectations of
 businessmen generate widespread errors of optimism in expansions

 adjustments, and temporary but cumulative depressant effects (Robertson,

 1915).    Unit costs of labor and production tend to rise relative
                                                                    to output
 prices before and after the downturn, and they tend to
                                                        fall before and after
 the upturn, reflecting changes in capacity utilization
                                                        and productivity; as a
 result, business profits show large fluctuations which help
                                                             explain the
cyclical movements in investment and output (Mitchell, 1913, 1927).

     This capsule summary can merely illustrate the broad
                                                          range of views held
by these early students of business cycles.      It is clear that there are
important disagreements among their theories, particularly
                                                           with respect to the

activity, particularly those connected with business investment.

writers considered business cycles to be caused and conditioned

recurrent phases of widespread unemployment and underutilization of productive

capacities did (and still do) present a deep puzzle to the classical doctrine

according to which the economy is always in, or at least tending closely to,

the general equilibrium.     Thus, for a long time, business cycles were simply

ignored by most economic theorists or, at best, were viewed as merely tem-

porary "frictional" interference with, and departure from, equilibrium.        But

students of the subject, including those who were themselves committed to the

equilibrium theory, have done much to counteract this evasive and untenable

position.

     Third, in the historical periods addressed by these studies the level of

prices tended to move up during the general business expansions and down

during contractions.   The positive correlation between cyclical movements in

broad price indexes and real activity measures implied that fluctuations in

total nominal expenditures parallel the fluctuations in the aggregates of real

income, employment, and output.     This was generally accepted as a central

characteristic of business cycles by the early theories in which the

fluctuations in aggregate money flows of income and spending play a large,

proximately "causal" role.    Of course, for these fluctuations to produce

cyclical movements in real variables, it is necessary that wages and prices

adjust with some sufficient lags rather than being highly flexible.     This

condition was sometimes explicitly assumed but not much discussed and often

only implied.8




     8Cf.Haberler, 19614, pp. 1459-)461. In terms of the present-day conven-
tional macroeconomic model, let us add, the positive correlation of fluctu-
ations in prices and real variables would indicate that shifts in aggregate
demand dominate the shifts in aggregate supply over the business cycle. If
this sounds rather alien to the early theories, it is because the latter are
typically more disaggregate.

2.   Uncertain Expectations, Unstable Investment, and Long Depression Cycles

     Keynes (1936, ch. 22, esp. pp. 31L315) attributed to the trade cycle a

sudden, sharp downturn, a protracted decline, and a gradual, sluggish

upturn.   These are all characteristics of the 1929 peaks and the depressions

and recoveries of the 1930s in Great Britain and the United States; also, in

part, of the British experience in the depressed early 1920s.      They are not

typical of most cycles in these countries and elsewhere.

     The sharp downturn or "crisis" is explained mainly by "a sudden collapse

in the marginal efficiency of capital."    During a boom the supply of new

capital goods and the cost of their production and financing rise, with

growing adverse effects on the current returns on investment.     The inducement

to invest is further weakened if the current costs come to be viewed as higher

than the probable future costs.   Optimism about the always uncertain future

returns lingers for some time, but sooner or later doubts arise about the

reliability of the hopeful expectations engendered by the boom.

     Investment expectations are highly volatile because even those forecasts

of long—term profitability of specific business projects which are viewed as

most probable inspire little confidence.     Observable frequencies of past

outcomes are not generally a source of reliable knowledge in these matters.

Keynes' world is thus one of pervasive uncertainty which is sharply distin-

guished from calculable and insurable risk (as in Knight, 1921).

     It is easier and more rewarding to predict the short—term movements in

the stock market, which are strongly affected by "mass psychology," than to

divine the long—term prospects for individual business concerns.     The market

reacts promptly to news on fluctuating business profits with revaluations

which inevitably exert a decisive influence on the rate of current

investment.    new business will not attract investors if a similar existing

one can be acquired on the exchange at lower costs (Keynes, 1936, p.    151).
                                            -22-

        This last insight gave rise to an influential theory of Tobin (1969),

which makes investment in new plant and equipment an increasing function of q,

the ratio of'the value placed by the security markets on the existing firm to

the replacement cost of'   its   capital.   This approach has several advantages:

it is relatively simple, uses observable variables, and provides an analyti-

cally attractive linkage between investment and the expectations of the

financial asset markets.     Implicitly, it also relates the expected profit rate

to the required rate of return on capital in the stock market and hence to the

interest rate.    However, the hypothesis has not fared well in empirical tests

(von Furstenberg, 1977; P. K. Clark, 1979; Blanchard and Wyplosz, 1981; Abel

and Blanchard, 1983; Gordon and Veitch, 198Z).       This is perhaps partly because

of the use of average q instead of the theoretically more appropriate marginal

q9 but more likely because of various simplifying restrictions used in this

work:    homogeneous capital and perfect financial markets with no liquidity

constraints on firms.    These idealizations are poorly suited for an analysis

of cyclical movements in investment and they certainly clash with the

Keynesian views on the instability of financial markets (see section IV-6

below))0




     9This is the ratio of' the increase in the value of the firm from
acquiring an additional unit of capital to the marginal cost of that unit
(which, in contrast to the measured average q, is an ex ante and not directly
observable quantity).

     10The same observations apply a fortiori to the "neoclassical" investment
theory dating from Jorgenson, 1963, which concentrates on the average long—
term behavior as determined by the requirement that the expected returns over
the life of a project exceed its costs. The short-run deterrent effect on
investment of the rising flow supply price of capital goods (stressed in
Keynes, 1936, ch. 11) is not well captured in this approach, and the
expectational lags are not distinguishable from the gestation periods or
delivery lags (cf. Abel, 1980). For recent tests of this and other investment
theories, see also Bischoff, 1971, and Kopcke, 1977.
                                              -23-




        Once aroused, the doubts about profitability of planned and current

investment projects spread rapidly, bringing down in "disillusion" the stock

market which is revealed to have been overoptimistic and overbrought.                  As the

pendulum swings to overpessimism, the demand for broadly defined money will

increase, raising the rate of interest and hence seriously aggravating the

crisis.     The revival of investment will require a "return of confidence

an aspect of the slump which bankers and businessmen have been right in

emphasizing    .
                   .   •" (Keynes,   1936, p. 317).     Butconfidence, once severely

shaken, takes time to mend.          Also, the propensity to consume is adversely

affected by the fall in the value of equities.

        Only as the downswing develops will it bring the level of interest rates

down.     This decline will not be as prompt and large as would be necessary to

counter the "collapse" of investment.           For the demand for money is interest.-

elastic, highly so at low levels of the rates, because of bearish speculation

in the face of basic uncertainty as to the future changes in the rate of

interest.     The conclusion here is that a recovery from a severe slump is

possible only after the capital stock of business has been reduced

sufficiently to restore its profitability.              This may take several years,

through use, wear and tear, and obsolescence (op. cit., p.             151).

        It might appear that overbuilding is the cause of the downturn and long

slump but Keynes insists that it is not.              Rather, the effective private demand

fails to sustain full employment because investment is too unstable and the

propensity to consume is stable but too low.              It is only relative to the

deficient demand that "overinvestment" can occur; there is no saturation of

profitable investment opportunities at full employment.

        Keynes' concern was with long and severe depressions characterized by
 very large declines to low levels of both real investment and stock market

 values.    Such major depressions have occured at intervals of a few decades

 through the t930s but most business contractions were always much milder and

 shorter.     Even in long contractions the stock of capital usually continues to

 increase, although at much reduced rates; also, an abrupt collapse of

 investment is rare.11       Consumer spending is much less stable in the short run

 than Keynes assumed (but also much more stable and supportive of growth in the

 long run).    As   for   the demand for money, there is a mass of evidence that its

 interest elasticity tends to be relatively low (Laidler, 1969).       These

observations raise serious questions about some elements of: Keynes' theory.

3.   Wage and Price Dynamics in Business Cycles

      Despite the great rise and persistence of unemployment, real wages in-

creased throughout the 1930s thereby failing to provide one classical cure for

the apparent disequilibrium in the labor market.12        Keynes (1936, chs.   19 and

21) did not argue that money wages are entirely rigid downward but rather that

they adjust but sluggishly to excess supplies of labor.        Such slow wage declines

are apt to reduce incomes, consumption, and prices before they begin to improve

profitability and stimulate investment.        When the resulting gradual deflation

becomes widely anticipated, people would repeatedly postpone purchases, mainly

of durable goods, while waiting for prices to fall further.        The demand for

money increases at the expense of the demand for goods and equities.




     These points were made early by Burns (see his collected essays, 1954,
                                                                              pp.
3-25, 207-235).  On the dispersion of peaks in various categories of investment
commitments and expenditures, see Zarnowitz, 1973, ch. 4.

     121n the United States, average hourly earnings in manufacturing divided
either by the consumer price index or by the wholesale price index rose
approximately 20 percent between 1929 and 1934, for example.  Money wage rates
declined less than prices. Hours of work fell along with the number of the
employed workers.  Cf. Temin, 1976, pp. 138-141.
                                           -25--




     Moreover, unexpected deflation increases the burden of accumulated debt

which falls most heavily on businesses and individuals with high propensities

to borrow, invest, and spend.        The activities of these units are severely

curtailed as their bank credit lines are cut.        Business failures and personal

bankruptcies rise in numbers and size.         Irving Fisher (1932, 1933) ascribed

the depth of the depression to the confluence and mutual reinforcement of

deflation and "overindebtedness" inherited from the boom.         (This suggests

overinvestment as the cause of the downturn.)        His policy prescription was

monetary reflation, a reversal of the price decline.

     A one—time large drop in the general wage level is a theoretical but

hardly a practical alternative in a large decentralized economy with numerous,

strongly differentiated labor markets and a complicated structure of relative

wages.    A spreading depression in an open system threatens a competition among

the economies in reducing their export prices, with deeply damaging overall

consequences.

     The actual and expected changes in the rates of change in wages and

prices can certainly be of great importance in business—cycle dynamics.            The

effects on aggregate demand of changes in the levels of wages and prices, on

the other hand, are believed to have their main roles in comparative statics

and the long run.13     The static and dynamic elements were never clearly




     13The reference here is, first, to the "Keynes effect" (at lower prices,
a given quantity of money represents a larger real (quantity) and the "Pigou
effect" (at lower prices, a given quantity of net nominal private wealth
represents a larger real quantity). The former would raise investment through
lower interest rates, the latter would raise consumption. To stimulate the
economy in the short run both require downward flexibility of prices
generally.  The Keynes effect depends inversely on the interest-elasticity of
the demand for money. The Pigou effect depends positively on the magnitude of
net private wealth, which is probably small in relative terms.  Deflationary
expectations and distributional shifts may also weaken greatly this process
(Pigou,   19)47; Patinkin, 19)48).
                                        —26—

distinguished by Keynes and his immediate critics; the debate proceeded for a

long time in the framework of comparative statics, which obscured the

essentially dynamic disequilibrium nature of Keynes' theory (Leijonhufvud,

1968).

      After World War II, inflation became for the first time a chronic

condition in peacetime, drawing attention away from the concurrent, relatively

mild recessions and at the same time making their understanding apparently

much more difficult.    The old problem of'    depression-cum-deflation       was replaced

by the new problem of unemployment-cum-inflation.         The famous "Phillips curve"

emerged first as a nonlinear and inverse dependence of the rate of change in

nominal wages (w) on the rate of unemployment (U) and was rationalized by

relating U to the excess supply of labor (Phillips, 1958; Lipsey, 1960).               Soon

the rate of inflation (p) was similarly related to U, on the ground that p and w

normally differ by a steady rate of growth in labor productivity (Sarnuelson and

Solow,   196O).1

      The classical view of an aggregated labor market posits the existence at

any time of a unique equilibrium or "natural" unemployment rate (UN) as a

function of real wages (Friedman, 1968).        An inflation that has lasted for some

significant time will be expected to persist at some positive average rate
(e)      Changes in the price level that are generally and correctly anticipated

are matched by wage changes and hence cannot cause deviations of U from UN).

Only unanticipated inflation, i.e., forecast errors         (e   -   p),   can cause such

deviations.    Equilibrium requires that   e    =   p, hence a stable long-run tradeoff

between p and U cannot exist (the "natural rate hypothesis" -- NRH -- see



          should be noted that from the cyclical perspective it is far from
innocuous so to substitute price for wage inflation.   As will be shown in
section 111-6 below, labor productivity and the related price and cost
variables undergo partly systematic changes over the cycle.
                                           -27-




Friedman, 1966, 1968; Phelps, 1967).        A short-run Phillips curve, associated

with unanticipated or disequilibrium inflation, stays in place only as long as

e    remains unchanged.15

       The initial reaction of most economists to the Friedman-Phelps critique was

to embrace the NRH without questioning the existence of an inverse relationship

between inflation and unemployment in the short run.            This was because they

assumed expectations to be "adaptive," that is, backward-looking and involving

only partial and lagging corrections of past errors.16

Indeed, it was frequently assumed that the errors of inflation forecasts are

fully eliminated only on the average over the business cycle.                   On this

permissive interpretation of a "long run", the NRH is entirely consistent with

continuing parallel fluctuations in inflation and real economic activity around

their (uncorrelated) long trend movements.

       The expectations-augmented but only slowly shifting Phillips curve appears

in Tobin's 1975 analysis of Keynesian models of cyclical contractions, with the

qualification that this does not imply a full acceptance of the NRH.                      In this

dynamic model, output (Q) moves in reaction to changes in aggregate real demand

CE).    In the short run the two variables can differ, say, E K Q when Q                   is   rising

because of lags in consumption and unintended inventory changes.                   E depends

positively on Q and the expected price change       e   and negatively on the price

level P.    Actual inflation p (    rate   of change in P) adjusts to changes in                 e   and

in Q   relative   to QN (the full-employment output).        Finally       e   reacts to the

divergencies of p from     e•   The equilibrium conditions are E = Q, Q = QN, and p =
e•     The main inference from the model is that "a strong negative price-level

the "expectations—augmented" equation satisfying the lIRH it is Wt =                   f (Ut) + p.

of price expectations to experience are conducive to stablility" (Tobin, 1975,

pp. 199-200).    Large adverse shocks to E can push the economy into a depression,

and market price adjustments will provide no reasonably prompt and effective

remedy under conditions where the price-change effects on E are stronger than the

                       17
price—level effects.


4•   Disequilibrium Models with Capital Accumulation

      Keynes' analysis is only implicitly and partially dynamic.      Since net

investment varies, so does total capital, which influences output, investment,

and savings.    But these effects are ignored and the stocks of production factors

and technology are treated as constant.       The older acceleration principle has no

role in the General Theory, and indeed is not even mentioned.       But the 1930s and

l9LIOs saw a proliferation of formal models of essentially endogenous cycles in

aggregate output, which use various versions of the investment accelerator and

the consumption multiplier and let the two interact (Harrod, 1936; Kalecki, 1937;

Samuelson, 1939; Metzler, 191; Hicks, 1950).

      In most of these formulations, net investment is a function of changes in

output, which implies that fluctuations in consumption are transmitted with

increasing amplitudes to the higher stages of production -- the derived demand

for intermediate and producer goods.    This contrast in amplitudes is broadly

consistent with the evidence (see section 11—2 above), which has long made the

acceleration principle attractive to business cycle theorists.       Yet it is clear

from the data that investment series have much higher persistence or serial

correlations than the series of first differences in output or sales.




     17For a more recent reassessment, with similar conclusions concerning the
cyclical effects of deflation, see Tobin, 1980, ch. I.
                                         —29—




The simultaneous relationship between these variables over short unit periods

is weak, not surprisingly, since investment depends on expectational and

financial factors as well as on changes in technology, cost of labor, etc.18

      With consumption lagging behind income and induced investment behind

change in output, the multiplier-accelerator interaction can produce a model

of fluctuating output in form of a second-order difference equation.      Small

values of'   the coefficient of acceleration result in damped cycles, large

values in explosive cycles.     When a trend is added reflecting continuous

technological change embodied in "autonomous" investment, the cycles are

slanted upward around a line whose slope represents the equilibrium rate of'

the economy's real growth.     In the potentially explosive case, fluctuations in

actual output are constrained between a "ceiling" along which the (growing)

resources are fully utilized and a "floor" set by the nonnegativeness of gross

investment (Hicks, 1950).     This model uses distributed lags in consumption and

investment functions and suspends the accelerator during a steep downswing,

with the result that the slump is both cushioned and prolonged as the excess

stocks of capital depreciate but slowly down to the levels required by the low

production at the floor.

     A closely related but more general class of models is based on the

capital stock adjustment (or "flexible accelerator") principle:     current

investment equals some fraction of the gap between the desired and the actual

capital.     The desired stock varies directly with output (taken, questionably,



      18The theory of production function of the firm includes the acceleration
effect but also, in the general case of variable factor proportions and prices,
a substitution effect (see, e.g., Gapinski, 1982, chs. 2 and Li). Net investment
cannot decline in any period by more than the capital stock can be worn out,
which suggests asymmetrical behavior between upswings and downswings.    In
principle, it is in the long run, along the rising trend of capacity output,
that the simple accelerator making net investment proportional to the change in
output should work best, not in the short-run of cyclical analysis.
                                           -30-




 as a proxy for the expected demand for output that the capital is to help

 produce).     Net investment therefore depends positively on output and inversely

 on the initially available stock of capital.       This formulation (used early in

 Kalecki, 1935; Kaldor, 1940; Goodwin, 1951) is capable of being         improved with

 some significant advantages.    Since profitability should depend positively on

 the output-capital ratio, the role of profits in the investment function

 (stressed by many authors, particularly after Tinbergen, 1939) is given at

 least an indirect consideration.    The fraction of the capital gap closed in

 the short unit period (the speed of adjustment) may be made a function of the

interest rate and, more generally, the costs of capital.           The costlier the

speed,the more gradual will be the optimal adjustment; this opens the way to a

potentially useful dynamic analysis.       On the other hand, the cyclical changes

in capital stock, being relatively small (and rarely negative), have probably

rather weak short-term effects on investment and output.

     The dynamics in the models under review comes from lags, nonlinearities,

or both.     Monlinearities are likely to be very common in economic

relationships, in part because the numerical values of certain important

parameters should vary with the phases of business cycles which cover a wide

variety of macroeconomic conditions.       Yet few theoretical models of the cycle

make important use of nonhinearities.       In Kaldor (1940), investment (I) is a

sigmoid function of output (Q)    with   much lower positive slopes at both

extremes than in the broad middle range of the Q      scale.   I   is deterred by both

surplus capacity in slumps and rising construction and financial costs in

booms.     Saving (S) has a converse shape, with higher positive slopes at both

extremes than in the middle range of Q:      people stabilize consumption over
time by temporarily reducing (raising) the average rate of savings when their
                                          —31—




incomes are unusually low (high).19       Given Q, I depends inversely and S

depends positively on the capital stock K.       There are three possible equilibria,

two of which are stable.       The result is a self-sustained cycle in the real

aggregates, from stable to unstable to another stable equilibrium.20

     The substantive uses of nonlinearities in the theory of business cycles

are yet to be systematically explored.       There are, to be sure, various non—

linearities in mathematical and econometric models but they are on the whole

scattered and treated mainly as technical detail.       The early models by Kaldor,

Hicks, and Goodwin remain influential in this literature.21

     Very recently, some methods of the "singularity" and "catastrophe"

theories, new branches of applied mathematics, began to be applied to the

analysis of large economic fluctuations involving crises, depressions, and

rapid recoveries.    The theory is concerned with the interaction of "fast" and

"slow" variables in dynamic systems described by differential equations, where

the short run equilibrium may jump from one region of the state space to

another.   For example, the rate of change in output may depend on the level of

output, a "fast" variable, and physical capital and financial assets, "slow"

variables (expectations or other parameters can also be treated as slow

variables).     An illustration using a modified Kaldor model is offered by

Varian, 1979.    This is an interesting approach, though still in its infancy.




     19The argument seems to anticipate the more recent theories of
consumption if one adds the assumption that people perceive larger proportions
of their incomes as being transitory in booms and slumps than in the more
"normal" times closer to the trend.  Transitory income is taken to be largely
saved, permanent income consumed.

     20The path of output is dQ/dt     cz[I(Q,k) - S(Q,K)1, with a > 0 denoting
the speed of adjustment.   The  equilibria are defined by I(•)     S(•);  they are
stable when óS/'SQ > tSI/ÔQ,   which occurs  at both  low and high levels of Q,
and unstable when oS/SQ <   OI/OQ, which occurs  in  an intermediate position.
The responses of Q,    i.e.,
                           movements along the I or S curves, are speedier than
the shifts of these curves caused by the changes in K.

         list of some references must suffice: (Ichimura, 19514; Rose, 1967;
Bober, 1968; Chang and Smyth, 1971; Kosobud and O'Neil, 1972; Torre, 1977;

      While innovative in their dynamics, the models discussed here are severely

 limited in their contents.      They slight or ignore the monetary, financial,   and

 expectational factors which, theory and evidence suggest, are particularly

 important in major cycles, crises, and depressions.      Most of these models, too,

 neglect the role of new technology as a determinant of investment (Goodwin,

 1951, is a notable exception).     These criticisms have been made early in the

 heyday of the endogenous investment theories of the cycle (Burns, 1952;

 Haberler, 1956; Lundberg, 1958).     Hansen (1951) 19614 viewed the accelerator as

 relatively weak and stressed the driving force of autonomous investment related

 to innovations which require more capital per worker.

      However, it is also clear that the models in question contain important

 elements and are capable of being expanded and improved, in particular by in-

 corporating monetary factors.     Indeed, Hicks (1950) added to his main real

model a monetary subsystem which could aggravate some downturns.22      Tobin's
 1955 model has similar cycles but also explicit roles for the supply of mone-

tary assets and the inflexibility of money wages.      More recently, Laidler

(1973a) makes the desired capital stock depend on the lagged real interest

rate as well as the lagged output, thereby modifying Hicks' equation for in-

duced investment so that it includes monetary effects.      Inflation expectations,

formed adaptively, appear in a Phillips-type relationship which complies with

the NRH but permits gradual price adjustments.     This model retains an

accelerator-multiplier mechanism and can generate fluctuations in output and

prices.   However, unlike in Hicks, the cycles are here damped, and exogenous




     22See Hicks, 1950, ohs. XI and XII.   The "monetary complication" takes
the form of a cobweb cycle in the IS-LM space, with rather complex lags and
nonlinearities.  A quarter-century later, Hicks (197)4) revised his views,
stressing the need for greater reliance on monetary factors and autonomous
investment.

inventory   investment, output, and sales.    However, at some point during the

expansion the rates of increase in sales, and hence also in inventory

investment, will start falling.    Declines in income and consumption will

ultimately result, reducing the desired stock levels.     Again, the very efforts

to get rid of the unwanted stocks depress income and consumption further and

are thus temporarily self-defeating, but eventually the rate of decline in

sales and the disinvestment in stocks will begin to diminish, and an upturn in

income and consumption will initiate a new cycle.

     Several papers report generally favorable tests of Met2ler's model based

on annual and quarterly data, mainly for the U.S. in the first two decades

after World War II (Coppock, 1959, 1962, 1965; Hillinger, 1966, 1979).        The

periodicities are heavily concentrated in the 3—k    years range and are not
seriously disturbed by inclusion of random error terms, but there is substan-

tial damping.    Anticipated values are derived from distributed lags (adaptive

expectations).   The techniques include cyclical (NBER) measures, regression,

and spectral analyses.   The hypothesis that fluctuations in non-farm business

inventory investment and nonresidential fixed investment are essentially

periodic, with cycles of about 3-5 and 7—10 years, respectively, has been

recently revived by Hillinger (1982, 1983).     However, the unconventional

methods used in this work are subject to serious doubts and the results are

     Metzler's hypothesis, like other cyclical investment models of the

multiplier—accelerator type runs entirely in real terms and pays no attention

to price adjustments and monetary and financial factors.     Also, it fits best



     2kCycles are estimated by cosine functions applied to residuals from
polynomial trends. The latter lack a theoretical rationale and are limited to
the period of estimation. The paucity of annual observations presents another
grave problem of statistical nature.

the finished goods inventories subject to changes reflecting errors in Sales
forecasts. But studies which disaggregate inventories by stage of fabrication

and type of production (Abramovitz, 1950; Stanback,    1962; Lovell, 196L; Mack,

1967; Zarnowitz, 1973; Popkin, 1981) show that for good reasons the behavior

of stocks varies systematically between these categories.      Thus finished

goods inventories are important primarily in production to stock; in

production to order, which plays a very large role in durable-goods and

particularly capital—goods industries, inventories consist mainly of goods in

process which depend positively on the rate of output, and materials, which

are strongly influenced by cyclical changes in supply conditions (delivery

periods, availability).     The stocks of materials can be promptly adjusted in

the ordering stage.   Of course, it is difficult to allow for such details in

aggregative models but an important lesson here is that desired inventories

depend importantly on other variables in addition to sales.

6.   The Role of Changes in Prices, Costs, and Profits

      In his 1913 volume, Mitchell linked the major changes in business acti-

vity to the outlook for profits or (in time of crisis) the quest for sol-

vency.   Prospective profits depend on sales experience and expectations and on

the price—cost relation which is itself changing with the rate of employment

and capacity utilization.     Business costs tend to rise faster than product

prices in the late stages of expansion, which depresses profit margins and ex-

pectations.   Accordingly, new investment commitments are curtailed well before

sales flatten.   Income receipts and consumption expenditures weaken, inven-

tories pile up, and production cuts multiply, particularly in durable goods

industries.   Pessismistic expectations spread and are confirmed and worsened

when output and employment turn down.      In the contraction that follows,

similarly, price—cost margins and profits first deteriorate and then     improve,
                                        —36—




excess stocks and other imbalances are gradually liquidated, and new investment

orders, sales, and output eventually revive.

     When Mitchell first developed a theoretical account of these developments,

he had little empirical knowledge of them from the very inadequate data then in

existence.   By now, however, there is much evidence that the relations he

stressed are generally consistent with the "stylized facts" discussed in part II

above (on their validity see Fabricant, 1959; Hultgren, 1950, 1965; Kuh, 1960;

Moore, 1962, 1975; Zarnowitz, 1973; Moore and Cullity 1983; Boehm, 1982).         What

is particularly well established and important is the typically procyclical but

lagging pattern in labor costs per unit of output, which reflects primarily the

positive conformity and leadtimes of labor productivity (output per hour of

work).   Real wages, on the other hand, normally do not show large deviations

from trend that are consistently associated with business cycles.25

     In a 1967 model of Rose, employment and labor supply fluctuate relative to

the stock of capital which grows with net investment.       The rates of change in

wages (w) and prices (p) are equal in the long-run equilibrium but differ in the

short run reflecting these fluctuations.       During a recession, the ratio of labor

supply to capital increases, the rate of employment falls, and prices start

rising faster than wages.     The improvement in profitability leads to an upturn in

the rate of employment.     During the recovery, the condition p >   w   persists, but




     25Countercyclical movements in real wages are implied by the classical
marginal productivity theory of the demand for labor, which was accepted by
Keynes, and they are also suggested by the view that prices generally are more
flexible and procyclical than money wages.  However, the evidence is mixed and
not conclusive:  it varies with the choice of the deflator, the character-
istics of the period covered, methods and dates (e.g., the intracycle changes
may not show up well in regressions with annual series).   A few studies favor
the countercyclical hypothesis (Neftci, 1978; Sargent, 1978), but there is
more support for either procyclical behavior (Dunlop, 1938; Tarshis, 1939;
Modigliani, 1977; Stockman, 1983) or no significant relationship between real
wages and employment (Kuh, 1966; Bodkin, 1969; Geary and Kennan, 1982).
                                       -37—

gradually   investment revives and growth of capital accelerates.     First employment

and then capital start growing faster than the labor supply.     The upswing

eventually causes wages to overtake prices.    In the new phase where p < w, the

profit rate and the employment-capital ratio turn down.     Investment is reduced,

the rate of employment declines, and a new recession begins.

     The model has debatable implications for the real wage movements and its
                                                                       era.26        But
shortcomings are apparent given the lessons of the recent inflationary

all formal models are heavily restricted and the aspect covered here, namely the

cyclical role of changes in the relative input/output prices, is important enough

to make the attempt interesting.    Earlier theories of this type, although not

worked out mathematically, are in some respects broader and more satisfactory.2'1'

     The price-cost-profit nexus can and should be combined with monetary ele-

ments, since, as stressed by Mitchell, business cycles arise only in a "money

economy" in its late stage of development and are incompatible with pure barter.

(For one interesting attempt in this direction, see Rose,    1969).    In moderate

cycles, the effective limit on the volume of transactions is set by demand,

whereasin "intense booms" a higher limit of monetary natureis reached.28




     26under perfect competition, Rose's hypothesis has real wages increasing
in the boom and early contraction, decreasing in late contraction and re-
covery.  Under imperfect competition, however, real wages could be either
invariant or procyclical, depending on the elasticities of demand and marginal
costs.  A single nonlinear Phillips wage-employment curve is involved; shifts
in it would have to be introduced, lest the model be applicable at best to a
short period before any endogenous expectations of inflation changes develop
and take effect.

      27Krelle, 1981, shows the similarity of Rose's theory to that of Preiser,
1933.   The main difference is that Preiser had a two-sector (consumer-goods,
producer-goods) model, whereas Rose has a simpler one-sector model.

     28For example, an expansion can be halted by the constraint on a further
rise in bank credit imposed by the gold standard, as in Hawtrey (Mitchell, 1927,
oh. 2).  On Mitchell's efforts to synthesize real, monetary, and expectational
factors in viewing both the causes and effects of business cycles, see Friedman,
1952, and Zarnowitz, 1968 and 1972.

        IV.   Theories   of Cyclical Response to Monetary and Real Disturbances

 1.   Exogenous Factors, Stochastic Elements, and Types of Theory

      Part III discussed mainly the work of economists who attribute business

 cycles to the modus operandi of industrialized private-enterprise economies.

Here the cycle itself is the principal source of the stresses and imbalances

that keep it going.       A nonlinear model that requires only a single initial

disturbance to produce self—sustaining cycles has maximum endogeneity.29

      In reality, of course, the economy is always influenced by outside factors

(e.g., weather) so that a comprehensive explanation of its motion cannot be

purely endogenous.       But no outside influences can by themselves produce the

recurrent sequences of expansions and contractions; this presumably requires in

the first place the particular dynamics of an interdependent economic system.         A

really satisfactory theory, therefore, should explain how business cycles are

generated by the internal mechanism of an economy exposed to the impact of a

great many potentially relevant external events.      What matters, then, is the

relative role of the inside and outside factors, not the extreme cases.

Nevertheless, a mainly endogenous model of business cycles differs in principle

sharply from a mainly exogenous one.

      The specific events and variables that are usually treated as exogenous

include wars, changes in population, technology, weather, government spending,

tax laws, etc.   They clearly can and often do have major exonomic consequences

that affect cyclical behavior.      In addition to these factors which usually show




     29Fluctuations that are neither damped nor explosive but self-sustaining
are simply not credible in linear models.   It would be extremely unlikely,
e.g., for the accelerator always to assume that precise middle value which is
needed to keep the system in a constant cycle. With random shocks imposed
upon such a model, the cycles would increase over time (Saznuelson, 19147, pp.
268—269).  This does not apply to nonlinear models which can produce recurrent
cycles with bounded variances, as shown for a Kaldor-type model by Klein and
Preston (1969).

considerable   persistence over time (are serially correlated), there are also the

random shocks --   uncorrelated   disturbances of various kinds which impinge upon

the structure of economic relationships.       Both the white noise and the

                                                                         and
identifiable exogenous factors play important roles in the early, linear

dynamically stable model by Frisch (1933).       Here a low value for the accelerator

                                                               impulses which
is assumed but also a sufficiently close succession of erratic

keep the system fluctuating.      That is, the response of the economy to random but

continual disturbances is such that what would be otherwise damped (fading)

oscillations are converted into the recurrent business cycles.       This hypothesis

                                                                  recognition in
(which was suggested earlier by Wicksell and Slutsky) gained much

recent theoretical writings and particularly influenced the work of

macroeconometriC model builders.

     Several econometric models of the U.S. economy in the post-World War II

period have been found generally noncyclical in the absence of outside

disturbances, as shown by simulation studies (Adelman, 1959; Hickman, 1972).

But random shocks applied to the more recent quarterly models proved to be
                                                                            to
insufficient to generate movements with the observable cyclical properties;

induce fluctuations in these models,     it was necessary to use serially correlated

disturbances (Zarnowitz, Boschan, and Moore, 1972; Howrey, 1972).       Moreover,

                                                                much weaker that
even the best simulations show only residual cyclical elements,
                                                                    models.         This
 those found in the historical series used in the estimation of the
                                                                     estimates of
 could be due to errors in either the structure of the models or the

 the disturbances or both.3°

      It should be noted that the large macroeconometric models used primarily




      30me models estimate as constant parameters that may well vary with
                                                                         and
 changes in policy regimes (Lucas, 1976), the structure of the economy,
 major departures from average cyclical patterns.   Models estimated with data
 from periods with mild business  cycles such as those of the 1950s and 1960s
                                                                     such as
 are known to be unable to reproduce much more violent fluctuations
 those of the 1930s (Zeliner and Peck, 1973).

for short-term forecasting are frequently and extensively revised, and the more

recent versions of them may well be substantially more cyclical.         Simulation of

one commercially successful model suggest that random noise from equation errors

accounts for only 7% of an overall measure of "cyclicality" and that some two

thirds of the latter would remain even with stable monetary policy, no financial

disintermediation "crunches", and no oil price shocks (Eckstein and Sinai,

19814).


      The validity of the evidence from macroeconometric models which appear to

refute the endogenous cycle and favor the random shock theory is for these and

other reasons open to doubts.      Thus Blatt (1978) constructed artificial time

series on income, consumption, and investment based on Hicks' model with a high

accelerator implying unstable behavior.      An econometric analysis of these data

shows that they are seemingly well explained by a linear model with random

shocks, which has a low accelerator yielding stable conditions.         The problem is

attributed to the limitations of linear models (Hicks' theory is essentially

nonlinear) 31

      Business cycles interact with long-term trends in varied and subtle ways so

the separation of the two is difficult conceptually and empirically (Zarnowitz,

1981).    Decompositions using purely deterministic (say, log-linear) trends

ignore such interactions, e.g., the imprint that major cycles leave on the

growth rates for some considerable time.         Cyclical analyses based on deviations

from such trends are suspect on statistical grounds (Nelson and Plosser,

1982).    The proposed alternative is to use stochastic trends approximated by



     3'Further, Blatt (1980) argues that the random shock theory is
inconsistent with the evidence that deviations of many economic time series
from smooth long-term trends show a pronounced asymmetry:   the rises tend to
be longer than the declines and also smaller per unit period.   The measures
are based on long monthly time series examined in trend—adjusted form by Burns
and Mitchell (19146,   ch.   7).

 business cycle problem much more seriously than his writings
      In the generally prosperous times after World War II, however, business

 cycles slipped way down in the public and professional interest.       The weight of

 the public sector increased greatly throughout the industralized world, and

government actions and policies attracted growing attention as a likely source

of large macroeconomic effects, notably the rising inflation.        The idea that

business contractions are also policy-induced and episodic rather than a part of

self-sustaining cycles seemed increasingly plausible.

     Even while the style of macroeconomic analysis and policy remained

predominantly "Keynesian," the theory soon veered sharply away from the unstable

accelerator-multiplier models to concepts that imputed much more stability to

the private sector.     This evolution shows up strongly in Duesenberry (1958).

The notion of strong cyclical effects from high values of the accelerator and

multiplier was further deflated by new theoretical developments:        the permanent

income and life cycle hypotheses of consumption and the "neoclassical" models of

investment.     Used along with adaptive expectations reacting but gradually to

past events, these formulations suggested relatively stable trends in private

demands.     The rise of monetarism (see next section) worked in the same

direction.

     Historically, the main substantive differences among, the theories centered

on the relative importance of real vs. monetary factors.        This can be linked to

the the distinction between the impulses and the propagation mechanism,

introduced formally by Frisch in 1933.        There can be models with monetary shocks

and real propagation, models with real shocks and monetary propagation, and

various mixtures of'   the   two.   Even in the largely endogenous theories it is



     331n this relatively disaggregate and complex theory, growth is explained
by the interaction of a capital-adjustment process with autonomous investment,
downturns by the operation of' various exogenous factors, and upturns by the
corrective forces inherent in the basically stable system.

sometimes possible to differentiate in a somewhat similar manner between the

mainly origthating factors and the mainly conditioning or responsive factors.314

      In sum, the several dichotomies encountered in modern business-cycle

dynamics intersect in various ways, and the extant theories actually represent

many of the possible resulting combinations.      They generally resist being neatly

characterized by these categories, but even attempts at approximations can be

instructive.   A few illustrations for some theories lightly treated above are

given in Table 5 (see the first four cases; the others refer to materials to be

discussed later).


2.   The Monetarist Interpretation of Business Fluctuations

      In the 1960s, the rise of monetarism mounted a frontal challenge to

Keynesian economics, starting from the simple quantity-theoretic proposition:

Changes in the stock of money are the main determinant of changes in nominal

income.   The demand for money is a relatively stable function linking real

balances to wealth or permanent income and to expected rates of return on money

and alternative assets.   Given significant lags in wage and price adjustments,

sequences of alternating phases of'   high and low growth rates in the quantity of

money lead to corresponding fluctuations in aggregate demand and real economic

activity relative to the secular trends.       Sufficiently long periods of low but

predominantly positive monetary growth rates are likely to produce business

slowdowns or recessions; sufficiently long periods of negative monetary growth

rates lead to depressions (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963a and b).35



     314me idea is found in Pigou, 1927, p. 8. Hansen (196'4, chs. 17 and 18)
applies it to the work by Wicksell, Aftalion, Pigou, and J. H. Clark.

     350f course, monetarism (like Keynesianism) has come to denote a broad
assortment of theoretical concepts and empirical propositions attributed to
economists who agree in some respects and disagree in others.   Here there is
need only for a selective treatment of these characteristics inasmuch as they
bear on the evolution of the work on business cycles.   (For comprehensive
surveys, see R.J. Gordon, ed., 19714; J. Stein, ed., 1976; Mayer et al., 1978.)

     The lags of output behind the monetary changes are seen as variable but on

the average iengthy.   This is so because, say, an accelerated increase in the

quantity of money must first alter the relative prices or yields on a broad

range of assets.   The resulting discrepancies between the actual and the desired

portfolios prompt the banks and the public to take corrective actions.   The

stimulus would eventually spread to product markets, causing rises in payments

for services of, and the investments in, nonfinancial assets.   As spending,

income, and prices rise, interest rates will snap back from their earlier

decline.   If price expectations are adaptive, i.e., subject to lagged error

corrections, people will tend to underestimate the rising prices and hence

overestimate their real money balances for some time.   This will induce more

transitory spending to liquidate the extra amounts of "redundant" money, and in

the process the rates of rise in prices and nominal income will overshoot the

new equilibrium paths for these variables.6    Thus, even in the case of a single

shock, some cyclical (presumably damped) reaction may well occur.

     The rate of growth of output or real income corresponding to full

employment (or the "natural unemployment rate") is exogenous in this model,

being determined by real factors.   The monetarist theory of macroeconomic

fluctuations deals with deviations of output from this trend, that is, with

"growth cycles.




     6These paths would run parallel but higher than the new equilibrium path
for the money stock, because at a higher rate of price rise less money in real
terms would be demanded relative to wealth and income. See Friedman and
Schwartz, 1963a, and Friedman, 1970.

     37me equilibrium or trend level of output in this sense is associated
with less than full utilization of resources; hence it can be either higher or
lower than the actual level of output at any time. This is unlike the concept
of a "ceiling" imposed on output by full employment (as in Hicks, 1950).
      The early and still influential versions of this theory, due largely to

Friedman, treat monetary changes —- growth rates or deviations from trend of

the quantity of money -- as if they were predominantly autonomous, i.e.,

having strong one-way effects on movements in total spending, income, and

output.      The reverse effects, from business activity to money, are recognized

to exist but only as secondary "feedbacks."       The main source of critical

monetary disturbances is thus located outside the private economy, in policy

actions and institutional changes.       Private expenditures, including business

investment, are viewed as essentially stable, except when affected by the

money shocks:     when undisturbed, they tend in real terms to be consistent with

the natural rates of employment and output.

     This is a new emphasis.       Earlier monetary theories generally gave most

attention to private sector instabilities, particularly credit fluctuations.

The differences are highlighted in Table 5 above (see also section 111—i

passim).

     This brings us to the subject of the determinants of money supply.         Under

the present fiduciary standard, money consists of currency and, mainly, depos-

its in private banks.     Monetary authorities can affect the quantity of money

only indirectly and over time, by trying to control the monetary base (bank

reserves plus currency).       Subject to legal or regulatory constraints, banks

vary their reserve-to-deposits ratios and the public their currency-to—

deposits ratios in response to actual and expected changes in interest rates,

real income, and probably some other indicators, e.g., those of business and

consumer confidence.     In principle, then, a supply function for money in

nominal units can be derived, involving the policy-related base and a few

endogerious determinants of'   the money multiplier (ratio of the money stock to
the base).     The stability of this function is an empirical question on which
                                      _L7_




there is significant disagreement.8    However, there is a substantial

consensus, not only among monetarists, that any effects that interest rates,

wealth, or -income may have on the nominal money supply are much weaker and

less consistent than the effects of these variables on the demand for real

balances.   Moreover, monetarist studies argue that central banks have the

power and tools to exercise the dominant influence upon the money stock,

except in the very short run.

     The potential for an autonomous monetary policy is generally overesti-

mated by analysts who concentrate on United States, the only large market

economy in which balance-of-payments considerations could long be treated as

secondary even under fixed exchange rates.     For any small economy under this

regime, the nominal money supply depends on changes in the available foreign

exchange reserves, must tend to be consistent with prices and incomes that

will balance the country's international payments, and hence cannot be deter-

mined independently by domestic authorities.    Under the gold standard, a

business expansion would come to a halt when the drain of cash and shortage of

gold reserves forced the banking system to curtail credit on a sufficiently

large scale.   This was the ultimate source of the relatively large and regular

British cycles in the 19th century to Marshall, Hawtrey, and Lavington.

     An early expectation that the monetarist approach may ultimately produce

a theory of "a partly self-generating cyclical mechanism    .   .   .   including   a




     38Cagan, 1965, shows that high-powered money fluctuated more erratically
than, and often opposite to, the currency and reserve ratios.   One source of
the interrelation is indirect—-common response to business cycles—-another
direct-—central bank operations designed to stabilize the economy.   He finds
that "the dependence of the money stock on prices and business activity, as
well as on other variables, is strong but is neither rigid, uniform, nor
immediate" (p. 16).  Friedman stresses that "neither interest rates nor real
income have a consistent and sizable influence on the nominal quantity of
money supplied" (1982, p. 35). On the other hand, Brunner and Meltzer argue
that an empirically stable money-supply function exists (1968, 1972).
                                       -8-

 feedback in the rate of change in money itself"   (Friedman and Schwartz,

 1963a, p.64) has remained unfulfilled.   The feedback or "reflex influence"

 running from business activity to monetary growth has not been analytically

 developed and integrated into a theory of how money, prIces, and real factors

 interact in the short run.   The approach produced instead an essentially

 exogenous and monetary model of the business cycle.   Yet the same studies that

 show an important independent role of money, particularly in major infla-

 tionary booms and severe deflationary slumps, also find much evidence that

fluctuations in the monetary variables reflect those in real   aggregates,

particularly in mild cycles (for a summary, see Cagan, 1965,   p. 29L).   The

primacy of the monetary effects cannot be established by the less than compelling

argument that, since money plays a key role in the major cycles, it should also be

important in the minor cycles which are just "less virulent members of the same

species" (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963a, p. 55).

     The idea that cyclical instability is mainly policy—induced is not an integral

part of, or a necessary inference from, the monetarist theory.     It is an empirical

judgment held by some monetarists as well as other economists.39    The popularity of

this view rose in the late 1960s and 1970s, when both inflation and unemployment

drifted upward, the Phillips curve moved north-to—northeast through a series of

clockwise cycle-related loops, and failures of attempted stabilization policies were

evident.   Rather paradoxically, the 1970s also witnessed the culmination of the

belief in the power of macroeconomic policies in form of the concept of a "political




     39Consider the following statement by authors who contributed much to the
development of the money supply function:   "Our version of monetarism does not
deny that if exogenous shocks take the form of government policies, including
fiscal policies, the system may oscillate or even explode into inflation or
cumulative deflation.  Our proposition asserts that cyclical instability is
mainly the product of government policies that are imposed on a stabilizing
private sector" (Brunner and Meltzer, in J. Stein, ed., 1976, p. 180).

business cycle," which is not of monetarist origin.40
     Monetarist models can acquire some cyclical dynamics by combining an

expectationsaUgmented Phillips curve with the quantity-theoretic demand for money

function.   Laidler (1973b) presents an intentionally very simple model of this type,

with exogenous monetary growth and the full-employment output rate, and adaptive

expectations of inflation.   The causation runs from lagged and current money growth

rates and current inflation to the change in output, then back to inflation, and so

on, recursively.   The model generates a cyclical movement in output and inflation

(relative to their natural and expected values, respectively) in response to a

single shift in the rate of monetary expansion.   Laidler notes that its simulations

leave much to be desired, probably in large part because of the missing variables,

particularly the interest rate.4

3.   Price Misperceptions and Intertemporal Substitution of Labor
     Adaptive expectations often imply long lags of adjustment and persistence

of apparently systematic errors.   Critics regard models that yield such

results as ad hoc and inconsistent with optimizing behavior.   They accept

instead the view that "expectations are essentially the same as the predic-

tions of the relevant economic theory" (Muth, 1961, p. 316).   Application of

this "rational expectations" hypothesis (REH) to macroeconomics was part of a




     40The political models of business cycles maintain several strong and
questionable assumptions. (1) Policymakers know the structure of the economy, the
public does not.   (2) The inflation-unemployment short-run tradeoff can be exploited
effectively by the party in power.   (3) Voters are myopic and concerned with the
current electoral period only. Thus the government is capable of fine-tuning the
economy periodically.   It is not surprising that these models, though ingenious,
find little support in facts: the related evidence is mixed and generally
inconclusive. See Nordhaus, 1975; Lindbeck, 1976; MacRae, 1977; also, Fels, 1977;
Moore, 1977a; and Tufte, 1978.   A very useful, balanced overview is given in Alt and
Chrystal, 1983; see especially, ch. 5.

      For  a corresponding theoretical analysis of a model for a small open economy
under fixed exchange rates, see Laidler, 1975, ch. 9.

new ambitious program of work undertaken in the 1970s by several economists

following the initiative of Lucas, 1972.        The objective was to develop a

general business—cycle theory in strict adherence to the basic principles of

the analysis of economic equilibrium:      consistent pursuit of self-interest by

individuals and continuous clearing of all markets by relative prices.42

        Under RE}-{, the route of the older monetarist theory which used adaptive

expectations to help explain the duration of cyclical movements is fore-

closed.     Expectations are now taken to be free of any bias and subject to

random errors only.     All persistent monetary changes, inasmuch as they are

predictable, will be correctly anticipated and met directly by proportional

changes in prices and related nominal variables.       Only random monetary

impulses can lead to price surprises and miscalculations which, in this view,

are necesssary to explain any cyclical movements in real variables.

        The short-run aggregate supply function for labor (Lucas and Rapping,

1969) is upward-sloping relative to the deviations of the current level of

real wages from their expected (discounted future) level.       It is seen as

typically elastic, reflecting strong competitive incentives to take advantage

of temporarily higher rates of real return.       Since the substitutability of

leisure over time is high, a small change in the return on the current work

effort can induce a large change, in the same direction, in the amount of work

done.     This intertemporal substitution hypothesis (ISH) plays a central role

in the recent attempts to explain employment fluctuations as an aggregate

result of individual choices on the supply side of the labor market.

as a theory of monetary disequilibrium and an unstable cumulative process, with
excessive credit creation causing distortions of relative prices and the
structure of production (as Hayek, 1932, 1933, are commonly interpreted).

 forecasting errors are unavoidable and can be recognized only in time, after

 the outside price data becomes available.       However, by then many erroneous

 decisions will already have been taken, and the necessary revisions and

 corrections, too, will involve time and costs.

        The model of the "representative producer," with its fusion of worker and

 employer, assumes that labor and business recognize that their interests

 generally coincide, or at least act as if they did.      This is not consistent

 with the strong evidence of significant patterns of cyclical behavior in cost—

 price-profit relationships (see part II and section 111—5 above).      These

 observations can best be interpreted on the common—sense assumption that firms

and workers pursue their own interests in reacting rationally to changing

business and labor market conditions.3

       The issue of the relative timing of output prices vs. input costs can be

reduced to an informational problem in a number of ways.       It might be assumed that

firms have prompter knowledge of price changes than workers or, more generally,

that the representative producer unit (firm      or worker) knows the prices of things

it sells better than the prices of things it buys (cf. Friedman, 1968).         If so,

then inflation will be stimulative because it is largely unanticipated by workers

or buyers (or, which is much the same, because it is recognized sooner in output

prices than in input costs).    Some critics view any of these assumed informational

asymmetries as arbitrary specifications (B. Friedman, 1978, p. 76;     Tobin,   1980, p.
42).

       The equilibrium approach to business cycles can be explained well in general

terms (Lucas, 1977) and restated simply    (see the text above and the capsule




     3To be sure, the interests of workers and employers may coincide in some
respects and are reconciled in negotiated or implicit contracts (see section IV-
7(3) below).

description in Table 5).     The individual models based on the REH and the ISH,

however, are much too diverse, experimental, and complex to lend themselves to

such verbal summarization.     Some of them use changes in current prices relative to

the next period's expected price level to induce intertemporal substitution on the

supply side (Lucas 1972, 1973; Sargent and Wallace, 1975).     Others allow for the

existence of assets that earn a nominal interest rate and add that rate to the

above price surprise term to obtain a measure of anticipated one-period real rate

of return.   This relative price variable then appears with a positive sign as a

determinant of supply and with a negative sign as a determinant of demand

(Barro, 1980a and

     The general criticism of the price—misperception hypothesis is that it

requires long informational lags which are even less likely under rational than

under adaptive expectations.    Ample, frequent, and low-cost monetary and price

statistics are now available, so informational confusion of the type here

hypothesized can at most be short-lived and associated with random changes, not

persistent cyclical fluctuations, in output and employment (Hall, 1975, 1980a;

Tobin, 1977; Modigliani, 1977).    True, this argument is partly countered by the

observation that there are indeed serious deficiencies in these and other impor-

tant data on the economy, which in many cases are reduced only througha time-

consuming sequence of revisions.    This can distort initial expectations and

delay successful signal detection for several months (Zarnowitz, 1982).     Still,

informational lags are surely much shorter than the average cyclical movements,

so they cannot alone account for the duration of the observed fluctuations

(Okun, 1980) or, one may add, for the large size procyclical fluctuations in

corporate profits and stock prices.     Beginning with an economy at full




     The net effect of a rise in this composite variable, then, will be to
stimulate output if, on the aggregate across the markets, the induced increase in
supply is larger than the induced decrease in demand.  This formulation takes into
account the debate about the direction of informational asymmetries noted in the
preceding paragraph of the text.

 empioyment,          most errors caused by temporary misperceptions of monetary and

 price changes would be detected and corrected before they could give rise to

 large cumulative income movements in either direction.                    Finally, the knowledge

 of the nominal interest rates, a set of timely and global variables, may convey

 information about the unobserved part of money growth (King, 1983;                               Barro,
 1980b).6

       The criticism of the ISH centers on observations said to be inconsistent

with continuous equilibrium in the labor market (see, e.g., Okun, 1980).                                   Thus

separations       account for most of the rise in unemployment.                 More people are

looking for work at current (or even lower) wages over longer average time

periods.       Fewer people quit their jobs as vacancies drop.

       General critiques, however, have limited power of persuasion, particularly

against strong priors of the economic equilibrium theory.                       It is therefore

particularly important that the hypotheses under consideration have been

subjected to various tests, in large part by their proponents.

       In one set of tests, the reaction function of' monetary authorities was

estimated by regressing the rate of growth in money on its own past values and

selected lagged variables, and identifying the residuals from this regression

with the "unanticipated" component of monetary change (Barro, 1977a, 1978; Barro

and Rush, 1980).          These tests could not reject the joint hypotheses of

rationality and neutrality of money, but many doubts were raised about the

specification and identifiability of'        Barro's         reaction function as well as its



     5it is against the spirit of the new equilibrium theory (and some older
scholars such as Hayek and other Austrians) to start an attempted explanation
of business cycles from postulating an initial state of recession.

      146This prompts Barro (1981, p. 51) to observe that the "stress on
confusions between temporary and permanent monetary shocks has been over-
done.   The real effects of temporary, but perceived, money shocks would be
eliminated by the appropriate adjustment in the nominal rate of return."
                                        -55—




consistency with private and public rational behavior.7

     The neutrality hypothesis that anticipated money growth has no real effects

is strongly rejected by tests reported in Mishkin (1982).    Here anticipated as

well unanticipated money growth influence output and unemployment with lags of

up to 20 quarters.8

     Data on monetary aggregates are available promptly and often (now weekly)

but they are also repeatedly revised.    The revisions are frequently large

relative to the average rates of money growth but they appear to be on the whole

random.   Economic agents should not be assumed to be ignorant of the current

monetary values for which they do have usable approximations.    And, contrary to

the RE-IS models in which prices are fully flexible, output is in fact

positively associated with these measured and knowable values of the money stock

(King, 1981; Boschen and Grossman, 1982; McCallum, 1982).

     The early tests by Lucas and Rapping (1969) favor the ISH but they are

based on adaptive expectations.   When re-estimated by Altonji (1982) under

rational expectations and a variety of alternative assumptions about agents'

information sets, the results generally fail to support the ISH.49    Weak

negative effects of a price surprise term on the unemployment rate are reported



            the comments by Blinder, H. J. Gordon, R. Weintraub, and Fischer in
S. Fischer, ed., 1980, pp. 49-72 and 219-221.   On the related basic problems
of "observational equivalence" and testability, see also Sargent, 1976b, and
Sims, 198Oa.

          is these longer lags that are primarily responsible for Mishkin's
conclusion being the opposite of that reached in the Barro papers, where lags
of two years or ten quarters are used.  No attempts to rationalize the
persistence of such long distributed lags under the REH are made in any of
these reports. See also Nelson, 1981, on the dependence of unemployment on
lagged values of nominal GNP.

     9"For most specifications, the current real wage, the expected future
real wage, and the expected real rate of interest are either insignificantly
related to unemployment and labour supply or have the wrong sign" (Altonji,
op. cit., p. 78L).  See also Altonji and Asherifelter, 1980.

 in Sargent (1976a) but disputed in Fair (1979); there are simultaneity problems
with these estimates, as shown in Barro (1980a).       These and other tests (Hall,

 1979) are admitted to be rudimentary and on the whole inconclusive; all

participants in this work stress that it presents great difficulties.         Still

other recent tests addressed to certain manageable aspects of the problem have

produced for the most part negative results (Clark and Summers, 1982; Mankiw,

Rottemberg, and Summers, 1982).

      To sum up, the evidence can be fairly described as being on balance un-

favorable to the theories here considered.     This has led to some reassessments

on the part of their authors.     Thus Barro (1981, p. 74) expresses "doubts

about the explanatory value for business cycles of currently available

equilibrium theories."50    MeCalluin, 1982, p. 4.,   argues that the evidence

requires the abandonment of "flexible-price equilibrium models" but not of the

"equilibrium approach to macroeconomic analysis," which can rationalize sticky

or slowly-adjusting wages and prices.


4.   Cyclical Persistence and Extensions of the Equilibrium Models

     Can random monetary shocks produce persistent fluctuations of'    real   aggre-

gates in an economy with market clearing and incomplete information?      Those

who deny it attack mainly the ISH as leading to misguided attempts to

represent business cycles as a "moving equilibrium" (Modigliani, 1977; Tobin,

1977, 1980; Solow, 1980).   Some expect that the postulate of continuous

marketing clearing will have to be abandoned in the RE models (Okun, 1980;

Gordon, 1981).




     50He hastens to add that these doubts "do not constitute support for
Keynesian disequilibrium analysis," which is incomplete and even more
questionable.  His argument implies that there are only two sides to the
debate, the "new classical macroeconomics' and "Keynesian macroeconomics."
This is a widespread but mistaken and, in my opinion, much too restrictive
point of view.
                                       —57-




     The equilibrium theorists recognize that the basic ingredients of their

models are not sufficient to produce the persistent movements in output and

employment -which occur during the business cycle.    However, they point out

that random shocks to aggregate demand can be converted into persistent

movements by suitable propagation mechanisms, as in Frisch, 1933.      Further,

Lucas and Sargent (1978, pp. 65-67) argue that some devices of this type have

already been incorporated in the equilibrium models and others are likely to

be developed.

     The first of these propagation mechanisms relates to the familiar

observation that rapid adjustments of the rates of employment and production

are costly.     Accordingly, firms respond with lags to the relative price

signals they perceive.51     In practice, modeling the cost-of-adjustment effects

takes the form of making the demands for factors àf production depend partly

on their own lagged values. it is important to note that this mechanism is

entirely different from and extraneous to that of the random price-mispercep-

tion effects.    The latter should not be spread over time by the old device of

distributed lags.    The unit period here is defined by the lag of data on the

nominal aggregates which was already shown to be relatively short.       The logic

of this approach seems to leave no good reasons for extending the lag to more

than one period and so opening up the possibility of autocorrelated forecast

errors.   Cost-of-adjustment models may provide a rationale for more     complex

and longer lags.     However, in a world without uncertainty about the

probability distributions governing the future (see next section), where

markets clear continuously leaving no unexploited opportunities for gain,



     51It should be noted that such lags could also rationalize a dynamic
model of fluctuations in employment and output that is purely "real", i.e.,
independent of' the behavior of money and prices (see Sargent, 1979, pp. 370-
379).
                                             -58-


   there   should be little ground for any sizable distributed
                                                               lags in economic
  decision making (cf. Poole,    1976).

       Another propagation device incorporates
                                               a form of an investment accel-
  erator (Lucas, 1975).    Positive price surprises induce not only increases
                                                                              in
  current employment and output but also acquisition of
                                                        additional capital.
  Capacity is supposed to increase promptly during
                                                   the period when the nature of
  the shock is not yet recognized. This increment to the
                                                          stock of capacity
  raises labor productivity and temporarily increases
                                                      the demand for labor and
  the supply of commodities; it also retards the
                                                 general price increase, thereby
 delaying the recognition of, or adjustment to,
                                                the initial shock.        Thus a
 persistence effect is created.

      This formulation also poses some major problems.
                                                              Many capital investment
 projects involve indivisibilities,       high costs and risks, and gestation periods
 measured in years and quarters, not months.
                                                    They are unlikely to be decided
 upon isolated signals that could well prove false
                                                   after a short information
 lag (cf. Gordon, 1981, p. 510).    Not surprisingly, random monetary

 disturbances and price misperceptions have not
                                                attracted much attention in the
 literature as potentially important determinants
                                                  of investment; instead,
expectations based on systematic changes in demand,
                                                    profits, credit, and cost
of capital have.    Neglect of these factors deprives the treatment of
                                                                       business
capital investment in this class of models of
                                              much interest.

     Furthermore, because of the relatively long ordering
                                                          and construction lags,
investment will tend to add to demand before
                                             it adds to capacity.  The effects

          Investment realizations are a distributed—lag function of investment
     plans.   But the series of new capital appropriations and contracts and orders

     for plant and equipment that proxy for investment plans are also serially

  correlated like the expenditures that follow them, only less so (see, e.g.,

  Zarnowitz, op. cit.).            Hence they lack the random-shock property which the

  equilibrium     theorists look for in "an essential propagator of business cycle

 fluctuations" (Taylor in Fischer,            ed., 1980, p. 192).         Nevertheless they are
 an important link in the cyclical process.                    The lag of investment expenditures

 behind investment decisions is an essential element in several otherwise

         Inventory investment provides still another potential channel for

 persistence effects in equilibrium models.                    In Blinder and Fischer (1981), an

 unanticipated rise in money and prices leads firms to sell out of inventories

 at the same time as they increase output.                    In subsequent periods, production
 is gradually raised to restock the depleted inventories.                    More specifically,
 inventory investment depends positively on the excess of the
                                                              desired stock of

         However, even in relatively simple linear models, the computational

 problems posed by this radically logical approach are often formidable.        Using
 RE as a model of actual behavior cannot mean imputing to economic agents

 generally the ability to solve such problems.     Rather it is the markets that

 are supposed to work as if they somehow approximated this capacity.     This

 could be interpreted along the lines of what may be called a weak version of

 the REH:    market incentives and penalties favor the dominance of optimal or

 cost-efficient predictions..    Firms and individuals whose forecasts are

 consistently poor will not be able to survive economically.     The anticipations
 of those who do survive will tend to come true.    This implies that predic—
 tively valuable information, on which such anticipations are based, is
                                                                        scarce
 so that collecting it is a profitable activity (Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980).

     Such propositions, when applied to well-functioning individual markets,

seem simply good, standard economics.     In the aggregate, they need not imply

more than a long-run tendency toward equilibrium, promoted by learning from

experience but inhibited by limited opportunities for controlled experi-

ments.    Thus no firm link is established between the type of model and the

expectational hypothesis used.     In particular, RE models have been built

without the property of continuous market clearing.     In principle, various

types of disequilibria could be expected by people and modeled with the
                                                                        aid of
RE methodology; or, if expectationa]. confusions prevail, no unique solutions

should be found.

     The REH of the macroeconomic literature in the 1970s, however, is a

strong version which adds to the reasonable premise of rational use of costly

information another assumption, namely that the available data and models

provide sufficient knowledge about the future so that the prevailing expecta-

tions are free of any systematic errors and consistent with continuous

 necessarily imply such a consistency.55

         In a stochastically stationary environment that has persisted long enough

 to be familiar, agents are assumed to have learned all they can about the

 probability distributions they face.6      In the economy as it is, however,

 change is to a large extent unanticipated and learning is perpetual.     In

 models with learning and disparate expectations, convergence to the RE equili-

 brium requires that agents know no less than the laws governing the change in

 the key parameters of the economy and the effects of exogenous shocks.

 Learning itself can act as a cyclical propagator mechanism by inducing serial

and cross correlations in forecasts (Townsend, 1978, 1983a and b).

         The strong assumptions of prior knowledge, are implausible but there

seems to be no alternative to them that would be satisfactory from the RE

point of view.57     Some simple but flexible rules of adaptive expectations (AE)

may be consistent with optimal learning (Taylor, 1975; B. Friedman, 1979)and

some models with a common simple rule converge to an equilibrium solution       (for

an example, see Bray, 1983).     But the collective adherence to a rule which, if

individually followed, would yield biased forecasts is in conflict with the

idea of the optimizing representative agent in a decentralized market economy.

     It is important to distinguish between the critique of the RE and the

critique of the particular market-clearing models with RE (see, e.g.,

Fair,1978).     Many critics agree that the pre-.RE treatments of expectations are

 permanent changes to occur but not to be identified immediately.     Stochastic

 shocks, whether monetary or real, have permanent and transitory components

 which cannot be reliably separated (new information reduces but does not

 eliminate the confusion).   The rational response to the shocks is adaptive,

 taking the form of gradual adjustments of beliefs about the permanent values

 of the endogenous variables.59

      What is the evidence of how people actually form their expectations?

 Recent work using survey data has been preoccupied with tests for the

 rationality of inflation forecasts.   Typically, actual values are regressed on

 predicted values, and the forecasts fail the tests when (1) the sample

 intercept and slope estimates are significantly different from zero and one,

 respectively, and/or (2) the residual errors are significantly autocor—

related.   Data from the semiannual surveys of economic forecasters conducted

since 19J47 by Joseph A. Livingston, a syndicated financial columnist, reject

the REH according to most of these and related tests (Pesando, 1975; Carlson,

1977; Wachtel, 1977; Moore, 1977b; Pearce,    1979; Gramlich, 1983; more favorable

results are reported by Mullineaux, 1978).    Tests of individual forecasts

confirm those of the group average forecasts, and the results from the

quarterly NBER—ASA economic outlook surveys are consistent with those obtained

for the Livingston surveys (Figlewski and Wachtel, 1981; Zarnowitz, 1983) 60




     59Note that this is a general approach, compatible with Keynesian, mone-
tarist, and other theories. It is used in the 1980 model of Brunner et al.,
in which monetary shocks affect only the price level and the rate of interest,
while unemployment is caused by errors due to the inability of workers to
distinguish between permanent and transitory real productivity shocks.  This
model is subject to all doubts concerning the hypotheses of complete neutral-
ity of money and intertemporal substitution in labor supply.

     60The relevant literature on the properties of expectationa]. data is very
voluminous and can be only briefly summarized here. For a more comprehensive
review of the evidence, see Zarnowitz, 198)4.

    Studies of consumer survey data from the Survey Research Center of the

     Few authors have tested data on anticipations for variables other than

inflation.   U.S. manufacturers' sales expectations have been on the whole

negatively assessed in a comprehensive study by Hirsch and Lovell (1969), more

positively by Pashigian (1964) and Irvine (1981).     For professional economic

forecasters, including econometric service bureaus, there is strong evidence

that predictions of inflation in the 1970s have been generally biased, while

those of other important aggregates (growth in nominal and real GNP, the

unemployment rate) pass the rationality tests much more frequently and better

(MeNees, 1978; Zarnowitz,    1983).62

     The REH finds the strongest support in the "efficient markets" literature

(Fama, 1970; Poole, 1976).    This is readily understandable since financial

assets and commodities are traded in well organized and informed competitive

auction markets.   However, some tests of forecasts by active participants in

these markets reject the REH, as shown in the survey of Wall Street predic-

tions of interest rates by B. Friedman (1980).     This could merely mean that

this survey was not adequately representative of the most successful traders



     61A11 these surveys collect largely qualitative responses (on the
direction and in some cases range rather than the precise size of the expected
price movements).  The conversion of these data to the quantitative form
required for the tests presents some difficult problems.

     62For many early forecasts of U.S. aggregate series, there is evidence of
significant bias (Mincer and Zarnowitz, 1969). The most common pattern is
underestimation of growth, and, less frequently, of cyclical changes (Theil,
1958; Zarnowitz, 1967).  There are indications of adaptive learning behavior
(Mincer, 1969).

 and hence of the market.6

      Expectations which fail the rationality criteria in ex post tests may

 well prove entirely consistent with optimizing ex ante behavior once the

 consequences of uncertainty, unique events, defective models, and fragmentary

or costly information are taken into account (Zarnowitz, 1982).     Also, they

need not be adaptive or otherwise backward-looking only.   In fact, it appears

that time—series models rarely explain statistically much more than half of

the variance of expectational data (see several papers in Mincer, ed., 1969;

Aiginger, 1979).   The evidence suggests that economic expectations are neither

mere projections of the past nor flashes of intuition about the future but

combinations of both extrapolative and autonomous components.     Predictions of

real growth and inflation are usually diversified and uncertain, seldom

demonstrably self-fulfilling.   Anticipatory action is often inhibited by prior

commitments incurred in part to reduce uncertainty.   Thus not all past is

bygones and expectations are not all-important.   Yet they matter a great deal

and are a proper subject for empirical as well as theoretical studies,6

6.   Models of Financial Instability

      Speculative excesses or "manias" have attracted the attention of contem-

poraries and economic historians since at least the Dutch Tulip Bubble of



     6Indeed, Mishkin (1981a) constructs forecasts from the bond market data
which fail to reject the rationality tests for interest-rate expectations.
But the concurrent bond-market predictions of inflation fail the tests.   The
argument that this reflects the unusual character of the 1960s, a period of
rising inflation, is not really persuasive. The inflation forecasts in the
perhaps even more "unusual" 1970s seem generally worse yet.   Long periods of
tranquility are hard to find.

     61The evidence from surveys has certain important limitations and must be
assessed with caution, but the consensus of careful independent tests based on
such data should be taken seriously; indeed, the materials now available are
rich and in need of much further exploration (cf. Tobln, 1980, p. 29).
Lessons from such work can usefully counter and correct the freely speculative
analysis that treats expectations as being inevitably "unobservable."
                                       —69-




1625—37.    Financed by credit expansion and characterized by "overtrading" in

real or financial assets,e.g., gold, land, or securities, they have been

associated with more than two dozen major booms in business activity, often

involving many countries (Kindleberger, 1978).    Historically, they tended to

be followed by "panics," that is, distress selling of the same assets to

reacquire money and repay debt, and crashes in the prices of the now illiquid

objects of the speculation.    The resulting financial crises accompanied or

aggravated the downturns in the business cycle.

    'In asset markets, the current price depends as a rule positively on its

own expected rate of change.    Expectations are influenced by outside events as

well as the "market fundamentals"--economic determinants of the rates of

return.    The markets may react to the events by adopting such price antici-

pations as would drive the actual prices away from the path consistent with

the fundamentals.    In this view, accepted much more readily by practitioners

than theorists, anticipations of a strong market trend are occasionally

capable of causing speculative "bubbles"--cuznulative, even explosive,

fluctuations in prices of selected assets.

     Very recently, these ideas, long mistrusted by most contemporary

economists, began to receive support from writers using rigorous techniques of

equilibrium analysis.    Shiller (1981a and b) concludes that stock price

movements are too large to be explained by an efficient-markets model which

incorporates future dividends, capital gains and inflation.    Blanchard and

Watson (1982) argue that bubbles can occur in efficient markets with new entry

and no unexploited arbitrage opportunities; also, that they have potentially
                                       -70-




strong real effects, on relative asset prices, wealth, and aggregate demand.6

     Much of the recent work in this area uses the overlapping-generations

approach due to Samuelson (1958) (see Kareken and Wallace, eds., 1980).

Models of this type, with markets continously cleared by price movements,

typically have a multiplicity of RE solutions, a large proportion of which may

involve fluctuations prompted by arbitrary but self-fulfilling shifts in

anticipations (Azariadis, 1981).    Thus, if the belief that sunspots predict

future prices were widely held, many individuals would act on it so as to bear

out their expectations.   Cass and Shell (1983) argue that RE equilibria

generally can be influenced by extrinsic uncertainty, i.e., random phenomena

such as "animal spirits" or "market psychology," which do not affect the basic

parameters of the economy (endowments, preferences, technologies).    The

conditions under which this would not be the case are so unrealistic as to be

devoid of any empirical interest.66

     These abstract treatments rationalize the role in financial crises of

"sunspots," but they do not tell us how much these interacting and self-

fulfilling expectations matter.    The crises are seldom isolated phenomena;

rather they form a part of some business cycles and are thus related to the



     6The problems of indeterminacy and instability of RE equilibria are now
well recognized and much studied.  Conditions under which bubbles may be
excluded from the RE paths of the price level have been specified for some
monetary models (see, e.g., Brock, 1975). Tests for the German hyperinflation
of the early 1920s reported by Flood and Garber (1980) give no support to the
hypothesis that a price-level bubble occurred in that extreme episode.   But it
is easy to see that expectations alone cannot account for a long or rapid
inflation in the absence of persistent or very high rates of money creation.
Clearly, bubbles are much more likely in speculative markets for financial
assets.

     66They include (1) strong RE -— unanimity of beliefs; (2) complete
markets -- there are markets for all types of contingent claims; and (3)
unrestricted access to these markets for all agents at all times -- across the
"generations." (1) and (2) are merely improbable; (3) is altogether
impossible.

monetary, institutional, and real factors involved in these cycles.          Market

psychology plays a large role insome crises, mainly the major ones.

        Mild financial crises of recent U.S. history, called "credit crunches",

are associated by some observers primarily with reduced availability of

credit, not high interest rates (Wojnilower, 1980).          Credit rationing by banks

is linked to imperfect information about the borrowers' default risk (Stiglitz

and Weiss, 1981; Blinder and Stiglitz, 1983).          When banks refuse to renew

their loans, the high-risk borrowers and many small firms will be unable to

secure credit elsewhere and forced to curtail investment and perhaps current

operations.       The retrenchment may or may not be caused by restrictive open-

market policies of the central bank.       Under fractional banking, loans and

deposits are highly collinear, so it is difficult to use the data to distin-

guish between this "Oredit" hypothesis and a "money supply" hypothesis of a

downturn.     Since the early 1950s, broad credit aggregates such as the total

debt of U.S. nonfinancial sectors have been closely and stably related to

GNP -    better   or not worse than the money stock and monetary base series (B.

Friedman, 1983).

        In several collected papers, Minsky (1982) argues that long periods of

prosperity interrupted only by mild recessions or slowdowns breed overcon-

fidence, excessive short-term financing by banks of long-term business

projects, investment booms interacting with stodk market booms, growing

indebtedness and illiquidity.       Innovative practices and new instruments are

used to increase the availability of'     investment   finance:   money should be

broadly defined and is endogenously determined.         Its supply, however, becomes

at some point inelastic as uncertainty grows and banks increasingly deem it

prudent to retrench (or monetary authorities act to constrain inflation).           The

demand for credit to finance planned and progressing investment projects
                                        -72-




nevertheless continues to rise.     It takes sharp increases in interest rates

and declines in the present value of expected net returns on capital assets to

check and reverse the expansion in new investment.      Business cash flows and

profits decline and eventually so do total sales, output, and employment.          The

resulting losses force many industrial concerns and financial intermediaries

into refinancing of debt and liquidation of assets to raise cash; many

retrench, some fail. When a sufficiently large number of these units exper-

ience inadequate cash flows from current operations and declining ability to

sustain debt, a financial crisis must occur, unless the central bank inter-

venes, injecting sufficient money into the system and preventing large bank

defaults and business failures,    If a crisis is averted and stimulative

monetary and fiscal policies continue, a mild recession may ensue but another

inflationary and eventually destabilizing investment boom will soon follow.

     This is a disequilibrium theory with strong endogenous elements.        The

originating factors are real, but monetary and credit changes have much to do

with the propagation of the cycle and are primarily responsible for its worst

manifestations (see also the summary in Table 5).      This is the opposite of

some recent theories (such as that of Lucas) which have monetary shocks and real

propagation mechanisms.    Minsky's hypothesis predicts the recurrence of'

financial   crises and business depressions, which invites controversy.      It

deserves to be carefully evaluated, but it is difficult to test (in part

inevitably so since financial crises and depressions are rare and complex

events).    In general terms, however, the account provided by Minsky tends to be

consistent with the history of speculative investment booms, financial crises,

and deep depressions in the United States (see Burns and Mitchell, 1946, ch.        11,

sec. VI; Kindleberger, 1978; Hoyt, 1933).      It also has interesting connections

with several diverse business cycle theories.6

7.     Demand and Supply Shocks and Responses:   A Search for New Concepts

        Dissatisfaction with the results obtained by using random money supply

shocks and price misperceptions prompted some economists to experiment with

different models (while retaining in most cases the basic RE methodology).

Abstracting from numerous detail, one can distinguish the following approaches.

        (1) Focus on interest rates and related factors.   These received much

attention in the literature from Wicksell and the Austrians to Keynes.

Monetary intervention or excesses of credit creation were seen as causing

interest rates to deviate from their equilibrium levels so that they fail to

coordinate saving and investment decisions.      Inconsistencies arise in the

aggregate between the expectations of those who make these decisions and the

expectations of the financial intermediaries.     Monetarists opposed these ideas

on the ground that investment and savings depend on the real interest rates

which cannot be affected by the banking system, except very transitorily.        In

the early RE models, too, interest rates had no important roles to play.

However, fluctuations in credit and interest, which have been so pronounced in

recent years, are receiving renewed attention in the literature since the late

1970s (Leijonhufvud, 1981, ch. 7, and in Frydman and Phelps, eds,, 1983, ch.

10).


       This includes some new departure along the incomplete-information line of

approach.    McCulloch (1977, 1981) argues that business fluctuations are asso-

ciated with unanticipated changes in interest rates that misdirect real in-

vestment decisions toward a wrong mix of capital goods and so distort the in—



              credits primarily Keynes, whom he interprets as having a dynamic
analysis that does not rely on price rigidities; but his emphasis on the
instability of credit flows and business debt relative to income recalls the
Austrians and draws on Fisher.
                                       - 7L -




tertemporal   production process (as in the real part of the theories of Hayek

and Mises).68   In an equilibrium model by Grossman and Weiss (1982), random

real shocks affect productivity and the real interest rate, causing investment

and output to fluctuate.    Random monetary shocks affect inflation and the nom-

inal interest rate, with the effect of amplifying the cycle.     Agents make er-

rors in trying to infer the ex ante values of the real rate and inflation from

the nominal rate (which includes the two) because the latter's movements con-

tain much random noise.    The critical gap in information concerns the relative

rates of real return (on own compared with other investments).    The model in-

volves only supply decisions, with the role of demand being purely passive.6

     Recent empirical work suggests that output (real GNP or industrial

production) interacts with price—level indexes, comprehensive credit

aggregates, interest rates, and narrow money aggregates.   None of these

variables is definitely exogenous relative to all the others; in particular,

money adds to the incremental prediction of the real variables along with

credit and interest rates, but it is not predetermined or predominant (Sims,




     68The novel element is the stress on "misintermediation" rather than on
the money-creating function of the banks (the two are closely connected).
Banks and other intermediaries, by borrowing short and lending long, are said
to mismatch asset and liability maturities and to add to the uncertainty about
interest rates by creating imbalances in their term structure. This
hypothesis and the related estimates deal only with nominal, not with real
rates, besides posing other problems that cannot be discussed in the available
space; but it does address an important and -long recognized institutional
aspect of financial instability (to which the previous section also briefly
referred).

     6investment here is equated to the process of transforming labor input
into next period's output. No durable goods are produced. The nominal shocks
take the form of disturbances to money demand. These simplifications are made
to allow some difficult problems in the dynamic equilibrium theory to be rig-
orously analyzed, but they also deprive the model of some highly relevant
characteristics of the modern capitalist economies which experience business
cycles.   This is, to be sure, not uncommon in the recent theoretical
literature.

1980b; B. Friedman,   1983).70

     These results are interesting and may prove robust, but they should be

interpreted with much caution.   Nominal interest rates may matter because

their changes are read as signals of changes in the stock of money and

inflation.   But they may also be important in their own right as the major

part of the true costs of credit.   Historically, their adjustments to

inflation, (and deflation) were sufficiently sluggish and incomplete to suggest

that people treated the nominal rates as if they were adequate proxies for the

real ones.   Evidence going back to the 1860s shows that this. condition

continued to prevail at least well into the 1950s; only thereafter did the

relationship between interest and inflation strengthen to become rather close

in the 1960s and 1970s.   More recently, it weakened again considerably.71

     The ex post real interest rates, pre and post-tax, have small cyclical

variations, which makes it difficult to detect how they are correlated with

movements in real variables, but this is rightly seen as a problem in

measurement rather than evidence of no significant relationships (Mishkin,

1981b).   Real rates rose sharply to unusually high levels in the early years

of the Great Depression and again in 1980-82, a period of severe recession and



     70mese exogeneity tests ask whether, say, the lagged values of money
help explain or predict output in a regression equation containing the lagged
values of output itself and of the other variables. This question is answered
for each variable in the system in terms of all variables included. This
method of variance decomposition or accounting for the interactions among the
"innovations" (serially uncorrelated residuals) of the series in question
avoids some major shortcomings of simple distributed-lag regressions but
encounters some difficult problems of its own (see the references in text
above).

     71These findings refer to the United States; for •the United Kingdom the
corresponding relation was much weaker throughout. See Friedman and Schwartz,
1982, ch. 10.  According to Summers, 1983, the impact of inflation on interest
rates has been much smaller throughout the post-World War II period than a
general equilibrium model would predict on classical assumptions, particularly
when properly allowing for the effective tax rates (see also Feldstein, 1976).

strong   disinflation.   It is only reasonable to view these changes as mainly

unanticipated and their probable net effects as seriously adverse.72       The

measured real rates are inversely correlated with lagged inflation.       Increased

money growth, then, by raising inflation, lowers the real rate; but the

evidence for a short—term effect of monetary policy, independent of inflation,

is mixed and weak (Shiller, 1980; Mishkin, 1981b).

fluctuations in real investment cause the business cycle.       Banks meet the

borrowers' demand for money and the depositors' demand for money as the monetary

authority provides them with the necessary reserves at any given level of

interest rates.    (B) Exogenous fluctuations in money supply cause the business

cycle.   The demand for money continuously adjusts to the supply through

changes in permanent income associated with much larger changes in measured

real income or output.

     Tobin (1970) sets the two models up so that (A) implies a consistent

pattern of early cyclical timing for monetary growth rates or deviations from

trend, while (B) does not.    Friedman denies that these examples cast doubt on

his views.   The two debaters agree that the evidence on leads and lags alone

cannot prove any hypothesis about causation (though it can disaprove some);

also, that both of the above models are far from adequate.       Indeed, (A) is an

oversimplification and partial distortion of Keynes, (B) of Friedman.       The

widely used general IS/LM-AD/AS framework can accomodate some of the ideas of

some of the Keynesians and monetarists with respect to the effects and

interactions of both autonomous expenditure and monetary changes.73       But this

 long—ruling paradigm was designed for comparative statics of exogenous

 interventions with a stationary environment; its adaptation to dynamic and

 expectatiorial processes confronts a host of difficult and unresolved problems.

      Earlier sections contain several diverse illustrations of recent work

 oriented toward nonmonetary (real, psychological, institutional) explanations

 of macroeconomic instability.   Other such efforts relate to the old idea

 (preceding Keynes, though often associated with him) that both money and real

 activity respond to the common factor of fluctuations in aggregate demand and

 the corresponding changes in interest rates and the value of existing

assets.    Sims (1980b), referring to Tobiri (1970), urges the development of a

stochastic version of this theory.    Some new historical studies also emphasize

the importance of factors other than the independent influence on business

conditions of changes in the stock of money.

      It remains to take note of the most radical reactions against monetarist

and monetary-shock theories by some strong believers in general-equilibrium


     73is and LM relate output and interest rates, AD and AS   (aggregate
demand and supply functions) relate output and the price level.   it is assumed
that the IS and AD curves slope downward, the LM and AS curves upward. The
Keynesian view is often associated with relatively steep IS and flat LM, the
monetarist view with relatively flat IS and steep LM curves.   But this
interpretation is by no means universally acceptable; even if accepted, it
leaves open other important. issues inthe controversy. The IS/LM-AD/AS mmodel
evolved from Hicks, 1935, 1937, through a long series of writings including
notably Patinkin, 1956.

     74mus Temin, 1976, attributes the 1929 downturn to a decline in
"autonomous" spending (interestingly, mainly in consumption and exports rather
than investment). For monetarist counterarguinents, see the essays by Schwartz
and Brunner in Brunner, ed., 1981; for a view that both money and investment
(and other spending) mattered, see Gordon and Wilcox in the same volume.
     King and Plosser, 1982, examine the possibility that the positive
correlation between the rates of' growth in output and monetary aggregates
reflects in large part the causal chain running from business activity to
"inside money", i.e., bank deposits.
     Bernanke, 1983, produces evidence linking the sharp drop in output during
the early 1930s to the reduced quality and higher real costs of credit
intermediation services, a result of the institutional weakness and crises of
banking.

modeling and the neutrality of money.      Here the main idea is that unantici-

pated changes in tastes and tethnology cause intersectoral shifts of human and

physical capital associated with much friction and temporary idleness.       Unem-

ployment generated by a   large   number of partly independent shocks to different

sectors will persist for considerable time because rapid transfers of

resources are costly, the more so the greater the specialization of the

production factors (Black, 1982).       But changes in tastes and technology will

tend to penalize some sectors and benefit others, causing numerous shifts in

relative prices and outputs; they may occasionally have significant net

favorable or adverse effects on growth but can hardly be responsible for

recurrent sequences of expansions and contractions in aggregate economic

activity.

     The most restrictive formal model of purely real "business cycles" (Long

and Plosser, 1983) abstracts not only from money and government but also from

technological change, durable goods, and adjustment costs; it assumes RE,

complete information, and stable preferences.      There are random shocks to

outputs of the many commodities, each of which can be either consumed or used

as input in the production of any other commodity during each unit period.

The optimal allocation rule is such that when the i-th output is unexpectedly

high (low), the simultaneous inputs of     i    in all its productive uses are

increased (reduced).    It is shown that this works to propagate the effects of

the output shocks both forward in time and across the sectors of the

economy.    The model is intended to serve as a benchmark for evaluating the

importance in actual business cycles of the many factors it omits, but it




     75mis recalls the "horizontal maladjustments," which were treated as a
potentially important aggravating factor, but not a prime cause, in classical
writings.  See p. 18 above.
                                      -79-




admittedly presents serious problems and the approach itself is

questionable. 76

     (3)Focus on the causes and effects of contractual wage and price

setting.   Recent literature is much concerned with the specification of

economic reasons for the existence of explicit or implicit multiperiod

contracts that limit the flexibility of wages and prices in response to

unanticipated shifts in demand and supply.77   The "contract—theoretic" models

based on this work drop the assumption of market clearing and the reliance on

price errors and intertemporal substitution effects.   They restore the changes

in aggregate demand to their old role as a direct determinant of fluctuations

in the real aggregates by delaying the adjustments in the contractually

predetermined wages and the wage-related prices.-

     The main models of this type are monetarist in the original sense of

relating short-run fluctuations in output to monetary policy operating via

changes in demand.   This is so even where the policy is based on a fixed

feedback rule known to the public, because the money stock can be changed more

frequently than the wage is renegotiated (Phelps and Taylor, 1977; Fischer,



     76   particular, the model has constant employment of labor while the
commodity outputs fluctuate. Simulations based on a 1967 input-output table
for six major industry divisions result in output series that show consider-
able comovements and two complete quasi-cycles in runs of 100 unit periods of
undefined length.  It is not clear whether the fluctuations due to the output
shocks are separable from those due to other factors.

     770ne hypothesis is that fixed-wage, variable employment contracts sell
risk-averse workers partial insurance against the variability of their incomes
(Baily, 1974; D.F. Gordon, 1974; Azariadis, 1975).   Another is that labor
contracts or understandings treat incomes as normal returns on the loyalty and
efficiency of long—term employees and protect large investments in firm-
specific human capital (Hall, 1980b; Okun, 1981, chs. 2 and 3). Steady
pricing policies are used to reduce the costs of shopping and attract steady
customers (Okun, op. cit., ch. U).   In sum, contracts are attempts to deal
economically with a variety of "transaction" (information, negotiation,
adjustment) costs in the face of price instability and general uncertainty.
For surveys, see. R.J. Gordon, 1976; Barro, 1981.

1977a; Taylor, 1980a).    The authors work with staggered contracts in which

wages are linked to expectations that are weakly "rational" (i.e., model-

consistent).    Fischer relates wages to price level forecasts; his contracts

are (frustrated) attempts to keep real wages from falling in the face of

inflationary policy.     Taylor relates wages to other past and anticipated wage

settlements; the degree of inertia in these interrelations helps explain the

persistence of unemployment.    These models have attracted much attention and

criticism. 78

     According to the "credibility" hypothesis (Feilner, 1976,    1980), a

consistent policy of adhering to preannounced moderate money growth targets

can deter inflationary wage and price setting and reduce instability in the

long run.   A correlate is that unions will push for higher wages in labor

contract negotiations and business will respond by raising prices if both

parties expect the monetary authorities to "ratify" their decisions through

accommodative policies.    This view differs in some important respects from

monetarism and the newer RE and contract theories, but it also incorporates

some of their elements.     It recognizes that, in practice, systematic policy

components are often weak and only belatedly detectable (see also Sims,

1982).   It is related to the idea of "coordination failures" (Leijonhufvud,

1981) in a game-theoretic form:     it is possible for expectational impasses to

develop, e.g., a recession-cum—inflation may continue while the central bank

waits for wage demands to moderate and business and labor wait for a resurnp-

tion of monetary expansion (Phelps, 1981).     All this certainly raises issues



     8The issues include the consistency of the assumed contract features
with rational behavior (Barro, 1977b; Fischer, 1977b) and the reasons why
wages are not fully indexed under anticipated inflation (Brunner and Meltzer,
eds., 1977). For a detailed critique of Fischer and Taylor, and a proposed
improved model, see McCallum, 1982.  For some evidence and further discussion,
see Taylor, 1980b and 1983.

 that are very important in dealing with inflation; how much bearing it has

here depends on how strongly policy-induced changes in monetary growth and

 inflation influence business cycles.   The notion that such changes are the

principal cause of the cycles (which many now accept as if it were self-

evident) is not supported by the long record of cyclical instability co-

existing with alternating extended periods of inflations and deflations.       It

is also countered by the argument that business contractions, whatever their

causes, have deflationary or disinflationary effects.79

       Most recent RE models, including those of' the contract-theoretic type,

consider only one determinant of aggregate demand, the real money balances,

and concentrate on the effects of monetary policy.    But shifts in aggregate

demand may be due to real and expectational as well as monetary factors.       They

may reflect the instability of any of the major expenditure components of'     real
GNP.   Neither theory nor evidence support the. focus on nominal demand shocks

and real supply shocks alone.    In recent times, at least, consumer capital

outlays have been no less cyclical than business investment (of. Gordon and

Veitch, 198L).   Indeed, new models of consumption which embrace RE have

consumers respond promptly and strongly to any new information that revises

their forecasts of future income.   This in itself would tend to increase the

sensitivity of consumption, and hence of income, to unanticipated changes in

aggregate demand or "autonomous expenditures" (compared with the earlier

models which used adaptive rather than rational expectations in the

calculation of permanent income).   The increased instability on the demand

side is offset only when the REH is combined with speedy clearing of' the



     79None of this, of course, is to deny that the inflationary bias of
government actions and the reactions to it have economic consequences of great
importance; what is questioned is the view (going far beyond the credibility
hypothesis) that these consequences include the business cycle.

markets and a highly stable and inelastic aggregate supply curve, i.e., in the

new "classical" equilibrium models (Bilson, 1980, pp. 279—283, and comment by

Hall, ibid., p. 301).80

                      V.   Conclusion:   The Needed Synthesis

     Business cycles belong to the history of modern economies with inter-

dependent markets, free enterprise, and private ownership of financial assets

and capital goods.    They developed in the era of great growth of industry,

banking and credit.    They are varied and changing, even while retaining their

general characteristics of perstistence and pervasiveness as well as specific

regularities of amplitude and timing.     All this was long recognized by serious

scholars and careful observers with abiding interest in the subject.

     For a long time, too, there was a substantial consensus among these

economists that business cycles have mainly endogenous explanations involving

recurrent fluctuations in interrelated monetary and real variables, prices and

quantities, expectations and realizations.      The theories tended to agree on

the cast and setting, disagreeing principally on which factors should play

star and which supporting roles.    Chance and outside disturbances were left

behind the stage, interfering with and modifying the action but not

determining its main course.    The cycle had plural causes and effects; it

produced and resolved its own stresses and resources, nationally and

internationally.   Few attributed it to any single factor or defect, and few

believed that it can be eliminated by any single, low-cost type of policy

intervention or institutional reform.

    The 1930s convinced many that the economy is not merely cyclical but



     80Many interesting theoretical and empirical studies of the consumption
function appeared in recent years, but the implications of this work for
business cycles remain to be worked out. See Hall, 1978; Davidson and Hendry,
1981; Blanchard and Wyplosz, 1981; Flavin, 1981; and Bernanke, 1982.

depression-prone.     The instability of profits, investment, and credit (old

concerns) attracted renewed attention.     In the 19140s and 1950s, however, there

was a rise of interest in the dynamics of multiplier-accelerator interaction

which yielded highly aggregative and purely endogenous models of potentially

unstable output fluctuations.     The monetary, financial, and expectational

aspects of the cycle were largely neglected.     Soon, strong reactions developed

against this one-sided conception.     One took the form of stochastic, dynamic-

ally stable mathematical models.     This greatly influenced macroeconometric

models which emphasized the destabilizing role of random shocks and exogenous

factors.

     The other reaction against theories of endogenous instability was mone-

tarism.    Its targets included not only the Keynesian models of aggregate

demand, with fluctuating but often weak investment and a major role for fiscal

policies to combat unemployment, but also the older models with unstable

credit-investment interactions.     Fluctuations in monetary growth attributed to

erratic or misguided policies were made primarily responsible for disturbing

the basically stable private economy and creating "business cycles".     The

real, financial, and expectational factors received little attention.

     The natural-rate and rational-expectations hypothesis, plus the

discouraging record of the 1970s, led to new hopes for a program of study with

a grand design:     to reconcile business cycles with the postulates of the com-

petitive general equilibrium theory in its modern dynamic form.     The initial

approach relied upon random monetary shocks, price misperceptions, and inter—

temporal substitution of labor.     However, critical analyses and tests soon

cast serious doubts on this construction and thereby on the underlying

premises, mainly that of flexible prices continuously clearing all markets.

No convincing remedy could be provided by adaptation of familiar elements of
                                        _814 -




older    "disequilibrium" theories such as the accelerator arid lags due to costs

of adjustments in the stocks of'   production    factors.

        Some equilibrium theorists questioned the importance of the disturbances

to money supply and tried to explain business cycles in real terms only.

Their RE models are more restrictive yet.        They consist of supply reactions of

a "representative" producer-consumer to productivity or input-output shocks.

The environment is purely competitive or even of a Robinson Crusoe-type.

There is little or no evidence to support these models.

     Contract theories, designed to explain why most wages and prices are

temporarily "sticky," formed the basis of very different models in which

aggregate demand fluctuations are restored to their usual prominence.         Other

work, also using the currently favored RE methodology,, turned to factors with

a long history of service in business cycle models:         uncertainty arid shifts in

"market psychology"; interest-rate misperceptions or maladjustments; long

investment gestation periods.

     There is not much empirical validation that random shocks of all kinds

play as large a role in business cycle as has been attributed to them in

recent literature.    The weight of exogenous policy factors, too, seems more

often than not overstated.    The theoretical interest in self-sustaining

cycles, or elements thereof, declined in times when economic events and

thought favored a revival of the faith in the private sector's capacity for

stable growth.    New work in this area, therefore, has been limited, but it

still produced some interesting and significant results.

     The most disturbing aspect of what must be viewed as the new mainstream

literature (the RE models) is its increasing fragmentation in the face of

various theoretical problems and recalcitrant facts.        The ruling research

strategy in these studies is to demonstrate for each particular model that one
                                         -85-




 or more of the selected factors can contribute to fluctuations in total output

or employment, while recognizing that others can do so as well.      The authors

are mainly concerned with theoretical possibilities rather than with explana-

tions of what actually happens.     There is in general little regard for how the

pieces fit each other or the "real world."      The variety of the iodels is only

loosely limited by the ingenuity of the theorists, but many of the offered

hypotheses are not tested and some are not testable.      Small linear models are

favored because of their mathematical tractability in the equilibrium RE

framework, but this certainly does not mean that larger and/•or nonlinear

systems are somehow inferior.     The criterion of conformity to stylized facts

would, in fact, suggest the. opposite.

     As a matter of simple logic, if each of a number of models is indeed

valid, then it should inprinciple be possible to integrate them and improve

the theory.     Of course, this is easier said than done, but when each model is

treated in isolation, there is little chance for the Job to be ever seriously

attacked.     The conclusion reached here, then, is that a movement toward a

synthesis of the tested and nonfalsified hypotheses is urgently needed if real

progress is to be made in our understanding of business cycles.

     In this view, research in this area will profit most from the confronta-

tion of testable hypotheses with a broad range of evidence on stylized facts

and from efforts to combine those hypotheses that survive the tests.     This

assigns high priorities to the work on (1) the consolidation and updating of

findings from the historical and statistical business cycle studies, and (2)

using the results to eliminate those elements of the extant theories that are

definitely inconsistent with the evidence and to improve the modeling of the

other elements.    This strategy could lead us away from the proliferation of

models which lopsidedly stress either the monetary or the real factors, either
                                        -86-


the supply or the demand behavior, either random shocks or purely endogenous

movements; instead, we would be working toward a better comprehension of how

these forces interact.   As was recognized early by the "classics," the sharp

dichotomies and monocausal theories tend to be invalidated by experience.

     Also, the hypothesis that business cycles are all alike would itself be

tested in the course of this research.     It is important to know not only what

the common core of the cyclical process has been for the U.S. economy in

recent times, but also how it may have changed historically and how it differs

from similar processes elsewhere.     The knowledge is necessary for an assess-

ment of the temporal and spatial reference points of business cycle theory.

(For the most recent work on these problems, see R. J. Gordon, ed.,

forthcoming.)

     We have witnessed a period of great intellectual ferment, activity, and

controversy in the theory of macroeconomic fluctuations and policies, but the

debate seems to be growing less heated lately and some signs of a future

rapprochement can be discerned.     The present may be a good time to ponder the

needed synthesis.
