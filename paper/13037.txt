                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses international survey data to document two stylized facts. First, risk aversion is associated
with anti-trade attitudes. Second, this effect is smaller in countries with greater levels of government
expenditure. The paper thus provides evidence for the microeconomic underpinnings of the argument
associated with Ruggie (1982), Rodrik (1998) and others that government spending can bolster support
for globalization by reducing the risk associated with it in the minds of voters.

1. Introduction

       Are markets and governments substitutes or complements? Traditional left-

right ideological divisions notwithstanding, an important strand of thought has always

maintained that markets and governments are, in fact, complementary. The argument

is that governments can help produce the political support required to maintain

flexible markets by providing social insurance policies, by stabilising the aggregate

level of economic activity, or by otherwise reducing the risk of disruption which

markets on their own can represent. A classic statement of this view is provided by

Ruggie (1982), who argues that in the aftermath of the catastrophe that was the

interwar period, policy makers developed a series of domestic and international

institutions which sought to combine a multilateral commitment to free trade, on the

one hand, with domestic stability on the other. This historic compromise he termed

‘embedded liberalism.’ Hays, Ehrlich and Peinhardt (2005, pp. 473-4) summarize the

argument nicely: “Because trade causes economic dislocations and exposes workers

to greater risk, it generates political opposition that democratically elected leaders

ignore at their peril. Thus...political leaders have had to be aware of and actively

manage public support for economic openness. To do this, governments have

exchanged welfare state policies that cushion their citizens from the vagaries of the

international economy in return for public support for openness.”

       Similarly, Rodrik (1998) shows that more open countries have bigger

governments, and explains this correlation in two stages. First, he argues that “More

open economies have greater exposure to the risks emanating from turbulence in

world markets” (p. 1011). Second, he argues that government expenditure can

perform “an insulation function, insofar as the government sector is the “safe” sector

(in terms of employment and purchases from the rest of the economy) relative to other



                                            1
activities, and especially compared to tradables” (ibid.). Governments may also

directly reduce the risk facing individuals by providing safety nets, and Rodrik argues

that this is indeed the case in richer countries. But, in either case, government

expenditure has the same effect: it reduces risk, and since risk increases with

openness, political considerations ensure that the size of the government expands with

openness as well.

       This paper tests the micro-foundations of these hypotheses, and it does so in

two stages. First, if risk increases with openness, then risk-averse individuals should

be opposed to openness, and thus favour policies, such as tariffs or quotas, which limit

the extent to which the national economy interacts with the rest of the world. Second,

government expenditure should be effective in reducing the hostility of such voters

towards openness: that is, in countries with bigger governments, risk-averse voters

should be less hostile to globalization than they would be in countries where

governments are small. Testing the first hypothesis requires information not only on

individual attitudes towards trade, but on their attitudes towards risk as well. Testing

the second hypothesis obviously requires survey data for several countries,

characterised by a range of government sizes.

       In testing these hypotheses, we need to control for the fact that preferences

towards trade are determined by a range of other variables as well. There is already a

substantial literature, for example, which argues that trade affects voter attitudes

through its effects on labour markets, and that these effects are consistent with the

predictions of simple Heckscher-Ohlin trade models (Scheve and Slaughter 2001;

Mayda and Rodrik 2005; O’Rourke and Sinnott 2001). This paper will control for

these Heckscher-Ohlin effects and confirm the results of the previous studies using a

newly available data set, the Asia-Europe Survey (ASES), which covers nine East and



                                            2
South East Asian and nine Western European countries. The paper will also take

seriously the possibility that a range of non-economic factors may shape preferences

towards globalization. In this paper we focus on the concept of national identity as a

more fundamental measure of nationalism than the specific measures of ‘patriotism’

and ‘chauvinism’ that we have considered elsewhere (Mayda and Rodrik 2005;

O’Rourke and Sinnott 2001). In addition to this, we also look at whether supra-

national identity (i.e., a feeling of being European or Islamic or Asian or Chinese) can

have an influence on voter preferences. We return to the question of the expectations

one might have regarding the impact of these variables below.

       Against this background, the primary focus of the paper is on the role that

governments can play in shaping attitudes towards globalization. In this regard, it is

closely related to a number of recent papers that argue that public finance

considerations can shape such attitudes (Facchini and Mayda 2006, Hanson 2005,

Hanson, Scheve and Slaughter 2005). The dominant expectation in this literature is

that the existence of the welfare state, itself a consequence of Ruggie’s embedded

liberalism, will influence attitudes towards immigration but not towards trade since

“immigrants may pay taxes, may receive public services, and may vote over tax and

spending choices. Imports, obviously, do none of these things” (Hanson, Scheve and

Slaughter 2005, p. 1). By contrast, the risk channel considered here is one which

should operate on trade preferences.



2. Trade preferences: labour markets, redistribution, risk and identity

       The study of economic factors affecting responses to globalization typically

focuses on the income-distribution effects of international integration. Assuming self-

interested maximizing behaviour, attitudinal responses in survey data sets reflect the



                                           3
impact of globalization on each respondent's individual utility. Therefore the analysis

of preferences, combined with information on each individual's socio-economic

background, allows an indirect test of the income-distribution predictions of standard

economic models. In addition, the availability in survey data sets of questions on

values, national identity and other attachments makes it possible to investigate how

globalization is perceived at the individual level from a non-economic point of view.

       The income-distribution effects of trade occur through different channels. The

first set of papers in the existing literature focuses on the labour-market competition

hypothesis. Trade allows countries to indirectly exchange the services of factors of

production, and thus affects rates of return in factor markets. The Heckscher-Ohlin

model predicts that trade liberalization benefits abundant factors and hurts scarce

factors. If skilled and unskilled labour are the two inputs into production, then in skill-

abundant countries skilled workers should favour trade liberalization while unskilled

workers should oppose it. In other words, we should observe a positive correlation

between the level of individual skill and pro-trade attitudes in these countries. Scheve

and Slaughter (2001) find empirical evidence which is consistent with this prediction

in their analysis of U.S. trade preferences. The trade model also predicts that, in skill-

scarce countries, the more educated an individual is, the smaller the probability that

he or she is in favour of free trade. This implies that, in skill-scarce countries, we

should observe a negative correlation between individual skill and pro-trade

preferences. O'Rourke and Sinnott (2001) and Mayda and Rodrik (2005) show that

these predicted relationships between individual skill and attitudes are consistent with

cross-national survey data. Skilled workers welcome trade liberalization only if they

are in skill-abundant countries while, in skill-scarce countries, it is the less educated

who are stronger promoters of free trade. In this paper we use a newly available data



                                             4
set, that covers a different range of countries than our previous papers, and test the

robustness of the above results by controlling for these labour-market determinants of

preferences.

       Another strand of the literature on preferences emphasizes that, together with

the labour market, there is an additional economic channel through which individual

utilities are affected by globalization, namely the welfare state, though there are

important differences between trade and migration in this respect. Since immigrants

both contribute to and benefit from the welfare state, they are likely to have a non-

negligible impact on public finances, even though their net effect could be negative or

positive, depending for example on their skill mix relative to natives. Hanson, Scheve

and Slaughter (2005), Hanson (2005) and Facchini and Mayda (2006) all find

evidence that individual attitudes towards immigration are indeed influenced by this

welfare state channel. However, Hanson et al. point out that the impact of trade on the

welfare state is much smaller than the effect of immigration, especially in developed

countries. Even though trade liberalization reduces tariff revenues, the trade

component of government revenues is usually small in high-income countries. In

addition, while trade increases the cost of the welfare state if public programs are in

place, such as Trade Adjustment Assistance in the U.S., this effect is usually limited

in size. Based on U.S. survey evidence, Hanson et al. find that while welfare state

considerations play an important role in shaping individual attitudes towards

immigration, they play no role in shaping individual attitudes towards trade. In

particular, in American states with high numbers of immigrants and relatively

generous welfare systems, high-skill respondents are much less favourably disposed

to immigration than they would be in states with low fiscal exposure to immigration,

the interpretation being that high-skill workers are high earners and will thus object to



                                            5
immigration in their capacity as taxpayers. On the other hand, they find that state

welfare spending has no effect on attitudes towards trade.

         As pointed out in the previous section, in this paper we focus on the channel

examined by Rodrik (1998), and analyze both the impact of risk considerations on

individual protectionist attitudes, and the role of the government in shaping this link.

Two papers in the literature (Hays, Ehrlich and Peinhardt 2005, Scheve and Slaughter

2004) come closest to analyzing the risk channel we are interested in, although neither

in our view provides a direct test of our hypotheses. Scheve and Slaughter (2004)

carry out a country-level analysis that shows how opposition to economic integration -

analyzed as the dependent variable – is negatively affected by welfare policies. First

the authors relate country-level average trade opinions to macroeconomic conditions

(such as the unemployment rate), labour-market policies and institutions.2 They find

that protectionist opinion is a significantly increasing function of the unemployment

rate: however, controlling for the latter variable, the average opposition to free trade is

negatively affected by labour spending (total national spending on labour market

programs as a percentage of GDP) and by measures of employment protection. They

also show that the gap in protectionist attitudes between unskilled and skilled workers

- which is greater the more skill-abundant the country is - is attenuated by the size of

the welfare state (labour spending).3 Hays, Ehrlich and Peinhardt (2005) show that

support for free trade is positively correlated with the net replacement rate for

unemployment insurance, with the amount of government spending per unemployed

worker on active labour market programs, and with a subjective evaluation of the

social security system (the first and third measures vary at the individual level, while

  For data on attitudes, they use the ISSP survey and, for robustness checks, the WVS.

  In particular, in Figure 4 Scheve and Slaughter (2004) plot the marginal effect of individual skill on
protectionist attitudes – from country-specific regressions – against spending on labour-market
programs as a percent of GDP, controlling for (log) per capita GDP. The figure shows that the
regression coefficient on labour spending is positive and significant.

the second one is a country-level variable).4 Our paper differs from Scheve and

Slaughter (2004) in that ours is an individual-level analysis while theirs is mostly a

country-level one; it differs from Hays, Ehrlich and Peinhardt (2005) in that the

survey which we use allows us to explicitly relate risk attitudes to preferences towards

globalization. In addition, we test whether this impact of risk preferences on attitudes

towards trade is influenced by government policy. We are thus testing more directly

the micro-foundations of Rodrik’s thesis.

        As already noted, we are also interested in the non-economic determinants of

globalization preferences. Several of the previous papers cited found that interests

were not the only determinants of protectionist policy preferences. Nationalist

ideology also mattered, and, by implication, national identity. Our objective in this

paper is to go two steps further. The first step is to use a direct measure of national

identity as opposed to our previous specific measures of patriotism and chauvinism.

Second, we include the effects of supranational identity in the analysis. In the

European context, the reasons for including supranational identity are obvious,

although a priori it is not clear which way the effect should go: respondents who say

they have a sense of European identity might be more outward-looking, supporting

intra-European liberalization and, by extension, supporting globalization more

generally. Or, they might have a mercantilist desire to liberalize within Europe, but

maintain high barriers between Europe and the rest of the world, a strategy pursued by

many nascent European nation states during the early modern period, as Heckscher’s

classic study of mercantilism emphasizes (Heckscher 1935). Note also that in this

paper we look not just at the effects of European supranational identity, but at the


4
 The authors also mention a robustness check where they interact measures of individual trade
exposure with the social protection variables. Employment in import competing sectors of the economy
has a negative impact on support for trade. However, the size of this effect decreases as the level of
social protection increases.


                                                  7
effects of Asian, Chinese and Islamic identities as well, although these are clearly

very different in nature from a sense of European identity. Expectations regarding the

effects of these identities are even more difficult to pin down a priori. One might

regard Asian identity as being analogous to European identity in that it has a specific

supranational institutional underpinning, through ASEAN. On the other hand, this

institutional underpinning is clearly much weaker, lacking the sophisticated political

machinery of the EU, let alone any notion of a shared citizenship. Whether a sense of

Asian identity is likely to be associated with negative or with positive views about

globalization is thus, if anything, more difficult to decide than is the parallel question

in the European case. In the case of Islamic identity, its religious underpinning might

suggest an association with universal values and with support for openness; on the

other hand, the growing politicization of Islamic identity in recent years may imply an

association with resistance to globalization. Finally, the difficulty in the case of

Chinese supranational identity lies in separating the effects of the supranational

dimension from the effects of its ethnic and national foundations. It might be expected

that the overseas Chinese community would be pro-globalization, given the role of

ethnic Chinese networks in promoting trade (Rauch and Trindade 2002), but this is

merely supposition. In short, while there are very good reasons for attempting to

tease out the impact of a range of supranational identities, it is difficult to embark on

the enterprise with clear-cut and well-grounded hypotheses. As a result, all we do here

is to explore the issues by noting the empirical findings.



3. The data

       This paper draws on data from the Asia-Europe Survey (ASES), which is a

survey of political culture in nine East and South East Asian and nine Western



                                             8
European countries. The survey was conducted in autumn 2000 by Gallup

International and its local affiliates and was coordinated by Nippon Research Centre,

Tokyo5. Minimum sample size in each country was 1000 respondents. With two

exceptions, the target population consisted of all those aged 18-79 in the entire

country. The exceptions were China, where the target was those aged 18-79 living in

eight major cities, and Indonesia, where the target was those aged 18-79 living in

Java. Sampling and fieldwork details are provided in Nippon Research Centre (2001).

        Our dependent variable is a binary variable indicating respondents’ attitudes

towards trade. ‘Extremely protectionist’ is equal to one if respondents strongly agreed

with the statement that their country “should limit the import of foreign products”,

and zero otherwise. Note that the way that we have defined this variable implies that

respondents who answered ‘don’t know’ to the questions, or did not answer the

question at all, are coded as zero: the dummy variable thus simply indicates whether

or not the respondent gave the most protectionist response possible to the question.6

        The ASES survey asks respondents to state their age and gender, as well as the

number of years of schooling they received. These variables are all included in our

regressions in a straightforward manner, although we assumed that the maximum

number of years of schooling an individual might reasonably receive was 25, and

excluded those individuals reporting a higher number than this (typically, these

individuals gave their age in response to this question).

        Our national identity variable was generated as follows. Respondents were

asked the following question (the example given is the question as asked in Japan):

5

Education and Science (Scientific Research Grant # 11102001, Principal Investigator: Takashi
Inoguchi). Information regarding ASES, including the questionnaire used, is available at
http://www.asiaeuropesurvey.org/index.html
6
  Alternatively, we could have coded non-respondents as missing values, but since there are only 4 non-
responses to this question this would have made no difference to our results.


                                                  9
“Many people think of themselves as being part of a particular nationality, for

example as French or American or Japanese or whatever. Do you think of yourself as

[JAPANESE] or as belonging to another nationality, or do you not think of yourself

in this way?” Unless respondents answered that they thought of themselves as

Japanese, they were coded as zero. If they thought of themselves as Japanese, then

they were coded as 1 if they answered ‘not important at all’ to the question “Overall,

how important is it that you are [JAPANESE]”, 2 if they answered ‘only a little

important,’ 3 if they answered ‘somewhat important’, and 4 if they answered

‘extremely important’.

       We also defined four ‘supranational identity’ variables, depending on how

respondents answered the following question: “Some people also think of themselves

as being part of a larger group that includes people from other countries, for example,

as European, Asian, Chinese, Islamic etc. How about you, do you think of yourself in

this way?’ Respondents could indicate that they thought of themselves as being

European, Asian, Chinese or Islamic, and four dummy variables corresponding to

each of these four categories were defined. The excluded categories are the other

possible answers to the same question: ‘other supranational identity’ and ‘I don't think

of myself in this way’ (missing values are kept as such and therefore are not included

in the regressions); the impact of the excluded categories is embodied in the constant.

       In order to gain an insight into risk aversion and the demand for social

insurance, we availed of responses to the following question: “Please tell me how

much you agree or disagree with the following...The government should take

responsibility for ensuring that everyone either has a job or is provided with adequate

social welfare.” ‘Pro-safety net’ indicates how strongly respondents agreed with this

statement, on a scale from 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 5 (‘strongly agree’). In itself, we


                                            10
believe that this variable indicates a sense of risk-aversion, since it shows whether or

not respondents want the government to ensure that there is a minimum level of

welfare below which it will not let people fall. If a taxpayer is in favour of paying for

such a guarantee, this is certainly consistent with a preference for insurance, and

hence an aversion to risk. On the other hand, attitudes in favour of the provision of

such safety nets might reflect individual attributes other than risk-aversion, and we

want to control for these in the analysis. Once we have controlled for these other

characteristics, ‘Pro-safety net’ can reasonably be regarded as an indicator of risk

aversion.

       What variables other than risk aversion might lead people to favour the

introduction of safety nets? In order to answer this question, we make use of the

analysis in Alesina and La Ferrara (2004), who study the determinants of individual

preferences for redistribution. To be sure, redistribution is not the same thing as the

provision of minimum safety nets, since redistribution involves taxing the rich to

benefit the poor, while safety nets might benefit anyone faced with a sufficiently

negative shock, whether rich or poor. Nonetheless, several of the variables which

Alesina and La Ferrara identify as mattering for attitudes towards redistribution might

also reasonably be expected to influence demands for social insurance as well.

According to Alesina and La Ferrara, preferences towards redistribution should reflect

current and future income (with richer people, or people expecting to be rich in the

future, being more opposed to redistribution), risk aversion (with greater risk aversion

spurring a greater demand for redistribution), altruism (greater altruism leading to a

greater demand for redistribution), and perceptions about whether the opportunities

facing different individuals in society are equal or unequal (with people who believe

that opportunities are unfairly distributed favouring redistribution). Their empirical



                                           11
results lend support to these hypotheses, and suggest that if you take preferences for

redistribution, and strip away the influences of current and future income and

ideology (i.e. altruism and beliefs about equality of opportunities), then what you

should be left with is a measure of risk-aversion. Thus, it seems reasonable to suppose

that if we strip away the impact of current and future income and ideology from our

safety net variable, what we should be left with is a measure of risk aversion as well.

This is especially so since our safety net question is closer to risk aversion than their

redistribution variable to begin with, as it measures a fear of falling below a minimum

level of welfare, rather than a desire to see the government narrowing the gaps

between the rich and the poor.

       Therefore, in what follows we will attempt to control for both current and

future income and ideology, and are confident that the residual impact of ‘Pro-safety

net’ can indeed be interpreted as a measure of individual risk-aversion. To this end,

we introduce three further variables into the analysis. The first is household living

standards, which vary from 1 (‘low’) to 5 (‘high’) and capture the level of current

income. The second variable is based on a question asking respondents whether they

are worried about their work situation – the variable ranges from 1 (‘very worried’) to

3 (‘not worried at all’) – and could be viewed as a proxy for expectations of future

income. It should be noted that we also control for the Heckscher-Ohlin variables -

described below - which capture an important component of future expected income

changes of the respondent, namely those linked to globalization. The third is a

measure of political ideology, based on where respondents place themselves on a ten-

point left-right scale. This variable represents a proxy for a sense of altruism and

beliefs about equality of opportunities. Unfortunately, this question was not asked in




                                            12
China, and thus in regressions involving this variable we were forced to omit all

Chinese observations.

       Finally, there are two country-level variables that we introduce in order to test

our two main economic hypotheses. The first is GDP per capita, which as in our

previous papers we assume is positively correlated with countries’ relative skill-

abundance and which can thus be used to test the predictions arising out of

Heckscher-Ohlin theory. In particular, the theory predicts that in poor countries, being

high-skilled should be associated with anti-trade attitudes, whereas in rich countries it

should be associated with more liberal attitudes. The prediction is thus that schooling

should enter with a positive sign in a regression explaining anti-trade sentiment, but

that an interaction term between schooling and GDP per capita should enter with a

negative sign. The numbers on GDP per capita are taken from Heston et al. (2002),

and are for 1998 (the last year for which data for all 18 countries, including Taiwan,

were given).

       The second country-level variable is a measure of government size. We use

the World Development Indicators’ figures for general government final consumption

expenditure as a percentage of GDP, which are for 2000. Our strategy is to interact

government size with risk aversion; we expect to find that while risk aversion has a

positive effect on anti-trade sentiment, the interaction term will enter with a negative

sign in the regressions, indicating that risk-aversion has a weaker effect on anti-

globalization attitudes in countries with larger governments. Unfortunately, data for

Taiwan are missing, and so we are forced to exclude Taiwan from this analysis.

         Summary statistics for all variables are given in Table 1, while Table 2 gives

the country level means for the variables.7 Ireland has the smallest government share

within Europe, while governments are generally smaller in Asia than in Europe.

Respondents tend to favour safety nets, and to place themselves in the middle of the

political spectrum. There are particularly strong senses of national identity in

Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and Greece.



4. Results

         Table 3 presents the results of the series of probit regressions designed to test

the various hypotheses developed in the previous sections. In every case we use the

same binary dependent variable, ‘Extremely protectionist’. All equations include

country fixed effects, to capture the influence of any unobserved country-specific

factors that might be influencing attitudes in a uniform way across respondents. We

do not report these country effects in Table 3, although we do report the coefficients

on the basic demographic controls that we include (that is age and female). As in

previous work, we find that older people are more opposed to trade. We also find a

pronounced gender effect, with women being more protectionist than men, other

things being equal. Since these age and gender effects are not the primary focus of

this paper, we merely note them at this stage and move on to our main results.

         As in our previous work (Mayda and Rodrik 2005, O’Rourke and Sinnott

2001) we find that the data are consistent with the predictions of Heckscher-Ohlin

theory (equation 1). The coefficient on schooling is positive and statistically

significant, while the interaction term between schooling and GDP per capita is

7
  The summary statistics in the overall sample (Table 1) are based on the observations used in
regression (7), Table 3, which is our preferred specification. The marginal effects we calculate in
Section 4 use mean values of the regressors from this Table. The summary statistics by country (Table
2) are instead based on all the observations available in the dataset (since not all countries in the sample
are covered in regression (7), Table 3).


                                                    14
negative and statistically significant. This implies that in sufficiently poor countries,

the better educated will be anti-trade, while in sufficiently rich countries, the better

educated will be liberal in their attitudes towards trade. This result is extremely

robust, in that it survives the inclusion of many additional variables in the

specifications in equations (2) through (8). According to the coefficients reported in

equation (7) (which is our preferred specification, as it controls for risk considerations

and non-economic determinants of attitudes) the cut-off point for per capita GDP

below which the high-skilled are protectionist is approximately $9,500. In addition,

the coefficient estimates in equation (7) imply that an extra four years of schooling

increases the probability of an extremely protectionist trade response by 2.2

percentage points in Indonesia (whose per capita GDP is approximately $3,900) while

it reduces the probability by 3.2 percentage points in Sweden (whose per capita GDP

is $22,475).8

         Equation (2) moves on to the main theme of our paper, by including our pro-

safety net variable. As we expected, being in favour of government-provided safety

nets is positively correlated with anti-globalization sentiment, with the result being

highly statistically significant. We believe that the positive coefficient on ‘Pro-safety

net’ is in part driven by the impact of risk aversion. However, entering ‘Pro-safety

net’ on its own is open to the criticism that this variable captures not just risk-


8 To calculate the marginal effects of individual skill, we used Clarify (King, Tomz and Wittenberg
2000; Tomz, Wittenberg and King 2001) and set all the individual-level variables equal to their overall
sample means (see Table 1). For the aggregate-level variables we used each country's specific values,
that is the government share, per capita GDP and coefficient on country dummy variable for,
respectively, Sweden and Indonesia. Note that we were also concerned to test the robustness of these
findings, given the recent argument of Hainmueller and Hiscox (2006) that education might be
influencing respondents’ attitudes towards trade directly (by providing them with ideas and information
relevant to the trade policy debate) rather than via its effects on labour market outcomes. We thus made
use of two questions, which asked respondents to identify their country’s foreign minister, and the five
permanent UN Security Council members. From these we generated two ‘political sophistication’
variables, which were included in regressions not reported here (these variables were included both
linearly and in interaction form with per capita GDP). Our Heckscher-Ohlin results are robust to the
inclusion of these variables.



                                                  15
aversion, but other variables such as household living standards (current and future)

and political ideology, and so we include these variables in equation (3). Controlling

for household income, for whether respondents are worried about their work situation,

and for ideology (how politically right wing the respondent reports himself or herself

to be), we find that the more a respondent agrees with the statement that “The

government should take responsibility for ensuring that everyone either has a job or is

provided with adequate social welfare,” the more likely he or she is to be

protectionist. As we argued earlier, since we are controlling for both ideology and

current and future income, this partial correlation between pro-safety net beliefs and

protectionism suggests that there is a positive correlation between risk aversion and

attitudes towards trade.

         This partial correlation in equation (3) is positive, and strongly statistically

significant. Our interpretation of this result is that respondents who are more risk-

averse tend to be anti-globalization, although we stress that this is a partial correlation

and that we are not making strong statements about causation. Again, this is a robust

result since it shows up in our other specifications as well (equations 4 and 7). It is

economically as well as statistically significant in that, based on regression (3), Table

3, an increase in ‘Pro-safety net’ from 3 to 5 raises the probability of being extremely

protectionist by 12 percentage points.9 Interestingly enough, household living

standards have no direct impact on attitudes towards trade, according to these results,

in that the coefficient is statistically insignificant (and indeed its sign is ambiguous).

Being politically right-wing is associated with more protectionist sentiments in

equation (3), but this result is not robust, since the coefficient on politically right wing

becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero in equations (4), (7) and (8).

9
 To calculate the marginal effect of ‘Pro-safety net’, we used Clarify and set all the right-hand-side
variables (except for ‘Pro-safety net’) equal to their overall sample means (see Table 1).


                                                   16
         It is probably not surprising that respondents who are more risk-averse are

more opposed to globalization. More interesting from the point of view of policy

makers is whether or not they can do anything about the hostility towards

globalization arising from this channel. Equation (4) suggests that in fact they can do

something. Equation (4) interacts our pro-safety net variable – as well as the other

determinants of pro-safety net attitudes – with the size of government, here measured

by the share of government final consumption expenditure in GDP.10 The interaction

term is negative and statistically significant, and again this result is robust to the

inclusion of additional variables in equation (7). What the result is telling us is that in

countries with bigger governments, risk aversion has a smaller impact on protectionist

attitudes than in countries with small governments. This could be for a number of

reasons, as mentioned in the introduction. It could be because larger governments do

better at providing social insurance programmes of the sort which our pro-safety net

question refers to. Or, it could be that having a big government by itself reduces the

risk environment facing economic agents, as argued by Rodrik (1998). Our results

show that bigger governments considerably reduce the impact of risk-aversion on

globalization preferences. Based on regression (7), Table 3, if ‘Pro-safety net’

increases from 3 to 5, then the probability of being extremely protectionist increases

by approximately 6.5 percentage points in Sweden, where the government consumes

26.6% of GDP, but by approximately 16 percentage points in Indonesia where the

share is only 6.5% (these two countries correspond to, respectively, the highest and

lowest government shares in the data set).11



10
   Notice that, in an individual-level analysis such as ours, reverse causality from attitudes to policy
outcomes (for example, government size) is not an issue, since each individual has an infinitesimal
impact on the aggregate policy outcome.
11
   To calculate the marginal effects of ‘Pro-safety net’, we used Clarify and set all the individual-level
variables (except for pro-safety net) equal to their overall sample means (see Table 1). For the


                                                    17
         We also tested the robustness of our results by estimating country-specific

regressions. For each country, we ran a probit model of protectionist attitudes on age,

gender, schooling, pro-safety net, as well as the other determinants of pro-safety net

attitudes. As Figure 1 shows, the country-specific marginal effect of pro-safety net is

negatively related to each country’s share of government expenditure in GDP.

         Another way of extracting information on risk-aversion from the pro-safety

net variable, and excluding other factors that might influence it, is to regress ‘Pro-

safety net’ on household income and political ideology, and enter the residuals from

this regression as a regressor into our bivariate probit analysis. Equation (1) in Table 4

provides an OLS estimate of the determinants of pro-safety net, including as

regressors not just income and ideology, but all the other right hand side variables

appearing in equation (3) of Table 3 as well. Though we are mainly interested in the

residuals, the results of this analysis are interesting in themselves. Household living

standards, not worried about job and politically right-wing are all strongly and

negatively correlated with pro-safety net opinions, consistent with the analysis in

Alesina and La Ferrara (2004). It is also noticeable that there is a Heckscher-Ohlin

style relationship between schooling and ‘Pro-safety net’ – with the educated

favouring safety nets in poor countries but not in rich ones. This result is important

because it is consistent with the interpretation in our previous work (Mayda and

Rodrik 2005, O’Rourke and Sinnott 2001) that the estimated impact of skill on

protectionist attitudes (positive and negative in, respectively, low-income and high-

income countries) is related to the income-distribution Stolper-Samuelson effect of

trade liberalization.



aggregate-level variables we used each country's specific values, that is the government share, per
capita GDP and coefficient on country dummy variable for, respectively, Sweden and Indonesia.



                                                  18
        The residuals from this relationship (equation 1, Table 4), which are a measure

of risk aversion, are then entered into the bivariate probit analysis of attitudes towards

trade (equations (5) and (6)). The results are consistent with what we found earlier:

risk-aversion is associated with anti-trade attitudes, but this correlation diminishes as

government size increases, consistent with the main argument of this paper.12

        Finally, we explore whether these results are robust to the inclusion of

variables measuring non-economic attitudes. The answer is that they are, but our

results for national and supranational identity are interesting in their own right as well.

Consistent with our previous findings, nationalist sentiment (in this case measured by

the degree of importance people ascribe to their national identity) is strongly

associated with protectionist attitudes. On the other hand, when we turn to the impact

of a sense of suprational identity, we find that a sense of European identity is strongly

associated with more liberal attitudes towards trade. Thus, in terms of our earlier

discussion, there is no evidence that identification with Europe (as in thinking of

oneself as European) is associated with ‘Fortress Europe’ opinions; rather, quite the

opposite, as our Euro-identifiers tend to be pro-globalization. By contrast, two of the

remaining three supranational identities contribute to anti-globalization sentiment:

respondents who reported having a sense of Asian identity or a sense of supranational

Islamic identity were more anti-trade than others.

        Equation (7) in Table 3 introduces these identity variables into a specification

where ‘pro-safety net’ is entered directly into the equation, along with household

income and political ideology. Equation (8) replicates the analysis, but this time

12
   We worried that the impact of government size on the coefficient of risk aversion might be driven by
the positive correlation between government size and per capita GDP levels across countries. For
example, maybe in advanced countries more risk-averse individuals might be less opposed to free trade
because markets work better than in lower-income countries, therefore making it easier to insure
against risk. We do not find evidence of this channel: When in regression (6), Table 3, we replace the
interaction term risk aversion*govt.share with the new interaction variable risk aversion*gdp, the
coefficient on the latter variable is not significant (results not shown).


                                                  19
adopts the two-equation approach of equations (5) and (6). In order to be consistent,

we estimate a new first-stage OLS regression explaining ‘pro-safety net’, adding the

identity variables as additional explanatory factors (equation (2) in Table 4).

Interestingly, while those having an Asian or a Chinese sense of identity are more pro-

safety net, the same is not true of those with a European sense of identity, rhetoric

about the ‘European social model’ notwithstanding. Moreover, respondents with a

sense of supranational Islamic identity were less pro-safety net than others. Most

importantly for our purposes, when the residuals from this equation are added into the

bivariate probit analysis (equation 8 of Table 3), the results are exactly as they were

before.



5. Conclusion

          Our results provide microeconomic evidence consistent with the long-standing

argument that the state and the market are in fact complementary. Openness and

globalization can introduce uncertainty into peoples’ lives, and this additional risk can

lead some people to oppose trade. Government expenditure can help to reduce this

risk, and thus shore up support for open markets. It would seem that the ‘grand

bargain’ that was embedded liberalism is politically effective. Whether that grand

bargain can survive the additional political pressures which the interaction of mass

migration and the welfare state can give rise to will be one of the key issues

determining the sustainability of this institutional compromise in the decades ahead.

These summary statistics are based on the same observations as regression (7), Table 3. Extremely protectionist equals 1 if the respondent
strongly agrees that his/her country should limit the import of foreign products. Pro-safety net ranges from 1=strongly disagree to 5= strongly
agree and gives the respondent's answer to the following question: "The government should take responsibility for ensuring that everyone either
has a job or is provided with adequate social welfare." Household living standards ranges from 1=low to 5=high. Not worried about job ranges
from 1=very worried to 3=not worried at all and gives the respondent's answer to the following question: "Some people feel that their life is going
well. Others are worried about the way it is going. In your own case, how worried are you about your work situation."
Risk aversion (risk aversion (2) ) is equal to the residual from a regression of pro-safety net on age, female, years of schooling, years of
schooling*gdp, household living standards, not worried about job, politically right-wing , and country fixed effects (and national identity
variables). gdp is the 1998 per capita GDP (divided by 1000). Govt. share equals the share of government final consumption expenditure in GDP
in 2000.

For each country, we have run a probit model of protectionist attitudes on age, gender, schooling, pro-safety net,
as well as the other determinants of pro-safety net attitudes. The values on the y axis in the Figure are the
marginal effects of pro-safety net from each country-specific probit model. The values on the x axis are each
country’s share of government expenditure in GDP.
