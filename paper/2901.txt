               THE IMPACT OF R&D INVESTMENT ON PRODUCTIVITY
                    NEW EVIDENCE USING LINKED R&D-LRD DATA


                                  ABSTRACT




        This paper uses confidential Censui longitudinal microdata
  to examine the association between R&D and productivity for the
  period 1972.1985. These data allow for significant improvements
  in measurement and model specification, yielding more precise
  estimates of the returns to R&D. Our results confirm the

  findings of existing studies:
        1) positive returns to R&D investment

        2) higher returns to company-financed research
        3) a productivity "premium" on basic research
  These results are robust to our attempts to adjust for
  "influential" outliers. Also, it appears that the return to

  company-financed R&D (but          total   R&D) is an increasing
  function of firm size.

          The Imoact of R&D Investment on Productivity.

                New Evidence Using Linked R&-LRD Data

                              Introduc t ion

     Economists have identified R&D investment as an important

determinant of productivity growth. The objective of this paper
is to examine the association between R&D and productivity growth

using the most comprehensive and accurate longitudinal microdata

yet available for productivity analysis. These data allow for
improvements in measurement and model specification, yielding
more efficient estimates of the effects of R&D investment on

productivity.

     Our empirical investigation of the strength of the R&D-
productivity connection is based on estimation of reduced-form
equations derived from the R&D Capital Stock Model (Griliches
1979), which asserts that the stock of a firm's technical

knowledge or its knowledge capital is itself a factor of
production. If the rate of depreciation of knowledge capital is
assumed to be negligible, TFP growth is a function of the

"intensity" of R&D investment, which is usually measured as the
ratio of R&D expenditure to sales:

          (1) DTFP — a ÷ RDINT + Ut
where u is a classical disturbance term. The coefficient on R&D
intensity ()    is   interpreted as a marginal product or "rate of
return" to R&D investment. Point estimates at the company or
line of business level are interpreted as measures of the private
rate of return to R&D, or those that accrue to the firm or its

investors. Due to incomplete appropriability or other factors,
this return may not equal the social return to this activity.
       This paper discusses and adjusts for the limitations of

existing micro-level empirical studies, which have provided
estimates of the private rate of return to R&D. While these

studies have been useful, productivity estimates at the firm or
line of business level contained therein have been based on crude

and incomplete measures of output and inputs. The most serious
measurement problem has been an inability to control for

diversification when calculating firms' productivity. More
specifically, productivity estimation in these studies has often

been based on the assumption that firms operate in only one line
of business (4-digit SIC industry). To the extent that the
relative prices of firms' outputs and inputs vary across
industries, this approach introduces an element of noise into

estimation of TFP growth (DTFP). Even if it is uncorrelated with
R&D intensity, this measurement error will reduce the efficiency

 of estimates of .    We   demonstrate that measures of TFP growth

 based on linked Census R&D-LRD Data are more precise, because we
 can calculate firms' real output and input at the 4-digit SIC
 industry level and aggregate to the firm level. As expected fron

 the   standard errors-in-variables model, this reduction in

 measurement error from improved deflation yields more efficient
 estimates of the rate of return to R&D.

        An empirical example is presented that illustrates the
                                                                        3


extent to which more precise TFP measurement leads to more
efficient estimates of rates of return to R&D. This example is

derived from a pilot study performed by the authors (Lichtenberg-
Siegel (1988)), based on linked R&D-LRD data for a sample of 115
firms for the years 1972-1980. Having demonstrated the
desirability and feasibility of using linked Census R&D-LRD data
to examine the R&D-productivity connection, a comprehensive
analysis of rates of return to R&D is undertaken, using a full
sample of over 2,000 firms. Given our ability to disaggregate R&D
investment, we can discriminate between the returns to R&D by
source of funds (company-funded vs. federally-funded R&D) and by
character of use (basic research vs. applied research and
development). Also, the panel structure of our data allows us to
explore the time series properties of these rates of return
throughout the sample period. The sensitivity of our results to
outliers (influential observations) is also examined.        Finally,
we address Schumpeterian issues - -   are   the returns to R&D an
increasing function of firm size? The last section is devoted to
a summary of the conclusions that can be drawn from our empirical

analysis.
I.             Description of Linked Census R&D-LRD Data
     Our examination of these issues is based on two confidential
longitudinal data sets that were made available to us as

participants in the ASA/NSF/Cettsus Research Program. The
Longitudinal Research Database (LRD), which brings together data
from the Annual Survey and Census of Manufactures, will be used

to measure productivity at the firm level (based on plant-level
data). The LRD file is the richest source of annual data

collected from manufacturing establishments, containing detailed

information on their output and inputs. Comprehensive
information on the characteristics of this file is presented in

McGuckin and Pascoe (1988).
     To study the relationship between R&D and productivity, we
linked the LRD file to the NSF/Census firm-level Annual Survey of
Industrial R&D (RD-i Survey). The RD-i Survey contains
comprehensive data on firms' R&D investment and its distribution
by source of funds (company vs. federally-funded R&D), character

of use (basic vs. applied, product field), and many other
classifications. The importance of the RD-l Survey is
demonstrated by the fact that it serves as the basis for the

official United States R&D statistics, as published by NSF.1
         A previous study, Lichtenberg-Siegei (1988), was based on
 linked R&D-LRD data for a sample of 115 large firms. In this

      1See Lichtenberg (1989) for a discussion of the RD-i data,
 including a comparison of them with other (e.g. Compustat) R&D
 data.

paper, we analyze the R&D-productivity connection for a

substantially larger and more representative sample of firms --
the complete universe of firms in the linked R&D-LRD data set- -
over 2,000 companies. Definitions of key variables appear in
Table 1. Table 2 contains descriptive statistics for these
variables. R&D intensity values are derived completely from
information contained in the NSF R&D Survey. That is, R&D

expenditure, employment, and sales figures reported are
consolidated, domestic, firm-level values. We have computed
average annual values of each variable for three periods, 1973-

1976, 1977-1980, and l98ll985.2
     Productivity performance appears to have improved in the
later periods. Average annual TFP growth declined 1.4 percentage
points during period one and remained virtually constant in
periods two and three. This result is consistent with the

general improvement in aggregate economic performance during
these years. A second stylized fact is that there is only a
small degree of variation across periods in all measures of R&D

intensity. For example, the average R&D intensity during periods
one, two, and three were 2.4%, 2.4%, and 2.8%, respectively.3
     While our measures of the intensity of R&D investment are
based on consolidated, company-wide numbers, our estimates of

     2Explicit information on the construction of these variables
is contained in the data appendix.
     3The unbalanced nature of reporting is due to the fact that
firms are     required to report R&D expenditure by character of
use (basic vs. applied research and development) and R&D
scientists and engineers by source of funds.
                                                                     0


firm   productivity are based on data collected from the LRD file.

This file contains information only for manufacturing
establishments that were sampled continuously in the Annual

Survey of Manufactures (ASM) for the years 1972-1981. The mean
value of the "coverage ratio" COVRAT (the ratio of a firm's total

LRD shipments to its consolidated sales) suggests that on

average, we are capturing a substantial proportion (approximately
82%) of each corporation's domestic sales. In the next section,
we discuss how these linked R&D-LRD Data can be used to estimate

the effects of R&D on productivity growth.



II.      The Relationship Between R&D Investment and Total. Factor
         Productivity-Review and Criticiue of Existing Studies

            Previous studies have demonstrated that productivity

growth is positively correlated with the intensity of R&D
 investment (usually measured as R&D expenditure per dollar of

 sales). Our reservations concerning attempts to assess the
 impact of R&D on productivity are not grounded in doubts relating
 to the theory that is used to explain this relationship.4 Our
 concern, however, is directed towards the poor quality of

 productivity measurement inherent to previous empirical


      41n contrast, Nelson (1987) criticizes the interpretation o
 the empirical results contained in these studies. He argues that
 R&D intensity is not exogenous; in fact, it is determined by
 "technological opportunity" and appropriability conditions in
 specific industries. To some extent, we will control for these
 factors by measuring each firm's R&D intensity as a deviation
 from the average R&D intensity in its home industry (2-digit
 SIC)

implementation of the basic theoretical model.
       This model (see Griliches (1979)), common to most existing
empirical studies, is based on a Cobb-Douglas production
function, including the stock of technical knowledge as a factor

of production:

                     —   output elasticity of factor i
                 a —     output elasticity of the stock of R&D
An index of TFP is defined as:



                                  it X.(t)
                                 i—l 1

       Taking logs, differentiating with respect to time, assuming
constant returns to scale, imposing the condition that the output
elasticities of the conventional inputs equal their respective
shares in total cost (factors are paid their marginal products),
and reparameterization of the output elasticity of R&D (see

Terleckyj (1974)), yields:
                                          R +
       (3) DTFP —            A    +
                                                                          8


where p is the marginal product of research capital, or the "rate
of return" to R&D investment, A is the rate of disembodied

"external" technical change, and j         is   a classical disturbance

term. Assuming zero or negligible depreciation of R&D,
  is measured as the "intensity," of R&D investment, or

the R&D to sales ratio. As discussed in the data appendix, the
dependent variable, total factor productivity growth (DTFP), is
calculated based on a Tornqvist approximation to the continuous
Divisia index of output and inputs. Equation (3) therefore
consitituteS the "intensity" version of the R&D Capital Stock

Model.
      Recent examinations of the relationship between R&D and

productivity have yielded somewhat contradictory results. Papers
based on data collected from the 1950's and 1960's have found

positive effects of R&D on productivity. However, in several
 studies using 1970's data, including Agnew and Wise (1978),

 Griliches (1980b) ,   Link   (198la) ,   and Scherer (1981), the R&D

 coefficient failed to achieve statistical significance. On the

 other hand, Mansfield (1980), Griiiches-Lichtenberg (1984),
 Griliches-Mairesse (1984), Criliches (1986), and Lichtenberg
 Siegel (1988) have found that the association between R&D and

 productivity did not collapse during the 1970's.
         An important consideration in analyzing the effects of R&D

 on productivity is the level of aggregation of the data. Early
 studies used economy-wide or industry time series, leading to
 parameter estimates that have been interpreted as measures of the
                                                                    9

social return to R&D. Several R&D-productivity studies have also
been undertaken at the firm-level (Minasian (1969), Mansfield

(1980), Link (1981a), Criliches (1980a, 1986), and Criliches-
Mairesse (1984)) and the business segment level (Clark-Grjliches
           5
(1984)).       A micro level analysis is desirable because of greater
degrees of freedom and the ability to evaluate private returns to
R&D.

       While these papers were useful, they were subject to some
major restrictions. One problem is that many studies were based
only on data collected from firms whose shares are publicly

traded.6 Also, public access files such as Standard and Poor's
Compustat file, which is derived from firms' 10-K reports to the
SEC, contain information only on company-funded R&D expenditure.
This lack of detailed R&D data is bothersome because recent

empirical work by Mansfield (1980), Griliches (1986), Griliches.
Lichtenberg (1984), and Link (1981b) has focused on differences

in productivity returns to specific components of R&D investment
(e.g. basic research).7


     5Mansfield (1980) used industry-level and firm-level data to
estimate the productivity impact of basic research. His results
were similar in both cases. The company-level estimates were
based on data provided by 10 petroleum firms and 6 chemical firms.
     6The Clark and Criliches (1984) study is based on the
proprietary PIMS file collected by the Strategic Planning
Institute (SF1).
     7Mansfield (1980) Link (l981b), and Griliches (1986) find
evidence of a productivity "premium" on basic research.
Griliches (1986) and Griliches-Lichtenberg (1984) conclude that
privately-financed R&D (but not federally-financed R&D) has a
strong effect on productivity growth.
                                                                  10


     ProductivitY estimates in existing micro level studies are

based on crude and incomplete measures of output and inputs.
Public access files include no information on the number of hours

worked and energy and materials data are often missing. The

major problem associated with estimates of productivity in
previous papers has been an inability to control for firm
diversification. When computing real. values of output and

inputs, industry deflators must be applied to nominal variables.

These deflators may vary greatly across different lines-of-
business in a given firm. However, public information concerning

a given firm's activity in different industries is remarkably
limited.8 As a result, in most firm-level studies, productivity
estimation has been based on the assumption that firms operate in

only one 4-digit SIC industry with real variables calculated
 according to a single set of price deflators.
      In Lichtenberg-Siegel (1988), we illustrated the problems
 associated with the single-industry classification process by

 presenting this simple example: Assume that a firm operates in
 two 4-digit SIC industries.

      Let    VQI —   The firm's output in current dollars, in
                     industry 1 at time t

             VQ2 —   The firm's output in current dollars, in
                     industry 2 at time t


      8Cornpustat, for example, provides only one or several 4-
 digit SICs for the corporations it samples. Most importantly,
 the distributions of the variables needed to construct total or
 partial productivity are unavailable at the line-of-business
 level.
                                                                           11

                        —   The price deflator for industry 1 at time t
                        —   The price deflator for industry 2 at time t

If VQl > VQ2 then industry 1 is considered to be the firm's
major line of business at time t, and industry l's price deflator

is applied to the firm's nominal output, to calculate real

output. Thus, the conventional (using publicly-available
information) methodology yields:

                       VQl+VQ2
       (Ml)    Q
We   believe that the proper way to measure real output is to take

account of diversification,9 by deflating the firm's nominal
output in each industry, and then aggregating real output to the
firm level. The preferred measure of real output is:


        (M2)       -
                       VQl + VQ2
It    is clear that         and Q   will     grow at different rates if there

arechanges in the relative price of the two industries' outputs.
Similar issues are associated with the measurement of real input
of    diversified firms.

        An errors-in-variables argument may be invoked to explain
the deviations from the basic regression model that are inherent

to each method of TFP estimation, the "conventional" (Ml) and th

"preferred" (M2) methodologies. Equation (3) is restated as:

        (4) DTFP — RDINT            +
                                        Ut

        9
      Gollop and Monahan (1984), using quinquennial Census of
Manufactures data for 1963-1977, present evidence that firms are
becoming increas ingly divers ified.

where

             RDINTC — the firm's R&D intensity in year t
             DTFP — the firm's true TFP growth in            year t

                ut — a classical disturbance term
Using the preferred methodology (M2), we observe:

        (5) DTFPC — DTFP +
where         is due to incomplete coverage of firm's establishments,

an inability to completely measure the firm's "true" level of
diversification, and errors in the industry deflators.10 In

estimating productivity growth according to the conventiona1
methodology (Ml), we believe that the following is observed:

        (6) DTFP — DTFP       +       ÷ 2t
The additional error term, 2t' is due to a failure to control

 for diversification beyond a single 4-digit SIC industry.
        The dependent variable is measured with error in both cases.

 We invoke the usual errors-in-variables assumptions:
                                      —                  —
        E(u) —   E(ci)   —

        —o
 The error terms have zero mean, are pairwise uncorrelated, and
 are uncorrelated with both the independent variable and the

 classical disturbance term.
        Under these assumptions, both the conventional and preferred

 methodologies yield unbiased parameter estimates. However, the
 conventional methodology (Ml) produces "noisier" estimates:

In order to assess the importance of these alleged gains in the
precision of TFP estimation generated by the "preferred"
methodology, we calculated variants of our regression model using

(Ml)        (M2) in Lichtenberg-Siegel (1988). For a sample of 115
of   the largest R&D performing companies, the standard deviation
of the conventional measure of TFP growth was 29% higher.
        Analysis of the regression results from the pilot study
reveals that the additional variance associated with the
conventional methodology is also uncorrelated with R&D. Tables 3

and 4 (from Lichtenberg-Siegel (1988)) are based on regressions

of average annual productivity growth on average annual R&D
 intensity (for two periods: 1973-1976 and 1977-1980), using the

 standard (Ml) and improved (M2) meLhods, respectively, to
 calculate TFP. In columns (b) and (e), R&D is disaggregated by
 source of funds, while in column (c), it is classified by
                                                                    14


character of use.11 The point estimates in both tables are quite
similar, as expected. However, LRD-based TFP measures provide

more efficient estimates, as evidenced by the substantial
                                                               12
increases in R2 that arise when we calculate TFP under (M2).

Across columns (a)-(e), a2   increases 30.8%, 46.3%, 69.2%, 88.2%,
and 38.1% when we control for firm diversification (Table 4).

Due to the overall improvement in goodness of fit when we adopt
(M2) rather than (Ml), the virtues of using the LRD file to

estimate TFP have been firmly established.

III.    Rates of Return to R&D Using Linked Census R&D-LRD Data
       Having developed a procedure to measure productivity with

greater precision in Lichtenberg-Siegel (1988), this section
consists of a comprehensive analysis of rates of return to R&D
investment using the complete set of over 2,000 firms in the

 linked Census R&D-LRD data set. Our sample, which includes many

 small, private firms, is a highly representative sample of

 companies performing industrial R&D.    Table S demonstrates that

 the companies in our sample accounted for 84% of R&D performed
 (by industrial firms) in the United States in 1976.   The sample

 coverage ratios are also quite high for sales, employment, and

       11 In Tables 3 and 4, columns a,b,d, and e are weighted least
 squares results, to adjust for heteroskedastiCity due to
 incomplete firm "coverage" in the LRD file. That is, we believe
 that estimates of firm productivity based on only a small
 fraction of its manufacturing plants are somewhat less reliable,
 or "noisy.' Still, on average, we captured 85% of a firm's sales
      121n comparing parameter estimates from these two tables, we
 note that corresponding regressions (columns (a)-(e)) are based
 on the same number of observations and R&D intensity values.
                                                                   15

all measures of R&D.
     In Section II, we discussed how use of linked R&D-LRD data

allows us to measure productivity more precisely at the firm
level. This is due to our ability to observe more complete
measures of firms' output and inputs across industries. However,
LRD estimates of a firm's productivity are based only on its

continuously operating (between 1972 and 1981) manufacturing
plants. We hypothesize that companies with a high percentage of
their output in LRD establishments have their productivity
measured more accurately than firms with low percentages of LRD
activity. We found that the inability to measure firms' total
output and inputs introduced an element of heteroskedasticity

into OLS estimation of equation (3).
     Thus, weighted least sauares estimates for variants of
equation (3) are presented in Table 6.   The weight for these

regressions is (COVRAT)12, where COVRAT — the ratio of the
firm's LRD shipments to its consolidated domestic net sales.

These results are based on regressions of average annual TFP

growth on average R&D intensity values for three periods, 1973-
1976, 1977-1980, and 1981-1985. In order to control
(imperfectly) for inter-industry differences in R&D intensity due

to differential "technological opportunityTM and appropriability
conditions, we measure each firm's R&D intensity as a deviation

from the average R&D intensity in its home industry (2-digit
SIC).13 The parameter estimates of Table 6 will be compared with

           of our regressions control for these industry effects
                                                                   16

those from existing macro/industry and firm/line of business
empirical studies in Table 7.
       As discussed in Section II, it is generally believed that

parameter estimates from industry-level studies measure social
returns to R&D, while estimates derived from micro studies

capture private returns to R&D. Therefore, we do not expect
parameter estimates based on models estimated at different levels

of aggregation to be equal.14 In the studies that are        based

on the "intensity" model, the parameter of interest is a, the
output elasticity of R&D. For each a, we have imputed a value of
A                                               A

p (the    estimated marginal product), dividing a by the mean of
R/Q. We are especially interested in comparing our results to
those of previous studies based on the "intensity" model, using

firm or line-of-business data.
        The results of Table 6 confirm the existence of a positive
relationship between the intensity of R&D investment and average

annual productivity growth. Under competitive assumptions, our
results imply private rates of return to R&D investment of 13.2%

and 9.7% using expenditure and employment measures, respectively.
A 13.2% rate of return is lower than comparable estimates of 20%
by Clark-Criliches (1984) using business level data, and 27% by

 Griliches (l980a) and 39% by Griliches (1986), using firm-level

         14Several authors have avoided imposing the condition that
    factors are paid their marginal products and instead, estimated
    Cobb-Douglas production functions directly, assuming only
    constant returns to scale with respect to the conventional
    inputs. The "level" and "growth rate" equations estimated in
    Griliches (1980a, l980b, and 1986) are based on constant returns
    to scale     competitive markets for these inputs.
                                                                     17

data.

        A   disaggregation of R&D by source of funds reveals that

while the intensity of company-funded R&D investment (expenditure

or employment) is a significant determinant of productivity
growth, the intensity of federally-funded R&D investment is not.

In addition, using both expenditure and employment measures, the
hypothesis of homogeneity of returns to company and federally-
funded R&D is rejected at the 1% level of significance.15 The

potency of privately-financed R&D (but not federally-financed
R&D) has also been documented in Terleckyj (1974), Griliches-
Lichtenberg (1984), and Criliches (1986). Our estimate of 35.3%

rate of return to company-funded R&D is substantially higher than
similar estimates of 24.5% by Griliches (1986) and 27.5% by

Mansfield (1980).
        A disaggregation of R&D by character of use indicates that

the intensity of investment in basic research has a powerful
impact on productivity growth. An estimated rate of return of
133.8% to investment in basic research is substantially lower
than Mansfield's (1980) estimate of 178.0% and Link's (l981b)
estimate of 231.0%. The hypothesis of equality of returns to
basic research and other types of R&D was rejected at the 1%
level of significance.16 This evidence of a "premium" on basic

     15The t-statistics for tests of the expenditure and
employment measures are 48.53 and 25.03, respectively.
     '6The t-statistic for the test of equality of returns to
basic research and applied research is 61.07. The t-statistic
for the same test involving basic research and development is
65.78.
                                                                    18

research confirms the findings of Criliches (1986), Mansfield

(1980), and Link (1981b).1718
    The point estimates displayed in Table 6 are based on pooled

regressions. imposing a common slope for each period (1973-1976,

1977-1980, and 1981-1985). To investigate the hypothesis that
the returns to R&D varied across these two periods, we re-

estimated the regression model, allowing for different slopes in
                     19   These results are presented in Table 8.
all three periods.
Although we could not reject the hypothesis of equality of rates
of return to R&D across periods, the results certainly suggest
that the impact of R&D investment on TFP increased substantially
in the later periods. In fact, the point estimate on total R&D
(expenditure) is almost twice as high in period two. The rate or

     17To make our results more comparable to the findings of
Criliches (1986), we also regressed TFP growth on company-funded
R&D intensity and the ratio of basic research to total R&D
expenditure. The estimated coefficients and t-statistics (in
parenthesis) are, respectively, .313 (11.86) and .096 (8.86).
These estimates are quite similar to the findings contained in
the aforementioned study, although the "premium" on basic
research is somewhat lower.
      18The same pattern of results emerges when we restrict our
 sample to include only firms reporting basic research. When we
 estimate variants of the regression model for the same set of
 companies, the estimated coefficients and corresponding t-
 statistics (in parenthesis) for columns a, b, d, and e are-a:
 .137 (4.66), b: .422 (6.17) .016 (0.41), d: .135 (3.07), e: .160
 (3.37) .044 (0.62).
      19Scherer (1983) argues that specifications such as ours may
 not capture "true" changes in private returns to R&D over time.
 He believes that it is important to follow R&D from industry of
 origin to industry of use, as many firms "purchase" R&D from
 other firms implicitly when buying certain products and services.
 Only by identifying these "interindustry technology flows" can we
 truly measure the impact of R&D on productivity.
                                                                        19

return to company-funded R&D, using expenditure or employment
measures of R&D investment, is also dramatically higher in period
two.         Turning to the character of use results, we observe that

the "premium" on basic research increased slightly in period two,
while the rates of return to applied research and development
were quite unstable across periods. In the next section, we
examine the sensitivity of the full sample regression results

(Table 6) to outlying, influential observations.
IV.                  Identification of Influential Outliers

       Following Kuh, and Welsch (1980) and Neter, Wasserman, and
Kutner (1985), our research design is to detect outliers in the
dependent and independent variables and determine whether these

outliers are influential in the least squares regression fit.
Cook (1977, 1979) has proposed an influence statistic that
measures the change in the estimated parameter vector that
results if the ith observation is deleted. It is well known (see
Maddala (1977)) that the confidence region for           is expressed as:

        (7)       (-8)'X'X(8-8)   F(l ,k,n )
                       k

where
        X is a nxk matrix of independent variables

             is a kxl column vector of regression parameters

        fi   is   a kxl column vector of estimated regression parameters
        MSE — mean square error

Cook's influence statistic is defined in a similar manner, except

 it is based on a measure of the difference in the estimated
parameter vector including and excluding the ith observation.
                                                                      20


                   (-P(j)) 'X'X(PP(j))
        (8) Di

where        is the estimate of      without the ith data point. An

equivalent expression for Di involves the residuals and leverage
values:
                        2
                    e           h1
        (9) D.              (
                   kMSE (i_hit)

Relating values ofD to the F-distribution with k and n-k
degrees of freedom, those observations having percentile values
(of the F-distribution) of 50% or more are considered influential
observations. For each variant of the regression model (equation

(3)), we detected observations that are influential           outliers
in X and/or y.
        The discovery of influential outliers compels us to examine

the sensitivity of our regression results to the following

remedial measures:

        1)    reduction of the impact that influential observations

              have on the fitted regression function

        2)    deletion of influential outliers
 Deleting outlying influential observations is a somewhat drastic
 approach, unless the researcher is certain that the extreme

 values are due to what Be].siey, Kuh, and Welsch (1980) call
 "gross measurement error"-keypunch errors or incorrect reporting.

 If these values are correct, then their deletion eliminates vital
 information. In our final sample, we believe that we have

 already discarded a non-negligible percentage of values
 reflecting gross errors in measurement. An alternative to the
                                                                  21

least squares estimator that minimizes the effect of egregious
errors or outliers is the method of least absolute deviations.

One of a class of robust estimators, this "bounded-influence"
estimator minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations of the
observations from their means. The loss function is:


     (10) EIYi(o+ilXjl+...klXikl)I

These estimates are less sensitive to outliers because the sum of

absolute, rather than squared, deviations, is minimized.20
     In Table 9, we compare our earlier estimates of rates of
return to R&D investment to estimates of these same parameters
after deleting influential outliers (DEL) and those derived from
the method of least absolute deviations (LAD). The LAD estimates
of the rates of return to total R&D, company-funded R&D, and
basic research are 29.5%, 26.6%, and 31.5% lower, respectively,
than our original estimates. Our point estimates of these same

three parameters decline 3.8%, 17.3%, and 24.4%, respectively,
when influential outliers are discarded. These results are
somewhat surprising. We expected the deletion of influential
outliers to have a stronger impact on the parameter estimates
than attempts to reduce their influence. Instead, the opposite
pattern emerged, as the LAD estimates of these three rates of


     20As demonstrated by Charnes et al. (1955), the method of
least absolute deviations estimates can be derived from the
solution to a linear programming problem. However, standard
errors for the parameter estimates are unknown due to the fact
that the statistical properties of the sampling distribution of
this estimator are not well-defined.
                                                                         22

return are always lower than corresponding DEL estimates. Still,

our original estimates of the effect of R&D investment on TFP

growth are     dramaticallY   sensitive to adjustments aimed at

reducing the impact of influential outliers.2' In the next
section. we explore the relationship between rates of return to

R&D and firm size.

V.             Firm Size and Rates of Return to R&D
                                                                      in
     The ideas of Joseph Schumpeter (1950) figure prominently
the belief that large firms are especially likely both to
undertake, and be successful in, research activities. Recent

papers by Griliches (1980a), Scherer (1984), Bound et a].. (1984),
and Cohen, Levin, and Mowery (1987) have found little evidence to
support the position that firm size is positively correlated with

R&D intensity. Link (1981a) suggested an alternative approach to
 empirical investigation of the Schumpeterian hypothesis.        He

 examined and found evidence of a systematic relationship between
 firm size and the impact of R&D on productivity     -
                                                         large   firms

 earned higher returns to R&D than small firms.

      Estimation of variants of equation (3) was contingent on the

 assumption of a common rate of return, p, among firms. In this
 section, we test whether large firms R&D investment by large
 firms is more successful than that undertaken by small firms, by

 investigating the possibility that p   varies   across firms



             influential outliers deleted, we still reject the
 hypothesis of homogeneity of returns to company and federally-
 funded R&D. The same is true for the hypothesis of equality of
 returns to basic research and other types of R&D.
                                                                   23
according to size.22 A test for the structural stability of
regression parameters has been developed by Brown, Durbin, and
Evans (1975). The null hypothesis of this test is that the

regression coefficients are constant over an index of firm size.
An analysis of the cumulative sum of squared residuals determines
where, if at all, a structural "breaks or shift occurs. An
attractive property of the Brown-D:rbin-Evans "cusum" test is
that it does     require prior information concerning the true
point of structural change, unlike the Chow test. The use of

prior information concerning structural shifts is often quite
plausible when analyzing time series data. However, in our
context, the implementation of this type of strategy would be
arbitrary.23 Link (l981a), having estimated rates of return to
R&D investment based on the reduced form version of the R&D

capital stock model (using firm-level data), employed the Brown-
Durbin-Evans test to examine the structural stability of these

returns with respect to firm size.

     Our findings, based on the same research design applied to a

larger and more representative sample of firms, do not

substantiate the Schumpeterian hypothesis. Using sales and
employment as proxies for firm size, we were unable to reject the

     22A strict Schumpeterian interpretation of the heterogeneity
of p across companies might be that p is a function of firms'
monopoly power. Large size is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient condition for firms' ability to gain or maintain
monopoly power.
     231n fact, cusum test have been applied on macroeconomic
time series data in Khan (1974), Heller and Khart (1979), and
Stern, Baum, and Greene (1979).
                                                                  24

null hypothesis of structural stability for the rate of return to
R&D.24 Although we were unable to determine from the data
whether different size "regimes" exist, with respect to the rate

of return to R&D, we ranked companies by size and divided the
sample into three groups. Table 10 contains estimates of rates
of return to R&D, productivity growth, and R&D investment for
these three size categories. The small degree of variation in
the rate of return to total R&D across groups provides non-

parametric evidence in support of structural stability. Mean
total factor productivity growth and R&D intensity values are
also quite similar.

     The returns to company-funded R&D, however, do appear to be

higher for large firms.   In fact, we observe highly

statistically-significant differences (at the 1% level of
significance) in rates of return to company-funded R&D between
the two groups of large firms and the smallest companies.25 The

apparent instability of this regression parameter compels us to
implement the cusum test on this coefficient. One reason for
this finding may be that appropriability conditions are more
favorable for large firms. This is a subject for future
research. We also note that federally-funded R&D has a stronger

     24That is, the test statistic, s  ,based on the normalized
cumulative sum of squared residuals, hways falls within the 5%
confidence intervals above and below the mean value line.

     25The t-statistics for these tests are 2.75 (largest vs.
smallest) and 2.97 (middle vs. smallest). The difference in
rates of return to company-funded R&D between the largest and
middle groups of firms is statistically insignificant.
                                                                   25
impact on the productivity growth of small firms. This result,
which has important implications for federal contracting policy,
also bears further examination.

      Still, the evidence presented in Table 10 demonstrates that
our earlier findings concerning rates of return are consistent
for each size classification of firms:

      a)   positive and significant coefficient on R&D intensity
      b)   higher returns to company-funded R&D
      c)   a productivity "premiumTM on basic research.
VI.                         Conclusions
      Given the limited information contained in publicly.

available and proprietary data sets, estimates of company
productivity used in previous studies have been subject to
substantial measurement error. The main source of inaccuracy in
these studies has been an inability to adequately control for the

diversified activities of corporations. Use of the NSF/Census
R&D-LRD Panel allows us to develop more precise estimates of TFP,
because the LRD file contains detailed data on the output and
input of firms at the 4-digit SIC industry level.

      Our results suggest that R&D investment was a significant

determinant of productivity growth during the 1970's, as
documented in previous studies, and also during the 1980's.
However, the estimated private rate of return to R&D expenditure

13.2%, is substantially lower than previous estimates. As in
Griliches-Lichtenberg (1984) and Griliches (1986), we observe
statistically-significant differences in the rates of return to
                                                                 26

company-funded and federally-funded R&D. We find a strong
positive correlation between the rate of growth of TFP and the

firm's privately-financed R&D, while federally-financed R&D does
not appear to be a significant determinant of TFP growth.26 We
also find that a firm's investment in basic research has a strong
effect on productivity growth, while investment in other types of
R&D apparently has either a small impact on TFP growth, or none
at all. This result is consistent with the findings of Mansfield

(1980), Link (1981b) and Griliches (1986).
     The point estimates we have discussed were based on pooled

regressions, assuming constant slopes for each three-year period,
1973-1976, 1977-1980, and 1981-1985. Although we could not
formally reject this constraint, we do find evidence to support

the hypothesis that the impact of R&D on productivity was
stronger in the later periods.27 Concern about a recent decline
in the impact of R&D on total factor productivity, due to a

diminution of technological opportunities (Nordhaus (1980)), does
not appear to be well-founded.
     Next, we analyzed the sensitivity of our regression results
to attempts to reduce the influence of "outlying" observations.

     26
       As Griliches (1979) points out, this result does not
necessarily imply that federally-funded R&D is "unproductive."
In industries with relatively high levels of publicly-financed
R&D, such as the defense or space sectors, output is poorly
measured and price indices do not accurately reflect improvements
 in quality.
      27Despite considerable variation across periods, the pattern
 of results in each period is consistent with our overall findings
 and those of most existing studies.
                                                                  27

Two strategies were employed to address this problem:
     a)   deletion of influential outliers

     b)   estimation by the method of least absolute deviations
           a "bounded-influence" estimator

These adjustments had only a small impact on our key empirical
findings. Therefore, our regression results are         due

primarily to values that may be anomalous and/or erroneous.

     The relationship between rates of return to R&D and firm
size was also examined. Inherent to our estimation of the
reduced form version of the R&D Capital Stock Model is the

assumption of a common rate of return among firms. As in Link
(198la), we explored the validity of this assumption by testing
for the structural stability of the regression parameter (only
the rate of return to total R&D was examined), with respect to

firm size. We could n... reject structural stability, and an
analysis of three groups of firms, ranked in ascending size,
seemed to confirm this result. However, the returns to company-

funded R&D appear to be an increasing function of firm size. At
the same time, the rate of return to federally-funded R&D is
higher for small firms.28 These results indicate that
appropriability conditions are more favorable for large firms
funding their own research. This non-parametric evidence, which
supports the Schumpeterian hypothesis, bears further examination.


            may explain why our estimate of the rate of return to
company-funded R&D was substantially higher in the pilot study
(Lichtenberg-Siegel (1988)), which was based on data collected
from large firms.

Data Sources for Construction of TFP estimates:
     To construct estimates of levels and growth rates of TFP

based on 3 factors of production, we need estimates of real.

values of output (Q)   , capital   (K) ,   labor   (L) ,   materials
(including energy) (M), and factor shares.             The LRD (Longitudinal

Research Database) file provides d'ta on nominal values of output

(VQ), capital (VK), labor (VL), materials (VM), energy, and
inventories for 20,493 establishments that were sampled in the
Annual Survey of Manufactures for the years 1972-1985.                 Price

deflators were imported from 3 separate files:

     1)    Bureau of Industrial Economics Output Data Base

           This file contains deflatot5 for shipments, raw
           materials, work-in-process, and finished goods
           inventories, at the 4-digit SIC level for the years
           1972-1980. Subsequent to 1980, we used the National

           Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) output deflators,
           which are derived from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

      2)   Bureau of Industrial Economics Caita1 Stocks Data Base
           Includes data for the years 1972-1982 on the net stock

           of capital in constant (1972) dollars and the gross
           stock of capital in historical dollars at the 3/4 digit

           SIC level. For each industry, we evaluated the ratio
           of these two numbers for plant and equipment
           separately. As in Lichtenberg-Siegel (1987), these
            ratios were applied to the gross plant and gross
                                                                  29

          equipment figures to evaluate net "benchmark" estimates
          of plant and equipment in 1972. Using these estimates
          of the initial capital stock, along with industry
          estimates of the average rate of capital depreciation

          and plant-specific deflated capital expenditures, a
          "perpetual inventory" algorithm is used to generate
          estimates of the net stock of plant and equipment. The
          real net stock of capital is then defined as the sum of
          net plant and net equipment.29

     3)   NBER R&D and Productivity Project File
          The NBER has constructed materials and energy deflators
          at the 4-digit SIC level.

     The remainder of this section is devoted to an explanation
of how key economic measures of output, labor, capital, and

materials (including energy) were defined using current dollar
values of inputs and output, and industry deflators (3 or 4 digit
SIC level) for the years 1972-1985.

Output:

     Output in current dollars is defined as the value of

shipments, with adjustments for the net (annual) change in
finished goods and work-in-process inventories.    Real output is

computed by dividing each term by its corresponding industry
price deflator.


     29The BIE data set has not been updated beyond 1982. As a
result, two-digit industry deflators for producers' durable plant
and equipment were used in later years (see March 1987 Survey of
Current Business).
                                                                    30


L ab
       Current dollar labor input is measured as the sum of

salaries and wages and total supplemental labor costs. Real
labor input is defined as the ratio of total salaries and wages

(TSW) to production worker wages (PWW), multiplied by total
production worker hours (PWH).

       (3)   L — (TSW ÷ PWW) •   PWH


This "production worker equivalent" measure of labor input (data

on hours of work of nonproduction workers is unavailable) is
based on the assumption that the relative wages of production and
nonproduction workers are equal to their marginal productivity.

Capital:
       Nominal capital is constructed using the assumption of

constant returns to scale. We define current dollar capital as
 current dollar output minus the current dollar costs of materials

 (including energy) and labor, plus an adjustment for the net

 change in materials inventories. Our construction of the real
 net stock of plant and equipment, based on a perpetual inventory
 algorithm, was discussed on the previous page.

 'taterials and Energy:
        The current dollar values of materials (including energy)    i
 defined as cost of materials (CM) ,   plus   an adjustment for the net

 change in materials inventories. Constant dollar values of
 materials (including energy) are evaluated by dividing current

 dollar values of materials and energy by the NBER 4-digit SIC

 price deflators for materials and energy.
                                                                               31

        We also compute factor shares, which are used in

constructing growth rates of TFP. Using the methodology employed
in Griliches-Lichtenberg (1984) and in many other studies, we
calculate a Tornqvist index of three inputs:
                    IN                                   L
                           —    . 5(SL+SL 6 *
                                                         t-6


                           + .5(SK+S1(6) *


                           + .5(SM+SM6) *

            IN — Index of total input at time t

             it
                — Share of factor i in the total cost of output at
                     time t, factors i — K,L,M (including energy)
                —    Quantity        of factor i at time t (in real terms).

Our explicit formula for TFP growth is:
