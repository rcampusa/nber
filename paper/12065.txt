                                           ABSTRACT

The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Graduate Education Initiative (GEI) provided over $80 million
to 51 treatment departments in the humanities and related social sciences during the 1990s to
improve their PhD programs. Using survey data collected from students who entered the treatment
and 50 control departments during a 15 year period that spanned the start of the GEI, we use factor
analysis to group multiple aspects of PhD programs into a smaller number of characteristics and then
estimate which aspects of PhD programs the GEI influenced and how these different aspects
influenced attrition and graduation probabilities. From these analyses, we identify the routes via
which the GEI influenced attrition and graduation rates and also indicate which aspects of PhD
programs departments should concentrate on if they want to improve their programs' performance.

   I.       Introduction

         The length of time it takes students to earn a doctorate in the humanities is longer than in

any of the other of arts and science and engineering fields (Hoffer et al. 2004, table 15). By the

late 1980s, median registered time-to-degree, the number of years between entry to graduate

school and receipt of the PhD, in the humanities had risen to approximately 9 years and doctoral

programs in the humanities were also characterized by high attrition; even in some of the most

highly regarded humanities programs in the nation, it was common for more than half of the

students who started PhD programs to leave without earning a doctorate (Bowen and Rudenstine

1992).

         To address these problems, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation launched a major new

program in 1991 called the Graduate Education Initiative (henceforth GEI). Its objective was “to

achieve systematic improvements in the structure and organization of PhD programs in the

humanities and the related social sciences that will in turn reduce unacceptably high rates of

student attrition and lower the number of years that the typical student spends working towards a

doctorate” (AWM Foundation 1991). The GEI was a unique intervention into graduate education

in that it focused on departments. Over a 10-year period (1991-2000), the Foundation provided a

total of over $80 million to 51 humanities and related social science departments at 10 major

universities. Each participating department committed to the goals of the program and developed

detailed strategies to achieve them.

         Annual data were collected on all PhD students that entered these departments’ PhD

programs during the 10 years prior to the implementation of the program and during the program

period. In addition to collecting information on background characteristics (test scores, gender,

race/ethnicity, citizenship, prior masters degree) of the entrants, information was collected on the




                                                   1
type of financial support that the student received each year he or she was enrolled in the PhD

program and his or her status each year (left the program, continued in the program, graduated

from the program). Similar data were collected for all students that entered a set of 50 “control”

departments’ PhD programs; some of these departments were at the ten universities in which

other departments were part of the GEI and some of these departments were at three other major

research universities in which no department received any funding from the GEI. These control

departments were not randomly assigned but rather were chosen after the GEI began.

         In previous research we have made use of the data reported by the departments to the

Mellon Foundation to estimate the impacts of the GEI on attrition rates, probabilities of

completion and times-to-degree using competing risk duration models and a difference-in-

difference approach (Groen, Condie, Jakubson, and Ehrenberg 2004).1 We concluded that the

GEI had a modest impact, reducing attrition rates and increasing completion probabilities at

treatment departments relative to control departments both by perhaps 2 to 4 percentage points,

and reducing mean time-to-degree by about .12 to .14 years. These analyses could not tell us,

however, whether these impacts were due to the financial support that the Mellon Foundation

provided to treatment departments or to changes that the departments made in their PhD

programs in response to the GEI.

         In this paper, we go inside the “black box” of graduate education to investigate what

characteristics of graduate programs in the humanities and related social sciences actually

influence PhD students’ attrition and graduation probabilities. We make use of data from the

Graduate Education Survey; a retrospective survey of all graduate students who entered PhD

the other (treatment or control) group, for which there were inaccuracies in data reporting, or that participated in the
GEI but started their participation later, or terminated it earlier, than other departments.

programs in the treatment and control departments during the 1982-1997 period that was

conducted by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. for the Mellon Foundation. After briefly

describing the survey in the next section, section III outlines our methodological approach.

Section IV presents our empirical findings and brief concluding remarks appear in section V.

While our focus is on evaluating the effects of the GEI, we believe the methodological approach

that we use can be profitably employed in a wide range of program evaluation studies.

    II.      The Graduate Education Survey

          The Graduate Education Survey (GES) was a retrospective survey conducted by

Mathematica Policy Research Inc. of all PhD students who had entered treatment and control

departments’ PhD programs during the 1982-1997 period.2 Between November 2002 and

October 2003, 18,671 individuals were surveyed and the GES achieved a rather remarkable

response rate of 74 percent, with 13,552 individuals responding. As might be expected, the

response rate was higher for individuals who completed their PhDs than individuals who did not

complete their PhDs and the response rates were lowest for the earliest entering cohorts of

students.

          The GES was designed to obtain respondents’ views about the nature of their graduate

programs and graduate departments, their experiences while in graduate school and their post

degree (or post drop out) labor market experiences. The first section of the GES asked students

questions about their entry to their graduate programs (including type of financial aid offer), their

departments’ academic expectations and requirements and the means by which these were

conveyed to them. The second section asked questions about their interactions with their

dissertation advisors and their department, the overall learning environment in the department,

(2004).


                                                        3
the time it took them to complete different phases of their programs and their publications, if

any, while in graduate school. The third section asked questions about their types of financial

support while in graduate school, and the relevance of this support to their doctoral study. The

fourth section solicited degree completion information and the following section solicited

demographic information, including marital status and the number of children in the

respondent’s family during his or her graduate study. A final section, whose data we will not use

in this paper, solicited information on their employment status at three points in time – six

months after degree completion or departure from their program, three years after that event, and

as of the survey date. A copy of the survey instrument and a detailed description of the

procedures followed during the survey are found in Kalb and Dwoyer (2004).

    III.      Methodological Framework

           Coupled with the data previously reported to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation by the

departments, the GES data provide an opportunity to analyze how the GEI impacted upon

characteristics of humanities and related social science doctoral program and how these

characteristics in turn influenced students’ probabilities of attrition from, and completion of, their

graduate programs. That is, it permits us to ascertain the routes via which the GEI influenced

PhD students’ attrition and completion probabilities.

           While individuals were asked numerous questions in the GES about the characteristics of

their PhD programs, it is impossible for us to enter each characteristic as a separate explanatory

variable in an analysis of the students’ transition probabilities for two reasons. First, if we tried to

do this, we would quickly exhaust degrees of freedom and would be confronted with severe

collinearity problems. Second, even though the response rate to the GES was 74 percent,

response rates on individual questions were often much lower. Many survey respondents failed




                                                   4
to respond to a number of questions about the characteristics of their programs, at least in part

because some questions were not relevant for respondents who had dropped out of the programs

prior to the dissertation stage.

          The strategy that we pursue to get around these problems in this paper is to compute the

average value of each program characteristic, for individuals who responded to that question, for

each entering cohort year/field/institution (for example students entering PhD study in English at

Cornell University in 1988) and to use these averages in factor analyses that combine all of these

characteristics into a smaller number of aggregated program characteristics.3 We then estimate

how the GEI influenced each of these aggregated characteristics and in turn how the

characteristics influenced students’ attrition and completion probabilities. From these two sets of

relationships, we can then estimate the routes via which the GEI influenced the PhD students’

attrition and completion probabilities.

    IV.      Empirical Analyses

          Table 1 reports the seven factors that we have chosen to summarize the characteristics of

humanities and associated social science doctoral programs: financial, seminar, exam

requirements, departmental culture, advising, clarity, and summer. Under each factor is the set of

specific variables that we use to construct the factor that are based on responses to questions

from the GES.

          For example, the financial factor is based upon respondents’ answers to questions about

the number of years of support offered to students at their time of program entry, the type of

financial support that they had during their dissertation year, whether they had fears of losing

funding during the writing of their dissertation and whether their progress toward the PhD was

3
 Appendix B provides an intuitive explanation of factor analysis and a discussion of the difference between it and
an alternative methodology, principle components analysis. Readers interested in more details can consult Lawley
and Maxwell (1971) or Joreskog and Sorbom (1979).


                                                         5
slowed by their being employed outside the department. The seminar factor is based upon

requirements students faced to attend courses or seminars during the academic year, which were

designed to move students more quickly through the program. The exam requirements factor was

based upon efforts to modify examinations to facilitate students’ transitions through the program.

       The department culture factor was based on variables reflecting the interest faculty took

in students’ work, faculty involvement in the intellectual life of the department, and whether

there was a sense of competitiveness or cooperation in the department. The advising factor was

based upon variables that reflected more desirable and higher quality advising, while the clarity

factor was based upon variables that related to departmental clarity with respect to requirements

and efforts to monitor student performance. Finally, the summer factor was based on summer

expectations set by the department to facilitate student progress through the program. In each

case, individual questions from the GES have been recoded so that higher values of a variable

indicate larger values for the factor.

       Table 2 presents our estimated factor equations for each factor. These were estimated

using the mean values of variables for each entering cohort year/field/institution for both

treatment and control departments. The factor loading coefficients can be thought of as the

regression coefficient that would emerge if we regressed the unknown factor on each of the

explanatory variables one at a time. So, for example, in the equation for the first factor, large

factor loadings are seen for the different numbers of years of financial support initially offered,

with less weight being placed on the remaining three variables. However, as the second column

indicates, many of these coefficients have large error variances (the uniqueness variable). The

factor scores found in the last column are the weights actually used to construct the factors; they

can be thought of as the regression coefficients that would emerge if we regress the unknown




                                                  6
factor on all of the variables (each in standard normal form) simultaneously. So, for example, the

most important variable in the financial factor proves to be whether the students were offered at

least two years of support when first admitted to the program, and the most important variable in

the exam factor is whether the exams students faced were tailored at least partially to their

individual research interests. Similarly, the most important variable in the seminar factor is

whether the students were required to attend a dissertation-writing seminar.

         Table 3 presents our estimates of the impact of the GEI on each of the factors, as well as

on two other variables we constructed from the survey data that summarize students’ beliefs

about their departments’ expectations about dissertations. The first variable (Publish) denotes the

fraction of respondents in the entering cohort year/field/institution that said that the department

stressed the importance to them of polishing their dissertations prior to submission, even if this

delayed completion of their degree, or of publishing while in graduate school, even if this

delayed completion of their degree. The second variable (Quick) denotes the fraction of

respondents in the entering cohort year/field/institution that said that the department stressed to

them the importance of finishing dissertations as quickly as possible. These two variables do not

add up to one (indeed typically their sum is less than one half) because students were given the

option of responding that their department did not indicate its attitude towards finishing the

dissertation or that the attitudes of different members of the department were inconsistent on this

issue.

         The underlying model used in the first panel of table 3 groups the data by entry cohort

year/field/institution and regresses each factor score on dichotomous variables for department

and institution, a dichotomous variable for whether the department is treatment or control

department, a dichotomous variable indicating whether the entering cohort is a pre-program




                                                  7
cohort or a cohort entering after the program was instituted, and the interaction of the latter two

variables. The coefficients of the last variable provide our estimates of the impact of the GEI on

each factor; essentially it is the difference-in-difference estimate. In order to measure longer-run

changes, students that began their PhD study between 1986 and 1990 are excluded from the

analysis, because while they entered graduate school before the GEI began in 1991, they were

eligible for financial support from the GEI starting in 1991.

       The estimates presented in panel 1, in which each observation is given equal weight,

suggest that the GEI’s primary effect on doctoral programs in these fields was felt through the

seminar, summer and clarity factors and through increased encouragement to finish dissertations

as quickly as possible; these were the only four variables for which the estimated effects were

statistically significant. The second panel in the table provides similar estimates when cohort size

is added as an additional explanatory variable to the underlying models. The addition of cohort

size does not significantly change the results. Panel 3 presents the estimates of the cohort size

variable in these models – decreasing cohort size is associated with higher values for the

financial factor, lower values for the seminar factor, and higher values for the departmental

culture and advising factors. We know from our prior research that one of the actions that

departments took in response to the GEI was to reduce cohort size (Groen et al. 2004).

       Entering cohort sizes, as well as the fraction of surveyed individuals that responded to the

GES, differed substantially across entering cohort years/fields/institutions in the sample. Hence

the numbers of individual observations from which the factor scores are calculated vary widely

across entering cohort years/fields/institutions and thus the variance of the factor scores varies

across observations. To control for this, we reestimated the regressions in table 3 (without the

cohort size variable included) weighting each observation by the average number of valid




                                                  8
responses to the survey that were used in the construction of the factor scores for each cohort

year/field/institution observation. These results are found in the fourth panel of table 3.

         The weighted results differ somewhat from the unweighted results. In particular, while

the GEI continues to appear to have led to a statistically significant improvement in the seminars,

summer requirements and clarity factors, it no longer is seen to be associated with a statistically

significant improvement in the expectation that dissertations would be completed as quickly as

possible. This suggests that the improvements in the latter variable that was attributed to the GEI

in the unweighted analyses (panel 1 of the table) occurred primarily in the smaller programs that

took part in the GEI. On the flip side, the weighted results show a larger estimated impact of the

GEI on the financial factor, which suggests that these improvements occurred primarily in larger

programs.4

         To estimate the impact of the different PhD program characteristics on attrition and

graduation probabilities, we use the individual level data collected by the treatment and control

departments and estimate multinomial logit models of the probability that an individual drops out




4
  One extension that we conducted warrants brief discussion. The adjustment described above for differences in
cohort size and differences in response rates across cohort year/field/institution observations may be inadequate. To
see why, consider the following example: Suppose an entering cohort year/field/institution observation had 20
students, that 10 of these students received PhDs, 5 were still enrolled in their PhD program, and 5 had dropped out.
Suppose also that only 10 members of the group responded to the GES. It is reasonable to assume that responses to
the survey questions may differ between students in the three groups; for example, completers may rate the
characteristics of the department’s PhD program more positively than people who have dropped out. Hence our
estimated average values of the factor scores for this entering cohort year/field/institution might well be very
different if the 10 respondents to the GES from the group were all completers than if the 10 respondents were all still
enrolled in the program or had dropped out.
To take account of this possible problem, we recalculated the factor scores for each entering cohort
year/field/institution group in a different manner. Instead of taking the averages for all GES respondents in the
group, we computed the averages for each subgroup (completers, continuers, and those who dropped out) and then
computed the overall average for the group as a weighted average of the subgroup averages, where the weights were
the shares of the entering cohort year/field/institution group that the department-provided data indicated were in
each of the three categories of students. We then reestimated the factor equations and the effect of the GEI on the
factor scores using these adjusted data. However, when we did this, the results we obtained were very similar to
those that appear in the first panel of table 3.


                                                          9
of a PhD program or graduates by the end of each year of enrollment in the program.5 The

explanatory variables included in these models are an individual’s gender, race/ethnicity,

citizenship, dichotomous variables for the field in which the student was studying, and

dichotomous variables for the institution in which the student is studying. In addition, for each

individual observation, we add in the estimated values of the seven program characteristics

factors and two departmental dissertation expectation variables for the entering

cohort/field/institution.

         The marginal effects for the program characteristics appear in table 4.6 We estimate

impacts on the cumulative probability of attrition for years 1 to 11 and on the cumulative

probability of graduation for years 4 to 11. The marginal effects reported in the table are

estimates of the impact of a one unit change in each variable on the probabilities of attrition or

graduation by each year.

         Turning first to attrition, improvements in the financial factor reduce the cumulative

probability of attrition in almost all years. The effect on the cumulative probability is largest in

the first three years, which implies that the largest effect is on early attrition.7 Having a program

with better advising and having a program whose requirements are clearer also reduces attrition

probabilities in many years. Finally, departmental expectations about the dissertation influence

attrition rates.

         Departments that emphasize the importance to students of polishing their dissertations

and/or getting things published while in graduate school (even if this delayed completion of the


5
  Because of the small number of students that complete their programs in years 1 to 3, we only estimate binary logit
attrition equations for those years.
6
  When we reestimated the models including cohort size as an additional explanatory variable, we obtained very
similar results.
7
  The primary variable that was important in the financial factor was offering entering students at least two years of
support (see table 2).


                                                         10
degree) have higher cumulative attrition rates than departments that do not convey clear

expectations about the dissertation to students. In contrast, departments that stress to students the

importance of finishing dissertations quickly have lower cumulative attrition rates, starting in the

early years of the program, than do departments who do not convey clear expectations about the

dissertation to students. Both of these “dissertation advice” variables begin to influence attrition

probabilities by year 2, which suggests that students’ views of departmental expectations about

dissertations affect early attrition.8 The growing magnitude of the Publish variable’s effect in the

later years implies that this variable also influences attrition during the dissertation stage of

programs.

         Turning next to graduation, improvement in the financial factor improves cumulative

graduation probabilities, starting in year 6. The advising factor is perhaps the most important

factor; when the advising factor improves, other factors held constant, the cumulative probability

of graduation increases in all years and the magnitude of this effect increases with time enrolled

in the program.

         The nature of dissertation expectations also proves important in influencing early

completion. Relative to the omitted category (not providing clear signals about dissertation

expectations), departments whose expectations are that their students will polish their

dissertations and/or that their students will publish while in graduate school (even if this delays

completion of their degrees) have significantly lower cumulative probabilities of graduation in


8
  We also estimated models in which the students’ dissertation advisors’ views about the nature of the dissertation
were included. When we did these, we found what appeared to be a perverse finding: students associated with
dissertation advisors who expected their students would polish their dissertations and/or publish while in graduate
school, even if these actions delayed completion of their degrees, had lower attrition rates during the early years of
their PhD programs. Upon reflection, we realized that this represented a problem of unobserved selection bias,
which can be explained best by reference to Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman. Heckman is known to
have extraordinarily high standards for his students’ dissertations and, for both supply and demand reasons, only the
very best students work with him. Hence the direction of causation most likely runs from top student to lower early
drop out rates; the advisor attitude variable is endogenous.


                                                         11
years 6 through 8, other variables held constant. Similarly, relative to the omitted category,

departments that stress to their students the importance of promptly finishing dissertations have

higher cumulative graduation probabilities starting in year 4, with the effect substantially higher

in years 6 through 10.

    V.       Concluding Remarks

         The results we presented in table 3 suggest that GEI program impacts were strongest on

the summer requirements, seminar and clarity of expectations factors, and also on the proportion

of individuals who said their department encouraged them to complete their dissertations as

quickly as possible. Taken together with the results presented in table 4, our findings suggest that

the GEI reduced attrition rates and improved graduation rates primarily through the routes of

improving clarity of expectations and encouraging students to finish their dissertations as quickly

as possible.9

         Gauging the impact of each of these changes on cumulative graduation and attrition rates

is important. For example, the estimated impact (table 3) of the GEI on the clarity factor was

.322 and the estimated impact of the clarity factor on the probability of attrition by the end of

year 7 (table 4) was -.013. An estimated impact of the effect of the GEI on attrition by year 7

working through the increase in program clarity is the product of these two numbers, or -.004.

Similarly, the estimated impact of the GEI on stressing the importance to students of finishing

9
  Treatment contamination is always a concern in analyses of program effects and the problem is potentially present
with the GEI also. There are three types of departments in our analyses: 1) departments that received funding from
the GEI, 2) departments that did not receive funding from the GEI but were located at universities in which some
other departments did receive GEI funding and 3) departments at universities in which no departments received
funding from the GEI. The behavior of departments in the second group may well have been influenced by what was
going on in departments in the first group and their universities may have provided them with additional resources to
compensate them for not receiving GEI resources. However, when we redid our analyses using only departments in
the third group as “control” departments our results were very similar to those reported in the text. Of course
changes that may have occurred at GEI departments to improve their graduate programs may have been known to
departments in the third group, which in turn may have caused them to make similar changes in their programs for
competitive reasons. Hence it is likely that our estimates are lower bound estimates of the effects of the GEI on
program characteristics.

their dissertations promptly was .073 (table 3) and the estimated impact of this variable on

graduating by year 8 was .084 (table 4). Thus the estimated impact of the GEI on the probability

of graduating by year 8 working through the increased encouragement to students to finish their

dissertations promptly is the product of these two numbers, or .006.

         While each of these effects may seem quite small, their magnitudes should be interpreted

in terms of our earlier analyses of the overall impact of the GEI on attrition and completion

probabilities. There we found that that the GEI reduced attrition rates and increased completion

probabilities at treatment departments relative to control departments by about .02 to .04 (Groen

et al. 2004). Hence the impact of the GEI on these PhD program characteristics “explains” a

substantial share of the overall effect of the GEI.10

         While the GEI appears to have had an impact on characteristics of graduate programs,

there remains substantial room for improvement. Table 5 ignores the distinction between

treatment and control departments and presents summary statistics for each of the factors and

dissertation advice variables for cohorts in our sample that entered after the start of the GEI

(1991-1996). The mean value of the clarity factor was .238 across entering cohorts/departments

during this period, the 25th percentile value was -.365 and the 75th percentile was .945. The

difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles is 1.310, which is more than four times our

estimated impact of the GEI on the clarity factor. So if one could improve the clarity factor for

departments down at the 25th percentile up the level of the clarity factor for departments at the

75th percentile, one could reduce attrition by year 7 in the former departments by about .02.

         Similarly, the mean value of the Quick variable was .248 in this period, but the 25th to

75th percentile range in this variable was .083 to .357, a difference of .274. This is over three


10
   Groen et al. (2004) also showed that the routes via which the GEI improved attrition and graduation probabilities
included reductions in entering cohort sizes and improvements in entering students’ GRE scores.

times the size of the estimated impact of the GEI on this variable. If one could move departments

down at the 25th percentile in terms of the Quick variable up to the 75th percentile, one could

increase the probability of students graduating by year 8 from the former departments also by

about .03.

        So an important message of this analysis is that the value of the GEI is considerably

greater than the impacts on attrition and graduation probabilities that we believe it caused. The

knowledge it has provided the academic community on which factors are associated with

attrition and graduation probabilities in humanities and related social science graduate programs

should provide a map for departments and graduate deans on how to improve their programs in

the future.

Finally, we should again stress that our estimates of the effects of the GEI on the various factors,

and hence on attrition and graduation rates, may well be only lower bound estimates of the true

effects of the program. To the extent that the “control” departments in our sample were aware of

the changes that the “treatment” departments were making in their programs and emulated the

behavior of the latter, our methodology will understate the GEI’s actual effects.

                               A Reader’s Guide to Factor Analysis

        The substantive problem we face in this paper is trying to determine the routes via which
the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation’s Graduate Education Initiative had effects on the attrition
rates and graduation rates of PhD students in the humanities and associated social sciences. The
Foundation’s Graduate Education Survey provides us with information on a large number of
variables that relate to the nature of the students’ graduate programs, including ones related to
financial support, seminar requirements, exam requirements, departmental culture, departmental
advising, clarity of requirements and expectations and summer support (table 1).

       These variables are, not surprisingly, both numerous and highly intercorrelated, so that
one cannot simply include 50 or so of them as explanatory variables in the outcome equations.
Therefore a method is needed to find lower dimensional combinations of the variables that
summarize the information they provide. The way we do this is described below.

        For ease of explanation, assume that there is just one aspect of the program we which to
capture, for example, financial generosity. We have a number of measures of this which are
highly intercorrelated. Adding all of them to the outcome equation would result in a collinearity
problem, which in turn would lead to estimates that are both imprecise and unstable.

       We could just choose a subset of the variables to include in the analysis. To do this would
discard all of the information in the unused variables and would lead to problems of omitted
variable bias. Moreover, it is not obvious how to choose the subset to keep. We instead use
information from all of the observed variables. Essentially, we find a (linear) combination of the
observed variables that represents our best estimate of the common component financial
generosity.

         Let’s start with an explicit example. Suppose that there are four observed characteristics
that reflect this common component. Let yit be the measured variable for individual i and
variable t. The index i reflects the number of observations and goes from 1 to N, while the index
t reflects the variables and goes from 1 to 4 in this example. Let ci be the underlying common
“factor” which we’ll think of as financial generosity, and suppose that the data were generated by
the following model:

      yi1 =   β1ci + εi1
(A.1) yi2 =   β2ci + εi2
      yi3 =   β3ci + εi3
      yi4 =   β4ci + εi4

         We assume that the εit’s have mean zero and are uncorrelated with one another and with
ci, though they may have different variances. (Those orthogonality conditions essentially define,
in a statistical sense, what ci is.) If the common factor ci were observable this would simply be a
system of regression equations. Since it is not observable we want to find a (linear) combination
of the observed yit’s that best predicts ci. That is, we want



                                                24
(A.2) E*(ci | yi) = γ’yi

where yi is the vector (yi1 , yi2 , ... yiT)’. One can show that the optimal set of weights is

(A.3)     γ = [V( y i )]−1 Cov( y i , c i )

       Thus, γ is a function of the underlying parameters of the model. If we knew those then we
would know γ. Because we don’t know them, we must use estimates of the parameters to form an
estimate of γ. However, because ci is not observable we cannot estimate the system of regression
equations implied by (A.1). Instead, the information about the parameters comes from the
variance matrix of the observed variables. Let

Var(ci) = ϕ2
Var(εit) = σt2
Cov(εit , εis) = 0 for t ≠s

  ⎡σ 2         0      0         0    ⎤
  ⎢ 1                                ⎥
              σ 22
Σ=⎢                                  ⎥ = V (ε )
     0                0         0
  ⎢0           0     σ 32       0    ⎥       i
  ⎢                                  ⎥
  ⎢⎣ 0         0         0     σ 24 ⎥⎦

β = (β1 , β 2 , β 3 , β 4 )′

         Because ci is not observed we need to set scale by normalizing one parameter. The
tradition in psychology is to normalize ϕ2 = 1. An equivalent, and easier to explain,
normalization is to set β1 =1 , that is, we measure the β’s for the other variables relative to that of
the first variable. Given the latter normalization, the variance matrix for the observed yi is

                   ⎡ϕ 2 + σ 2                 β2ϕ2             β3ϕ 2             β4ϕ2          ⎤

where we’ve just filled in the upper triangle of the matrix since it is symmetric. We can now
solve for the parameters as functions of the elements of the variance matrix:

          β 2 = ω 23 / ω13
          ϕ 2 = ω12 / β 2
          β 3 = ω13 / ϕ 2
          β 4 = ω14 / ϕ 2


                                                                25
           σ12 = ω11 − ϕ 2
           σ 22 = ω22 − β 22 ϕ 2
           σ 32 = ω33 − β 32 ϕ 2
           σ 24 = ω 44 − β 24 ϕ 2

and we’ve solved for all of the parameters. The linear combination of the data that we want (i.e.,
γ) is just

γ = [V( y i )]−1 Cov( y i , c i ) = ( ββ′ϕ 2 + Σ) −1 )(βϕ 2 )

Note that there are multiple estimates of some parameters. For example,

          β 2 = ω 23 / ω13 = ω 24 / ω14

The statistical method provides for the optimal average of these multiple estimates in cases like
this.

       We use the sample analogs of the quantities above to form the estimators. Using the
sample variance matrix

          1      N
Ω
ˆ =              ∑ ( y i − y)( y i − y)′
       ( N − 1) i =1

we have

βˆ 2 = ω
       ˆ 23 / ω
              ˆ 13 and so on. We use these estimates to form


γˆ = ( βˆ βˆ ′ϕˆ 2 + Σˆ ) −1 )(βˆ ϕˆ 2 )

        This is the factor score regression, that is, the linear combination that is the predicted
value of the underlying common factor c given the observed data y. Multiplying the data by
these weights gives us a value for financial generosity which we can use as an explanatory
variable in an outcomes analysis.

     In our problem we have a number of different factors of interest (financial generosity,
summers, etc.). We create the factors in three steps:

Step 1: Identify those variables which we think reflect the same underlying factor. For example,
we take the set of variables which reflect financial aid, recode them so that a higher value means
more generous, and use them in the analysis.




                                                        26
Step 2: Compute the average value of each variable, for individuals who respond to the
underlying question, for each group defined by entering cohort year/field/institution.

Step 3: Do the factor analysis to find the factor score regression defined above.

        We then repeat those steps for each of the factors.

        It is important to realize the difference between our approach and an alternative approach
that would use principal components analysis. Principal components is a way to find linear
combinations of the data which “account for” the largest amount of the total variation, not the
common variation. The weights in the first principal component are the eigenvector
corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of Ω. This will sometimes give similar answers to the
factor analysis, but other times can give very different answers.

Consider the following example:

Var(ci) = 1
yi1 = (1) ci + εi1     Var(εi1) = .05
yi2 = (1) ci + εi2     Var(εi2) = 10.0
yi3 = (2) ci + εi3     Var(εi3) = .05
yi4 = (.1) ci + εi4    Var(εi4) = 5.0

y1 is the base case. y2 has the same mean relationship but is extremely noisy. y3 has the same
disturbance variance as y1 but a stronger mean relationship, and y4 has a weaker mean
relationship than y1 and is noisier, though not as noisy as y2. For these values we have

   ⎡1.05 1   2    .1 ⎤
   ⎢     11 2     .1 ⎥⎥
Ω= ⎢
   ⎢        4.05 .2 ⎥
   ⎢                  ⎥
   ⎣             5.01⎦

The eigenvectors are the columns of the following matrix

⎡ .8944   .4131   .0963        .1419⎤
⎢ 0      − .3029 − .0972       .9480⎥⎥
⎢
⎢− .4472 .8261    .1925        .2837⎥
⎢                                    ⎥
⎣ 0      − .2349 .9717         .0246⎦

with the corresponding eigenvalues of

(.05   4.26 5.05 11.75)




                                                27
so that the last column of the matrix contains the weights for the first principle component. Note
that the weight on y2 is very large, more than six times larger than the weight on y1.

        In contrast, the pattern of weights from the factor analysis is very different. We have,
using the formula above

γ = (.1978, .0010, .3950, .0002)

and then normalizing them so that they have unit length, like the principal component, yields
weights of

γ* = (.4472 , .0022 , .8944 , .0004)’

        We see that the factor analysis puts higher weight on variables with small error variances
and strong relationships to the common factor, that is, it “rewards” the variables that reflect the
common components of variation rather than idiosyncratic components.
