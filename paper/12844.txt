                                               ABSTRACT

This paper develops an original measure of learning in higher education, based on grades in subsequent
courses. Using this measure of learning, this paper shows that student evaluations are positively related
to current grades but unrelated to learning once current grades are controlled. It offers evidence that
the weak relationship between learning and student evaluations arises, in part, because students are
unaware of how much they have learned in a course. The paper concludes with a discussion of easily-implemented,
optimal methods for evaluating teaching.

I. Introduction and Background

         Given the difficulties associated with accurate assessments of teaching effectiveness,

student evaluations traditionally have been the primary, if not the only, means of assessing

teaching in higher education.1 With the Miller Commission’s focus on accountability in higher

education, evaluation methods are receiving increasing public attention (United States

Department of Education [2006]; Golden [2006]). While assessment is never easy, the wide-

range of subjects taught makes assessment in higher education particularly difficult.

         This paper develops a procedure for optimally assessing instructor quality that is easily

implemented. This procedure applies basic regression techniques to data that are already

available in machine-readable form at most or all institutions. It is based on a unique measure of

the learning acquired in a section of a course based on the grades that the students in that section

receive in subsequent courses in the same subject (adjusting for student characteristics). The

availability of a learning measure allows us to investigate how students reward instructors for

learning as well as for the grades the receive in their current course.

         Economists and educational psychologists both have studied how grades and learning are

related to student evaluations of teaching but in a way that prevents one from inferring whether

students reward higher grades, more learning, or both. Instructors are expected to give higher

grades to better performing students, making it necessary to control for both grades and learning

when assessing the determinants of student evaluations. Surprisingly, we are unaware of studies

that have considered both factors together. While the existing literature has not convincingly

demonstrated that students reward learning and not grading leniency, even without these issues,

student evaluations generate an incentive for instructors to inflate grades and almost surely place

too little weight on learning.

         There is a substantial literature on evaluations of teaching in educational psychology,



1
 White (1995) reports that U.S. economics departments predominantly use SET’s to measure teaching
effectiveness. He notes that there appears to be strong reluctance to rely on direct observation of teaching,
particularly among research-oriented departments.
                                                          1
comprising thousands of items (Feldman [1997]). Fortunately there are a number of large-scale

literature reviews. This literature focuses on the relationship between student evaluations and

various measures of learning and generally finds a strong relationship. The most persuasive

evidence for a link between learning and evaluations comes from multi-section courses with

common syllabi and exams (Cohen [1981]; Dowell and Neal [1982]; Marsh [1984, 1987, 2006];

Abrami, d’Apollonia, and Rosenfield [1997]; Feldman [1997]; and Theall and Feldman [2006]).

The lack of instructor discretion in these courses raises questions about the extent to which these

results will generalize to other courses. More importantly, this design is not suitable for

determining how grades and learning separately affect evaluations because there is little if any

variation in grades conditional on learning. Ironically, discussions with our students suggest that

they often estimate how much they have learned in a course from the grade that they expect to

receive.2 If so, in multi-section classes, students’ estimates of their learning will be highly

correlated with their grades. The literature has noted that estimates of the effect of learning on

student evaluations may be biased by grades. Because the multi-section design makes it virtually

impossible to estimate the effect of grades and learning separately, educational psychologists

have generally relied on indirect methods to address the effect of grading leniency (see, for

example, Greenwald and Gillmore [1997]).3

        The literature on the economics of education is less sanguine about the relationship

between learning and evaluations. It has focused on how grades affect evaluations, providing

evidence that high grades raise student evaluations and argued that the use of evaluations may

lead to grade inflation.4 Results from empirical work linking expected grades to evaluations are

  This view was expressed at a presentation of this work at our Undergraduate Economics Society at our university
at which approximately 30 students were in attendance.

  In the economics literature Sheets, Topping, and Hoftyzer [1995] employ a multi-section approach. Shmanske
[1988] uses grades in a subsequent course in a two-course sequence, which is related to our approach but much less
widely applicable. Neither study includes current grades.
4
  Becker and Watts (1999) criticize economics departments for “following the herd” in their uncritical use of SET
measures and not applying the same rigor they require of published research to the use and understanding of
teaching-quality survey instruments to evaluate the performance of their faculty. Kanagaretnam, Mathieu, and
Thevaranjan (2003) cite several articles from the Chronicle of Higher Education dealing with the topic of the
impact of SET’s on student learning and grade inflation. McKenzie (1975) develops a simple model of consumer
                                                        2
mixed.5 This paper departs from this work in two ways. First, it uses actual course grades rather

than expected grades. While students generally do not receive grades until after completing their

evaluations, we prefer to use actual grades because expected grades are likely to be quite noisy

and students have some idea of what grades they may receive based on midterm results,

homework scores, and other objective information on their course performance as well as

possible signals from the instructor. Second, unlike most of the literature, this paper measures

grades using the average grade in a section rather than individual-level grades. In an individual-

level regression, most of the variation in grades arises from individual differences in grades

within a section. Therefore, the individual-level relationship between grades and evaluations

indicates whether students who are at the top of a given section give higher evaluations than

those at the bottom of that section, not whether instructors who grade more leniently receive

higher evaluations. Third, as indicated above, this paper is also the first to study how grades and

learning are jointly related to evaluations.

         We use our analysis of the determinants of student evaluations to suggest improved

methods for evaluating instructors. Educational psychologists have argued that if there is little

effect of grades on evaluations but there is a strong relationship between grades and learning,

one would not want to adjust student evaluations for grades (Greenwood and Gillmore [1997]).

If evaluations were affected by grades, however, it would be advisable to adjust evaluations for

grades, provided that one can condition on learning. Such an adjustment would reduce instructor

incentives to inflate grades and remove a source of bias in evaluations.

         There are two additional factors that arise when relying on student evaluations. First

student evaluations depend on students’ assessment and valuation of how much they have



choice in which the use of SET’s by academic institutions provide an incentive for instructors to alter the grade-
effort tradeoff that students face to make it easier (less costly in terms of effort) to earn higher grades. This
contributes to grade inflation and adversely affects the institution’s ability to distinguish good and bad students. A
search of the Chronicle’s table of contents for the key words “student evaluation” yields 22 articles and notes for
the year 2005 (through the end of October). A search for both “student evaluation” and “grade inflation” yields six
letters and articles between 1998 and 2005, for example, Benton (2004).
5
  Nichols and Soper [1972]; Krautmann and Sander [1999]; Boex [2000]; and Kelley [1971] report a positive
relationship between expected grades and evaluations, while DeCanio [1986] and Nelson and Lynch [1984]; and
                                                          3
learned in a course. Below, we provide evidence that student evaluators may not be well

positioned to make that determination accurately. Even if students accurately assess their

learning, they may place less weight than universities do on learning relative to the course

experience. For example, society and parents may place higher weight on human capital

production and less weight on the course experience than students do because students discount

at a high rate or because human capital generates externalities for society. In either case, relying

solely on student evaluations will distort instructors’ incentives away from the social optimum.

        This paper fits into an emerging literature on the determinants of outcomes in higher

education (see Bettinger and Long [2004]; Beddard and Kuhn [2005]; and Hoffmann and

Oreopoulos [2006]). It also relates to a large literature in the economics of education on the

determinants of student outcomes in primary and secondary education.

        Our data cover nearly fifty thousand enrollments in almost four hundred offerings of

principles of microeconomics, principles of macroeconomics, and intermediate microeconomics

over a decade at The Ohio State University.6 In addition to information on student evaluations,

the data contain all grades that students received in subsequent economics courses and rich

information on student background, including race, gender, ethnicity, high school class rank and

SAT and/or ACT scores. These data can be used to regression-adjust grades and our learning

measure. The data show a strong positive relationship between student evaluations and both

current grades and learning when these variables are included separately, but when these

variables are included in the same model, the current grade is related to student evaluations but

learning is not. There are many potential explanations for these results, including a variety of

selection arguments. We devote considerable effort to five of them, concluding that, on average,

students are not aware of how much they have learned in a class. There are no reasons to believe

that the focus on current grades and uncertainty about learning is specific to economics or the



Bosshardt and Watts [2001] report weak, negative, or mixed results.
6
  These courses were chosen because they are standard, they enroll the most students, and more of the students in
these classes take additional economics classes. These were the only classes for which data were collected or
analyzed.

institution studied and therefore our results are expected to generalize, at least qualitatively.

        The availability of a measure of learning and the checks that we run on it entail a number

of analyses that are of interest in their own right. For example, we also consider how instructor

characteristics are related to measures of the quality of teaching. In some cases, female and

foreign-born instructors receive lower student evaluations than male and US-born instructors.

Learning, however, is not systematically related to instructor gender or national origin, nor are

there systematic differences in evaluations or student learning between non-tenure track faculty

and tenure track faculty. This finding is noteworthy in light of Ehrenberg’s (2004) observation

that little is known about the effect of part-time and non tenure-track faculty on student learning

and other measures of academic production. While we do not find that observable instructor

characteristics are related to learning, we do find large variations across instructors in learning

performance. This result is consistent with evidence from primary and secondary education (See

Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain [2005]).

        We also investigate whether students in sections that rate their instructors more highly

are more likely to take additional classes, a revealed-preference measure of quality (see

Hoffmann and Oreopoulos [2006]). We find that student evaluations of teaching are unrelated to

the number of subsequent economics classes that students take, further eroding our confidence in

student evaluations.7

II. Data

        The data set includes students who took principles of microeconomics, principles of

macroeconomics or intermediate microeconomics at The Ohio State University between 1995

and 2004, and contains identifiers for the sections the students took, student demographic

characteristics, and grades in all economics courses taken during this period. They also contain

rich background information on students, including race, gender, ethnicity, high school class



7
 Two obvious additional measures are drop rates and wait lists. Wait lists are uncommon in these courses and the
measure of drop rates includes students who dropped before the beginning of the class as well as those who dropped
once the course began.
                                                        5
rank and SAT and/or ACT scores that can be used to regression-adjust grades and our learning

measure. In the regressions, ACT scores are included for students for whom we have them and

SAT scores are included for students for whom we do not have ACT scores (because ACT

scores are available for more students). The estimates include a dummy variable for which score

is included. We obtained data on all subsequent economics courses taken by these students

through the end of academic year 2004. Student evaluations are anonymous and are available at

the section-level but not at the student-level. Thus, we estimate the relationship between grades

and evaluations at the section level rather than at the individual level, which is appropriate, as

discussed above.

       The evaluation instruments contain ten items, including an overall score, which is the

principal measure of student evaluation used in this study. Other questions include measures of

perceived learning, preparation and organization, the instructor’s attitude, and the extent to

which the course stimulated students to think.

       Table 1 shows the variable definitions and their means and standard deviations for the

three sets of courses. The data set comprises 190 sections (with 26,666 students) in principles of

microeconomics; 119 sections (with 14,729 students) in principles of macroeconomics; and 86

sections (with 4,111 students) in intermediate microeconomics. The average evaluation score

ranges from 3.72 (standard deviation of .54) for principles of macroeconomics to 3.86 (standard

deviation of .44) for principles of microeconomics on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). The

average course grade is close to 2.7 on a four-point scale (with a standard deviation of about .3),

a B-, for all three courses. The table shows the distribution of instructor and student

characteristics for the three courses.

III. Estimation

       We employ a three-step strategy to estimate grades and learning and their relationship to

student evaluations: (i) we first estimate grades (ii) then we estimate the amount of learning in

each section based on grades in subsequent sections; (iii) finally we use these learning estimates

to assess how grades and learning are related to evaluations. In addition, we analyze these

                                                  6
learning measures since they are of interest in their own right.

          This section describes the procedure step-by-step in terms of principles of

microeconomics, including how individual-level data on current and subsequent grades are

collapsed to the section-level to be merged into section-level evaluations. Similar procedures

were used for principles of macroeconomics and intermediate macroeconomics.

Step 1. Estimating Grades

          Let i index students and s index the base section (i.e. the particular section of principles

of microeconomics that the student took). Let g is denote the grade received by student i who

took base section s. In the first step, g is is regressed on a vector of base section dummy
          v                                                                      v
variables Dis and the student’s characteristics at the time of the base section, X is . The

specification is
                                       v v         v v
                                g is = X is′ β 1 + Dis′ ψ + ε 1is      (1)

The coefficient ψ s on the dummy variable for base section s gives the mean grade in the section

adjusting for individual characteristics. These coefficients are used in the third stage to represent

grades.

Step 2. Estimating Learning

          Grades in subsequent courses are used to measure learning. Let j index sections of

subsequent economics courses, so that g isj denotes the grade of student i, who took base section

s, in subsequent section j. Grades in subsequent courses, g isj , are regressed on a vector of

dummy variables for the subsequent section (to control for differences in grading across classes),
 v                                                        v                                   v
Z isj ; a vector of dummy variables for the base section, Disj ; and student characteristics, X isj , at

the time of section j. Formally,
                                    v v       v v v v
                                      ′ β 2 + Z isj
                            g isj = X isj              ′ θ + ε 2isj
                                                ′ Γ + Disj                   (2)

The coefficient θ s on the dummy variable for students who took base section s indicates how

well these students do in later courses adjusting for their characteristics. This coefficient is our

                                                          7
measure of learning, or human capital produced in section s. The θ s we estimate in this stage are

used in our third step to control for learning produced in the section and the estimates are of

interest in their own right.

Step 3. Evaluating Student Evaluations

        Having estimated ψ s , the grades in base section s and θ s , the learning in base section s,

we now regress the student evaluations for base section s, e s , on learning, grades, and instructor
                             v
and section characteristics, Ws :
                                                       v v
                                e s = θ sφl + ψ sφ g + Ws′ρ + ε 3 s .   (3)

        The coefficient φl indicates how much students value learning (net of any costs of

learning) and the coefficient φ g , how much students value high grades when evaluating the
                                   v
instructor. The coefficient vector ρ tells how observable instructor and section characteristics

are related to evaluations.

Additional Analyses

        Once we obtain a measure of learning, we can estimate a variety of related effects. We

investigate the effect of instructor characteristics such as gender, native language, tenure track

status, or whether or not the instructor is a graduate teaching associate, on learning by

estimating,
                               r v
                     θ s = Ws ' β 3 + u s .                                   (4.1)

As above, Ws would represent the characteristics of section s, including those of the instructor.

        We also assess how instructor characteristics are associated with grading leniency, by

estimating,
                               v v
                     ψ s = Ws ' β 4 + θ s γ + ξ s .                           (4.2)

One could estimate this model with or without θ s as a control for the effect of human capital.

IV. Findings

Validity of the Learning Measure

        We begin by validating the learning measure. The most obvious concern is that it is noisy

because of sampling error. To address this possibility, we estimate the share of the variance in

the estimate of learning in each section that is due to learning in the section as opposed to

sampling error. To do this, we split each class into two equally-sized halves and calculate the

covariance between learning in each half. Intuitively, the idiosyncratic components of learning

in each half of the course will be unrelated to each other, and the covariance between them will

give the variance in learning in the section as a whole. We now discuss the formal procedure.

        Let θ sj = μ s + ε sj denote the estimate of learning for portion j ∈ {1,2} of section s, which

equals the learning in section s, μ s , plus sampling error in portion j of the section, ε sj . We

estimate the covariance between the two randomly assigned halves of each section,

             Cov(θ s1 ,θ s 2 ) = Cov(μ s1 , μ s 2 ) + Cov(μ s1 ,ε s 2 ) + Cov(ε s1 , μ s 2 ) + Cov(ε s1 ,ε s 2 ) .

The terms involving the sampling errors, ε sj drop out because they are orthogonal to the other

components by construction, and the covariance between the μ s gives its variance. Formally,

Cov(θ s1 ,θ s 2 ) 2 = Var (μ s ) 2 . This measure gives the standard deviation in learning across sections
              1              1




because it represents the variation in learning for students who took a particular section in the

absence of any sampling error. We also calculate the share of our learning measure that

represents learning as opposed to sampling error by calculating

                                       Cov(θ s1 ,θ s 2 )        Var (μ s )
                                                         =                         .
                                         Var (θ s )        Var (μ s ) + Var (ε s )

Here ε s denotes sampling error in the entire section.

        Second, in regression (2), where we generate our learning measure by relating future

grades to future section dummy variables and base-section dummy variables, we test for the

statistical significance of the base-section dummy variables (vector θ ) which measure base-

section learning. Third, we regress the base-section dummy variables from (2) on instructor
                                                              9
dummy variables. The second-stage model is given by

                                            θ s = φI s + u s ,

where Is denotes a vector of dummy variables for the instructors teaching the base section. It

seems reasonable to assume that learning varies across sections and across instructors. Under

this assumption, section dummy variables and instructor dummy variables are expected to be

statistically significantly related to the learning measure (i.e., future grades).

        Table 2 reports results for the three courses. As shown in the top panel, there is

substantial variation in learning across sections – the standard deviations range between .15 and

.2 grade points. These differences imply that moving a student from a section with the mean

level of learning to one with learning one standard deviation above the mean would raise his

grades in all future economics classes from, say from a B- to more than half way to a B.

Moreover, between 46% and 83% of the variance across base sections in the learning measure is

due to learning at the section as opposed to noise, so our estimates of learning are quite precise.

In other words, while (unobserved) individual factors such as motivation and ability account for

the majority of the variation in future grades across students, only a minority (54% to 17%) of

the variation in future grades across base sections is due to noise from sampling and the vast

majority (46% and 83%) is signal.

        When we estimate (5), including controls for section characteristics, F-tests for the joint

significance of the base-section dummy variables soundly reject the null hypothesis that base-

section grades are not important determinants of learning. For all three courses, the P-values are

less than .0001.

        As shown in the lower panel, more than half of the section-learning effects for principles

of macroeconomics are due to instructor effects. Instructors account for 44% of the variation in

the section-learning effects for intermediate microeconomics and 39% for principles of

microeconomics. The null hypothesis of no instructor effects is also rejected with a P-value less

than .0001 for macro-principles and with P-values of .01 for micro-principles and .1 for

intermediate microeconomics. While much of the variation across sections is due to fixed

                                                   10
instructor effects, there is still considerable variation within instructors (due to variations in the

rate of learning by doing or deterioration and idiosyncratic factors). For this reason, we focus on

section-level (rather than instructor-level) estimates of learning for most of the analyses.

         These results indicate that although they contain some sampling error, grades in future

courses are a valuable measure of learning in base-sections. The substantial variations in

learning across sections and the strong effect of instructors on learning are also noteworthy and

indicate the importance of evaluating instructors based on the learning that they produce.

Principles of Microeconomics

         This section reports estimation results for equation (3). We begin with results for

principles of microeconomics, and then discuss the results for principles of macroeconomics and

intermediate microeconomics. We then turn to alternative explanations of our results, including

those based on selection issues, and conclude with some additional analyses. These estimates

and others like them include instructor random effects.

         The first column of table 3 reports a regression of student evaluations on the current

course grade. We find that students in sections with higher grades rate their courses more highly

than those in other sections. Column 2 reports a regression with only the learning measure,

which is also found to be positively associated with evaluations though with a smaller coefficient

than current grades. When both current grades and learning are included in the same regression

(column 3), the effect of the current grade dominates, and the coefficient on learning is small and

insignificant.8 We remind the reader that both current grades and the learning measure are

regression adjusted for observable student characteristics.

         The remaining columns examine a variety of other potential determinants of student

evaluations. First, we include a set of instructor characteristics without controlling for grades or

learning (column 4). Female instructors receive lower evaluations than men, as do foreign-born


8
 If learning is multi-dimensional, grades in the current course may capture learning of material that is valuable
outside of future courses, including skills as an economic actor or a citizen. By measuring learning using grades in
future classes, the present analysis will not capture these other dimensions of learning. An alternative explanation
for the strong relationship between evaluations and current grades is that teachers who expect to receive bad
                                                         11
instructors, although these differences are not statistically significant in all specifications. There

are no discernable differences in evaluations between non-tenure track lecturers, graduate

teaching associates, and tenure-track faculty.

         Differences in grading practices and learning may be responsible for the gender gap in

evaluations as well as the substantial (but statistically insignificant) foreign-domestic gap. To

explore this possibility, column (5) includes both current grades and learning along with

instructor characteristics. Inclusion of these variables increases the gender and foreign-domestic

gaps in evaluations slightly. The above evidence suggests that students rate women and perhaps

foreign instructors less favorably than others, possibly reflecting distaste/disrespect for such

instructors or unmeasured differences in the course experience like language ability or teaching

style.

         The regression in column (6) includes section characteristics; column (8) reports

estimates with all of these variables, year dummy variables, and the response rate for the

evaluations in the section. In both regressions, the coefficient on the current course grade is

significant and similar in magnitude. To summarize other statistically significant findings,

column (6) shows that students in honors and evening sections give higher evaluations than other

students (i.e. those in non-honors, daytime sections). Column (7) shows that the coefficients for

honors and night classes as well as for female instructors all are significant after fully controlling

for the available variables. The foreign effect remains large, but insignificant.

         The estimates in Table 3 consistently show a statistically significant effect of the current

course grade. Indeed, the coefficient becomes larger as more variables are controlled.

According to column (8), a one standard-deviation change in the current course grade is

associated with a large increase in evaluations – over a quarter of the standard deviation in

evaluations. Once current grades are controlled, learning, as measured by future grades, is not

statistically significantly related to evaluations in any of the regressions.

         Our use of the actual current course grade as a measure of the expected grade in the


evaluations penalize their classes with harder exams or a harder curve.
                                                         12
course deserves some discussion. As noted already, students likely have some idea of what

grades they will receive based on formal or informal feedback received during the quarter.

Alternatively, students may form expectations of their course grade based on the reputation the

instructor’s grading in previous offerings of the course. We examine this last possibility by

including in the regression the lagged grade – the mean grade in the last offering of the course by

the instructor – along with the current grade. Column (8) presents results without the lagged

grade for the sample for which the lagged grade is available. Including the lagged grade, in

column (9) does not change the estimated coefficient of the current course grade or learning, and

the coefficient for the lagged grade is itself small and statistically insignificant. It appears that

students base their evaluations on indications provided by the professor about the current course

rather than on the professor’s reputation (at least based on recent offerings of the course).

Individual Evaluation Items

        We use ten evaluative items, nine focusing on specific aspects of the course experience as

well as the overall score, which has been the focus of the analysis thus far. Estimates for these

individual items (not reported here, but available upon request) are quite similar to those for the

overall evaluation measure. The current course grade is always associated with higher

evaluations and the relationship is statistically significant at the 5% level in eight of the ten

cases. None of the evaluation items are statistically significantly related to learning.

        One item directly measures learning, asking students whether they, “Learned greatly

from instructor?” It is noteworthy that this measure is no more closely related to our learning

measure based on future grades than any of the other items. This finding suggests that students

are not able to evaluate the amount they learn in a course or that they base their estimates on the

grades that they expect to receive.

Principles of Macroeconomics and Intermediate Microeconomics

        This section reports results for principles of macroeconomics and intermediate

microeconomics as a check. There are only 60 percent as many macro-principles sections as

there are micro-principles sections and fewer of the students in macro-principles take subsequent

                                                  13
classes. Similarly, there are fewer intermediate economics sections than micro-principles (less

than half as many) or macro-principles (three quarters as many) and fewer students take later

classes making the estimates noisier.9 Thus, both sets of estimates will be more noisy than those

for principles of microeconomics.

         The results, which are reported in Appendix Table 1 in the same order as those for

principles of microeconomics, are generally consistent with those for principles of

microeconomics. For both principles of macroeconomics and intermediate microeconomics,

grades in the current course are strongly related to student evaluations for later courses. In fact,

the estimates are, if anything, stronger, than those for micro-principles. Learning is unrelated to

evaluations once current grades are controlled. Again women and foreign born instructors tend to

receive lower evaluations than men and domestic instructors, but these differences are not

consistently statistically significant. Results, not reported here but available upon request, for

individual evaluations items also show a strong relationship with current course grades but not

learning.

Robustness

         This section explores two robustness checks. One possibility is that learning in principles

of microeconomics may be better captured by performance in other microeconomics classes. To

explore this possibility we have estimated learning using grades in intermediate microeconomics

only. The estimates are reported in the top panel of Table 4 and are similar to the previous

estimates, with a strong positive relationship between current grades and student evaluations and

a weak relationship between learning and student evaluations.

         Because we are often interested in the effectiveness of particular instructors, we have also

re-estimated our models using instructor-level data. To do this, we estimate the weighted mean

of student evaluations and of our measures of grades and learning for each section taught by an


9
 While micro-principles is not a prerequisite for macro-principles, almost all students take micro-principles before
macro-principles, so that almost all of the grades in the macro-principles classes are available to estimate learning
for micro-principles, while for macro-principles, learning can only be estimated for students who take a third
economics course. Similarly, many business majors require intermediate microeconomics, but no additional classes.
                                                         14
instructor estimated in equations (1) and (2). In these calculations, each section was weighted by

the number of students in that section. Equation (3) is then estimated at the instructor level with

these instructor-level means as the independent and dependent variables10. (In the specifications

that include section and instructor characteristics, the means of those variables are included.)

These estimates, reported in the bottom panel of the table, show somewhat higher estimates of

current grades than the section-level estimates, but the coefficient learning is small and

statistically insignificant.

Summary

           The highlights of what we found so far are:

       1. There is a consistent positive relationship between grades in the current course and

           evaluations. This finding is robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls and

           specifications.

       2. There is no evidence of association between learning and evaluations controlling for

           current course grades.

       3. Learning is no more related to student evaluations of the amount learned in the course

           than it is to student evaluations of other aspects of the course.

       4. In some cases women and foreign-born instructors receive lower evaluations than other

           instructors, all else equal.

V. Alternative Explanations

           Through the various checks reported in Table 2, we feel confident that our measure of

learning is valid. Our findings show that student evaluations are strongly related to grades and

that learning, as measured by future grades, is unrelated to student evaluations once grades have

been controlled. The obvious explanation for these findings is that grading leniency is an

important determinant of evaluations and that students do not reward instructors who generate

learning per se. There are, however, five other explanations that come to mind and this section



10
     We do not include the lagged evaluation because it is ill-defined when these regressions are run for instructors as
                                                            15
investigates them and shows that they are unlikely to explain our results.

         First, the findings may indicate selection into courses – for example, the least able

students may disproportionately take courses from the instructors with the best student

evaluations, biasing downward our estimates of learning for the best instructors. Second, the

results for learning may reflect selection into future classes. Our learning measure can only be

constructed for students who take subsequent economics classes. Better performing students in

one economics course may be more likely to take future economics classes. If more highly rated

professors make economics more attractive particularly for students with low economics ability,

the relationship between grades and whether students take additional classes will be weaker for

students taking classes from the highly rated professors. In this case, our learning measure will

be biased downward for highly rated instructors relative to less highly rated ones, leading us to

underestimate the effect of learning on evaluations. We will examine this possibility. A third

explanation is that students from more highly rated professors may be induced into taking more

difficult future classes. We will also examine this possibility. A fourth interpretation is that the

costs to students in courses where they learn much may offset the benefits they perceive. Lastly,

students may be unable to gauge how much they have learned in their classes. The weak

relationship between our learning measure and the evaluation item that specifically addresses

learning, suggests that the last explanation may be the most relevant one. We investigate these

explanations below.

Selection into Base Sections

         This section considers whether selection biases our estimates. There are a number of

selection arguments. The simplest is that there may be selection into base sections, so that

variations in learning and grades are due to differences in student ability.11 As noted earlier, all

the preceding estimates control for a rich set of student characteristics including ACT or SAT



opposed to individual courses. Also, lagged grades did not matter in the previous models.
11
   Another selection possibility is that students who expect to receive bad grades drop classes and therefore do not
complete evaluations (Becker and Powers [2001]). If, within a class, students expecting lower grades give lower
evaluations, self-selection would raise both the observed average course grade and the observed evaluation.
                                                         16
scores and high school class rank, thereby mitigating this concern. For principles of

microeconomics, we have also restricted the sample for which we estimate learning to students

who took principles of microeconomics in the Fall of their first year. These students presumably

have little information about instructors. This strategy is similar to Hoffmann and Oreopoulos

[2006]. Results were less precise but similar to those presented above.

Selection into Future Classes

         There are other selection arguments. For example, the effect of learning, as measured by

future grades, on evaluations may be biased downward if students with low ability in economics

take more additional economics courses after taking a course from a highly rated instructor than

after taking a course from a less highly rated instructor.12 To test this hypothesis, we estimate

logit models of whether student i takes subsequent economics courses, Future Classis. The first

model is,
                                             ⎧1 if es β + X is Γ + Ws Π + ε is > 0
                             FutureClassis = ⎨                                     .
                                             ⎩0 if es β + X is Γ + Ws Π + ε is ≤ 0

Here e s denotes the evaluation in section s; X is denotes student characteristics; and Ws denotes

characteristics of the instructor and section. In addition to individual characteristics included

above, in these regressions, X is includes dummy variables for the college that houses the

student’s major and interactions between these dummy variables and a quadratic in time to

account for (time-varying) differences in requirements to take economics classes across different

units.13 This model can be used to determine whether students take more economics classes after

taking a class from a highly-rated instructors than they do after taking a class from a less highly-

rated instructor, in which case βˆ > 0 . The second model is,




Unfortunately, our data do not permit us to identify students who dropped a course.
12
   Alternatively, students who are more interested in economics may rate their instructors better and continue with
economics classes even if they are not as capable. Random variations across sections in student motivation might
produce more low-quality students going on to take more economics classes when ratings are higher. These
estimates also test for this hypothesis.
13
   Unfortunately, historic information on which programs require which economics courses is not available.
                                                         17
                                      ⎧1 if gis β + gis es π + X is Γ + Φ s + ε is < 0
                      FutureClassis = ⎨                                                .
                                      ⎩0 if gis β + gis es π + X is Γ + Φ s + ε is ≤ 0

As above, e s denotes the evaluation in section s and X is denotes student characteristics; g is

gives the grade received by student i in section s and Φ s denotes a set of section dummy

variables, which are estimated explicitly and account for differences across base sections in the

probability of taking future courses. With section fixed effects, the instructor and section

characteristics (including the direct effect of student evaluations) are captured by the section

fixed effects. The parameter β gives the difference between the probability of taking subsequent

economics courses by students with higher grades relative to those with worse grades. The

parameter π , on the interaction between grades and evaluations, is of particular interest. If

π > 0 ( π < 0 ), then the relationship between students’ grades and the probability of taking
future economics courses is stronger (weaker) in sections with higher evaluations.

       While one might have expected that students from sections with higher evaluations

would be particularly likely to take additional economics classes, the estimates reported in the

odd numbered columns of table 5 show little relationship between student evaluations and the

number of subsequent economics classes taken. Thus, there is no evidence that students take

more classes after having more highly rated instructors. Viewed from a revealed preference

perspective, this result casts doubt on student evaluations as a measure of teaching quality. For

both principles of microeconomics and macroeconomics, students with higher high school class

rank and better math ACT or SAT scores are more likely to take subsequent courses while those

with higher verbal scores and women are less likely to take additional economics classes. The

other controls are not systematically related to the probability of taking additional economics

classes.

       The estimates in the even-numbered columns of the table show a strong positive

relationship between grades in the current course and the number of subsequent economics

classes taken for students in principles of microeconomics and principles of macroeconomics.

The relationship is negative and significant for students in intermediate microeconomics courses.

                                                     18
The relationship between grades and the probability of taking future courses only depends on

evaluations in intermediate microeconomics. Good students are particularly likely to take

subsequent economics classes after taking intermediate microeconomics from a highly-rated

instructor, which would bias the relationship between evaluations and learning upward. Here too,

there is little evidence that selection explains the weak relationship between grades in subsequent

classes and student evaluations.

       We also estimate our learning measure using a formal selection model. For these

estimates, we look at students who took principles of microeconomics as their first principles

course and their grades in principles of macroeconomics. Our instruments for whether students

take principles of maroeconomics, which were excluded from the future grade equation from

which learning was estimated, are a set of interactions between the college that housed the

student’s major at the time of enrollment in principles of microeconomics and time. This is a

good instrument, because it reflects exogenous changes in the requirements of majors and

advising practices. We included college dummy variables in the equations for taking principles

of macroeconomics and in the grade equation for principles of macroeconomics, so the selection

model is estimated from variations over time in the share of principles of microeconomics

students taking principles of macroeconomics within majors.

       The results, which are quite similar to those in table 3, are reported in Appendix Table 2.

Consistent with the previous results, there is a strong relationship between student evaluations

and grades, which is unaffected by the inclusion of learning. The learning measure is weakly

related to evaluations.

The Difficulty of Future Courses Taken

       Another selection argument focuses on the particular classes that students take. Students

who take a course from a more highly rated professor may take additional classes that are more

difficult than students whose prior course is from a less highly-rated instructor. While the

estimates of learning based on future grades include fixed effects for future courses, if a

disproportionately large number of students from a particular class take courses that are more

                                                 19
difficult in the sense of yielding lower average grades for the same amount of initial knowledge,

it will lead us to underestimate learning from those sections.

         Our data provide a convenient test for this hypothesis insofar as intermediate

microeconomics (the third class taken by most students) is offered in two versions – a standard

course and a calculus-based course, taken by roughly 13 percent of the students in our sample.

For students who took an intermediate microeconomics class, we estimate
                                                ⎧1 if es β + X is Γ + ε is > 0
                          Hard Intermediateis = ⎨
                                                ⎩0 if es β + X is Γ + ε is ≤ 0

using a logit model. Here Hard Intermediateis is a dichotomous variable equal to 1 if the person

took the mathematical intermediate microeconomics class and 0 if the person took the less

mathematical intermediate microeconomics class; e s denotes the evaluation in section s, and X is

denotes the student characteristics. The parameter β indicates whether students who took

sections with higher ratings were more or less likely to take the more mathematical intermediate

class.

         The estimates are reported in Table 6. There is no relationship between student

evaluations in principles of microeconomics or macroeconomics and the probability of taking the

more mathematical intermediate microeconomics course. (For principles of macroeconomics the

estimates indicate that students in more highly rated sections are actually less likely to take the

more mathematical intermediate microeconomics course, although the coefficient is not

statistically significant.) Not surprisingly, students who have higher math ACT or SAT scores

are more likely to take the mathematically intensive class.

         These estimates indicate that the finding of no relationship between evaluations and

learning is not due to this potential source of bias. Overall, we conclude that there is little

evidence that selection (in a variety of forms) accounts for the weak relationship between

evaluations and learning reported above.

VI. Determinants of Learning and Grades

         The preceding estimates show that there is substantial variation in learning across

                                                  20
sections and that instructor effects account for much of this variation. This section considers how

observable instructor characteristics are related to the learning measure and how current grades

are related to learning and instructor characteristics. These are estimates of equations (4.1) and

(4.2). Given that controlling for current grades eliminates the relationship between learning and

evaluations, we anticipate that learning and current course grades are positively related.

        The results are reported in table 7. The first three columns report results for principles of

microeconomics. They show no systematic relationship between instructor characteristics and

current course grades. As expected, grades in the current course are positively related to

learning, although the relationship is not statistically significant. This finding is consistent with

instructors giving higher grades to sections that do better. Not surprisingly students in honors

section of the course received higher grades and learned more than other students, and these

results are highly statistically significant.

        Results for principles of macroeconomics, reported in columns (4) through (6), show that

none of the observable instructor characteristics are related to learning, but that women tend to

give lower grades. As shown in column (5), learning is positively, but not significantly, related

to grades in the current course, but the previous results are robust to controlling for learning.

        Results for intermediate microeconomics, reported in columns (7) through (9) show that

women tend to assign higher grades, but none of the other instructor characteristics is

statistically significantly related to current grades. Students who took intermediate

microeconomics from a foreign-born instructor learn less. Otherwise, none of the observable

instructor characteristics is statistically significantly related to learning. As before, the current

course grades are positively related to learning.

        It is noteworthy that Table 2 showed large instructor differences, but that the estimates in

Table 7 show no consistent relationship between observable instructor characteristics and

learning. This finding parallels the literature on teacher effects in primary and secondary schools,

where teacher effects are found to be large, but observable teacher characteristics have only

weak effects (see, for example, Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain [2005]). Thus here, as in that

                                                    21
literature, the characteristics of instructors that matter the most are unobservable.

VII. Optimal Evaluation Criteria

         This section considers optimal evaluation criteria. Assume that evaluations depend on

grades, gs ; learning, l s ; and an unobserved course experience, ξ s , according to

                                               es = φ g g s + φl l s + ξ s                                         (3’)

which is equivalent to (3) without instructor characteristics. If a direct measure of learning and

unbiased estimates of φˆg and φˆl are available from (3 / 3’), it is possible to estimate the course

experience directly from,

                                                          (               )
                                             xˆ s = e s − φˆg g s + φˆl l s .14                                     (5)

The xˆ s in (5) are the residuals from (3 / 3’). In other words, our measure of the course

experience is evaluations regression-adjusted for grades and learning and (perhaps) instructor

characteristics.15

         With this information, instructors can be evaluated on the course experience they provide

and the amount of human capital they produced. With a sense of social priorities, estimates of

the course experience, human capital, and grades, administrators can reward instructors based on

social welfare.

         Because much of the interest is in evaluating instructors, we analyze rankings of

instructors for each course.16 Figure 1.A shows a strong positive relationship between the

estimated course experience for instructors and his or her student evaluations for principles of



14
   We note that that this procedure attributes all factors that affect evaluations other than grades and learning to the
course experience. If, as we have heard mentioned from time to time, instructors give out cookies or the like when
administering evaluations, that will be attributed to a better course experience. Thus, in only regression adjusting
evaluations, we may be placing too much emphasis on them, but we note that unadjusted evaluations are affected by
these biases and our procedure has the advantage of adjusting evaluations for grading leniency.
15
   As noted by the editor the desirability and feasibility of controlling for instructor characteristics is not
straightforward. For instance, one might want to adjust for gender to eliminate a gender-bias in evaluations, but it is
not clear whether one would want to control for, say, experience.
16
   The course experience for each instructor is the mean of his or her residuals from regression (6) in Table 3, which
controls for learning, grades, and section characteristics. The learning produced by each instructor (regression
adjusted) is the mean of each instructor’s residual of a regression like that in column (6) of Table 3 where learning
is the dependent variable and section characteristics are controlled.
                                                              22
microeconomics. The correlation between the two variables (shown in Table 8) is .94 indicating

that regression-adjusting evaluations for grades and learning leaves most of the information

intact. Panel B plots learning against student evaluations showing virtually no relationship

between the amount of learning an instructor produces and his or her student evaluations. Given

that learning and evaluations are essentially independent, it is not surprising that many of the

instructors who do well on their evaluations do poorly on learning, while many of the instructors

who do poorly on their evaluations produce a lot of learning. Thus, student evaluations provide

no meaningful information about learning. The table also shows that the correlation between an

instructors’ course experience and the amount of learning produced is low, .11.

       The remaining panels of the table show correlations for principles of macroeconomics

and intermediate microeconomics. Again, there is a strong relationship between the imputed

course experience and student evaluations, but not between learning and student evaluations. In

fact, in these courses, learning is negatively related to evaluations and the course experience,

especially for principles of macroeconomics.

       The preceding results have two implications for the design of optimal evaluation criteria.

First, rankings of instructors based on their course experience are quite similar to rankings of

instructors based on raw student evaluations. Nevertheless, we prefer to rank instructors based

on the course experience both because it controls for differences in grading leniency and because

it eliminates the incentive to inflate grades. Second, rankings of instructors based on learning are

markedly different from rankings of instructors based on student evaluations. The optimal

assessment of instructors’ quality would not be based on raw student evaluations but rather on a

weighted average of the course experience and learning variables, where the weights correspond

to the relative importance that society assigns to these two objectives.

       The optimal assessment of instructor quality is easily implemented. It applies basic

regressions to data that are available in machine-readable form at most or all institutions. Four

points are worth highlighting. First, constructing optimal evaluations requires one to select the

proper weights to be placed on learning relative to the course experience. Second, in order to

                                                 23
properly evaluate the amount of learning, enough time must elapse for students to be observed in

subsequent classes. Third, while this measure has the advantage of weighting knowledge in

proportion to its importance in future course work, which yields a high level of external validity,

the method is most applicable for classes where subsequent coursework will build on the

knowledge acquired in the base class. Lastly, the procedure may raise selection concerns, and

while we find little evidence for selection in the current context, matters may be different in

other contexts. Of course, selection concerns also arise when using conventional student

evaluations.

VIII. Conclusions

       Our findings show that student evaluations are strongly related to grades and that

learning, as measured by future grades, is unrelated to student evaluations once current grades

have been controlled. We also provide evidence that evaluations vary with instructor

characteristics, the type of section, and composition of the class. We find, for example, that

students sometimes give lower evaluations to women and to foreign-born instructors. We do not

believe that our results are specific to our institutional setting, and expect our results to be

qualitatively similar for higher education generally.

       Student evaluations of teaching differ from the ideal construct because they are affected

by grade leniency and do not reflect learning produced in a course. Even if student evaluations

did not suffer from these two deficiencies, student evaluations would assign proper to weight to

learning relative to the course experience only under the highly unlikely condition that students

place the same weights on these items as the social planner. Based on our analysis, we propose a

procedure for optimally assessing instructor quality. It is simple to use and the underlying data

are readily available.

Note: Standard errors in parentheses. Estimates in the top panel include random effects for instructors. * Significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%;
*** significant at 1%. For the instructor-level estimates, we construct the weighted mean of student evaluations and of our measures of grades and
learning for each section taught by an instructor estimated in equations (1) and (2). In these calculations, each section was weighted by the
number of students in that section. Equation (3) is then estimated at the instructor level with these instructor-level means as the independent and
dependent variables. In the specifications that include section and instructor characteristics, the means of those variables are included.

Note: The course experience is the mean of each instructor’s residual of regression (6) in Table 3, which controls for learning, grades,
and section characteristics. Learning (regression adjusted) is the mean of each instructor’s residual of a regression like that in column
(6) of Table 3 where learning is the dependent variable and section characteristics are controlled.
