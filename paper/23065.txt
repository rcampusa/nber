Disaster Risk and Asset Returns: An International Perspective

                                         ABSTRACT

Recent studies have shown that disaster risk can generate asset return moments similar to those
observed in the U.S. data. However, these studies have ignored the cross-country asset pricing
implications of the disaster risk model. This paper shows that standard U.S.-based disaster risk
model assumptions found in the literature lead to counterfactual international asset pricing
implications. Given consumption pricing moments, disaster risk cannot explain the range of
equity premia and government bill rates nor the high degree of equity return correlation found in
the data. Moreover, the independence of disasters presumed in some studies generates
counterfactually low cross-country correlations in equity markets. Alternatively, if disasters are
all shared, the model generates correlations that are excessively high. We show that common and
idiosyncratic components of disaster risk are needed to explain the pattern in consumption and
equity co-movements.

       The risk of disasters has long been proposed as an explanation for a variety of financial

market anomalies. Key among these anomalies is the high equity premium in the face of

relatively smooth consumption. As originally presented by Reitz (1988) and advanced by

Barro (2006, 2009), a low probability of a large decline in output can sufficiently increase the

variability in intertemporal marginal utility to deliver the level of equity premium seen in

U.S. data. In combination with risk of government default, the potential for these disasters

can also explain the level of government bill rates. Moreover, as Wachter (2013) shows, time

varying disaster risk can help explain the volatility of equity returns and government bills.

       Since disasters are rare in the U.S. time series, this literature uses international data to

measure both the frequency and size of these events. To obtain these measures, each country

is typically assumed to face the same potential decline in consumption, parameterized from

observed disasters across all countries.1 However, if true, this assumption carries important

implications for the magnitude and co-movements in international asset returns. If all coun-

tries face a similar disaster risk, this risk should affect the correlation of asset returns across

countries, as well.

       In this paper, we study the international asset pricing moments and co-movements im-

plied by a standard domestic-based disaster risk model. Using consumption and asset price

data for seven OECD countries, we begin by evaluating each country in isolation following

the standard approach in this literature. Within the constant probability of disaster frame-

work as in Barro (2006), we ask whether differences in exposure to disaster risk can explain
   1
     In a modification of this approach, Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro and Ursua (2013) estimate endogenous
differences in timing, magnitude, and length of disasters while maintaining the assumption that the frequency
and size distribution is time invariant and the same across countries. Similar to our model below, they allow
for correlation in the timing of disasters. However, they use this information to match the U.S. asset pricing
moments alone and do not consider the international asset pricing implications. We discuss their approach
relative to ours below.


                                                      1
the cross-section of asset return moments for each individual country. To examine these

implications, we choose model parameters that best fit the asset pricing moments using Sim-

ulated Method of Moments. For this purpose, we allow for cross-country deviations in the

size of the disaster, the probability of government default, and the dividend leverage param-

eter. Despite allowing for these deviations, however, the model cannot match the variation

in the cross-country data. We then incorporate time-varying probabilities of disasters as in

Wachter (2013). Across countries, time-variation in disaster probabilities indeed improves

the fit for asset return volatility and, to a lesser extent, the mean returns.

       Given the best fit to individual country asset returns, we evaluate the disaster model’s

ability to match the international correlation of asset returns and consumption growth found

in the data. For example, an empirical finding in the data is that international consumption

correlations are lower than equity return correlations.2 To determine whether the model can

replicate this pattern, we analyze implied correlations under two extreme assumptions about

international disasters found in the literature; that is, independent versus common disaster

events.3 Under the assumption that disaster events occur independently across countries,

equity return correlations either mimic those of consumption correlations when disaster risk

is constant or else are much lower than consumption when disaster risk is time-varying. By

contrast, when disaster events are common, equity return correlations are near one, and are

hence too high.

       To address the inconsistencies posed by these two extreme cases, we posit a novel gener-
   2
    See, for example, the discussion in Tesar (1995) and Lewis and Liu (2015).
   3
    Studies that treat disasters as independent across countries include Barro (2006,2009) and Wachter
(2013). In these papers, the frequency of disasters is calculated as the average number of times that output
or consumption declined below a threshhold across all countries and years. Studies that treat disasters as
common include Gourio, Siemens, and Verdelhan (2013) and Farhi and Gabaix (2016).

alization of the theoretical framework that incorporates both country-specific and common

world disaster shocks. This generalization allows us to combine the domestic-based dis-

aster risk model with international asset return and consumption correlations in the data

to uncover country-specific versus common world disaster risk. Our evidence shows that

a high degree of common disaster risk is required to explain the pattern that asset return

correlations are greater than consumption growth correlations.

   As this description makes clear, our objective in this paper is to highlight the international

implications of existing U.S.-based disaster risk models in the tradition of Reitz (1988) and

Barro (2006). For this purpose, we use a canonical disaster risk model to study its ability

to fit international data moments. Therefore, we purposefully take as given the assumptions

consistent with that literature and do not develop a new equilibrium model.4 In this way, the

results in our paper most directly contribute to understanding any required modifications

and potential limitations of the standard model when facing international data.

   Although our analysis provides a unique contribution to understanding the international

dimensions of disaster risk models, a number of other papers have also addressed the impact

of disasters on the macroeconomy and on asset markets. Gabaix (2008, 2012) considers

disaster risk with variable severity of disasters arising from the resilience of an asset’s recover

rate through a “linearity generating” process. Martin (2008) solves for the welfare cost of

business cycles due to disasters, but does not match to asset return data. Backus, Chernov,

and Martin (2011) use U.S. equity index options to examine the implied disaster risk in

consumption. Gourio (2008, 2012) evaluates the impact of disasters in a real business cycle
   4
     By contrast, in Lewis and Liu (2017), we develop an international equilibrium model that requires a
given asset and goods market structure.

model allowing for recoveries after a disaster. Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursua (2013)

also allow for recovery periods after disasters, but then estimate differing probabilities of

entering disasters across countries. However, these papers do not evaluate the international

asset pricing implications of disaster risk.

    Two recent papers provide an exception. Gourio, Siemer and Verdelhan (2013) and Farhi

and Gabaix (2016) examine the co-movements of returns and exchange rates with disasters,

but they do so assuming complete markets. By contrast, our goal is to investigate the

international asset market implications of existing U.S.-based empirical disaster risk models

that, in turn, do not require markets to be complete. As such, we view the contribution in

our paper to be complementary, but distinct from all of these papers.

    The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 1 reviews the general framework used in

the literature as well as the approach used in this paper. Section 2 describes the data and

evaluates the model fit for countries in isolation. Section 3 describes the implications for

correlations in consumption and asset returns across countries. Concluding remarks are in

Section 4.




1     The Canonical Model and Framework

The disaster risk literature is grounded in a theoretical asset pricing tradition beginning

with Lucas (1978), which relates returns to the intertemporal consumption optimization.

Research applying this theory to data has met with mixed success. For example, as Mehra

and Prescott (1986) showed in their seminal work, the risk to U.S. investors implied by

historical consumption data was not sufficient to generate the observed equity premium, a


                                               4
regularity often called the “equity premium puzzle.” Following this observation, Reitz (1988)

suggested that the risk of rare, but severe, disasters could provide a resolution to this puzzle.

   The impact of rare disasters has been difficult to quantify, given the infrequency of these

events in U.S. data, however. Therefore, Barro (2006) proposed using data on disasters

across a large sample of countries to identify both the size and frequency of disasters in

the U.S. Subsequent papers such as Barro (2009) and Wachter (2013) have also considered

the implications of these disasters on various asset pricing moments such as the mean and

variance of the equity returns and government bill rates. Moreover, these moments are often

measured in real returns in home country prices, and presented as average asset returns (e.g.,

Barro (2006), Barro and Ursua (2008)).

   While the consumption-based asset pricing literature on disaster risk has almost exclu-

sively focused upon the behavior of U.S. data moments, the identifying assumption that

disasters need to be measured with non-U.S. data has clear implications for the asset pric-

ing moments of those countries as well as their cross-country co-movements. In order to

evaluate these implications below, we develop a framework taken from a standard domestic-

based model, modified to allow as much latitude for the model to match differing asset and

consumption moments across countries. For this purpose, we incorporate country specific pa-

rameters to the framework with time-varying disaster risk developed by Wachter (2013). The

Barro (2009) model with constant probability of disaster is a special case of this framework.

We refer to this general framework as the “canonical model” below.

   Since our contribution is to investigate this framework applied to international asset

returns, we necessarily inherit both the limitations and generalities of the standard approach.

Specifically, the most limited interpretation of our investigation would be that, since the

                                               5
framework was developed to target domestic asset pricing moments, our analysis applies only

to a world of multiple closed economies in isolation. Indeed, this narrow interpretation is

consistent with the quantitative analysis in Section 2 that focuses exclusively on the analysis

within each country. However, in Section 3, we show that this interpretation is likely to

be overly restrictive when we examine the co-movements across countries implied by the

canonical domestic-based disaster model. As demonstrated there, the domestic-based model

implies positive co-movement in consumption and asset returns across countries. Therefore,

to highlight the potential relationships within the standard model that may lead to these

international co-movements, we review more general interpretations of the canonical model

at the end of this section in Subsection 1.4.



1.1    Preferences and Consumption

To consider how a standard single-country disaster risk model may fit a cross-section of

individual country asset returns, we modify the model specified in Wachter (2013) and Barro

(2009) to allow all parameters other than preferences to differ by country. For consistency

with this approach, we maintain the assumption from these papers that the analysis for each

country is specified in units of home country consumption.

   Following this framework, there is a representative consumer-investor in each country,

indexed by j. These agents have identical preferences over their own aggregate consumption

good defined as Ctj at time t. To allow the model to match real consumption data that is

deflated by home price indices, we assume that each country’s aggregate consumption good

is a composite of individual goods that will in general differ by country. This approach



                                                6
ensures consistency between the theoretical framework and the data.

       In particular, we assume as in Barro (2009) that preferences are recursive over time.5

We also follow Wachter (2013) by considering the continuous time version formulated by

Duffie and Epstein (1992) for the case of unitary intertemporal elasticity of substitution in

consumption. This special case implies tractable, exact form solutions to our asset pric-

ing moments below.6 Thus, under these assumptions, utility at time t for representative

consumer j, defined by Vtj , is given by:


                                                        Z   ∞
                                          Vtj   = Et            U (Csj , Vsj )ds                            (1)

                     U (Ctj , Vtj )   = β(1 −   γ)Vtj       log Ctj   −                  j
                                                                            log((1 − γ)Vt )                 (2)
                                                                        1−γ

and where β > 0 is the rate of time preference and γ > 0 is the coefficient of relative

risk aversion. Furthermore, the consumption good Csj in each country j is a composite of

multiple heterogeneous non-durable goods each with separate prices, thereby allowing the

price index to differ across countries as in the data. This approach follows a long literature in

international finance that treats consumption in each country as an aggregate of individual

goods.7 Moreover, to insure a well-defined price index per country while providing the most
   5
     These preferences use the form of the utility function specified in Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil
(1990). Barro (2009) argues that these preferences are needed to avoid the counterfactual implication that
high price-dividend ratios predict high excess returns.
   6
     This assumption allows us to adapt the closed-form solutions from Wachter (2013) to individual coun-
try asset returns, in the case where disaster intensity are time-varying. Nevertheless, when the disaster
probability is constant, we could in principle allow the intertemporal elasticity of substitution to differ from
one.

     For early examples see Adler and Dumas (1983), Cole and Obstfeld (1991), and Backus, Kehoe, and
Kydland (1994). Colacito and Croce (2011) provides a more recent example.

general framework, we assume only that aggregate consumption Csj is isoelastic with respect

to its individual goods components without specifying a particular form for the aggregation.8

Thus, although the basic form of the utility function over aggregate consumption is the same

across countries, preferences over individual goods may differ. Specifying consumption in

this way provides consistency with the empirical literature that treats aggregate consumption

in units that are the inverse of the price index in each country.9 Note that this assumption

implies that the value of consumption for country j in units of another country consumption

will differ by a real exchange rate. We discuss the implications of variations in the real

exchange rate in Subsection 1.4 as well as our quantitative analysis below.

       The representative agent in each country j then chooses the sequence of Csj to maximize

utility subject to a lifetime budget constraint of income, Ytj = Y j (δ t ), where δ t is a vector

of state variables in the economy. In general, income is the flow of the resources available

to a given country so that δ t reflects all of the variables influencing those resources. In

a full international macroeconomic model, these variables would include variables affecting

both domestic production and any net ownership of foreign production through foreign asset

positions. Below we follow the asset pricing literature in taking this process as given by

production side decisions in the economy and then focusing upon the asset pricing decisions

conditional on income. Therefore, this income process may be considered exogenous for

much of the analysis, although in Subsection 1.4 we discuss more general interpretations.
   8
     Adler and Dumas (1983) demonstrate that when the consumption aggregator is homothetic with respect
to individual goods components, then a well-defined price index holds per country, even in the absence of
purchasing power parity.
   9
     Technically, as described in Adler and Dumas (1983) we require the consumption aggregator to preserve
the property that utility is homogeneous of degree one in the individual consumption components. This
property holds for specific aggregators such as those in Colacito and Croce (2011) or Verdelhan (2010), for
example. However, the condition also holds for more general aggregators as well.

where Ux denotes the partial derivative with respect to x. Thus, the state price density

relates the value of resources to the intertemporal marginal utility of consumption. Hence,

this variable must be determined in equilibrium, as described below in Subsection 1.2.

       The representative agent then chooses consumption to maximize utility given in equations

(1) and (2) subject to the constraint that:


                                                ∞
                                                    πsj j

                                                                  j

                                            t       πt


This optimization implies a value function that gives the maximum utility as a function of

the state variables, such as wealth, which we describe in more detail below.10 Since the

utility function in equation (2) is strictly increasing in aggregate consumption, the wealth

constraint in equation (3) will hold with equality along any optimal path, implying an

equilibrium relationship we use below.

       The consumption that arises from this optimization naturally inherits a functional depen-

dence on at least some of the variables that affect income. Defining this subset of variables as

δ t , then we could rewrite consumption as: Ctj = C j (e
e                                                      δ t ). While a full macroeconomic model

would detail how the income process relates to consumption, much of the empirical asset pric-
                                                                              hR            i
                                                                                 ∞ j
ing literature directly uses the fact noted above that in equilibrium Wtj = Et t ππsj Csj ds .
                                                                                                     t


As such, the behavior of consumption identified by the data is sufficient to determine the

    In discrete time, the value function would be determined using a Bellman equation. In this continuous
time setting, the same is done using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation as detailed in Appendix A.1.

behavior of wealth.

   The common feature in the disaster risk literature is that consumption is affected by

infrequent but large declines in income. For example, as argued in Barro (2006), this impact

on consumption can be generated by significant downturns in the macroeconomy as occurred

during the Great Depression, by natural events such as earthquakes, or may be the result of

wars such as the World Wars. It may also arise through large declines in productivity that

affect business cycles, as articulated in Gourio (2008, 2012).

   Overall, although the specific ways in which disasters affect consumption will depend

upon the nature of the macroeconomy, its impact will be observed in the data. For this

reason, much of the focus in the disaster risk asset pricing literature has been to analyze the

consumption data directly and then use the implications to uncover the effects on wealth

through the constraint in equation (3). We therefore follow this approach below by using

the framework from Wachter (2013) that includes the possibility of disasters. However,

we augment this process to allow the parameters to differ across countries in order to fit

potential variations. Specifically, using the notation above and including the potential effects

of disasters, the consumption process to be related to the data below is:

where Ct− denotes lims↑t Cs and Ct is lims↓t Cs , dBtj is a standard Brownian motion that

affects consumption in normal times, dNtj is a Poisson process that is positive when disaster

events occur, and Ztj is a variable that determines the size of the decline in consumption

conditional on a disaster occurring.

       We follow Barro (2006, 2009) and Wachter (2013) in identifying periods when disasters

occur as years in which there were declines in income or consumption below a threshold.

That is, the response of consumption to these disasters is reflected in a proportional drop in

level by the amount ω j Zt , where Zt is a random variable that reflects the size of the drop

and ω j allows for the impact of this decline to differ across countries. To capture the effect

of disasters, Zt < 0 and ω j > 0 so that realizations of dNtj reduce consumption growth. In

our quantitative application below, we parameterize the distribution of Zt with the empirical

distribution of disasters using the long sample of international data from Barro and Ursua

(2008).11 This distribution is treated as time-invariant so we drop the time subscript in the

remainder of the paper.

       To consider time-variations in disasters, Ntj has an intensity parameter, λjt , given by:


                                                                                q

specific processes,                                  are uncorrelated with each other at a given time t

within a given country j.

       Since these shocks originate from income processes for each country, they are likely to

be correlated across countries if, for instance, there is trade in goods or assets. Therefore,

in Section 3 we consider this possibility and allow for the correlations between countries,

Corr(dBti , dBtj ), Corr(dNti , Ntj ), and Corr(dBλ,t

the independence within countries as in the standard model. As a result, these variables are

   This approach has been used in a number of papers including Barro (2009), Nakamura et al (2013), and
Wachter (2013).

not in general independent across countries, even though we continue to identify them with

a country-specific superscript.

       The consumption process in equations (4) and (5) include country-specific parameters

that allow the framework to fit data across countries below. For instance, although the stan-

dard model implicitly assumes ω j = 1, we incorporate this parameter to allow for differing

effects across countries. Clearly, a country with higher ω will experience a larger impact of

disasters on consumption. In addition, consumption volatility in ”normal times” without

disasters, σ j , and the time-varying intensity parameters, κj and σλj , may be country-specific.

Below we also consider country differences in asset return parameters measuring leverage

and government bond default rate to be detailed later.

       While our specification of consumption processes in equations (4) and (5) allows some

parameters to be country-specific, others are treated as common. In particular, country mean

growth rates, µ, are set to be equal across countries for plausibility since our quantitative

analysis will focus upon developed economies. We also assume that the long run mean of

the disaster probability λ is common across countries in the absence of power to distinguish

this parameter across countries.12



1.2       First-Order Condition for Intertemporal Optimization

In order to solve for implied returns using observed consumption data, we follow the lit-

erature by conditioning our analysis on the first-order condition of intertemporal utility

maximization given the wealth constraint. As with other first-order conditions, it simply
  12
   For this reason, we also treat the other parameters in the time varying intensity process, κ and σλ as
common in most of the quantitative analysis.




                                                   12
provides a relationship that optimizes an objective of one agent in the economy and may

not reflect the equilibrium in the presence of multiple agents. Therefore, we condition our

analysis on a further identifying assumption from the standard disaster risk literature: the

domestic investor’s first-order condition prices the domestic equity returns and government

bill rates. This condition would clearly be satisfied if financial markets were completely seg-

mented since only domestic investors would have access to their own assets. However, this

identification also holds in more general contexts as we discuss at the end of this section in

Subsection 1.4.

       To solve for the return on an asset that would be required by the representative investor

from country j, we must derive the first-order condition that relates wealth to that asset.13

For this purpose, we define the value function for the country j investor in terms of the state

variables of wealth and the disaster probability as H(W j , λj ). As noted earlier, analyzing

wealth in the data is simplified since in equilibrium the budget constraint in equation (3)

                                            πsj j
                                       R∞
holds with equality; i.e., Wtj = Et     t
                                               C ds.
                                            πtj s
                                                       Thus, wealth can be viewed as the value of an

asset that would theoretically pay a dividend mimicking realizations from the consumption

process in perpetuity, an asset often called the “consumption asset.” Given the equilibrium

association between consumption and wealth, valuation of financial securities in representa-

tive agent frameworks often depends upon the return on this asset.14 Indeed, for recursive

preferences, Epstein and Zin (1991) and Duffie and Epstein (1992) show that each asset must

satisfy a first-order condition involving its own return and the return on an asset that is a

claim on future realizations of consumption.
  13
     This approach is equivalent to the process in discrete time using the value function from the Bellman
equation, thereby yielding the Euler equation.
  14
     The usefulness of the equilibrium relationship between wealth and consumption is highlighted in Camp-
bell (1993), for example.


                                                   13
       Recognizing this relationship, we can then determine two important building blocks for

valuing equity and the government bill rate used in our empirical analysis for each country j:

its instantaneous risk-free rate, and the associated state-price density. We only summarize

their solutions here, providing more discussion in Appendix (A.2) for the risk-free rate and

in Appendix (A.3) for the state-price density. Details are in Wachter (2013), Appendix A.I

and A.II.

       Determining the first building block, the risk-free rate for each investor, requires solving

for the value of this asset at the equilibrium level of portfolio holdings. This rate can be

determined by taking the derivative of the value function H(W j , λj ) with respect to the choice

of the risky consumption asset at the equilibrium level implied by the wealth constraint in

equation (3). Following these steps implies that the value of a risk-free rate to an investor

in country j is:
                                                          h    j     j
                                                                            i
                            rtj = β + µ − γ(σ j )2 + λjt E e−γω Z (eω Z − 1)                            (6)


where the expectation is taken over the time invariant distribution of Z.

       From the perspective of investors in country j, the only source of variation in the country

j risk-free rate arises from time variation in the disaster probability, λjt , as shown in equation

(6). Moreover, if there were no disaster risk, this rate would simply be constant at: rtj = rj =

β + µ − γ(σ j )2 . The finding that the risk-free rate is constant when consumption growth

is i.i.d. is well-known.15 By contrast, time variation in the disaster probability induces
                                                           jZ
volatility in the risk free rate. Moreover, since eω            < 1, a higher probability of disasters,

λjt , implies a greater risk that a disaster event will reduce consumption. In turn, this greater

                                                    14
risk induces more demand for precautionary savings, thereby reducing the implied country

j risk-free rate.16

       Note also that since wealth of investor j is measured in consumption units of country j,

this return would only be risk-free to residents of country j. In particular, since consumption

in country i is measured in different consumption units, the value of consumption in country

                                                                           eti,j ≡ Qi,j
j from the perspective of country i could be written in county i units as: C            j
                                                                                    t Cs where


Qi,j
 t is the real exchange rate that values a unit of country j in country i consumption. Thus,


the risk-free asset to country j’s investors would be risky from the perspective of country i’s

investors, because it would be valued at Qi,j j
                                          t rt . Moreover, since we follow the literature in


expressing all asset returns in domestic country good units below, the same real exchange

rate variations will affect all relative valuations of these returns across countries.

       The second key building block for valuing assets from the perspective of country j’s rep-

resentative investor is the intertemporal marginal utility of consumption measured through

the state price density, πtj . Solving for this process requires using the solution for the value

function H(W j , λj ) and the envelope condition that HW = UC (C, V ) along the optimal path.

Using the functional form for these expressions together with Ito’s Lemma implies that the

state price density for country j follows:

     As noted previously, the shocks to equilibrium consumption inherit shocks from the macroeconomy.
Thus, variations in the probability of disaster arise from news in the economy that alter the perceived
likelihood of disasters.

ter process, κ and σλ ; the expected size of the disaster for country j, ω j Z; and preference

parameters, β and γ.17 As noted earlier, this process is specified in units of domestic con-

sumption, Ctj . Therefore, the state price density will in general differ across countries, unless

they are identical once converted into a common good so that πtj = Qi,j j
                                                                    t πt . We discuss this


implication in Subsection 1.4 below.

       Since the state-price density impacts the valuation of all risky assets in the economy,

equation (7) is useful for building intuition about several asset pricing relationships we find

in our quantitative analysis below. First, note that the state price in equation (7) evolves

with innovations to the exogenous variables in an intuitive way. In particular, πtj decreases

in “good times”; that is, with increases in the Brownian on normal times consumption dBtj

according to risk aversion, γ. By contrast, the state price increases in “bad times”; that is,
                                                                j
with innovations to the Brownian on disaster probabilities, dBλ,t , according to the current
                                 q
level of the disaster probability λjt and the expected size of the disaster implied through

the parameter bj . Finally, since Zt < 0, disaster events generated by dNtj increase the state

price. Note that, in the absence of time-varying probabilities, the instantaneous variance of

the state-price density during normal times would be driven by the variation in normal times

consumption alone. Therefore, if disaster probabilities were constant (i.e, σλ = 0), then the

instantaneous volatility of the state-price in normal times would simply be γσ j , as in the

standard iid Guassian model.

of the disaster probabilities, as described in Wachter (2013).

1.3     Relating Asset Prices to Observed Data

Given these building blocks, we now relate the theoretical framework to returns observed

in the data. Note that the framework simply asks how a representative investor-consumer

would value claims to any specific stream of future income, which potentially applies to

a large number of assets. Moreover, because wealth is identified by the present value of

consumption, the framework does not have anything to say about which assets actually

comprise the portfolio held by the representative investors. Since our objective is to evaluate

the standard disaster risk literature, therefore, we consider only the two assets typically

related to the data in that literature: government bill rates and equity returns.18 With two

assets per country, this approach implies that we only focus upon 2J asset returns, where J

is the number of countries.19 In this section, we describe the solution of these two returns,

relegating details to Appendix A.4 and Appendix A.5 for the government bill rate and the

equity return, respectively.


1.3.1    Government Bill Rates


We begin by considering the government bill rates. Following Barro (2006), the return of

government securities is presumed to be subject to partial default during disaster periods.

This presumption is based upon the observation that crises are often associated with a decline
  18
     As noted earlier, these are the two assets studied in the tradition of Barro (2006,2009) and Wachter
(2013). However, other papers such as Backus, Chernov, and Martin (2011) and Farhi, et al (2016) analyze
options. Since option analysis would require significant restructuring of the canonical framework in this
paper, we leave this analysis to future research.
  19
     Note, however, that since the countries have different consumption units, there will be different valu-
ations of these returns across countries unless state price densities are equal once converted into common
consumption units. Thus, in principle, we could evaluate the required returns from the perspective   of each
of the J representative agents. That is, if there N j assets in country j, we could obtain J N j different
                                                                                              P
                                                                                              j
asset returns implied by the first-order conditions.



                                                       17
in the value of government securities, either through partial default or inflation. Following

this literature, we define the probability of this government default for country j as q j . Then,

consider an asset that pays out government debt that is risk-free during normal times but

is subject to default with probability q j during disaster periods. In this case, a domestic

investor would evaluate the asset as a combination of the risk-free rate in equation (6) and

an asset that may default during disasters. Using a no-arbitrage condition for these payouts,

the instantaneous required return on the j government bill rate, as measured in units of

country j consumption can be shown to be:


                                                 h     j             j
                                                                          i
                          rtb,j = rtj + λjt q j E (e−γω Z − 1)(1 − eω Z )                     (8)



This solution for the government bill rate illustrates several features. First, the premium on

government bills is clearly increasing in probability of default, q j . Moreover, the volatility

depends upon the variation in the probability of disasters, λjt . Note that in the absence

of time-varying disasters, the government bill rate, like the risk-free rate, is constant so

that its variance is zero. Furthermore, a higher probability of default increases the required

compensation by investors to hold government bills as indicated by the second term on the

right-hand side of equation (8). Finally, as noted earlier, the solution for this government

bill rate is measured in units of domestic consumption, corresponding to its treatment in the

data below.




                                                 18
1.3.2      Equity Prices


Equity is the second asset typically studied in the disaster risk literature. Defining Dtj as

dividends paid by country j equity and Ftj as the price of the claim to income from all future

dividends using the state price of country j investors, then this equity price can be written:


                                                         ∞
                                                               πsj j
                                                   Z                   
                                      Ftj   = Et                   Ds ds .                             (9)
                                                    t          πtj


With this relationship, we can evaluate the behavior of the stock price over time given a

process for dividends.

       The specific assumptions about how those dividends are identified in the data varies

across studies. The most direct approach to discipline the dividend process is to use dividend

data itself (e.g., Bansal and Yaron (2004), Lewis and Liu (2015)). Arguably, this approach

gives the best picture of the behavior of the dividend process. However, unlike asset return

data, reliable data do not exist for dividends across countries over a long history. For that

reason, a typical approach in the disaster risk literature is to treat dividends as a process

that mimics a more volatile version of consumption. Therefore, in this paper, we follow

Wachter (2013) in assuming that the dividend process can be calculated using a process that

mimics consumption multiplied by an exponential factor (e.g., Abel (1999), Wachter (2013),

Gourio, Siemer and Verdelhan (2013)). That is, dividends Dtj for country j are related to the
                                                         φj
consumption process according to: Dtj = Ctj                    where φj > 1 is the ”leverage” parameter.20

       Using this relationship along with the consumption process in equation (4), Ito’s Lemma

   By contrast, some studies assume dividends mimic consumption itself (e.g., Mehra and Prescott (1985),
Obstfeld (1994)) with no leverage parameter.

implies that the process of dividends for equity from country j is given by:


                                                                       j ωj Z
                       dDtj = µjD Dt−
                                   j               j
                                      dt + φj σ j Dt− dBtj + (eφ                     j
                                                                                − 1)Dt− dNtj ,                (10)



where µjD = φj µ+ 21 φj (φj − 1) (σ j )2 . Combining this process for dividends with the evolution

of the state price density in equation (7), the diffusion for the stock price in equation (9)

can be written as21 :

                                     j j       j
                      j = µF,t dt + φ σ dBt + g σλ               λjt dBλ,t
                                                                       j
                                                                           + (eφ            − 1)dNtj ,        (11)

where µjF,t is the instantaneous mean and g j < 0.22 .

       The evolution of the stock price follows the essential features of the state price density

in equation (7). In particular, the stock price increases with innovations in the Brownian on

normal times consumption, dBtj , now augmented by the leverage parameter, φj . Moreover,

the stock price decreases with innovations to the Brownian driving innovations to the prob-
                        j
ability of disasters, dBλ,t , as well as disasters themselves. Also, note that in the absence of

time-varying disaster probabilities, the stock price volatility in normal times would simply

be that of the levered volatility of normal times consumption, φj σ j . As with all the other

asset returns, the stock price evolution is in domestic consumption units. Overall, these re-

lationships can then be used to generate the asset pricing moments in the model to compare
  21
     Wachter (2013) in Appendix A.III derives the stock returns including the dividend payment, the solution
we use to match to the equity returns. Here we provide the equity price alone for illustrative purposes only.
  22
     Specifically, g j = Gj0 (λjt )/Gj (λjt ) where Gj is the price-dividend ratio for the equity of country j. This
price-dividend ratio also depends upon the state price diffusion in equation (7). Ensuring that the solution
of G is not imaginary restricts the relationship between not just Z and the parameters of the time-varying
densities as before, but also the leverage parameter φj .

to their counterparts in the data.



1.4     Generality and Limitations of Canonical Framework

In order to consider the international implications of the literature on consumption-based

asset pricing with disaster risk, we have modified the standard domestic-based model to

allow for differences in the consumption and asset return data across countries.23 Given

the domestic economy focus of this literature, a narrow interpretation would be that the

framework cannot do more than represent a world of multiple isolated markets with exoge-

nously specified consumption. However, the literature on consumption-based asset pricing

has demonstrated over the past few decades that this interpretation may be unduly restric-

tive. A more generous interpretation would be that the model reflects a world in which

consumption is an endogenous outcome of a larger production process, potentially generated

by international trade in goods and financial assets. In order to consider this possibility,

then, we next review these alternative, more general interpretations of the literature as well

as the limitations imposed by its basic identifying assumptions.


1.4.1    Exogenous versus Endogenous Consumption


The framework above is conditioned on a particular consumption process as given by equa-

tion (4) and therefore a narrow interpretation would presume that consumption is exogenous.

There are other interpretations, however. Barro (2009) describes how a similar process for

consumption obtains when output is an endowment process. Furthermore, other papers
  23
    In particular, removing all the j superscripts and setting ω j = 1 reduces all the equations above to the
Wachter (2013) model when the disaster probability λ is time-varying and to a continuous time version of
the Barro (2009) model when it is constant.



                                                     21
have studied a richer production side of the analysis. For example, Gourio (2012) develops a

production-based model with capital and labor that endogenously generates a consumption

process with disaster shocks. Similarly, Gourio, Siemer, and Verdelhan (2013) analyze a pro-

duction economy in a two-country model with open financial markets, implying a consump-

tion process with infrequent, but large declines. The international setting then imposes an

additional world resource constraint to the framework above. That is, for each time period,

                                                                 Qi,j j
                                                                                   Qi,j j
                                                         P                 P
world consumption equals world income; that is,              j    t Ct =       j    t Yt , for t ∈ {0, ..., ∞}.


       Overall, a key feature common to disaster risk models is that income to the economy

experiences large declines that, in turn, dramatically reduces consumption. Moreover, since

observed consumption is the outcome of decisions made by individuals operating in the

true economy, it reflects the optimal process given the constraints faced by agents.24 The

approach has also been used to examine risk-sharing in Cochrane (1991a), Lewis (1996), and

Lewis and Liu (2015).


1.4.2      Complete versus Incomplete Asset Markets


The domestic-based model above uses the first-order condition of domestic investors to price

domestic assets, without specifying whether foreign investors also hold these assets. Implic-

itly, then much of the domestic-based asset pricing literature assumes that domestic agents

are the marginal investors who determine the price of domestic assets. To see why, consider
  24
    Treating consumption as measured in the data as an endogenous outcome also has a long tradition in
macro-finance, dating to Lucas (1978,1982).On the connection between consumption and asset pricing data,
see Hansen and Singleton (1983), Cochrane (1991a), Campbell (1993), Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and
Bansal and Yaron (2004), among others. Kocherlakota (1996) provides a very useful review of the behavior
of consumption and asset prices required to generate asset returns. In some cases, fuller production-based
models are separately specified to demonstrate how an observed consumption process can be generated. For
example, Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010) show how a persistent autoregressive component to consump-
tion can arise endogenously even though the technological process in production is only subject to i.i.d.
shocks.


                                                   22
again the canonical model above. In this setting, the source of income to the domestic in-

vestor, Ytj , affects the state price density, πtj , that is used in turn to value the two domestic

assets measured in home country consumption: equity and government bills. As noted ear-

lier, a narrow interpretation that clearly delivers this result is that each country is completely

segmented in its financial market.25 More generally, however, the analysis is also consistent

with at least two other interpretations: either markets are complete or they are incomplete

in a particular way described below.

       The first alternative interpretation is that markets could be complete. In this case, the

countries would share the same state price density as measured in the same consumption

units. Therefore, if purchasing power parity does not hold complete markets would require

that Qi,j      j                     j
           i
                                         i
      t = πt /πt or if it does hold πt = πt , for all i, j. Given our goal of analyzing the


standard model and allowing for the most general treatment in our analysis below, we do not

impose these restrictions a priori but instead allow the data to reflect any such relationship.

       A second alternative interpretation is that markets are incomplete in a way such that the

domestic investors are the marginal investors that price domestic assets in the given data

sample. This interpretation is based upon the idea that the pricing impact of some investors

in the market may not be apparent during periods when those investors are inframarginal.

This notion is consistent with some studies of incomplete markets. For example, Telmer

(1993) describes a model in which agents can only trade a risk-free bond, implying multiple

equilibria over time. In this equilibrium, one agent will often be at a corner solution.26
  25
     Note that countries need not be segmented in goods markets for the asset return equations to hold,
however. If countries are engaged in international trade, then income processes, Ytj , will in general be
correlated across countries, correspondingly implying that consumption processes, Ctj , will be correlated
internationally as we find in Section 3.
  26
     When markets are incomplete, the Euler equation holds for each agent but is not unique in aggregate.
See Telmer (1993), Bakshi, Cerrato, and Crosby (2015) and Lustig and Verdelhan (2016), for example.


                                                   23
Further, Heaton and Lucas (1996) consider domestic economies in which agents only have

access to a risk-free bond but markets are incomplete while Baxter and Crucini (1995)

consider a similar financial market in the international setting. Although the implications

of these studies are specific to their market structure, they raise the possibility that the

first-order condition of some investors may be more important in pricing in any particular

period.

   Overall, then, the standard disaster risk model that conditions on the domestic house-

hold’s valuation of domestic assets may be interpreted consistently with the international

data in three ways. Financial markets are either (a) completely segmented; (b) completely

integrated; or (c) incomplete in a manner such that the domestic representative household

is the marginal investor during the data sample.


1.4.3     Purchasing Power Parity versus Differing Goods Prices Across Countries


The consumption-based asset pricing literature typically converts asset returns and con-

sumption into real growth rates using the domestic price index. This approach has also

been maintained in the disaster risk literature beginning with Reitz (1988) as well as the

more recent literature starting with Barro (2006) and calculated in international data by

Barro and Ursua (2008). Clearly, this practice implicitly converts these data and their mo-

ments into domestic consumption units that differ by country. For this reason, the aggregate

consumption indices in the utility function (1) as well as the state price densities for each

country and their corresponding equity prices and government bill rates are all specified in

home consumption units in the framework above.

   Therefore, we measure these returns in a manner that is consistent with consumption

                                             24
in each country and do not take a stand on whether the prices are equal across countries

or not. Again, this treatment admits a range of possibilities from the empirical analysis.

If purchasing power parity holds, then current real payouts will be valued equivalently by

investors across countries. However, if purchasing power parity does not hold, investors

will view foreign payouts differently because of variation in the real exchange rate. That

is, dividends of equity from country j from the perspective of country i would be: Qij j
                                                                                    t Dt .


Intuitively, it would be like the value in real U.S. terms of a dividend paid in real German

consumption units. We follow this treatment so that our structural framework will match

the empirical analysis in the literature that converts all units into domestic real units.




2     Single Country Implications of Disaster Risk

Above we described how to modify a standard disaster risk model to allow for potential

cross-country differences. In this section, we consider the implications of this framework for

non-U.S. countries, focusing on the data of each country individually as in the U.S.-based

approach. In Section 3, we will examine their cross-country implications.



2.1    Data by Country

Following much of the disaster risk literature, we base our empirical analysis on the long

time series sample of consumption and asset return moments across countries reported in

Barro and Ursua (2008). For the 21 OECD countries in the sample, this data set provides

consumption beginning in the range of 1800 to 1913, depending upon the country. These

data are constructed by deflating with their respective country consumer price indices. Since


                                              25
consumer prices are known to differ across countries due to Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

deviations, the measured consumption identified with Ctj will presumably not be in the same

units of goods across countries. However, individual country consumption are in the same

units as their own asset returns payouts as developed in Section 1.

       Available asset return data generally begin later than consumption, precluding a long

history analysis of all 21 countries in the Barro-Ursua (2008) set. For this reason, we focus

upon seven countries with asset pricing data that begin relatively early: Australia, Canada,

France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Among these coun-

tries, the United Kingdom’s stock return data starts the earliest in 1791, while Canada

begins the latest in 1934. In all cases, the bond return data are available either earlier or at

the same time as the stock return data.

       Table 1 Panel A reports the means and standard deviations for the equity return, the

government bill rate, and consumption for these seven countries.27 As the table shows, the

mean consumption growth rates of the countries are similar across countries, ranging between

1.47% and 2.48%. By contrast, the asset pricing estimates vary widely across countries. For

example, Australia has the highest mean stock return at 10.27% while the lowest is France at

5.43%. Also, the standard deviations of equities are relatively similar for Australia, Canada,

France, the U.K., and the U.S., but are higher for Germany and Japan at around 30%. A

similar pattern may be seen in the standard deviation of the bill rates, as those estimates

exhibit substantially higher volatility in Germany and Japan. A wide range of mean bill

rates is also apparent, and those levels are even negative for Germany and France. In our
  27
     For Canada, the bill rate is unavailable from Barro and Ursua (2008). We therefore use the bond rate
for this country.




                                                   26
quantitative analysis below, we refer to moments calculated over this full sample of data as

“Unconditional,” following Wachter (2013).28

       One reason for the range of moments may be that disasters affect countries heteroge-

neously in the sample. As such, it may be informative to condition the moments on years

when disasters are absent. Therefore, following Wachter (2013), we also examine post war

data as a subset of our full sample, representing a data sample that excludes large disasters.

We refer to these moments as “Conditional.”

       Again using the Barro and Ursua (2008) data, we recompute consumption growth and

asset pricing moments for the period after 1947. Table 1, Panel B shows the range of annual

data moments across the seven countries for this postwar sample. The range of mean equity

returns is smaller, but the range of standard deviations across countries remain large. Not

surprisingly, the standard deviations of consumption growth and government bill rates are

uniformly lower in the postwar period without disasters than in the full sample.



2.2       Matching the moments: Constant Disaster Probability

Given the solutions for the asset pricing returns and the consumption processes in Section

1, we now ask how well the model can fit each individual country’s consumption and asset

return data. For this purpose, we use Simulated Method of Moments. We describe results

from this analysis next, relegating details of the simulation to Appendix C.

       We begin by considering the constant disaster risk model assuming the baseline parame-

ters from Barro (2006). In particular, these parameters are a relative risk aversion of γ = 4, a
  28
    Given that Germany and France have negative average bill rates over the sample, we constrain their
targeted bill rates at the lower bound of zero for all analysis below based upon this period.




                                                 27
rate of time preference of β = 0.03, a “normal times” consumption growth rate of µ = 0.025,

and a probability of disaster event of λjt = λ = 1.7% for all countries j, where the latter is

calculated as the proportion of years when GDP dropped by 15% or greater. We also assume

that the distribution of the sizes of consumption declines due to disasters, Z, is given by the

historical sample in Barro and Ursua (2008).

   Table 2 reports measures of the model fit for both the Unconditional Model Moments

including disasters, targeting the data moments in Table 1 Panel A, and the Conditional

Model Moments during “normal times,” targeting the post-war data in Table 1 Panel B.

For each version, we use Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) to provide the best fit of

our model parameters for each country’s data moments. In order to fit these parameters,

we target the following seven data moments for each of the countries: (a) the consump-

tion growth standard deviation, (b) the mean equity premium, (c) the standard deviation

of the equity return, (d) the Sharpe ratio, (e) the mean government bill rate, and (f) the

standard deviation of the government bill rate. Using these target moments, we estimate

the following model parameters: (a) the probability of government bond default, q j ; (b)

the dividend-consumption leverage parameters, φj ; (c) the proportion of disaster state con-

sumption decline, ω j , relative to the standard model; and (d) the volatility of consumption

in normal times, σ j . We calibrate the mean consumption growth rate µ to be equal to the

average mean growth rate across countries.

   Table 2, Panel A reports the parameter estimates targeting the moments over the full

”Unconditional” Barro-Ursua sample, including years when disasters were observed. Despite

the range of data moments across countries, the estimates for the Unconditional Model

Moments provide a relatively tight range of country-specific parameters. Indeed, for most

                                              28
of the parameters, the estimates correspond to those found in the literature for the U.S.

For example, the probability of government default is in the range given by q = [0.42, 0.45],

close to the assumption of q = 0.4 in Barro (2006). Moreover, the fitted “normal times”

consumption volatility, σ, estimates are around 2.3% and therefore near standard estimates.

The range of the estimate for the leverage parameter φ are between 2.6 and 2.8, near the

Abel (1999) assumption of 3. Overall, these estimates are all relatively in line with values

required to fit asset pricing moments in the U.S., even though the target data moments

are for non-U.S. countries that often have quite different values. By contrast, the range of

estimates of ω are all lower than one, ω j = [0.84, 0.88], indicating that the consumption loss

in the event of a disaster is somewhat lower than that assumed in the standard U.S.-targeted

model.

   This tight range of fitted parameters creates difficulties in matching the wide range of

asset pricing moments, however. As Table 2, Panel A reports, the annualized asset pricing

moments from the model are much closer across countries than their data counterparts in

Table 1, Panel A. For example, in the model, the mean and standard deviation of government

bill rates are all relatively uniform and do not differ across countries by more than 0.5%.

In the data, by contrast, the means vary by almost 4% and the standard deviation by over

10%. Similar discrepancies can be found in the equity returns. Even the more modest range

of the consumption volatilities across countries cannot be generated by the model.

   The last row of Table 2 Panel A emphasizes the poor fit by reporting the sum of squared

difference (”Sum of Sq Difference”) between targeted data moments and the average model-

derived moments across parameter estimates. As the numbers indicate, the model fits par-

ticularly poorly for Australia and Japan.

                                              29
   A potential problem with these results is that, depending upon the occurrence and sever-

ity of disasters, the data estimates may not accurately report the population data moments.

For this reason, Panel B of Table 2 reports the results of an alternative SMM analysis target-

ing the model under “normal” times excluding disasters, given by the postwar data moments

in Table 1, Panel B. As before, to get an aggregate measure of how the model fits across all

the data moments, we report the Sum of Squared Difference.

   Despite the differences in the samples, the fitted parameters targeted to the Conditional

data moments provide a qualitatively similar pattern as before and, once again, are similar

to the estimates found for the U.S. There are some differences, however. The values for

the probability of government default q are now somewhat higher, between 0.432 and 0.521.

Furthermore, the leverage parameter φ estimates range between 2.731 and 3.005, and thus

are all close to 3. By contrast, the implied loss in consumption, captured by ω, is lower than

standard disaster studies of the U.S. that assume ω = 1. These estimates are very similar

across countries at about 81% to 87% of the size generated by the distribution from the

Barro data.

   Given the similarities in parameters across countries, the model again shows little vari-

ation in implied moments across countries. The government bill rates are mostly between

3% - 4%. Moreover, as noted earlier, during normal times, the model implies that the bill

rate is constant so that the bill rate volatility is zero. The equity premium and the volatility

of equity returns are fairly uniform around 5% and 6.5%, respectively. Thus, the model

cannot explain the range of equity premia from 6.35% to 11.90% reported in Table 1, Panel

B. Furthermore, in most cases, the model-implied volatility of equity is much lower than the

15% to 33% found in the data. The only notable exception is Japan which, given its large

                                              30
consumption growth volatility, generates a lower bill rate, a higher equity premium, and a

higher equity standard deviation.



2.3    The Size of Disasters With Constant Disaster Probabilities

In light of these difficulties with matching moments for individual countries, we next study

how variations in key parameters affect the implied asset prices. For this purpose, we simulate

the model based upon varying levels of, alternatively, ω, φ, and q. These results are shown

in Table 3.

   The table begins by reporting the effects of a range of values of the severity of disasters

through ω. In particular, the numbers in the first three columns labeled “Baseline” show how

asset pricing moments vary when the proportionate size of the disaster ω to the standard

model ranges from ω = 0.8 to 1, holding constant the other parameters. For example, as ω

increases towards one, the government bill return declines. As noted in Section 1, a more

severe disaster increases savings, thereby reducing the risk-free rate. As a consequence, the

government bond rate declines with higher ω as well, although this effect is muted by the

increased default risk premium. In the absence of time variation in disaster probability,

higher ω has a large affect on the mean risk-free rate but not the volatility of the risk-free

rate. For consumption growth, by contrast, the increase in ω has a larger effect on volatility

than on the mean.

   Under the next three columns labeled “High φ”, Table 3 shows the effects of a higher

leverage parameter. Here we assume the leverage parameter φ to be 3.0 rather than 2.8,

and then re-examine the results from varying ω. Comparing the results to the first three



                                              31
columns of Table 3 shows that a higher leverage ratio increases the equity premium. It also

increases the standard deviation of the market return, albeit much more modestly. On the

other hand, comparing the model moments in the ”Baseline” model to the ”High φ” model

shows that these effects from higher leverage become muted when there is less sensitivity to

disaster risk; that is, when ω is lower. For example, comparing the Mean Equity Premium,

the higher leverage ratio increases the equity premium 24 bps from 7.88% to 8.12% when

ω is one, but only 17 bps when ω is 0.8. The government bond rate is unaffected by any

changes since, as noted earlier, it is independent of the equity dividend leverage parameter

φ.

     The last three columns of Table 3 labeled “Low q” report the implications for the model

moments when the probability of government bond default conditional on a disaster q declines

to 25% rather than the 40% given in the Baseline Model. Comparing these results to those

in the first three columns makes clear that a decrease in the probability of government

default decreases the government bill rate. The intuition is clear. A lower probability of loss

reduces the implied default risk premium as shown in equation (8). Moreover, this lower

government bill rate correspondingly increases the equity premium. Reducing the likelihood

of the default loss in disasters also reduces the volatility of the government bill rate.

     Table 3 also reports the model-implied moments for each set of parameter values. For the

Conditional Model Moments computed during normal times alone, the increase in leverage

ratio, φ, again produces a noticeable increase on the mean equity premium, and a slight

increase on the equity return volatility. Similarly, the increase in q decreases the return and

volatility of the government bill rate. Finally, given the low volatility of the equity return

for the conditional moments, the model suggests implausibly large conditional Sharpe ratios

                                               32
that range between 1.11 and 1.46, for the cases when ω is one.

       In summary, the model with constant probability of disaster fails to explain the volatility

of asset returns. The volatility of equity returns are significantly lower than in the data, while

the volatility of government bills during periods without crises is counterfactually zero. In

the next section, therefore, we evaluate the effects of incorporating time-varying disaster risk

on the cross-country variation in asset pricing moments.



2.4       Matching the moments: Time-Varying Disaster Intensity

We now allow for time variation in the probability of disasters following Wachter (2013) and

ask whether the model can generate better fitting cross-country differences in asset returns.

The time-varying disaster intensity process in equation (5) introduces two new parameters:

the volatility of the probability, σλ , and its mean reversion, κ. We therefore began by

conducting SMM to target these two new parameters in addition to the four parameters

formerly fitted. However, including these two new parameters generally meant that the SMM

optimization would not converge because σλ and κ tended to exceed conditions required for

the distribution of λ to be well-defined, even when we restricted these parameters to be the

same across countries.29 For this reason, in the results reported below, we instead constrain

some of the parameters and conduct SMM to obtain the best fit to the data for the other

parameters.

       We take as a base case for the time-varying disaster probability model the parameters
  29
    The intensity process in equation (5) has a stationary Gamma distribution only for 12 σλ2 < κλ. Thus, for
given assumptions about the mean of disaster probabilities, λ, the volatility of probabilities, σλ , cannot be
too high and the degree of mean reversion, κ, cannot be too low. Otherwise, the distribution of probabilities
becomes degenerate.




                                                     33
from Wachter (2013). In particular, we assume for time preference that β = 0.12, for risk

aversion that γ = 3, and for the average probability of disaster that λ = 3.55%.30 Given these

assumptions, we then analyze the model in two ways. First, we maintain the same disaster

risk parameters (κ, σλ ) as in Wachter (2013), and use SMM to fit, respectively, country-

specific government default, consumption volatility, leverage ratio, and size of disaster as in:

{q, σ, φ, ω}. This case is most comparable to the constant disaster probability model results

in Section 2.1. Second, we hold fixed those same parameters, and fit κ and σλ to match data

moments. For parsimony, we report in the text only the analysis targeting the Unconditional

data moments, although the results targeting Conditional data moments are qualitatively

similar.

       Panel A of Table 4 shows the results when we choose the leverage parameter φ, probability

of government default q, the volatility of normal times consumption σ, and the proportional

impact of disasters ω, to match the target data moments, while fixing the volatility of dis-

aster intensity σλ and its persistence parameter κ. In particular, normal times consumption

volatility is calibrated to the standard deviation of Post-War consumption growth in the

data as before. As the table shows, there is now a wider range of parameters. For example,

Australia has a lower leverage parameter and probability of government default than the

other countries. The Sum of Squared Difference is substantially lower across all countries

compared to those in the constant probability model for Unconditional Moments in Table

2, Panel A. Furthermore, the differences in parameters now generate a wider range in asset

return moments across countries. Indeed, the mean of government bill rates becomes too

low for Australia. The model also generates equity volatility closer to the data.
  30
       This probability is based on treating disasters as a decline in consumption of 10% or more.


                                                       34
      Table 4, Panel B reports the estimates based upon reversing this process. Specifically,

we now fix the probability of government default q, the leverage parameter φ, and the size

of disasters ω, to those in Wachter (2013), and instead use SMM to fit parameters in the

distribution process for the intensity λt to best match the targeted Unconditional Model

moments. As the table shows, the parameters vary in a narrow range. The degree of mean

reversion κ is essentially unchanged across countries, while σλ varies only between 0.066 to

0.087. In practice, this narrow range is dictated by the condition that the distribution of λ be

stationary. But the resulting implications for the government bill rates and equity premium

are again that asset pricing moments cannot vary much across countries. This finding is

highlighted by the larger Sum of Squared Difference in Panel B relative to Panel A.

      Overall, therefore, the best fit is the model with time-varying probabilities of disasters

in Table 2, Panel A, allowing for differences across countries in government default recovery

rates, consumption volatility, equity leverage, and effects of disaster shocks.



2.5       The Size of Disasters With Varying Disaster Probabilities

As the above results show, the means of asset returns are similar to those of the U.S. market,

although there is a higher variation in standard deviations of returns. Therefore, we now

ask how differences in the impact of disasters can affect the moments.

      The results are given in Table 5. For the base case model, reported in column 1, we

first report the implications for Unconditional and Conditional Model Moments when ω is

constrained to be 1, as in Wachter (2013). By contrast, the second and third columns report

the results when ω = 0.85 and ω = 0.95, respectively.31 As the results show, reducing ω from
 31
      We also considered the cases when ω > 1, but these violated the condition that is required to give a


                                                    35
1 to 0.85 increases the bill rate since the disaster has less of an impact. It correspondingly

reduces the size of the unconditional equity premium from 7.6% to 4.6%. At the same time,

the unconditional equity volatility also decreases as the impact on consumption is lessened,

declining from 20% to 16.6%.

    In the following three columns, labeled “High φ”, we consider the impact from increasing

the leverage parameter φ to 3. The results are quite similar for the bill rate and volatility.

However, the unconditional equity premium and volatility are higher as a direct implication

of the increased leverage. Moreover, the range of potential sizes of declines is narrower since

the model generates imaginary solutions for ω = 0.85.

    Finally, the last three columns, labeled “Low q”, report the same analysis as the base

case, but now setting the probability of government default conditional on a disaster at

q = 0.25, down from 0.40. The lower risk of default increases desired precautionary savings

at the benchmark disaster size, ω = 1, so that the unconditional mean bill rate is an im-

plausibly low value of 0.6%. As the size of disaster declines to ω = 0.95 and ω = 0.85, the

precautionary motive is offset somewhat and the bill rate increases while the equity premium

correspondingly shrinks.

    Similar patterns hold for the Conditional Model Moments. In general, the precautionary

motive for holding bonds decreases with lower ω and q so that implied government bill rates

increase. Generally, the equity premium moves inversely with these relationships.

    Overall, the time-varying model does provide an improved match for the volatility of

asset returns. This improvement, coupled with the fact that there is less variability across
non-imaginary solution of b in the state price density given in Equation (7). In other words, the restriction

countries in the asset return variances, allows the model, even within a narrow range of

parameters, to fit these moments better.




3     International Correlation Implications of Disaster Risk

The analysis in Section 2 above examined in isolation the country effects of the canonical

disaster risk framework. In this section, we begin to examine the international implications

of this framework. To do so, we ask how well the model can generate the international

co-movements of asset returns and consumption that are observed in the data. In particular,

a common empirical finding is that the correlations of consumption are lower than the

correlations of equity returns (see Tesar (1995) and Lewis and Liu (2015)).

    In the canonical disaster framework considered here, these moments are also affected by

real exchange rate variations since consumption and asset returns are measured using a price

index specific to each country. To see this relationship, recall that the value of consumption in

country j in units of country i is Ctij ≡ Qi,j j
                                           t Ct . Then the correlation of consumption growth


measured in home consumption units as in the Barro and Ursua (2008) data set will include

the effects of the correlation of the real exchange rates when viewed from the perspective

of a common numeraire. That is, the correlation of consumption between country i and
                                                       dC dC j
                                                       i                i ij i,j 
                                                                          dC d(C /Q )
country j measured in country i price indices is: Corr C it , C jt = Corr C it C ijt /Qi,jt ,
                                                              t    t               t   t   t


and similarly for asset returns. Clearly, these correlations differ from the perspective of a

given home representative agent depending upon the real exchange rate. Therefore, in this

section, we also demonstrate that the standard correlation patterns between consumption

and asset returns hold in the data when measured in this way.


                                               37
       In order to consider these international co-movements in the model, we must discipline

the international correlation for each of the random variables, dB, dBλ , and dN. The data

counterpart for the first of these variables is straightforward since during ”normal times,”

Corr(dBti , dBtj ) is equal to the correlation of consumption growth between the two countries.

Therefore, we calibrate this number to the data correlation in the Conditional data sample.

By contrast, there are insufficient observations of disasters to identify the correlation of the

disaster events and their probabilities in the data. For this reason, we turn to the assumptions

in the literature.

       There are typically two extreme assumptions in the literature about the co-occurence of

disasters across countries: (a) they are independent; or (b) they are common. As an example

of a study using the first assumption, the Barro (2006) model calculates the frequency of

disaster events as independent across countries. Moreover, the realization of the event itself

in the form of the Poisson jump Ntj only affects one country. Thus, there are no feedback

effects from disasters in foreign countries that would affect the home country disaster process.

Therefore, we start our analysis of disasters with this assumption in Section 3.1. As an

example of a study using the second assumption, Gouirio, Siemer and Verdelhan (2011)

assume that disasters are common across countries. In Section 3.2 below, we examine the

model under this assumption.

       We show that neither of these two assumptions of disasters can explain the data patterns.

Therefore, in Section 3.4, we introduce a new hybrid version, finding that both common and

country-specific disasters are required for the canonical model to match the correlation of

asset returns and consumption across countries.32
  32
       Since the objective of the paper is to examine the implications of the standard disaster risk model, we


                                                       38
3.1     International Co-movements Assuming Independent Disasters

To examine international co-movements, we begin by considering the pattern of consumption

co-movements implied by equation (4), repeated here for convenience:


                        dCtj           j      ω j Zt
                                    j
                         j = µdt + σ dBt + (e        − 1)dNtj , ∀ = 1, ..., J.
                        Ct−


If indeed, the Poisson process generating the disaster is independent across countries, then

clearly the instantaneous consumption correlations are just given by the correlation of the

normal times Brownians, as observed in the data:

                                                 !
                                     dCti dCtj
                            Corr      i
                                         , j         = Corr(dBti , dBtj ) ≡ ρij .                       (12)
                                     Ct−  Ct−


Similarly, asset price correlations are also only affected by the correlation of Brownians,

implying that there are no effects on the correlation across countries due to disaster risk.

To see why, consider the state price processes across countries from equation (7) under

the assumptions that the dNtj realizations and the Brownians on their intensities dBλ,t
                                                                                    j
                                                                                        are

independent across countries. In this case, the correlation of the state price processes are
                                                                  i j
                                                                  dπ dπ
also the correlation of normal times consumption; that is, Corr πit , πjt = ρij . The state
                                                                                t    t


price processes are only correlated across countries due to their normal times consumption

correlations since agents view the impact of disasters on consumption as uncorrelated. As
simply generate the model correlation without taking a stand on the source of that correlation. This approach
leaves open the question of how much international market integration is implied by the effects of disaster
risk on asset return comovements. More generally, a large literature has studied the degree of financial
market integration in international markets. See, for example, Dumas and Solnik (1995), Pukthuanthong
and Roll (2009), Bekaert, Harvey, Lundblad, and Siegel (2011), and Carrieri, Chaieb, and Errunza (2013),
among others. In Lewis and Liu (2015,2017), we focus upon the potential degree of integration in a long run
risk model and disaster risk model, respectively.


                                                      39
a result, the instantaneous correlation in stock prices across countries using the process for

equities in equation (11) and the assumptions of independent disasters is also:

                                                       !

   Furthermore, the independence of disasters implies that the government bill rates will be

independent. Simple inspection of the government bill rate in equation (8) makes clear why.

As noted earlier, these rates only vary due to the changes in the probability of disasters,

according to λjt . When λjt and λit are uncorrelated for all i, j, then government bill rates

will be as well. Therefore, the instantaneous correlation of government bill rates under

independent disasters is:
                                                           !
                                           drtb,i drtb,j
                                    Corr         ,             = 0.                      (14)
                                            rtb,i rtb,j

   Note also that if disasters are independent, the correlation of consumption and asset

pricing moments will be the same whether using a full sample including disasters or a sub-

sample excluding those disasters.



3.2    International Co-movements Assuming Common Disasters

By contrast to the assumption of independence, most of the disasters identified in the data

by Barro (2006) and Barro and Ursua (2008) occur at roughly the same time for the OECD

countries. For example, during the periods of the Great Depression and the World Wars,

most of the countries were in disaster states, whether measured by declines in GDP of at

least 15% as measured by Barro (2006), or by declines of consumption of at least 10% as



                                               40
classified by Wachter (2013). Nakamura, Steinsson, Barro, and Ursua (2013) also estimate

a world disaster event during these periods.

   Thus, an alternative assumption may be that all countries share the same disaster risk

process so that dNtj = dNtw , ∀j where dNtw is a Poisson world disaster event shock that has

an intensity λw
              t . In this case, consumption for country j follows:




                      dCtj        j  j      ωj Z
                       j = µdt + σ dBt + (e      − 1)dNtw , ∀ = 1, ..., J                    (15)
                      Ct−


where dNtw is a Poisson jump process and the intensity process follows:


                                     w                p
                            dλw
                              t = κ  λ  − λw
                                           t   dt + σ λ   λw   w
                                                           t dBλ,t .                         (16)



To highlight the effects of the common disaster risk, we assume that the mean reversion

parameter, κ, and the volatility of the probability, σλ , are the same as defined earlier, and are

equal across countries. However, the impact of the disaster may affect country consumption

growth rates differently through the size of ω j . Note that even if ω j = ω, ∀j so that all

growth rates decline by the same proportion during a disaster, the impact on levels is unique

to each country since consumption goods units potentially differ across countries due to real

exchange rate effects.

   If the disaster event is common, the correlation of consumption and asset returns will

also depend upon the correlation of the disaster components. To see why, consider the effect

on consumption correlations from these common disasters assuming for simplicity that the
                                                                       w
intensity on the world disaster shock is constant so that λw
                                                           t = λ . Defining the size of the

decline in the consumption growth during disasters as K j ≡ (eω                 − 1) and using moment

properties of Poisson processes, the correlation of consumption across countries is given by:

                                    !
                        dCti dCtj                  σ i σ j ρij + K i K j λw

                            , j         =q                      q                                (17)

Or, in the case where the effect of disasters is the same so that ω i = ω j ∀j, and K j = K i = K,

the instantaneous correlation is:

                                        !
                            dCti dCtj                σ i σ j ρij + (K)2 λw
                   Corr      i
                                , j         =q                    q                              (18)

   Using the relevant parameter values, it can be shown that the correlation of consumption

growth in equation (18) is greater than the correlation of normal times consumption, ρij .

Thus, in this case of shared disaster risk, consumption is more correlated.

   Now consider the effects on asset prices. The correlation in the state prices in equation (7)

will include a common disaster shock, dNtw , thereby increasing the correlation in state prices.

In particular, since disaster risk is shared, both by a common occurrence of the disaster event,

dNtw , and by common changes in its probability, dBλ,t
                                                   w
                                                       , then intertemporal marginal utility

increases at the same time across countries. As a result, equity prices will share this same

higher correlation due to the common disaster shock. To see this relationship, consider the

                                                                            w
stock price process in equation (11) under constant disaster risk so that dBλ,t = 0. Then the

stock price evolution becomes:



                          dFtj   j         j j  j      φj ω j Z
                            j = µF,t dt + φ σ dBt + (e          − 1)dNtw ,
                          Ft−


                                                 42
As this equation shows, when disaster intensities are constant, instantaneous variations in

equity returns are generated exclusively through the Brownian on ”normal times” consump-

tion, dBt , and the disaster event shock, dNtw , as in consumption. However, these effects

on equity prices are magnified relative to consumption growth by the leverage parameter φ.

Thus, the correlations in equity prices are the same as those of consumption in equation (17)
                            j ωj Z
except that now K j ≡ (eφ            − 1) and σ j are replaced by σ j φj .

   When disaster intensities are time-varying, the correlation of asset prices can be higher

than consumption, however. Rewriting the stock price in equation (11) to include the com-

mon disaster event and common time-varying probabilities, the process becomes:


                dFtj   j         j j  j
                                              p      w        φj ω j Z
                  j = µF,t dt + φ σ dBt + gσλ   λw
                                                 t dBλ,t + (e          − 1)dNtw .
                Ft−


In this case, stock price changes have a higher correlation due to the perfect correlation in

  w
dBλ,t ; that is, through innovations to the probability of a common world disaster.

   We next evaluate the quantitative implications for both common and independent disas-

ters on the correlations across countries.



3.3    Matching the Moments: Correlations

In order to understand the degree of co-movement between returns, we focus upon two

countries, the U.S. and the U.K. Table 6 reports under ”Data Correlation” the cross-country

correlations of consumption growth, equity returns and government bill rates for these two

countries using the Barro and Ursua (2008) data. In the rows labeled, ”Unconditional,”

the table gives the correlations calculated over the entire history of common consumption


                                                    43
and asset return data from 1870 onwards, while the rows labeled ”Conditional” provide the

same statistics calculated in the post-War data. Both the Unconditional and Conditional

correlations show the pattern typically found in the literature that consumption correlations

are lower than asset return correlations.

    Table 6 also gives these same correlations calculated from the model simulations as-

suming the Wachter (2013) parameter values for two identical countries with correlation in

normal times consumption give by the post-War data correlation between the U.S. and the

U.K. These simulations are conducted for two cases. Panel A reports the correlations of

consumption, equity returns, and government bills under the assumption that the disaster

probability is constant and that λjt = λt = λ = 3.5% for j = 1, 2. The table reports both the

“Unconditional” correlations over all realizations as well as the “Conditional” correlations

excluding the disaster events. The second column gives the results when the effects upon

consumption due to disasters are assumed to be uncorrelated across countries as in equation

(12). As described above, the correlation of equity during normal times, consistent with the

“Conditional” results, is determined by normal times consumption. Over the whole sample

including disasters reported in the Unconditional results, however, consumption and equity

return correlations are driven down to implausibly low numbers by independent realizations

of dNtj .

    Alternatively, the last column reports the results assuming a common world disaster as in

equation (15). Since countries are affected by a common world disaster, the disasters across

countries are not only perfectly correlated, but also have the same magnitude of realizations

of Z. Once again, the consumption and equity return correlations are similar during normal

times, as the “Conditional” results show. However, now the periods of disasters are shared

                                             44
across countries, both for the timing and size of disasters. As a result, the periods of dis-

asters generate a strong common component during those periods, driving the consumption

correlations very high. Indeed, the correlation of consumption is higher than that of equity

returns, inconsistent with the data.

   Panel B of Table 6 provides the correlation when the probability of disasters is time

varying as in equation (17). In this case, an important component of the correlation of equity

returns is determined by the co-movement of time-variation in disaster probabilities, λt .

The column labeled ”No Disaster Correlation” shows that when these disaster probabilities

are uncorrelated, even the normal times Conditional correlations in equities are lower than

consumption at 0.056. As in the static probability case, the independence of disasters renders

the Unconditional correlations in both consumption and equity to be implausibly low at

about 5%. Also, as described in the previous subsection, the correlation of the bill rates is

driven entirely by the correlation in the disaster probabilities. Thus, when the probabilities

of disasters are independent across countries, the correlation of bill rates becomes zero.

   By contrast, when disaster events occur at the same time across countries, the correlations

in asset returns are much higher. For this case, reported in the last column of Table 6 Panel

B, equity return correlations at 0.946 are significantly higher than those of consumption.

Moreover, this high correlation is maintained in the full sample at 0.958. At the same time,

both conditional and unconditional government bill rates carry a correlation of one, since

they are driven by the same common disaster probability.

   In summary, the investigation highlights problems with both versions of assumptions on

disaster risk. When disasters are independent, correlations of asset returns are too low,

indeed lower than consumption correlations. On the other hand, when disasters are shared,

                                              45
asset return correlations are too high and near one.



3.4       Country and World Disasters

As the results above demonstrate, standard assumptions about disaster risk across countries

imply counterfactual implications for the normal times correlation in equity returns. In the

absence of time-varying disaster intensities, the variation in equity returns is too low and

the equity return correlation is driven entirely by the correlation in consumption. In the

presence of time-variation in disaster intensities, however, the equity return correlation is

too high if the disaster events are common and too low if disaster events are independent.

       This observation suggests that a more plausible assumption is that some disasters are

shared while others are country-specific. To allow for this possibility, we specify the disaster

event in the consumption process as a mixture of two Poisson jump processes. Moreover,

note that there are two potential dimensions in which disaster risk can be correlated: the

disaster event, Nt , and the size of consumption decline conditional on disaster, Z. To focus

upon the role of disaster events, we assume that disasters are only correlated through the

Poisson process that guides the timing of the disaster, and allow the size of disasters Z j to

be independent for each country j.33 Then the consumption process in this case is:


                          dCtj           j      ωj Z j
                                      j
                           j = µdt + σ dBt + (e        − 1)(dNtj + dNtw )                               (19)
                          Ct−


where Ntj has disaster intensity λjt and Ntw has disaster intensity λw
                                                                     t . In other words, the
  33
    Note that the assumption is only made to connect with the data on the prior section. In principle, we
could consider the case where the world disaster is big and the country-specific disaster is smaller, or vice
versa.



                                                     46
probability of a disaster in each country can be generated by a world disaster shock, dNtw ,

or a country-specific shock, dNtj . In turn, each of these shocks are driven by their own

time-varying probability processes as in equations (5) and (16).

   As such, the correlation of consumption is a mixture of the independent and common

jump processes. For example, in the special case when the probability of disasters is constant

so that λit + λw    i   w
               t = λ + λ , ∀t, the consumption correlation is:


                                       !
                           dCti dCtj                   σ i σ j ρij + K i K j λw
                Corr        i
                               , j         =q                       q                      (20)
                           Ct−  Ct−          (σ i )2 + (K i )2 λw ((σ j )2 + (K j )2 λw

                  j Zj
where K j ≡ (eω          − 1) as before. However, note that the probability of world disasters

λw must now be lower since the total probability of a disaster is given by the sum of the

probabilities, λit + λw
                      t . In order to match the data, we therefore impose the condition that

                                                                          w              i
the means of the two intensity processes equals that of the data; or τ i λ + (1 − τ i ) λ = λ
                                                                                            ei

      ei is the weighted mean of the joint Poisson process and 0 < τ i < 1 is the share of
where λ

disaster risk of country i that is due to country-specific disasters.

   In this case, the consumption correlations will be lower than in the case of common world

disasters due to the presence of uncorrelated country-specific disasters, thereby lowering λw .

The realizations of these common and country-specific disaster events therefore affect equity

correlations as well. The probability of a disaster for country i given that country j is in a

disaster will lie between the extreme cases of 0 and 1.

   Identifying the share of country-specific versus world disaster probabilities poses a diffi-

culty with empirically evaluating the differing disaster risks across countries. Since there are

not enough disaster events in a given country, there are insufficient observations to detect


                                                  47
common versus country-specific disaster events. However, Lewis and Liu (2015) propose an

identification approach that is useful in this context. Given the pattern of consumption cor-

relation such as in equation (20) along with the implied correlation patterns of asset returns

in the model, we can recover the relevant patterns for identification such as λi , λw . Using

the framework above, we can vary the share of country-specific disaster risk through τ i to

match the observed correlation patterns.

   Table 7 demonstrates the relationship implied by varying τ i between 0 and 1 for the Static

Disaster case in Panel A and the Time-Varying Disaster case in Panel B. To be consistent

with our prior analysis, we set λ̃i = 3.55%. We continue to maintain the assumption that

the variance of the probability of country-specific and world disasters are the same, as for

the case of the U.S. and U.K. example. As the weight on the world disaster increases, the

correlation of asset returns increases. For example, for the Time-Varying case under normal

times (signified by the Conditional rows), the correlation of equity returns increases from

0.055 when disasters are uncorrelated to 0.946 when they are perfectly correlated. A similar

pattern holds for the bill rate.

   The table results suggest combinations of world and country-specific disasters that may

match the pattern of correlations given that consumption correlations are equal to their data

counterparts by construction. Using again the example of the Conditional period Time-

Varying Disaster case, when τ = 0.6, the correlation of equity returns is 0.59 while that of

bill returns in 0.61, both close to their data counterparts of 0.58 and 0.63, respectively. The

fit to the full sample period reported as the Unconditional results are not as tight, in part

because of the low data correlation of 0.12 over the full period since 1870. This tendency

may reflect an increase in consumption correlations over time as the world has become more

                                              48
integrated. Overall, the evidence suggests a higher degree of world disaster risk than country

disaster risk is needed to explain the degree of co-movement between asset returns.




4     Concluding Remarks

A growing literature examines the impact of disaster risk on the macroeconomy and asset

returns. Indeed, the relevance of this risk has become more evident since the recent financial

crises. A standard approach in this literature is to use international data to make inferences

about the frequency and size of these disasters. Nevertheless, the focus of these studies has

largely targeted U.S. consumption and asset return behavior.

    In this paper, we began to ask what this literature means from an international per-

spective. For this purpose, we evaluated international asset returns through the lens of a

canonical disaster risk model as articulated in Barro (2006, 2009) and allowing for time-

varying disasters as in Wachter (2013). Our analysis led to three main findings. First, while

the disaster risk model does well in explaining U.S. asset returns, it is less successful in

matching the range of asset return behavior observed internationally. Second, the degree to

which the model can explain international asset return co-movements hinges largely on the

importance of a common disaster risk across countries. Specifically, if the frequency and size

of disasters is independent across countries, the correlation of asset returns is implausibly

low. By contrast, if all disasters are common, these correlations are near one and, hence,

unrealistically large. Third, these findings suggest that international correlations of asset

returns and consumption can provide an identification of the importance of world versus

country-specific disasters. Calibrating the model to the correlations between the U.S. and


                                             49
the U.K. implies that 60% of the disaster risk is common between the two countries. Overall,

this paper shows that the international dimensions of standard disaster risk models carry

important implications for their saliency.

A         Appendix: Asset Return Solutions

In the text, we use solutions for asset returns for each country that follow from straightfor-

ward extensions of the analysis in Wachter (2013) Appendix A. While we summarize these

solutions here, interested readers may wish to consult Wachter (2013) for detailed derivations.



A.1        The Value Function

The asset returns are determined through the intertemporal first order condition maximizing

consumption and portfolio allocations given income. Since wealth is related to equilibrium

consumption through the budget constraint in equation (3), these returns depend upon their

riskiness relative to a claim on realizations of consumption in all future periods (Epstein

and Zin (1989,1991), Duffie and Epstein (1992)) and a risk-free rate. Using this relationship

allows us to solve for the value function and, as described in below, the state price density

and risk-free rate as we describe below. Given these solutions, the price of any other asset can

then be determined through standard arbitrage arguments as described in Wachter (2013).

       Defining the price of a claim on Ctj for the representative agent in country j as Stj and

assuming that the consumption process has the form given in equation (4), the price of this

claim follows34 :
                                                                 jZ
                           dStj = µSt−
                                    j            j
                                       dt + σ j St− dBtj + (eω     t
                                                                            j
                                                                       − 1)St− dNtj                       (21)


Next, defining αtj as the fraction of wealth Wtj that the representative agent allocates to this

risky asset, the price-dividend ratio for country j as `j ≡ (Stj /Ctj ) and (1 − αtj ) fraction of
  34
    Since the purpose of this appendix is to consider possible differences across countries, we signify differ-
ences across countries with j superscripts. Note, however, that we do not impose any assumption about the
degree of integration or comovement in assets in these derivations. We return to these issues in Appendix B
below.


                                                      64
their wealth to the risk free asset, then the wealth process for country j follows:



dWtj = Wtj αtj dStj + Wtj (1 − αtj )rtj dt − Ctj dt                                                                              (22)
                                        −1                                                                            jZ
         = (αtj Wt−
                  j
                    (µ − rtj + `j                   j j
                                              ) + Wt− rt − Ctj )dt + αtj Wt−
                                                                           j
                                                                             σ j dBtj + αtj Wt−
                                                                                              j
                                                                                                (eω                      t
                                                                                                                             − 1)dNtj



   Thus, αtj is investor j’s portfolio share in the consumption asset while (1 − αtj ) is investor

j’s portfolio share in a country j risk-free asset. Note that in this formulation of wealth,

the price-dividend ratio for this consumption claim `j = Ctj /Wtj is a constant because the
                                                                 


intertemporal elasticity of consumption is one (see Weil (1990)).

   Defining the value function as H(Wtj , λjt ), the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation relates

the instantaneous expected change in the value function plus flow utility to zero at the

optimum, similar to the role of the Bellman equation in discrete time. Given the wealth

process in equation (22), the risky asset process in equations (21), the felicity function in

equation (2), and solving for this HJB as a direct application of Ito’s lemma with jumps (see

Duffie(2010)) implies that this equation is:



   sup {HW (αtj Wtj (µ − rtj + (ltj )−1 ) + Wtj rtj − Ctj ) + Hλ κ(λ − λjt ) + 12 HW W (αtj Wtj σ j )2
  αjt ,Ccj                                                                                                                       (23)
                                                         j
     + 21 Hλλ σλ2 λjt   +   λjt Eν [H(Wt (1   +   αtj (eω Z   −   1)), λjt )   −   H(Wtj , λjt )]   +   f (Ctj , J)}   =0


where Hi and Hiq are the first and second derivatives of H with respect to i and to i and

q, respectively, and Eν is the expectation taken over the time invariant distribution ν of Z.

Solving this equation for the value function H(Wtj , λjt ) then provides the utility from lifetime

consumption as a function of state variables Wtj and λjt . In equilibrium, Wtj is given by the



                                                              65
consumption asset so that, αtj = 1. Using this fact along with the consumption process in

equation (4), we solve for this value function by guess-and-verify following the conjecture

form in Wachter (2013) :


                                                                              1−γ
                                                                          Wtj
                                   H(Wtj , λjt )     =I   j
                                                              (λjt )1−γ            .         (24)
                                                                          1−γ

Using this form of the value function and the envelope condition that HW = UC (C, V ), it

follows that: `j = ` = β −1 . Thus, with identical preferences, all countries have the same

wealth-consumption ratio, even though they are potentially priced in completely segmented

financial markets with different consumption units. Further conjecturing the explicit form

for the proportionality term in the value function as


                                                                  j +bj λj

and following the same steps as Wachter (2013), it can be shown that for the benchmark

case considered in the text when σλj = σλ ; κj = κ, ∀j = 1, ...J:

Note that the effects on the value function from time-variation in the disaster intensities,

λt , as captured by bj in equation (26) only differ across countries according to how much

consumption declines when a disaster occurs, as measured by ω j . However, the constant



                                                          66
effect as captured by aj in equation (27) also varies by countries according to the volatility

of normal times consumption, σ j , reflecting cross-country heterogeneity across countries from

the standard certainty equivalent consumption measure.



A.2     Risk Free Rate

Substituting the solutions for bj and aj in equations (26) and (27) into equation (25) and

the result into equation (24) gives the explicit solution for the value function. Further

substituting this value function solution into the HJB equation (23) and taking the derivative

with respect to αtj implies the following first order condition:


                                                                            jZ                 jZ
            (µ − rtj + `−1 ) − γαtj (σ j )2 + λjt Ev [(1 + αtj (eω               − 1))−γ (eω        − 1)] = 0.   (28)



Using the facts noted earlier that `−1 = β and that in equilibrium αtj = 1 and rearranging

equation (28) to solve for rtj verifies the risk-free rate equation (6) given in the paper repeated

here:
                                                        h    j     j
                                                                          i
                          rtj = β + µ − γ(σ j )2 + λjt E e−γω Z (eω Z − 1)



A.3     The State Price Density

The state price density measures the agent’s value of holding risky assets according to the

intertemporal marginal utility of consumption. Following Duffie and Skiadas (1994), this

state price is:
                                           Z   t                       
                             πtj   = exp            UV (Csj , Vsj )ds       UC (Csj , Vsj ).                     (29)
                                            0




                                                          67
Using the solution for the value function in equations (24) and (25), the envelope condition

that HW = fC (C, V ) implies that the marginal untility of consumption is:



                                      UC (Ctj , Vtj ) = β γ (Ctj )−γ I j (λjt ).



Applying Ito’s Lemma to the state price equation (29) and using the solutions for the terms

in the value function in equations (26), and (27), this form for marginal utility gives the

solution for the state price in equation (7) of the text rewritten here:


                 dπtj

                                            − 1).



A.4     Government Bill Rate

Modifying Wachter (2013) to be country-specific, the price of government debt is:



                                      dLjt  b,j       ω j ZL,t
                                       j = rt dt + (e          − 1)dNtj                                     (31)
                                      Lt−

where ZL,t = Zt with probability q j ; ZL,t = 0 with probability (1−q j ). Using the relationship

between the state-price density in equation (30) and the price of government debt in equation

(31), the drift term rtb,j can be solved as:


                                                            h                          i
                                                                −γω j Z           ωj Z
                          rtb,j   =   rtj   +   λjt q j E    (e         − 1)(1 − e ) ,




                                                               68
obtaining equation (8) in the text.



A.5       Equity Price

The price of equity is the value of a perpetual claim on dividends, defined as Dt . Then

letting Ftj denote a claim on the dividends in country j, this price has the form given by

equation (9) in the text given here:


                                                        ∞
                                                                  πsj
                                                    Z
                                        Ftj   = Et (        Dsj       ds)
                                                    t             πtj


Following Abel (1999) as well as Wachter (2013) and Gouirio, Siemer and Verdelhan (2013),

among others, we identify these dividends in the data as a levered claim on consumption,
            φ j
Dtj = Ctj          , where φj is the leverage parameter. Using Ito’s Lemma, the dividend process

is:
                           1 j 2 j                                   j    j
         dDtj = φj (µ +                 j
                             σ (φ − 1))Dt−              j
                                           dt + σ j φj Dt− dBtj + [(eω Z )φ − 1)]Dt−
                                                                                  j
                                                                                     dNtj .
                           2

Using this relationship and applying Ito’s Lemma to the equity price equation (9) verifies

the equity price diffusion given in equation (11) in the text repeated here:


                      dFtj

                        j = µF,t dt + φ σ dBt + g σλ         λjt dBλ,t
                                                                   j
                                                                       + (eφ            − 1)dNtj .
                      Ft−


                            0             0
where g j = Gj0 (λjt )/Gj (λjt ) where Gj (λjt ) is the price-dividend ratio for the equity of country

j.

      We use this price process in combination with the dividend payout process to generate

equity returns in the quantitative analysis. Calculating these returns requires valuing the

                                                    69
dividend payout strips at each future date as described in Wachter (2013), Appendix A.III.




B         Appendix: International Correlations

This appendix describes the cross-country correlations solutions reported in Section 3 in

the text given various assumptions about disaster events. The consumption processes in

equation (4) are repeated here:


                                                      jZ

                                                            − 1)Ct− dNtj , ∀ = 1, ..., J



where Ntj is a Poisson process with time-varying intensity parameter, λjt , given by equation

(5) as:
                                                      q
                              dλjt = κ λ − λjt dt + σλ λjt dBλ,t
                                                             j
                                              



Similarly, the stock prices are in equation (11) and the risk-free rate is in equation (6).

    Independent Country Poisson Processes: When dNtj are independent Poisson pro-
             j
cesses and dBλ,t are uncorrelated across countries, then inspection of equations (4) and

(11) demonstrates that international correlations of consumption and equity prices only
                                                          dCt dCtj          dFt dFtj

arise through the ”normal times” Brownians. Thus, Corr C i , C j = Corr F i , F j =
                                                                        t−   t−            t−   t−


Corr(dBti , dBtj ) ≡ ρij . Moreover, since risk-free rates given in equation (6) only vary due
                                    j
to the Brownian on the intensity, dBλ,t , and these are independent across countries, then

Corr rti , rtj = 0.

    Common World Poisson Process: When disasters are driven by a common world

Poisson process, the dNtj are replaced by a common world process dNtw with its own in-

tensity process, dλw
                   t . In this case, the correlation between the disaster components across


countries is one. Also, since the variance of a Poisson process is equal to its intensity,
                                   

Corr (eω Z − 1)dNtw , (eω Z − 1)dNtw = (eω Z − 1)(eω Z − 1)λw t Since the normal times


Brownians dBtj and the disaster risk components, dNtw and dBλ,t

each other, the correlation of consumption becomes:

                                     !                             i            j

when the intensity process is constant over time, thus verifying equation (17). Following

similar steps, the correlation in stock price changes with constant intensity is:

                              !                                    i   i            j   j

   Mixed Independent and Common World Poisson Processes: When disasters are

driven by both processes, the consumption process is as in equation (19) in the text:


                          dCtj           j      ωj Z
                                      j
                           j = µdt + σ dBt + (e      − 1)(dNtj + dNtw )
                          Ct−


Again, the country disasters dNtj are independent and therefore add no correlation to interna-

tional consumption. However, the world disaster is perfectly correlated as above. Therefore

following the same steps as for the Common World Poisson Process implies the solution in

equation (19).

To compute model moments, we first simulate a long time series (50,000 years) of shocks to

consumption growth (dBt ), shocks to disaster intensity (dBλ,t ), and consumption declines in

disaster (Zt ). In the time varying case, we compute the time series of λt using equation (5),

the shock to the disaster intensity (dBλ,t ), and parameters (κ, σλ ). Then with the generated

series of disaster probabilities, λt , we simulate the Poisson process (dNt ), which determines

whether there is a disaster in each period, and combine it with Zt , which is the change to

consumption growth in the event of a disaster, to form a disaster series. Finally, we combine

the disaster series with simulated direct consumption growth shocks (dBt ) to compute the

consumption process described in equation (4) over 50,000 years. Then applying the above

closed-form solutions with a given preference parameters, we compute the model implied

asset returns and model moments.



C.2     Single Country Simulated Method of Moments

In Section 2, we use Simulated Method of Moments (SMM) to find the parameters that

best match the data moments of consumption and asset return moments for each country.


                                              72
As noted in Section 2, we find the best fit for four parameters: the probability of govern-

ment bond default, q j ; the dividend-consumption leverage parameters, φj ; the proportion of

disaster state consumption decline, ω j ; and the volatility of normal times consumption, σ j .

All of these parameter fits are further conditioned on the mean consumption growth rate

parameter µ that is set equal to the average mean growth rate across countries. Using SMM,

we find the best fitting parameters of the model to target seven data moments: (a) the mean

government bill rate, (b) the standard deviation of the government bill rate, (c) the mean

equity premium, (d) the standard deviation of the equity return, (e) the Sharpe ratio, and

(f) the consumption growth standard deviation.

      For this purpose, we simulate the model to obtain the seven data moments and iterate on

values of q j , σ j , φj , and ω j until the sum of squared difference between the data and model

moments are minimized. Specifically, we begin with an initial guess for the parameters (q j ,

σ j , φj , and ω j ) anchored by the parameters values in Wachter (2013). Then drawing a long

time series of shocks (dBt , dBλ,t , Zt ), we simulate the consumption process described in

equation (4) over 50,000 years. For the parameters not being estimated, such as preference

parameters (β, γ) and mean consumption growth (µ), we use values advocated by Barro

(2006) for the constant disaster risk case and Wachter (2013) for the time varying disaster

risk case. Given these shocks and parameters, we compute model-implied moments described

above. This set of model moments is then compared to the data to arrive at a Sum of Squared

Difference. To find the set of parameters that achieve the lowest sum of squared difference,

this process is repeated over a ranges of parameters, with each iteration computing the model

implied moments using the same set of shocks but different parameter values.35

      In general, less than 100 iterations are need to find the combination of parameter values that minimize


                                                      73
   Although our long history run of 50, 000 Brownians and Poisson draws should provide a

fairly accurate measure of the distribution of the parameters, we take the simulation a step

further in order to ensure stability of the estimates. For this purpose, we repeat the entire

procedure described above multiple times (50 times for the time-invariant case, 25 times for

the time-varying case). Tables 2 and 4 report the average of the parameter estimates across

these simulation runs. We find that our estimates are little changed after multiple runs,

suggesting that the estimates are indeed stable.



C.3     International Country Correlation

In Section 3, we report implied model consumption and asset return correlations with various

assumptions about the comovement in disasters across countries. In order to make sure our

results are not driven by asymmetries across countries, we consider two identical countries

with parameters calibrated as in Wachter (2013) with µ = 0.025, σ = 0.02, q = 0.4, κ = 0.08,

σλ = 0.067. All cases treat the ”normal times” consumption as a common drift µ and

standard deviation σ as before. However, in this case, the cross-country correlation of the

”normal times” consumption Brownians ρ12 are measured from the correlation between the

U.S. and the U.K. in the post-War period without disasters as given in Tables 6 and 7 in

the ”Data” column.

   In Table 6, we further calculate the disaster events in two polar ways. The ”No Disaster

Correlation” case generates the simulated disaster effects by drawing two independent Pois-

son processes {dNt1 , dNt2 } and, moreover, two individual draws of the size of the disasters,
the sum of squared difference. However, this depends somewhat on the range on each parameter. Given
model boundary condition constraints, we typically bound our parameter estimates to be ω ∈ [0.7, 1.0],
φ ∈ [1.5, 3.5], q ∈ [0.2, 0.6].

Ztj .36 Furthermore, for the ”Time Varying Disaster” case reported in Panel B, the intensities
                                                    1
of disasters, λit , are generated from draws of the dBλ,t     2
                                                          , dBλ,t processes as independent zero

normal variables and hence these intensities are uncorrelated. Table 6 also reports the op-

posite case as ”Perfect Disaster Correlation.” In this case, a common world Poisson process

dNtw is generated with a common disaster effect Ztw .

       Table 7 reports correlations of simulated data from a hybrid case with both independent

and common disasters. Generating the disaster effects for this case follows the same steps as

above, but generates the Poisson process as dNtj + dNtw where the mean of the probability
                              w              i
of this joint Poisson is τ i λ + (1 − τ i ) λ = λ
                                                ei where λ
                                                         ei = 3.55%, the frequency of disaster

imposed before.37 Since we use a single draw to generate the Poisson processes, we further

assume that the size of the disaster Z is the same whether it originates from the world

disaster through dNtw , or originates from the individual country through dNtj . As before,

the distribution of the intensity processes are the same.




  36
     Barro (2006) and Wachter (2013) assume the disaster process is uniform. Therefore, we checked our
simulations based upon the Poisson process by comparing to the Uniform distribution case, finding similar
results. We base our simulations on the Poisson assumption to ensure that our cross-country correlations
accurately correspond with the model.
  37
     We approximate this process in our simulation as a single Poisson process calculated as a mixture of
two Poisson processes. This process in turn is used to generate asset returns as described in Appendix A
as a mixture of Poissons in place of the given Poisson jump process dN . As this approximation imposes
restrictions on the joint process of returns, we intend to relax these restrictions in future work.
