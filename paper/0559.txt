Price Level Determinacy with an Interest Rate Policy Rule and Rational Ecpectations


                                          ABSTRACT


       This    paper reconsiders a result obtained by Sargent and Wallace, namely,

that   price    level indeterminacy obtains in their well-known model if the monetary

authorities adopt a policy feedback rule for the interest rate rather than the

money stock. Since the Federal Reserve seems often to have used the federal

funds rate as its operating instrument, with the money stack determined by the

quantity demanded, this result suggests that the Sargent-Wallace model -- as

well as others incorporating rational expectations --      is   inconsistent with U.S.

experience. It is here shown, however, that the indeterminacy result vanishes

if the interest rate rule is chosen so as to have sonie desired effect on the

expected quantity of money demanded. This revised conclusion holds even if

considerable weight is given, in the choice of a rule, to the aim of smoothing

interest rate fluctuations.

I.    IntroductIon


       It would be unreasonable to argue that the Sargent—Wallace (1975)

paper, "'Rational' Expectations, the Optimal Monetary Instrument, and

the Optimal Money Supply Rule," has been neglected by the profession;

in fact, it has been frequently cited by both admirers and critics.

Virtually all of the attention, however, has been devoted to its policy—

ineffectiveness or "neutrality" result: that, in the rather orthodox

IS—LM—NRPc model considered, the "probability distribution of output

is [with rational expectations] independent of the particular determin-

istic money supply rule in effect" (1975, p. 241).        By contrast,

practically no attentIon has been devoted to the paper's second major

conclusion: that, in the same model and again with rational expectations,

"under an interest rate rule the price level is indeterminate" (1975,

p. 241). Indeed, the only discussions of this result that I have seen

are in Sargent's own Macroeconomic Theory (1979, pp. 360—363) and in very

recent papers by Taylor (1979) and Turnovsky (1980). The purpose of

the present paper, accordingly, is to discuss and reconsider this second

result of the Sargent—Wallace (S—W) analysis.

       The empirical relevance of an interest rate rule is, it would seem,

undeniable; knowledgeable observers of the U.S. monetary policy behavior agree

that the federal funds rate, rather than some measure of aggregate reserves,

has been used for substantial periods of time as the Fed's operating policy
             2/
instrument.—      To accept this view, it   might   be added, is not to deny that the

FCd   has been serious in its professed desire to influence the (Ml)     money stock
or some other aggregate, but simply to recognize that this influence has been

effected by setting the interest rate period—by—period at levels that

                                      —1—
                              —2—




are expected to make the quantity demanded of money (or the relevant

monetary aggregate) equal to the desired amount, perhaps modified to

keep interest rates from moving torapidly. Since observations on the

money stock are cbtained with substantial lags, the Fed must of necessity

seek to control it by setting either an interest rate or a reserve

variable; in fact it has used the former)-'

     The relevance of the Sargent—Wallace model with the rationality

assumption is perhaDs more controversial. But the aggregate demand

(IS and LM). portions of •the model are highly orthodox, and the Phillips

curve or aggregate supply function is quite representative of relation-

ships found in "practical" macroec000metric models designed to describe

the economy of the United States)' Indeed, it is because the Sargent—

Wallace structure cas basically orthodox that their neutrality conclusion

was viewed by the profession as so striking.

     How, then, is one to interpret the Sargent—Wallace price—level

indeterminacy result? While a few economists might be tempted to use

it as an "explanation" of recent price level behavior, I believe that

would be inappropriate: the result says that the price level is not defined,

not that it is high or rapidly rising. What the result seems to suggest,

empirically, is erratic movements in both upward and downward directions of

 the price level (and the money stock). Consequently, the appropriate con-

 clusion might appear to be that the SargentWallace model with expectational

 rationality provides a seriously misleading picture of the U.S. economy.

 Indeed, it might appear that the indeterminacy result provides the basis for

 an empirical refutation of a wide class of rational expectations   models!
      But that conclusion, too, would be unwarranted. The reason is that,
                               —3—




despite appearances, the S—W result is not   entirely   general; i.e., does

not apply to all interest rate rules. In fact, it does riot apply to

rules in which the rate is set so as to influence the money stock, as is

done by the Fed. Only if the ultimate effects on money are entirely

disregarded in the design of the rule does the indeterminacy prevail.

The purpose of the following sections is to establish the validity of

this claim.

 II. The Model


        in the discussion that fo1los, the basic an1ytical context will

 be the slightly modified version of the S—W model: used in Sargent's (1979)

more recent exposition. Accordingly, let us begin with the following

 specifications of the IS,            LM, and NC functions:


 (1)             b + bi[r —                      - pr)]   + v'   ,
                                                                                b1
                                                                                     <   0



 (2) m — p.             c + c1r + c9 +                                          C1 <     0 <



 (3)             a0 +   a1(p —   Eip)        +   a2Yi +

 Here        Pt and          are logarithms of output, the price level, and                    the
 money stock, while r i               the   nominal rate of interest. The operator

        denotes the expectation of the indicated variable within the model

 at hand and conditional upon values of all variables in periods t—l

 and earlier. The stochastic variables u,                    Vt and       are   generated by

 white     noise processes and are independent of past values of all variables.


        It might be noted that the S—W paper expresses the real interest rate

in the IS function as r —
                                       Et           +   E1p ,        rather   than

   —
       E   lt+l +       p.     This    leads one to ask which          specification         is appropriate.

In a macroeconomic model of the S—W type, EiP represents an average

across individual agents or markets of agents' perceptions of the current

aggregate price level, while Pt represents an average over agents or

markets of "local' prices. Consequently, if the expected inflation rate

that    agents    use to convert nominal into real interest rates, for decision
                                 —5—




making purposes, is one that involves current and anticipated future

local prices, then the formulation in (1) will be appropriate.!! Another

specificational issue is whether wealth terms should also be included in

(l) The presence of a real money—balance term,        —         would not

affect the results in any significant way and so can be omitted for

simplicity. The presence of a term reflecting private holdings of

government bonds, on the other hand, would eliminate the price level

indeterminacy. To see that this is true in a static classical

model is an extremely simple exercise and a useful extension to a dynamic

setting more like that of Sargent—Wallace was recently provided by

Turnovsky (1980). It is, however, debatable whether bonds should be

modelled as constituting net wealth to the private sector; the contrary

"Ricardian" view (that the capitalized value of implied future tax

liabilities precisely offsets the value of currant bond holdings) ha

been given important support by Barro (1974). [n any event, one object

of the present paper is to show that determinacy does not require valid-

ity of the non—Ricardian view. Consequently, wealth terms will be

omitted in the subsequent analysis.

     The object in what follows will be to derive equations representing

the stochastic behavior of   p under various specifications of policy,

all of which presume that the monetary authority's behavior is represent-

able as a linear feedback rule for    r. In conducting the analysis, I

shall use the "dtd coefficients" procedure introduced into the

macroeconomic literature by Lucas (1972). In this way it will be

possible to express the S—W indeterminacy result in a different, and
                                           —6—


perhaps      intuitively appeaLing, way   and also to obLain—w.t1! -oniu   1os- of

generality——greater       explicitness in our new result.

       Before turning to •the analysis, however, it will be useful to

simplify the model even further. Since output is, in this model.,

independent of policy, its behavior is basically irrelevant to the issues

at hand. Thus nothing of importance will be lost, and considerable

computational simplicity will be gained, if we simply treat output as a'

constant. With this done, we can (by appropriate definitions of h0,

       and v) express the model as
c0,

(1') r                               +
               b0 +    Et lPt+i Pt
(2') m         Pt +    c0 + c1r +
plus    a policy rule for rt.

        As one more preliminary point, let us note that nothing would be

gained by appending to the model a money supply function reflecting

hank behavior, such as


             = h   +
 (4)                     + v1r +

where h is a reserve aggregate and               a disturbance. For with

determined by a policy rule, (4) would simply explain h with the variables

of major macroeconomic interest determined by the system (O—(3) or

 (i'),(2'). Furthermore, there would be no point in interpreting

as (e.g.) the treasury bill rate and introducing a separate variable

for    the   federal   funds rate——which would then enter (4) as a distinct
argument——if the model were then closed with an          "efficient   markets'
relation such as
                                     —6 a—




(5)
       r       +        +t

with       white   noise, etc. The reason is that,. clearly, this last

equation makes any discrepancy between rt             random and uiiinteresting

Consequently, most analyses of the instrument problem have been
                                                     9/
conducted in models with only one interest rate.—

III.           The Sargent—Wallace Result


           Let us now develop our version of the S—W indeterminacy result.

Given our use of the undetermined coefficients approach, it is
                                                                              necessary

tospecify the variables that appear in the authority's policy rule for

r. To keep the analysis as simple as possible,                let   us consider the

deterministic rule


(6)        r           + p1r1
where p0. and p1 would presumably be positive. As in McCallum (1978),
the analysis proceeds            by using the mGdel's   linearity and the white noise
property         of the     disturbances to express Pt and m as reduced—form functions
of    the sole predetermined variable            r1 and the current disturbances.

Thus for appropriate values of the 1T• parameters we have


(7a) p                  + 11r1 + ri2v       +


(7b)               20 + 21r1 +              ÷

And our immediate object, necessary for understanding the dynamic behavior

of p and m ,
       t           t   is   to determine the values of the ii.    coefficients in   terms
of    the basic parameters appearing in (1'), (2'), and (6).

       As a preliminary step, note that


(8)
       Eip+1 rio + r1iiE1r                   n10 + r11(p0 + piri)
Then   putting (6), (7a), and (8) into           (1') we obtain
                                                                —8—

But for this equation to hold for arbitrarY: values of the system's

variables, the                 following              relations must characterize the ii.

the model. This result is reminiscent of Sargent's observations regarding

the consequence of a pegged interest rate in a textbook—style classical

model (1979, pp. 9495).

IV.      Analysis     with Revised Polity Rule


         Our object now is to respecify the interest rate rule in a way that

will make it more "realistic," i.e., will make it more nearly representa-

tive of actual Fed behavior as described above. The crucial aspct to

be emphasized is that the rule is chosen not arbitrarily, but so as to

provide some desired effect on the quantity of money demanded. The

purest case would be that in which the policy rule for r is designed

to make the expected value of                equal to some target value such as


(13) m u0 +

with          presumably positive. In this pure case the rule would be to set

r equal t.o the value


              =
(14) r              c1)(0 +    j1r1 — c0       —
                                                    E1p)
which makes the expected value of money demand equal to                  m .   Of course

this rule differs from the type considered by S—W because its coefficients

depend (via E1p) on behavioral parameters of the model, but it can

still be expressed as a feedback rule.

         More general than the foregoing is the case in which, instead of

(14) ,    the     rule is


          r
(15)
                   (/c1)(j0 + i1r      — c0 -       Etip + (1   —




with 0 <             < 1.   Clearly this   specification says       that the monetary
authority         sets r with some weight       given to the target vaue of m, hut
with weight also given to the objective of interest rate smoothing (i.e.,
the avoidance of fluctuations in re). Thus the smaller is the value of

•, the less weight is given to the attainment of the target value nit and

the more weight is given to smoothing. Since this formulation is perhaps

more realistic than (14), and includes (14) as a special case, we shall

now assume po3ic behavior as specified in (15).

       Analysis of the model (1'), (2'), (15) begins with the computations

From these last two we immediately obtain                                            1 and IT13   0, while

In order to tell which root is relevant, consider the special case in

which      = 1 and               0. In this case ri does not appear in the

structural equations so we should have                                  =   0.       And (21) reduces, in this

case, to


(22)           =    (l/2){(1     -
                                     c1)
                                           1 -        c1)2      I




Since    1 —
                c1 is a positive number, (22) gives                              iT11
                                                                                        = Ofor    the negative square

root. Therefore, we conclude that the smaller root is generally relevant

in (21), which then determines

       Given ir11, finally, we find                        from (19) as


(23)                   — c0 —                  —
        IT10                         b0c1/(l       iT11)

Thus we see that all of the coefficients in (7a) are well defined by

the model. With the interest rate rule (L5), the price level is

determinate in the S—W model.

       For cornp]eteness, we might note that substitution into (2') gives

Inspection shows these to be sufficient to determine the coefficients in

(7b) so             is also determinate.

       It is perhaps worth emphasizing that the foregoing- result implies

a determinate price, level even when values of                                      are small; i.e., when

the authority emphasizes interest rate smoothing and attends to its

monetary target only slightly. Only for .O does' the indeterminacy

result prevail. It is in that respect that indeterminacy obtains only

if the rule's effects on money are tentire1y disregarded,' as claimed

above.

       In conclusion, it                should perhaps be emphasized that the foregoing
result does not formally contradict the Sargent—Wallace conclusion, for their
analysis presumes that the parameters in the interest rate teedhac.k rule
are autonomous——i. e. , unrel at ed to behavioral parameters -                                   But   rules of
the general type described in (15) would seem to he o[ greater practical

relevance. And the existence of interest rate rules of that type

provide, as e have seen, no basis for concluding that the S—W model

or other rational expectations models are inconsistent with data recently

generated by the U.S. economy. Finally, it should be said that the

foregoing discussion suggests that use of an interest rate instrument

is feasible, not that It is desirable.

                                Appendix

     The object here is to show that the deterrninacy result of Section 4

remains intact under the alternative versions of the IS function mentioned

in footnote 8. First, if (1') is replaced with


(1") r b0 + EP÷i — Pt       + Vt

the first two equalities in (19) become

                              + (11rll) = b


     (1—r11)(/c1)(1-11) -    ri1(l-)      =



The second of these yields r11 in a manner analogous to (20) in

Section 4, which permits determination o.f       from the first.



     Next, if the Sargent—Wallace IS function is used .with the deter-

ministic policy rule (15) and output is treated as a constant, the

disturbance v must be removed from (1') and thus from (7). The

solution is then as in Section 4 except that             =   0.   (Use of the

more complete supply function (3), even with a2 = 0, would of course

permit retention of vt.)

    have not been able to delineate the class rigorously, but it appears
that the indeterminacy result holds for most (perhaps all) models with
rational expectations and sensible steady—state properties. One example
of a model iith the indeterminacy but without the "policy ineffectiveness"
property is that of Phelps and Taylor (1977). Thus the price eve1 indeter-
minacy feature might even be regarded as reason for rejecting expectational
rationality.

This conclusion       can be obtained more rigorously in the context of an
'tisland model" of the type used by Lucas (1973). If there exists a security
traded in all localities so that agents observe an economy—wide interest
rate, the S—W neutrality result will riot hold, for reasons described by
Earro    (1979). Conclusions relevant to the present discussion remain intact,
however, and these also hold if the          S—W   formulation, with
     —
         E       +
                     Etip   ,   is used.    The relevant anaylsis is sketched in the

Since c1 < 0     ,   the coefficient on r1 in the latter exceeds 1.0.
Thus the implied behavior of               is explosive, even though the target
money stock is constant and the price level is white noise. This result
is analogous to ones in which the price level explodes with a constant
money stock. (For a discussiOn, see Flood and Carber (1980).) Some
authors have ruled out such solutions, using the explosive behavior as a
justification. The rationale employed here ——                    that     a variable which
appears nowhere in the model should not appear in reduced—form equations ——
seems preferable.
