    International Capital Mobility and Crowding Out in the U.S. Economy:
      Imperfect Integration of Financial Markets or of Goods Markets?




                                  ABSTRACT




        Conventional wisdom in the field of international finance holds
that the U.S. economy has become so open financiallly as to be
characterized by perfect capital mobility: a highly elastic supply of
foreign capital prevents the domestic rate of return from rising signifi-
cantly above the world rate of return. This view has been challenged
recently by the observation that investment rates are highly correlated with
national saving rates, and the claim by Feldstein and Horioka that this
correlation is evidence of relatively low capital mobility.

        The premise of this paper is that the Feldstein-Horioka finding
regarding crowding out in an open economy is strong enough to survive the
econometric critiques that have been leveled against it, but that it need
have nothing to do with the degree of capital mobility in the sense of the
openness of financial markets and the equalization of international interest
rates expressed in a common currency. It is real interest rates that
matter for questions of crowding out, and real interest parity requires not
just that nominal interest rates be equalized expressed in a common
currency, but also that purchasing power parity hold. It is well-known that
purchasing power parity does not in fact hold. Currently, for example, the
dollar is expected to depreciate in real terms. Thus real interest rate
parity fails and crowding out takes place because of imperfect injor
of goods markets, not imperfect integration of financial markets.

     Conventional wisdom in the field of international finance holds that

the U.S. economy has become so open financially as to be characterized by

perfect capital mobility: a highly elastic supply of foreign capital pre-

vents the domestic rate of return from rising significantly above the

world rate of return. This view has been challenged recently by the

observation that investment rates are highly correlated with national

saving rates, and the claim by Feldstein and Horioka that this correlation

is evidence of relatively low capital mobility. The experience of the

United States in the 1980s seems to confirm this challenge. The decline

in U.S. national saving has been partly offset by a capital inflow from

abroad, but the effect has not been large enough to prevent U.S. real

interest rates from rising and to an extent crowding out domestic investment.

     The premise of this paper is that the Feldstein—Horioka finding

regarding crowding out in an open economy Is strong enough to survive the

econometric critiques that have been levelled against.it, but that it

need have nothing to do with the degree of capital mobility in the sense

of the openness of financial markets and the equalization of international

interest rates expressed in a common currency. It is real interest rates

that matter for questions of crowding out, and real interest parity

requires not just that nominal interest rates be equalized expressed in a

common currency, but also that purchasing power parity hold. It is

well—known that purchasing power parity does not in fact hold. Currently,
                                  —2—

for example, the dollar is expected to depreciate in real terms. Thus

real interest rate parity fails and crowding out takes place because of

imperfect integration of goods markets, not imperfect integration of

financial markets.

     Section I presents the issues in the context of crowding out by the

U.S. budget deficit in the 1980s. Section II presents regressions of

investment against national saving on U.S. historical data. Section III

discusses three distinct senses in which the term   "perfect   international

capital mobility" has been used: (1) closed interest parity, (2) uncovered

interest parity, and (3) real interest parity. It also attempts to see

how much of the real interest differential can be explained by expected

real depreciation. Section IV summarizes conclusions.


                I. International Capital Mobility and U.S.
                           Crowding Out in the 1980s

     It is a commonplace that the U.S. economy has over its history become

increasingly integrated into world goods markets and financial markets.

As regards goods markets, imports and exports (averaged) as a share of

GNP have risen gradually at an annual trend rate of .096 percent a year

over the last 55 years, reaching 9.1 percent of GNP in the 1980s. 1/

The percentage of the economy consisting of goods and services that are

potentially tradable internationally, as opposed to actually traded, is

of course considerably higher. International competition now reaches


  !/ The share averages .0379 for 1929—1944, .0478 for 1945—1973 and
.0897 for 1974—1984. Figures are from IMF data base. These long run
trends in U.S. trade are examined in Lipsey (1984). See also Cooper (1985).
                                  —3—

almost everywhere, beyond U.S. manufacturing into agriculture and services.

Long—run trends towards lower transportation costs, lower tariffs, and an

increasingly Integrated world culture, have all played their parts.

     U.S. financial markets are considered to be even more closely inte-

grated with the rest of the world than are goods markets. Here the

development of the Eurocurrency market, the removal of capital controls

when the Bretton Woods system ended, and the continued technological

progress in telecommunications and innovation in the banking system

worldwide have all been Important. Indeed the assumption of "perfect

capital mobility" has for 20 years now been standard in models of floating

exchange rates among the United States and most other major industrialized

countries, despite some of the surprisingly strong conclusions that

typically follow from it.

     One strong conclusion that Is thought to follow from perfect capital

mobility is that a fiscal expansion has no effects——neither a negative

effect on investment nor a positive effect on aggregate output. The

absence of an effect on Investment arises because a potentially infinite

capital inflow prevents the domestic interest rate from rising above the

world Interest rate, so that none of the crowding out of investment that

is usual in closed economy models occurs. The absence of an effect on

aggregate output arises because the currency appreciates and worsens the

trade balance by precisely enough to offset the gain in domestic demand.

One can see from a money market equilibrium condition that if the interest
                                  —4—

rate does not change, because it is tied to the foreign interest rate, and

the real money supply does not change, then real Income cannot change. 1/

     The question of fiscal crowding out has become especially topical In

the 1980s because of the large structural fiscal deficits run by the U.S.

federal government. According to some theories an Increase in government

dissaving should be precisely offset by an Increase in private saving, by

people putting aside money to help their children pay future taxes, so

that there is no effect on total national saving. (National saving Is

defined as whatever private saving is left over after the government

budget deficit has been subtracted out.) Whatever one thinks of the

theoretical merits of the argument, the results of the current experiment

seem clear. The Increase in federal dissaving from the 1970s to the 1980s

has not been matched by a rise in private saving. The rate of total

national saving has rather fallen, from 16.1 percent of GNP on average in

the period from 1973 to 1980 to 14.5 percent in the period fom 1981 to

1984. 2/

     As a matter of accounting identity, this fall in national saving

must equal the rise in net capital inflow from abroad plus the fall in

domestic investment. The question of interest is how the change is

divided up between the two. There has in fact been a large net capital

inflow, the counterpart of the record current account deficits, but it


      There are a number of ways that these strong results can be watered
down. One way particularly relevant for the United States is the large—
country point: to the extent that a fiscal expansion succeeds in driving
up the worldwide interest rate, it will have succeeded in raising income
and crowding out investment (both effects holding abroad as well as
domestically).
  2/ The decline in saving net of the capital consumption allowance has
been even more pronounced. See Table 4 in Friedman (1985).
                                   —5—

 has not been large enough to prevent the investment rate from falling,

 from 16.1 percent of GNP in the period from 1973 to 1980 to 15.4 percent

 In the period from 1981 to 1984. 1/

     More visibly, the capital inflow has not been large enough to prevent

U.S. real interest rates from rising sharply, even vis—a—vis foreign real

interest rates. There are of course different ways of measuring the real

interest rate. For questions of saving and investment, the long—term

nominal interest rate is to be preferred over the short—term rate. But

measuring inflation expectations is more problematic in the long term

than in the short term. Table 1 reports measures of long—term real

Interest rates using four measures of expected inflation that are available

for both the United States and major trading partners: a three—year lag

on past inflation (with weights .5, .3, and .2), forecasts by DRI, forecasts

by the OECD, and a survey by American Express of opinions among 250—300

central bankers, private bankers, corporate treasurers and finance directors,

and economists. By any of the four measures there was a clear increase

in the U.S. real interest rate after 1980, both absolutely and relative

to a weighted average of trading partners. The long—term real interest


  1/ The average investment rate in the 1981—1984 period encompasses a
fall in the first two recession years and a rise in the subsequent two
recovery years; investment, like saving, is of course highly procyclical.
There has been talk, especially in 1984, of an investment boom. But
Bosworth (1985) suggests that the favorable effect that the 1981 corpo-
rate tax law changes had on the cost of capital to firms was more than
offset by the unfavorable effect of the increase in real interest rates,
and that any appearances of an investment boom in 1983—85 were due to the
recovery and the existence of new computer technology. See also Friedman
(1985). In any case, it must be that the increase In real interest rates
has acted to depress investment relative to what It otherwise would be.

differential stood at about 3 percent in the first part of 1985, as

compared to —2 percent five years earlier.

     For those outside the field of international economics, the novel

feature of the 1980s is the magnitude of the U.S. capital inflow and of

its counterpart, the notorious record trade deficits. The unfavorable

effect of the latter on U.S. export and import—competing sectors has of

course received a great deal of attention; and the favorable effects of

the former, keeping interest rates from rising as much as they otherwise

would, have received some attention as well. But for those inside the

field the interesting question is rather, "if capital mobility is as

perfect as we have been assuming, why has there been     rise in the real

interest differential; why has the increase In the net capital inflow

not been large enough to prevent     crowding out of investment; and why

has the increase in the trade deficit not been large enough to counter-

act the expansionary effects of the fiscal policy so as not to leave

net effect on national income?"


                II. Correlations of Saving and Investment

1.   The Feldstein—Horioka methodology

     Even before the current episode, Feldstein and Horioka (1980) initiated

a controversy on the subject of the implications of perfect capital mobility.

They ran cross—section regressions of investment against national saving,

found coefficients much closer to one than to zero, and interpreted the

results as evidence that capital mobility is in fact far less than perfect.
                                        —8—

The argument was that if a country faced an infinitely elastic foreign

supply of capital that prevented the domestic rate of return from rising

above the foreign rate, then random variation in propensities to save or

in government deficits should be fully offset by international capital

flows, and there would be no reason for them to have any effect on invest-

ment rates.

     The Feldsteln—Horioka work has been subjected to a barrage of criti-

ques. Virtually all of them are econometric in nature. Little of the

commentary has tried to define better than did Feldstein and Horloka what

precisely is the hypothesis one is seeking to test, or how it relates

conceptually to more conventional definitions of capital mobility based

on rates of return. Doing so is one of the major aims of this paper. 1/

     But first we will address some of the econometric critiques of the

Feldstein—Horioka regressions. Consider the national saving identity

with each of its components specified as functions of the rate of return r:


     1(r) —   NS(r,   G) =   KA(r_r*)

where I is investment, NS is national saving, KA is the net capital inf low

from abroad, and C is government expenditure, or any other determinant of

NS thought to be exogenous. Then (assuming also r*, the foreign rate of

return, exogenous),

                                  NSc
                      =
     dC         dG        1 +   (rSr)/(r)
  1/ Two other papers that discuss both the Feldstein—Horioka notion of
international capital mobility and the more conventional definitions are
Boothe et al (1985) and Obstfeld (1985).
                                       —9—

This derivative is in general negative, assuming NS is. But it is zero if
       =   , and   is equal to the closed economy crowding out effect if KAr =   0.
        There are three basic econometric difficulties with regressions of

investment against national saving. The first, which arises only in time

series studies, is the strongly procyclical nature of both saving and

investment, even when expressed as shares of GNP (as they always are in

these studies). If an exogenous boom causes the saving rate and invest-

ment rate both to rise, we do not want to attribute it to low capital

mobility. For this reason, Feldstein and Horioka restricted their analysis

to cross—section data, as did most who followed in their footsteps. 1/

The second econometric difficulty is the "large country problem": the

United States and other major countries cannot take the world rate of

return r* as exogenous. Even if perfect capital mobility equates the

domestic interest rate to the world interest rate, a fall in domestic

saving will reduce domestic investment to the extent that it drives up

the world interest rate. 2/

       The third econometric difficulty is the general one of endogeneity

of the independent variable. The error term in the regression equation

consists of all factors determining investment, other than the rate of

return (and GNP). If they happen to be uncorrelated with the independent


  !I       Other cross—section studies include Fieleke (1982), Feldstein
(1983), Penati and Dooley (1984), Murphy (1984), Caprio and Howard (1985),
and Summers (1985). However, Obstfeld (1985) used time—series data, as
did Sachs (1981) but with the inclusion of a GNP gap variable.
  2/ Tobin (1983), Murphy (1984) and Obstfeld (1985) criticized Feldstein
and Horioka on these grounds.
                                   — 10 —




variable,   there is no problem. But this is unlikely, especially in light

of the identity linking saving and investment. Probably the most popular

criticism of the Feldsteln—Horioka regressions is the "policy reaction"

argument: governments react to current account imbalances so as to reduce

them. For example, if the goverment reacts to a trade deficit induced

by a random increase in investment, by cutting government expenditure or

raising taxes, then national saving and investment will be correlated for

reasons having nothing to do with capital mobilIty. 1/ If endogeneity of

national saving were the only problem, we could invert the equation and

regress national saving against investment; the hypothesis that capital

is in infinitely elastic supply at a given rate of return would still

imply a zero coefficient. This test would be equivalent (given the

national savings identity) to regressing the current account against

investment; the null hypothesis would in that case be a unit coefficient,

implying that any exogenous changes in investment are fully financed by

borrowing from abroad. This in fact is the equation run by Sachs (1981,

1983). But arguments as to why saving should be endogenous apply also to

investment. Clearly the right answer is that national saving, investment

and the current account are all endogenous, and no OLS regression is

appropriate.

     If the motivation is to see whether changes in private saving or the

government budget would crowd Out investment in an open economy, then we


  1/ The "policy reaction" argument has been made by Fieleke (1982), Tobin
(1983), Westphal (1983), Summers (1985), and Caprio and Howard (1984).

should indeed think of the former as the right—hand side variables and the

latter as the lefthand. But the technique that is required is instrurnen—

tal variables. Total government expenditure is probably not a good enough

instrument because under the policy—reaction argument it is endogenous.

Two better candidates are military expenditure and the age composition of

the population. The former is most immediately a determinant of the

government budget deficit and the latter of private saving. It is possible

to think of ways that either could be endogenous; it is conceivable that

military expenditure could be cut back in response to trade dficjts and

that the age composition of the population could respond to the growth

rate. It is also possible to think of ways that either could affect invest-

ment through routes other than saving and the rate of return. But these

two variables seem to meet the criteria for instruments at least as well

as most alleged instrumental variables in macroeconomics. 1/

2.   U.s. saving and investment time series

     This section reports Feldstein—Horioka tests on US. data. Econometric

"fix—ups" for each of the three kindsof problems are attempted. But no

claim is made that the results are good tests of the degree of capital

mobility. Indeed, it is argued in subsequent sections that they are not.

This paper in a sense follows in a tradition of others who have criticized


  1/ Many of the critiques ignore that the original Feldstein and Horioka
paper used instrumental variables (the four instruments were the ratio of
retirees over 65 to the working age population, the ratio of younger
dependents to the same population, the labor force participation rate of
older men, and the benefit/earning "replacement ratio" under social
security).
                                   — 12 —



Feldstein   and Horioka and then found the temptation irresistible to do a

few tests of their own on the grounds that the high correlation of savings

and investment is an interesting empirical regularity. 1/

     If one is concerned with the worldwide degree of capital mobility or

crowding out, then cross—section studies of the sort performed by Feldstein

and Horioka (1980), Penati and Dooley (1984) and others are appropriate.

However, if one seeks to isolate such parameters for the United States in

particular, and if one wishes to see how they have evolved over time,

then time series regression is necessary. We ran instrumental variables

regressions of investment against national saving for the United States

from 1870 to 1979. We use decade averages of saving and investment

rates, hoping to remove the cyclical variation. The data are graphed In

during World War I. One can also see that both saving and Investment

fell drastically in the Depression, never fully to return to earlier

levels.

showed that the same results held with net numbers.

 Out ("low capital mobility"). Despite the very small number of observa-

 tions (11) the standard error is relatively small. Even when we correct

for the (marginal) presence of serial correlation, the estimate Is high

 (.91) and we can easily reject the hypothesis of zero crowding out ("per-

fect capital mobility"), though we cannot reject the opposite extreme.

To try to see whether the relationship has changed over time, we added a

coefficient trend term. Its sign is positive, pointing to an increasing

degree of crowding out, but it is not statistically significant, as one

would expect from the small number of observations. 1/

     A more recent data set would seem more promising for two reasons.

First, yearly data are available. Second, it is widely believed that the

postwar trend toward increased integration of the economies of the United

States and other countries, both with respect to financial markets and

goods markets, merely reversed sharp movements in the opposite direction

that took place in the interwar period. Thus we look for a trend begin-

ning in the l930s at the earliest.

     Table 3 repeats the regressions for yearly U.S. data in the period

1929—1984. In this case, with the greater number of observations, we are

able to reject both extremes of zero and one, even when making the neces-

sary correction for serial correlation. We are also able to identify a


  !/ We tried splitting the sample of decade data at 1919 to try to see how
U.S. capital mobility changed over time, but as one would expect from the
very small number of observations the estimates were so imprecise as to
be worthless (—2.69 with a standard error of 2.0, and .75 with a standard
error of .38, respectively). Reliable yearly data are not available
before World War I, aside from the problem of cyclical endogeneity.

 statistically   significant time trend of .01 per year in the coefficient.

 It implies that the degree of crowding out rises over time, from an esti-

mated coefficient of .19 in 1929 (insignificantly different from zero) to

an estimated coefficient of .74 in 1984 (insignificantly different from

unity). An alternative way to see how the coefficient changes over time

is to split the sample. We choose as the breakpoint 1958, the year when

the European countries restored convertibility of their currencies. The

two coefficients are very similar, .75 in the first half of the sample and

.78 in the second. In both cases we can easily reject a zero coefficient,

but in the 1959—1984 period we are unable to reject a coefficient of unity.

     One would expect that the foregoing coefficient estimates would be

biased upward by the cyclical endogeneity problem, because they are not

based on longer term averages. In the second half of Table 3 we report

regressions using yearly saving and investment rates that have been

cyclically adjusted. The cyclical adjustment of each is accomplished by

first regressing it on the GNP gap, defined as the percentage deviation

from the Bureau of Economic Analysis'"middle expansion trend" of GNP and

taking the residuals. The saving and investment rates are graphed in

Figures 2 and 3 for the period 1955—1984. They are more stable than

earlier In U.S. history. 1/ Nevertheless there is enough variation


  1/ David and Scaddlng (1974) argue that "Denison's Law," the stability
of private saving as a fraction of GNP in the post—war period, applies
also to preceding U.S. history, despite shifts from personal saving to
durables expenditure and corporate saving. (Their period is 1898—1964.)
But as they point out, the stability of private saving in the face of a
rising and fluctuating government deficit precludes the stability of
aggregate national saving that would be Implied by the theories mentioned
on page 4 of this paper ("ultrarationality").

to   see that the two series do move together, even after the cyclical

variation has been taken out (Figure 3). The cyclically adjusted invest-

ment and saving rates show a regression coefficient of .81. This is

similar to the estimate for the much longer 1870—1979 period (.91) in

that we can easily reject zero but cannot reject unity. Attempts to find

a postwar trend In the coefficient or a break in the data when capital

controls were removed in 1974 suggest that the coefficient has been moving

closer to one——that Is, that the degree of crowding out has increased (or

the degree of "capital mobility" has fallen). But the standard errors

are too large, probably because the number of observations and the varia-

tion in the data are too small, for the shift to be statistically signi-

ficant.

      The failure to reject complete crowding out is the same result found

by Obstfeld (1985, p. 39—43) on quarterly U.S. data. The failure to find

a drop in the coefficient even in the 1970s Is the same result found by

Feldstein (1983) and Penati and Dooley (1984, p. 9—10), and interpreted

by them as contradicting the popular impression of an -increase in the

degree of capital mobility among OECD countries.

      Obstfeld (1985) attributes the continued high magnitude of the U.S.

coefficient in the recent period to the large—country problem. It remains

even after the use of instrumental variables and cyclically adjusted num-

bers. The next step is to relate the differential between the U.S. invest-

ment rate and the rest of the world's investment rate to the differential

in national saving rates. Under the null hypothesis, an exogenous fall
                                     — 18 —



 in   the U.S. national saving rate may drive up the world real interest

 rate and crowd out investment, but there is no reason for the crowding

 out to be reflected in U.S. investment any more than in the rest—of—the

world investment. Such differential saving rates and investment rates

are calculated in Table 4. The close correspondence between U.S. saving

and investment remains: the coefficient in a regression is .740, and is

highly significant despite the small number of observations. 1/

3.     What is the meaning of capital mobility?

       The apparent finding of a relatively low degree of capital mobility

in the saving—investment studies, from Feldstein—Horioka to the results

just reported, seems puzzling——even startling——to one accustomed to thinking

of capital as perfectly mobile internationally. This is one reason for

the succession of econometric critiques of their paper. The instrumental

variable results are a partial answer to the critiques (more or less con-

vincing according to whether the military expenditure and age structure

variables are considered more or less valid instruments). But even if

one believes that problems of econometric endogeneity remain, as is

likely, It seems intuitively clear that a degree of domestic crowding out

fundamentally exists, that even if truly exogenous changes in national

saving could be isolated they would not be found to be offset one—for—one

by net capital inflow.


  1/ The standard error of the coefficient is .172, the RZ is .59, and
the Durbin—Watson is 1.66. The numbers are not cyclically adjusted, but to
the extent that business cycles are internationally synchronized (as they
should be under conditions of high capital mobility), cyclical effects
should be less important in the differential rates.

  2/ National Saving (NS), calculated as Investment (I) + Current Account (CA)
                                    — 20 —



      Most readers of the Feldstein—Horioka paper and subsequent literature

 have from the start been vaguely bothered by the connection, or lack of

 it, between their use of the phrase "perfect capital mobility" and the

 use of the phrase that existed previously in the field of international

 finance. Feldstein and Horioka themselves take pains to say that they

 are talking about long—term, as distinct from short—term, capital mobility:


     It is important to emphasize that this conclusion is compatible
     with the obvious international mobility of short—term liquid
     capital. While a small part of the total world capital stock
     is held in liquid form and is available to eliminate short—term
     interest rate differentials, most capital is apparently not
     available for such arbitrage—type activity among long—term
     investments (p. 328).


One problem with this type of argument is that if short—term assets and

long—term assets are relatively close substitutes within each country,

then international arbitrage of short—term rates of returns would be all

that is required. It may be that short—term treasury bills are not in

fact close substitutes for long—term bonds, or for equities or real

capital within a given country; but i-f. so, this Is not the fault of

international capital mobility.

     Penati and Dooley, who generally confirm the findings of Feldstein

and Horioka, come closer at describing the connection with traditional

notions of capital mobility by emphasizing the distinction between gross

flows and net flows:

    ...It is not necessarily true that a large volume of two—way
    trade in financial assets is associated with net trade in
    financial assets. But it is the net trade, together with the
    associated net trade in goods and services, that allows domestic
    investment to diverge from domestic savings (p. 7)
                                  — 21 —



This is clearly right. But the question that remains to be answered is

the following: If there are no barriers to the gross acquisition of

assets across national boundaries, how can there be barriers to the net

acquisition of assets? Is not "gross" capital mobility sufficient to

equalize interest rates? And if it is, how is it that changes in national

saving seem to crowd out investment in their own country?

     We turn now to traditional definitions of international capital

mobility, where the operational criteria are stated in terms of differen-

tial rates of return rather than correlations of saving and investment.

Later we will return to the meaning of the correlations.


                III. Three Interest Parity Conditions as
                        Definitions of Capital Mobility

     The term "perfect capital mobility" is commonly used in three distinct

ways; in each case the operational criterion is a version of international

interest rate parity.

1.   Closed interest parity

     The first definition is the absence of important capital controls,

transactions costs, or other barriers separating investors from the assets

they would like to hold. 1/ The operative criterion is that arbitrage

equalizes nominal interest rates on assets located in different countries,

when any exchange rate risk has been removed. This criterion is most



  1/ This is the definition of perfect capital mobility that I argued is
the most sensible, to distinguish it from perfect substitutability (the
second definition, considered below) in Frankel (1983); supporting cita-
tions appear there.
                                    — 22 —



often   stated as covered interest parity:


      i =    i*   +   fd

where i is the domestic nominal interest rate, i" the foreign nominal

interest rate, and fd the forward discount on domestic currency.

        For the criterion to be an interesting one, the interest rates should

refer to securities that differ in political jurisdiction, not just in

currency of denomination. The best—known study of covered interest parity,

Frenkel and Levich (1975), found the relationship to hold well for Europound

and Eurodollar interest rates on deposits side—by—side in a London bank.

Indeed if one were to find significant deviations from covered interest

parity with such a data set, one would be less likely to change one's view

of the world than to question the reliability of the data set. The interest-

ing criterion instead uses, for example, London interest rates and New York

interest rates. The London interest rate can be either a Eurodollar rate

(it), or a pound rate (ii) covered on the forward exchange market.
                                                       -.

In the former case we would test the condition


(2)     i = 4
which we might call "absolute" or "simple" interest parity. In the latter

case we would test the condition


(3) i14 =         i+fd
which is "international" (as opposed to "Euromarket') covered interest
                                   — 23 —




parity.   Given that Euromarket covered interest parity holds,


(4) 4     = i+fd,
the other two, more interesting, criteria are identical to each other.

If one phrase is desired for the two of them interchangeably, it might be

"closed interest parity."

     Frenkel and Levich (1975, 1977) find that, even for the periods 1962—67

and 1973—75 when Euromarket covered interest parity held well, international

covered interest parity, using U.S. and U.K. treasury bills, held signif i—

cantly less well. They attribute the deviations to what Aliber (1973)

called political risk: default, taxation, capital controls, or any other

sort of risk attaching to the political jurisdiction of a security as

opposed to its currency of denomination. Similarly, Dooley and Isard

(1980) find imperfect capital mobility for Germany during the period 1970—74;

they use mark deposits in Frankfurt versus Euromark deposits in Zurich to

test what we have just called absolute or simple interest parity, and find

large deviations. Like Aliber and Frenkel and Levich, they attribute the

deviations to political risk, specifically allocating primary responsibility

to the level of controls in place in Germany at the time (essentially the

taxation of interest paid to foreign residents) and secondary responsibility

to the uncertainty regarding possible future changes in the level of controls.

Fase (1976) finds large deviations from closed interest parity, both simple

and covered, for the United States, Canada, Germany, and eight other major

countries for the Bretton Woods period 1961—72.
                                       — 24 —




          Germany and the United States removed most of their capital controls

in 1974. !I      Using Granger—Sims causality tests on simple interest parity
for the dollar (the Eurodollar rate versus the domestic U.S. commercial

paper or treasury bill rate), Hartman (1983) finds a significant strength-

ening of the link from the 1971—74 period to the 1975—78 period. Boothe

et al. (1985, p. 112) find small deviations for the Canadian dollar in

the 1975—82 period.

      Britain removed its controls in 1979, so that by the 1980s six indus-

trialized countries——the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom,

Switzerland, and the Netherlands——were perceived as having essentially open

financial markets. France and Italy, on the other hand, maintain serious

controls on capital outflow, as is easily demonstrated by the excess of the

Eurocurrency interest rates In London over the domestic rates in France and

Italy. Giavazzi and Pagano (1985, 27—28) find that the deviations from

covered interest parity are large enough that domestic arbitrageurs would

make guaranteed profits if they could get their money into the Euromarket,

on 85 percent of the days in the case of France (September 1982 — August

1984, with a mean return of 3.99 percent) and 60 percent of the days in

the case of Italy (November 1980 — August 1984, with a mean return of

3.51 percent), and that the deviations rise sharply before a devaluation. 2/

and Baumgartner (1977) give the history of German capital controls in the
197 Os.
  2/ Claassen and Wyplosz (1982) and Frankel (1982b) also document the case
for France.
                                   — 25 —



They also look at Germany and the Netherlands and find deviations that are

opposite in sign to those of France and Italy, but that are In any case

much smaller in magnitude (the mean returns to covered arbitrage are only

0.34 percent for Germany and 0.14 percent for the Netherlands, for the

period September 1982 — August 1984).

     Of the seven summit countries, Japan Is the one of controversy. In

the late 1970s Japan maintained strict controls on capital Inflow, in order

to resist the large appreciation of its currency that was taking place.

Foreigners were prohibited from acquiring most forms of Japanese securities,

such as gensaki, a three—month repurchase agreement. In May 1979, in the

face of a depreciating yen, the Ministry of Finance removed most of these

prohibitions. The controversy arose in 1983 when some American businessmen,

alarmed by devastating competition from Japanese exporters, convinced the

U.S. Treasury Department that the Japanese government was still using some

form of capital market restrictions to keep the value of the yen lower than

It would otherwise be. There followed a campaign by the U.S. government

to induce the Japanese to adopt a whole list of measues further liberalizing

their financial markets, which came to fruition In the May 1984 Yen/Dollar

Agreement between the U.S. Treasury and the Japanese Ministry of Finance.

     This episode Is a good case study in which to apply our closed inter-

est parity criterion for capital mobility. We can compute the differential

between the three—month Euroyen interest rate in London and the gensaki

rate in Tokyo, and compare its magnitude before and after the purported

liberalization. Between the period January 1975 —   April   1979, and the

period May 1979 — November 1893 the mean absolute value of the deviation
                                     — 26 -




fell   from 2.06 percent to 0.31 percent and the variance fell from 3.29 per-

cent to 0.22 percent. !I The statistics in Table 5 show that, by the

criterion of closed interest parity, Japanese financial markets are now as

open internationally as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland.

2.     Uncovered interest parity

       The second definition of perfect capital mobility is the absence of

imperfect substitutability, attributable in particular to risk, between

domestic and foreign assets. The operative condition here is uncovered, or

open, interest parity:
           —

where Lse is the expected percentage depreciation of the dollar over the

coming period. In other words, investors respond to any differentials in

expected returns so as to arbitrage them away. In theory, investors should

wish to diversify their portfolios and so should not entirely arbitrage

away such a differential but rather should leave a risk premium, unless (a)


  1/ The sign of the deviation switched, from a mean of —1.84 in the first
period to +0.26 in the second period. This is evidencethat, although the
earlier controls acted to prevent capital inflow into Japan (otherwise
investors would not have settled for the Euroyen interest rate in London
when a higher return was available in Tokyo), those controls that remained
after April 1979 acted more to prevent capital outflow (otherwise investors
would not have settled for the interest rate in Tokyo if a higher Euroyen
rate were freely available in London). It is ironic that the United States
in 1983—84 pushed for further Japanese liberalization with the express goal
of strengthening the yen, when liberalization could be expected to result
in greater capital outflow in response to higher interest rates in the
United States, and thus to weaken the yen. The calculations cited here
appear in Frankel (1984, p. 21—24); the numbers are originally from Morgan
Guaranty. See also Otani and Tiwari (1981) and Otani (1983).

they   are risk neutral, or (b) exchange risk is completely diversifiable,

both extremely strong assumptions. But the magnitude of the risk premium

is very much an open matter.

       Cumby and Obstfeld (1981, 1984) and others have statistically rejected

the hypothesis that the errors made by the interest differential in pre-

dicting exchange rate change are random. Given covered interest parity,

the tests are equivalent to the (more numerous) tests of the hypothesis

that the errors made by the forward discount In predIcting exchange rate

changes are random. In both cases, the standard finding is statistically

significant serial correlation of prediction errors, and even a tendency

for predictions to be incorrect as to the sign of exchange rate changes.

Cumby and Obstfeld, and most others, have concluded from such evidence that

uncovered interest parity fails. But, as they recognize, the tests are in

fact joint tests of uncovered interest parity and rational expectations.

The evidence cannot distinguish which half of the joint null hypothesis is

being rejected.

       More information Is needed to try to isolate the risk premiums out of

the noisy prediction errors, i.e., out of the difference between the inter-

est differential and the ex post changes in the exchange rate. The most

natural source for such information is the theory of portfolio optimization

on the part of investors. The theory says that the risk premium ought to

be related to such factors as the degree of risk—aversion, the supplies of

various currencies that have to be held In investors' portfolios, the

variance of the exchange rate In question, and the covarlances with returns

on other securities and with other investment opportunities. Econometric
                                     — 29 —




tests   have looked for a systematic relationship between the prediction

errors and the variables to which the theory says that the risk premium

should be related, and have found no signs of such a relationship. !/ As

always, the statistical failure to reject the null hypothesis of a zero

risk premium could be due to low power in the test. But there is a surpri-

sing, and more far—reaching, point that transcends the particular econometric

technique used to estimate variances and covariances of rates of return.

It is that conventional estimates of the degree of risk—aversion imply that

the risk premium must be very small.

       It can be shown that if investors optimize with respect to the mean

and variance of their wealth, they will allocate their portfolios accord-

ing to the following equation:

       x      a+ [PQF'(rpt)
where xt is the share of the portfolios allocated to foreign assets (or a

vector of shares allocated to various foreign currencies); c is the minimum—

variance portfolio, which is closely related to the share of consumption

allocated to foreign goods (or a vector of such shares); p is the coeffi-

cient of relative risk aversion;    is the variance (or variance—covariance

matrix) of the return differential, i.e., of the change in the exchange

rate if we are looking at short—term financial assets with known nominal

returns; and rpt is the risk premium on foreign assets (or vector), i.e.,

the ex ante return differential or deviation from uncovered interest


  !/    For example, Frankel (1982a), which also gives further references.
                                     — 30 —




parity.   !/ Intuitively, an increase in the expected return on a particu—

lar asset will induce investors to shift a higher share of their portfolios

into that asset; but the more important investors consider risk diversifi-

cation (that is, the larger is p or P), the less will they shift their

portfolios in response to a given change in expected returns.

       The unconditional monthly variance of the relative return on dollars

has been on the order of .001. 2/ The conditional variance, which is

what should matter for investor behavior, must be less than or equal to

the sample variance. Thus we may take .001 as an upper bound estimate

of Q. The coefficient of risk aversion, p, is thought to be in the

neighborhood of two. 3/ Taking the product [pQ], it follows from the

above equation that asset demands are extraordinarily sensitive to the

risk premium. If an increase in the supply of foreign assets Xt equal

to 1 percent of the portfolio is to be held willingly, it will have to

drive up the risk premium rpt by .002 percent on a monthly basis, or a

mere .024 percent per annum——just 2.4 basis points. It also follows

that,    the magnitude of the risk premiums, not just the variability, is

very small. 1/

        It must be emphasized that the conclusion that international substi-

tutability is very high, and thus the risk premium very small, depends

entirely on the optimal portfolio argument. The hypothesis that investors

diversify their portfolios optimally has not itself held up well to

statistical tests. 2/

     If one were to abandon the optimization hypothesis, one would be

hard—put to find other sources of information to help isolate the risk pre-

mium out of the noisy prediction errors made by the interest differential.

About the only apparent alternative is the survey data of exchange rate

expectations that made a brief appearance in Table 1. These data do show

a sizable gap between the interest differential and expected rate of

depreciation, at least for the 1981—85 period of dollar appreciation.

Unfortunately the implied risk premium goes precisely the opposite direc-

tion from that implied by the Cuinby—Obstfeld and other unbiasedness tests

on the interest differential or forward discount data. Those tests all

imply that when the dollar sold at a discount, as it consistently has

during the 1981—1985 period, even though it has not depreciated ex post,

dollar assets must be carrying a positive risk premium. The risk premium


  1/ Krugman (1981) and Frankel (1985) show that if pc2 is small, then both
the level of the risk premium and changes are small. More generally, past
tests of biasedness in the forward discount or interest differential have
not found unconditional bias; those who have argued for the existence of a
large risk premium have always specified that it be time varying, so as to
fluctuate between positive and negative (e.g., Hansen and Hodrick (1983)).
  2/ Frankel and Engel (1984) reject the international optimization hypo-
thesis in a mean—variance framework. Hodrick and Srivistava (1984) do so
in a more general intertemporal framework.
                                   — 32 —



constitutes   some positive fraction of the interest differential (100 per-

cent of it, or more, in the case of tests that show predictions in the

wrong directions). The natural explanation why dollar assets might carry

a positive risk premium in the mid—1980s is that, as a result of recent

enormous federal budget deficits and current account deficits, the supply

of dollar assets that the market must hold in its portfolio exceeds the

share represented by the minimum—variance portfolio. But the survey data

show that for the 1981—85 period, expected depreciation has consistently

exceeded the interest differential, i.e., the risk premium on dollars is

negative. They do not explain any positive fraction of the systematic

component of the prediction errors.

     We will return to the subject of the survey data subsequently. But

for now, especially in light of the fact that the validity of these data

as measures of expectations has yet to win widespread acceptance, we take

the existing theoretical and empirical evidence as suggesting that inter-

national capital mobility is very high, in this second sense of high

substitutability in investors' portfolios and a small risk premium. !I

3.   Real interest parity

     So far we have concluded that capital is highly mobile between the

United States and the other major countries both in the sense of (1) low


  1/ Frankel and Froot (1985) introduces the survey data, tests alterna-
tive specifications for the expectations formation process, and tests the
rational expectations hypothesis. Froot (1985) further Investigates
whether the standard findings of biasedness in the forward discount can
be attributed to a risk premium, and allows for measurement error in the
survey data.

transactions   costs and capital controls, so that closed interest parity

holds relatively well between U.S. securities and foreign securities

(either denominated in dollars or covered on the forward market), and (2)

low risk premiums, so that uncovered interest parity holds relatively

well also (though the evidence here is more widely disputed). How are

such conclusions to be reconciled with the results of the Feldstein—Horioka

tests in Part II above?

      Our third definition of perfect capital mobility is the one that

Feldstein had in mind. It is phrased in terms of real interest rates,

not nominal interest rates. It is, after all, the real interest rate

on which saving and investment are thought to depend. The operational

criterion is real interest parity:


(5)            rUS =     rUK


where rUS   '-us —   ,ie5,     r       ,1e, and TeUS and 1UK are the

countries' expected inflation rates. If infinitely elastic international

flows were to tie the domestic real intEerest rate to the world real

interest rate, and if the domestic country were small enough to take the

world real interest rate as given then there should be no crowding out:

exogenous decreases in national saving should not drive up the domestic

real interest rate and discourage domestic investment. In the Feldstein—

Horioka regressions (with valid instrumental variables), the coefficients

should be zero.
                                   — 34 —




     But,   especially given the large—country and other endogeneity problems,

a better econometric approach than saving—investment correlations is to

test real interest parity directly. Such tests have been performed for

the U.S. and major trading partners in the recent period, by Mishkin (1982,

1984), Friedman and Schwartz (1982), von Furstenberg (1983), Cumby and

Obstfeld (1984) and Cumby and Mishkin (1984). All find significant gaps

between domestic and foreign real interest rates. Since real interest

parity Is the only definition of perfect capital mobility that could lead

one to expect an absence of crowding out, its empirical failure automatically

explains the finding of crowding out in the Feldstein—Horioka regressions;

no arguments about econometric endogeneity are required. Furthermore,

the general trend in the real interest rate results over time is the same

as the general trend in the Feldstein—Horioka regressions. Mishkin

(1984, pp. 1352, 1354), for example, found even more significant rejections

of real interest parity for the floating rate period after 1973 II than

he did for his entire 1967 II — 1979 II sample period. This corresponds

to the findings of Feldstein (1983) and Penati and Dooley (1984) that the

crowding—out coefficient did not declined as expected after 1973.

     One need not search far for the source of failure of real interest

parity. Even if the first two definitions of perfect capital mobility

hold completely, so that uncovered interest parity holds,

it is necessary also to assume what is sometimes called ex ante relative

Whether ex ante relative PPP (also describable as "random walk expectations

regarding the real exchange rate") holds is a question regarding the degree

of integration of international goods markets (which is thought to be low),

not the degree of integration of international financial markets.

national portfolio investors have reason to arbitrage away gaps in

tries' nominal rates of return when expressed in a common numeraire; but

they have no reason to arbitrage away a gap between the domestic rate of

return expressed in terms of domestic goods and the foreign rate of return

expressed in terms of foreign goods. Perhaps the central message of this

paper is that, although Feldstein and Horioka are correct about the exis-

tence of crowding out, econometric endogeneity problems notwithstanding,

they are wrong to offer this conclusion as evidence of imperfect capital

mobility. 1/

       It might be protested that our first two definitions of capital

mobility refer only to nominal assets——bonds and, especially, shorter

term bills or deposits—— and that a perfectly good third definition would


  !/ Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Feldstein (1983) explicitly refer to
barriers to integration of financial markets. Among the many subsequent
authors who seem automatically to accept the conceptual jump from crowding
out to imperfect financial market integration are Tobin (1983), Murphy
(1984), Caprio and Howard (1984) and Boothe et al (1985). Obstfeld (1985)
and Summers (1985) note the relevance of changes in relative goods prices,
though they phrase the distinction differently from the present paper (or
from each other).
                                   — 36 —



refer   to real assets——equities and direct investment. But the same

argument applies. In the absence of significant barriers to mobility or

substitutability (including risk), an international investor should equate

the expected rate of return on equities or real investment in one country

to that in another evaluated in a common numeraire, not each evaluated In

terms of local goods prices. If the real return on a country's equities

were equal to the real return on its bonds, each evaluated In terms of

local goods prices, and if real interest parity held, then the real

returns on equities would be internationally equalized as well. But

given the failure of real interest parity, neither foreign direct invest-

ment nor any other known force will equalize real returns on capital.

Thus equating internationally rates of return on financial assets of

any sort will be not sufficient to equate real interest rates; ex ante

relative purchasing power parity is needed as well.

4.   Ex ante purchasing power parity

     Not long ago, purchasing power parity was widely accepted. It was

argued on a priori grounds that the Law of One Price should be enforced

at least for traded goods: if automobiles were selling at a lower price

in Germany than in the United States, international arbitrageurs should

buy them in Germany and sell them in the U.S., raising the price in one

country or lowering it in the other until equality was restored. If

PPP were to hold in level form then it would also hold in expected rate

of change form (equation (7)); goods markets would pose no obstacles to

real interest parity.
                                  — 37 —



     The empirical evidence against PPP in level form is overwhelming.

The enormous real appreciation of the dollar in the 1980s has now convinced

the remaining doubters, but abundant statistical evidence was there all

along. For example, Krugman (1978, p.406) computed for the floating—rate

period July 1973 to December 1976 standard deviations of the (logarithmic)

real exchange rate equal to 6.0 percent for the pound/dollar rate and 8.4

percent for the mark/dollar rate. He also computed serial correlation

coefficients for PPP deviations of .897 and .854, respectively, on a

monthly basis, equal to .271 and .150 on an annual basis. The serial

correlation coefficient is of Interest because it Is equal to one minus

the speed of adjustment to PPP. It may be best not to rely exclusively on

the standard deviation of the real exchange rate as a summary statistic

for the degree of integration of goods markets because It In part reflects

the magnitude of monetary disturbances during the perIod. 1/

     Table 6 shows updated annual statistics on the real exchange rate

between the United States and Great Britain. During the floating rate

period 1973—1984, though there Is no significant time trend, there is a

large standard deviation of 15.4 percent. The serial correlation in the

deviations from PPP is estimated at .720, with a standard error of

.248. (The equation estimated is (ert÷1 —   t÷1) = AR(ert —rt),   where
er is the real exchange rate and er is the long—run equilibrium level,


  1/ For example, Krugman found that the standard deviation for the real
mark/dollar exchange rate during the German hyperlnflation, February 1920
— December 1923, was much larger (20.8) percent) than during the 1970s,
even though the serial correlation was no higher (.765).

alternatively   estimated as the sample mean or a time trend, and AR is the

autoregressive coefficient.) This means that the estimated speed of

adjustment to PPP is .280 per year and that we can easily reject the

hypothesis of instantaneous adjustment.

     From the ashes of absolute PPP, a phoenix has risen. In response to

findings such as those reported here, some authors have swung from one

extreme, the proposition that the tendency of the real exchange rate to

return to a constant is complete and instantaneous, to the opposite

extreme that there is no such tendency at all. The hypothesis that the

real exchange rate follows a random walk is just as good as the hypothesis

of absolute PPP for implying ex ante relative PPP. But there is (even)

less of an a priori case why PPP should hold in rate of change form than

in the level form.

     Roll (1979) has claimed that the random walk model of the real

exchange rate has a basis in efficient markets theory. His argument is

apparently that if the expected Inflation rate is lower in the United

States than In Germany, allowing for expected exchange rate changes, then

an arbitrageur can contract to buy authmobiles In the United States and

ship them to Germany and expect to sell them there at a higher price; such

profitable arbitrage would then eliminate the opportunity to begin with,

enforcing PPP in expected rate—of—change form. If this arbitrage is

intended to be different from the old arbitrage in level form which has

been empirically rejected, and Roll clearly intends it to be different,

then it is a remarkable strategy to recommend to international traders.

Measures of expected real depreciation of the dollar as of 1985 show a
                                     — 40 —



short—term depreciation rate of about 1.0 per cent per annum. As of 1985,

the level of BMW prices is said to be almost twice as high in the United

States as in Germany, as a result of the five—year appreciation of the

dollar against the mark. Yet Roll's apparent strategy tells us to buy

BMWs in the United States and ship them to Germany because in the three

months it takes to complete the shipment their relative prices will have

increased 0.25 percent in expected value! The near—SO percent loss would

seem to outweigh the 0.25 per cent gain.

     Even though ex ante relative PPP has little basis in theory, it does

appear to have some empirical support. Typically, the estimated speeds

of adjustment during the floating rate period, .27 or .28 on an annual

basis in Table 6 (1973—84), while not so low as to be implausible as point

estimates, are so low that one statistically cannot reject the hypothesis

that they are zero. In other words, one cannot reject the hypothesis

that the autoregression coefficient is 1.0.

     A 95 percent confidence interval on the autoregressive coefficient

covers the range 0.17 to 1.27 (in the no—trend case). -   If   the null hypo-

thesis is an autoregression coefficient of 1.0, one cannot legitimately

use the standard t—test derived from a regression where the righthand—side

variable is the level of the real exchange rate, because under the null

hypothesis its variance is infinite. (This does not invalidate the t—test

reported above of the null hypothesis that the tendency to return to PPP was

100 percent, i.e., AR =   0.)   There are number of ways of dealing with this

nonstationarity problem. Here we simply apply the corrected Dickey—Fuller

cumulative probablility distribution for this problem. The t—ratio to
                                    — 41 —




test   an autoregressive coefficient of 1.0 is 1.13, which falls far short

of the Dickey—Fuller 95 percent significance level, 3.00.

       This failure to reject a random walk in the real exchange rate is

the same result found by Roll (1979), Frenkel (1981, p.699), Darby (1981),

and Mishkin (1984, p.1351—53). Most of these studies used monthly data.

On the one hand, the more abundant data reduces the standard error of the

estimate but, on the other hand, one is no longer testing whether AR = .28

is different from 1.0, but rather whether, say AR 1/12 =    .90 is different
from 1.0, so that it may not be much easier to reject. Another problem

is that one cannot be sure that the nature of the true autoregressive

process is first—order on a monthly (or continuous—time) basis; the

typical finding is that computations on monthly data imply a somewhat

more rapid speed of adjustment when annualized than do computations

performed directly on annual data, suggesting that the process may not be

exactly first order. In any case, the monthly data in the studies cited

were generally not powerful enough to reject the random walk. 1/ As

Frenkel says, "it is concluded that the deviations from purchasing power

parities seem to follow a first—order,- autoregressive-process, but that

the data do not provide sufficient evidence to reject the alternative

hypothesis of a random walk."

       A more promising alternative is to choose a longer time sample.

Table 6 reports also statistics for the entire post—war period 1945—1984.


  !/ Cumby and Obstfeld (1984, p. 146) used a Q—statistic to test for
higher order serial correlation in monthly real exchange rate changes
and found none. However, they also found that expected inflation differ-
entials are unrelated to expected exchange rate changes, rejecting the
random walk characterization of the real exchange rate.
                                   — 42 —



 PPP held slightly better during the Bretton Woods
                                                   years than it did after

 1973, as measured either by the mean absolute deviation and standard

 deviation of the real exchange rate, or by the ability to reject the

 hypothesis of zero autocorrelation. But, despite the longer time sample,

 we are still unable to reject the random walk. The 95 percent confidence

 interval runs from .65 to 1.01, and the t—ratio of 1.9 falls short of the

 Dickey—Fuller 95 percent significance level of 2.93.

      In the last column of Table 6 we present the statistics for an

entire 116 years of TJ.S.—U.K. data. With this long a time sample, the

standard error Is reduced considerably. The rejection of no serial cor-

relation in the real exchange rate is even stronger than in the shorter

time samples. More importantly we are finally able to detect a signifi-

cant tendency for the real exchange rate to regress to PPP, at a rate of

14 percent a year. The confidence interval for AR runs from .77 to .95,

safely less than unity, and the t—ratio of 2.92 exceeds the Dickey—Fuller

significance level 2.89.

     The last row of the Table reports regressions of the real exchange

rate against the nominal exchange rate. The coefficient is highly

significant for the 1864—1984 period. The figures suggest that changes

in the nominal exchange rate (for example, due to devaluations under

fixed exchange rates or monetary disturbances under floating exchange

rates) cause transitory changes in the real exchange rate because goods

prices are sticky. Such results specifically rule out the possibility,

which is suggested occasionally in the literature, that apparent devia—

tions from PPP might be attributed to random measurement errors in the

price data.

     In    this paper, our motivation for looking at PPP is to obtain insight

into the "expected rate of real depreciation," because that is the variable

that separates the real interest differential from the risk premium. In

rejecting the random walk description of the real exchange rate, we have

rejected the claim that the rationally expected rate of real depreciation

is zero.

     The rationally expected rate of real depreciation estimated from a

specific time series process is in any case not necessarily the same as

the actual expectation of real depreciation held by investors. People

could be either less sophisticated or more sophisticated than the auto-

regressive model.

     In Table 7 we use the Economist and American Express survey data on

expectations of exchange rate and price level changes to compute a direct

measure of expected real depreciation for the dollar against five individual

currencies, and regress it against a measure of current real "overvaluation."

Overvaluation is the difference between the current exchange rate and a

long—run equilibrium rate calculated by PPP, using as the base the average

of the period 1973—1980. The equilibrium measure differs from a constant

in that it evolves over time at the rate of the inflation differential,

and in that when the regression period is confined to the period 1981—1984,

as is necessarily the case for the Economist data set, it shows a large

real overvaluation throughout. According to the results in Table 7,

investors show a statistically significant expectation that the real

exchange rate will regress back toward PPP. 1/ The constant term is also

statistically significant. 2/

       We can take point estimates from Table 6 to illustrate what a typical

magnitude might be for the rationally expected rate of real depreciation

even in the absence of any expected changes in the long—run equilibrium

terms of trade. For the 1869—1984 period a one percent deviation from

PPP, say an "overvaluaton" of the currency, 1mples a ratIonally expected

rate of subsequent real depreciation equal to 0.14 percent per year. Since

the mean absolute deviation from PPP is 9.3 percent, the mean absolute

value of the rationally expected rate of real depreciation is 0.14 x 9.3
=   1.3 percent. In the post—1973 period of larger exchange rate fluctua-

tions, the magnitude of expected real depreciation is larger. The most

dramatic case is 1984 or 1985, when calculations of real overvaluation

of the dollar (relative to PPP) on the order of 30 percent imply that the

rationally expected rate of future real depreciation back toward PPP is

large enough to explain all of the real interest differential, calculated

in the various ways of Table 1. 3/


  1/ Because the data sample is pooled time series cross—section, there
is certain to be correlation of the error term across different currencies.
The system should be estimated by Seemingly Unrelated Regressions, as Is
done in Franke]. and Froot (1985).
  2/ The American Express data set covers a longer time period, 1976—1984,
but fewer observations. The addition of a dummy variable for the strong—
dollar period after 1980 eliminates the significance of the regressive
coefficient. The results without the dummy variable are significant, but
not reported in Table 7.
  3/ The 1984 Economic Report of the President, Chapter 2, found that
the expected future real depreciation implicit in the real interest
differential roughly coincided with the "real overvaluation" Implied by the
PPP. But any such calculations are very sensitive to the term of maturity
chosen.

     A more precise decomposition of the real Interest differential into a

risk premium and expected real depreciation, based on the assumption of

rational expectations and the use of ex post data, is difficult. The

reason is that the difference between the expected exchange rate change and

the ex post exchange rate change, even though random if expectations are

rational, is so large as to reduce greatly the precision of any estimates,

as Mishkin (1984a) notes. Indeed it was for this reason that Mishkin was

unable to reject the hypotheses of a zero risk premium or of zero expected

real depreciation considered individually, even though he could easily

reject the joint null hypothesis in a test of real interest parity, where

the exchange rate expectation errors do not interfere.

     It should be recalled from Section 111.2 above that, on the one hand,

the standard tests of unbiasedness in the forward discount or interest

differential say that the rationally expected rate of depreciation is

significantly less than that Implied by the interest differential, and on

the other hand that economists' notions of a long—run equilibrium for the

dollar, as embodied for example In the Economist and American Express survey

data, imply that the expected rate of depreciation as of 1985 is considerably

greater. One cannot prove that expected real depreciation explains 100

percent of the real interest differential, no less and no more. But the

calculations of this section are intended to show that plausible magnitudes

for the former correspond to plausible magnitudes for the latter, and

that deviations from the assumption of perfect capital mobility in the

senses of definitions (1) or (2) are not needed to explain deviations

from real interest parity.

     Regressions of the investment rate against the national saving rate

give results for U.S. time series similar to those obtained by Feldstein—

Horioka and others for cross—section data: a point estimate on the order

of .8, significantly different from zero and insignificantly different

from 1.0. Econometric problems abound, but cyclically adjusting the

saving and investment numbers, using Instrumental variables or working in

terms of deviations from world levels does little to reduce the coefficient

estimate. The estimate has, if anything, been moving closer to 1.0 in

the postwar period. It seems that international capital mobility does

not fully prevent exogenous changes in the government budget or in private

saving from crowding Out domestic investment.

     This paper has argued that neither econometric problems nor imper-

fect capital mobility are needed to explain the crowding—out estimates.

"Perfect capital mobility" has multiple definitions: (1) closed interest

parity, requiring insignificant barriers such as transactions costs and

capital controls; (2) uncovered Interest parity, requiring also small

exchange risk premiums; and (3) real interest parity, requiring also ex

ante relative purchasing power parity. Each criterion can be tested

directly. Closed interest parity is observed to hold well among eight of

the major industrial countries. Uncovered interest parity is more difficult

to test, because investors' exchange rate expectations are not directly

observable; nevertheless some theoretical considerations and some evidence

from survey data both contradict the view that a large positive component

of the interest differential (or forward discount) on the dollar constitutes

a risk premium. Thus the first two criteria, the ones that are most
                                   — 48 —




properly   associated with the degree of integration of financial markets,

do seem to hold to within relatively small margins. Real interest parity,

the only condition that might lead one to expect an absence of crowding

out, is also the condition that clearly fails empirically. This is not

surprising, since purchasing power parity is well—known to fail empiri-

cally and the argument that ex ante relative PPP could hold nevertheless

is extremely weak on both theoretical grounds and empirical grounds.

When 116 years of data on the U.S.—U.K. real exchange rate are used, it

is possible to reject the random walk characterization, to find a statis-

tically significant speed of adjustment to PPP.

     Thus expected real depreciation is an important variable. It seems

possible to attribute all of, for example, the 3.0 percent U.S. real

interest differential as of 1985, to expected real depreciation, rather

than to a risk premium. This implies that it is possible to attribute

the existence of crowding out in an open economy to imperfect integration

of goods markets, rather than necessarily to imperfect integration of asset

markets as has been suggested in the past.
