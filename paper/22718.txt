                                          ABSTRACT

The U.S. 2009 Tobacco Control Act opened the door for new anti-smoking policies by giving the
Food and Drug Administration broad regulatory authority over the tobacco industry. We develop
a behavioral welfare economics approach to conduct cost-benefit analysis of FDA tobacco
regulations. We use a simple two-period model to develop expressions for the impact of tobacco
control policies on social welfare. Our model includes: nudge and paternalistic regulations; an
excise tax on cigarettes; internalities created by period 1 versus period 2 consumption; and
externalities from cigarette consumption. Our analytical expressions show that in the presence of
uncorrected externalities and internalities, a tax or a nudge to reduce cigarette consumption
improves social welfare. In sharp contrast, a paternalistic regulation might either improve or
worsen social welfare. Another important result is that the social welfare gains from new policies
do not only depend on the size of the internalities and externalities, but also depend on the extent
to which current policies already correct the problems. We link our analytical expressions to the
graphical approach used in most previous studies and discuss the information needed to complete
cost-benefit analysis of tobacco regulations. Finally, we use our model as a framework to re-
examine the evidence base regarding the size of the relevant internalities.

Introduction

       Over the past 50 years the U.S. and other countries have enacted a range of anti-smoking

policies including health information campaigns, excise tax hikes, and bans on smoking in public

places. The U.S. 2009 Tobacco Control Act (TCA) opened the door for new anti-smoking

policies by giving the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broad regulatory authority over the

tobacco industry. The TCA bans cigarette sales to minors, requires new graphic warning labels,

bans flavored cigarettes other than menthol, and bans the use of misleading terms such as “light”

in cigarette marketing. Beyond these specific requirements, the FDA is considering using its

authority under the TCA to make additional product regulations such as banning menthol

cigarettes, reducing cigarette nicotine content, and banning flavors in small cigars. The TCA

does not allow the FDA to completely ban cigarettes or nicotine.

       The TCA requires the FDA to design tobacco regulations to promote public health.

However, regulations that promote public health do not necessarily improve consumer welfare.

In the absence of the regulations, smokers could reap the same health benefits by voluntarily

quitting or cutting down. FDA tobacco regulations potentially improve consumer welfare by

preventing internalities when smokers fail to optimize. This poses a dilemma for applied welfare

economics: when smokers fail to optimize, their observed consumption choices are not reliable

indicators of the choices that would maximize their experience utilities.

       We develop a behavioral welfare economics approach to measure the impact of FDA

tobacco regulations on consumer welfare. While the TCA creates a public health standard for

tobacco regulations, Executive Order 12866 also requires the FDA to conduct cost-benefit

analysis (CBA) (FDA 2010, 2011, 2014, 2016). We contribute to an emerging line of research

                                               Page 3 of 57
that addresses the challenges of conducting CBAs of regulations that affect smoking and other

addictive consumption (Weimer, Vining and Thomas 2009, Australian Productivity Commission

2010, Ashley, Nardinelli and Lavaty 2015, Cutler et al. 2015, Jin et al. 2015, Levy, Norton and

Smith 2016).

       The next section provides more background about FDA tobacco regulations and

discusses the distinction between nudges versus paternalistic regulations that limit choices or

create large disincentives. The following section uses a simple two-period model to develop

expressions for the impact of tobacco control policies on social welfare. Our model is an

example of the reduced-form approach to behavioral welfare economics (Mullainathan et al.

2012, Chetty 2015). Our model includes: nudge and paternalistic regulations; an excise tax on

cigarettes; internalities created by period 1 versus period 2 consumption; and externalities from

cigarette consumption. Our analytical expressions show that in the presence of uncorrected

externalities and internalities, a tax or a nudge to reduce cigarette consumption improves social

welfare. In sharp contrast, a paternalistic regulation might either improve or worsen social

welfare. Another important result is that the social welfare gains from new policies do not only

depend on the size of the internalities and externalities, but also depend on the extent to which

current policies already correct the problems.

       We then link our analytical expressions to the graphical approach used in most previous

studies and discusses the information needed to complete CBAs of tobacco regulations. The key

pieces of information needed are estimates of the internalities. We use our model as a framework

to re-examine the evidence base for strong conclusions about the size of the internalities. The

next-to-last section examines the potential of different approaches to measure the internalities in

more detail. We then provide a concluding discussion.

Categorizing FDA Tobacco Regulations

         For our analysis we broadly categorize FDA tobacco regulations as either nudge

regulations or paternalistic regulations. A few FDA tobacco regulations fit the definition of a

nudge: an intervention “that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any

options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the

intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid.” (Thaler and Sunstein 2008, p. 6) Nudges often

involve framing or choice architecture, such as setting default options and automatic enrollments

to encourage saving for retirement. One example of a tobacco nudge regulation is the TCA’s ban

of the use of misleading terms such as “light” in cigarette advertising and manufacturing. The

ban is based on the argument that marketing low-tar and –nicotine cigarettes as “light cigarettes”

misleadingly frames them as a healthier choice. The ban only changes the framing. After the ban,

cigarettes formerly marketed as “light” remained on the market and in fact appear to have

maintained most of their market share. 1 Another example of a tobacco nudge regulation is the

TCA’s requirement that advertisements that are likely to reach youth, including point-of-sale

advertisements, must be black-and-white only. 2 The FDA’s “The Real Cost” anti-smoking

advertising campaign is another corrective nudge: it is designed to prevent youth smoking by

making the harmful effects (the “Real Cost”) of tobacco use more salient to adolescents.

       More FDA tobacco regulations fall into the category of paternalistic regulations. A

paternalistic regulation forbids options or changes incentives to encourage consumers to make

choices that are more closely aligned with their fully optimizing choices. 3 An example of an

almost literally paternalistic regulation is the TCA’s ban of cigarette sales to minors. The ban is

intended to prevent youth smoking by imposing significant new costs on underage potential

purchasers (Abouk and Adams forthcoming). The FDA (2014, p. 13) notes that restrictions on

youth access might also prevent youth smoking through social norms. We categorize regulations

that stigmatize tobacco use as paternalistic regulations because they impose the direct utility cost

of social disapproval. Another paternalistic regulation already implemented is the TCA’s ban of

flavors in cigarettes, other than menthol. As mentioned in the introduction, the FDA is

considering other tobacco regulations including: banning menthol cigarettes, reducing cigarette

nicotine content, and banning flavors in small cigars. Each of these potential regulations fits our

definition of a paternalistic regulation: although designed to encourage healthier choices (by

discouraging smoking) they forbid certain options and are not cheap or easy to avoid.

       Tobacco regulations do not always fall neatly into our categories of nudges and

paternalistic regulations. The TCA’s graphic warning labels regulation is a prominent example.

A graphic warning label might appear to be a nudge that increases the salience of the health

consequences of smoking and serves as a counter-cue to smoking (Levy, Norton and Smith 2016,

p. 26). However, the experimental study used to develop and test the proposed graphic warning




3
 To extend Thaler and Sunstein’s imagery, paternalistic regulations could also be called
“shoves.”
                                                Page 6 of 57
labels did not find strong evidence that exposure to the labels improved smokers’ awareness

about health consequences (Nonemaker et al. 2010). Instead, the experiments find that exposure

to the images on most of the labels elicited strong emotional responses including feeling

“disgusted or grossed out” and that “the pack is difficult to look at.” Consumer heterogeneity

further complicates the categorization problem. Graphic warning labels might be nudges for

some consumers, but to the extent they impose the direct utility cost of disgust, they also fit our

definition of a paternalistic regulation. 4

        Our analysis does not consider the impact of FDA tobacco regulations on product

manufacturing costs or new product entry. Many health, safety, and environmental regulations

substantially increase manufacturing costs of products such as automobiles (Viscusi, Harrington

and Vernon 2005, pp. 804 – 807). However, most of the implemented and proposed FDA

tobacco regulations do not require major changes in manufacturing processes. For example, label

changes to meet the graphic warning labels requirement create an estimated one-time cost of

about $0.03 per pack. 5




4
 The Thaler and Sunstein definition of a nudge is intuitive but not precise, which raises hard-to-
answer questions. Is the disgust created by graphic warning labels a significant change in
economic incentives? In Canada and other countries that require graphic warning labels, some
smokers purchase pack covers or store their cigarettes in non-labeled cases. Does the availability
of aluminum cigarette cases for less than $CAN 5.00 mean that the graphic warning labels are
cheap and easy to avoid? Avoiding the labels involves some inconvenience and cost, and
smokers are still exposed to the labels when they make purchases.
5
 The total one-time costs of the labeling change are estimated to be in the range of $273 to $465
million (FDA 2011, p. 36735). 14.4 billion packs of cigarettes were sold in the U.S. in 2011
(Orzechowski and Walker 2011).

       FDA tobacco regulations might have a more significant impact on the entry of new

products, most notably vaping products. The FDA’s deeming regulation extends its authority to

regulate tobacco products to include vaping products (FDA 2016). After a grace period, vaping

product manufacturers will be required to submit marketing applications in order to continue to

sell their products. The FDA (2016, Tables 11a and 12a) estimates that manufacturers will face

costs between $182,000 and $2 million per application for e-liquids and between $286,000 and

$2.6 million per application for delivery systems. The FDA estimates that rather than face these

costs, between 50 and 87.5 percent of current manufacturers of e-liquids and 50 percent of

current manufacturers of delivery systems will not enter the new regulated market. The

implications of regulation-induced entry costs for market concentration, prices, product variety

and ultimately consumer welfare are beyond the scope of our analysis.

FDA Tobacco Regulations: Model and Welfare Analysis

A Two-Period Model of Smoking and FDA Regulations

       We develop a simple two period model of smoking and FDA tobacco regulations. The

model assumes that smoking only creates adverse consequences in period 2. The consumer can

avoid all health consequences by reducing period 2 cigarette consumption: just-in-time (JIT)

quitting. This assumption is based on evidence from epidemiologic and econometric studies that

smokers who quit by around age 40 avoid almost all of the excess mortality risk associated with

smoking (Doll et al. 2004, Jha et al. 2013, Darden, Gilleskie and Strumf 2016). Our JIT

assumption is an approximation to capture the patterns shown in the survival curves in these

studies. Our JIT assumption also abstracts away from the immediate morbidity risks of smoking.



                                               Page 8 of 57
Mortality risks are valued so much more heavily than morbidity risks that they dominate

consumer decision-making and social welfare calculations. 6

       Period 1 decision utility (V1) is assumed to be a quasi-linear function of the quality (G1)

and quantity (A1) of cigarettes consumed and a composite commodity (Y1):

               𝑉1 = 𝐺1 𝑈(𝐴1 ) + 𝑌1                                                            (1)

       Period 2 decision utility (V2) includes terms for the consumer’s perceived adverse

consequences of cigarette consumption. We model these consequences as utility losses of L2|1 of

period 2 loss per unit of period 1 cigarette consumption and L2|2 of period 2 loss per unit of

period 2 cigarette consumption:

               𝑉2 = 𝐺2 𝑈(𝐴2 ) + 𝑌2 − 𝐿2|1 𝐴1 − 𝐿2|2 𝐴2                                        (2)

       L2|1 includes the perceived utility losses due to withdrawal costs: period 1 cigarette

consumption increases the utility cost of reducing cigarette consumption in period 2. In this way,

our model is a special case of the Becker and Murphy (1988) rational addiction model. L2|2

includes the perceived utility losses due to the smoking-related mortality and morbidity if the

individual continues to consume cigarettes in period 2.

       Lifetime decision utility is given by:



6
 For example, Sloan et al. (2004, Table 11.1, p. 252) estimate the present value of the private
costs of smoking to a 24-year-old smoker in 2000. The morbidity and disability costs are only 17
percent the size of the mortality costs. In the data used in the Sloan et al. calculations (Table 9.5,
p. 208) 85 percent of the most severe measure of disability due to smoking is experienced by
smokers over the age of 50, which implies that more than 85 percent is experienced by smokers
over the age of 40. Putting these estimates together suggests that abstracting from the immediate
morbidity costs of smoking to smokers under the age of 40 misses less than 10 percent of the
value of the adverse consequences of smoking.
                                                 Page 9 of 57
               𝑉1 + 𝑉2 = 𝐺1 𝑈(𝐴1 ) + 𝑌1 + 𝐺2 𝑈(𝐴2 ) + 𝑌2 − 𝐿2|1 𝐴1 − 𝐿2|2 𝐴2 (3)

       Tobacco policies enter the model as follows. First, a cigarette tax T enters the standard

lifetime budget constraint. The consumer faces exogenous period 1 and period 2 incomes (Z1 and

Z2) and a cigarette price P which is a function of the tax: P = P (T).

       Second, we assume that a corrective nudge regulation determines the fraction N of the

experienced adverse consequences (denoted by superscript E) that are perceived by the

consumer: L2|1 = N LE2|1 and L2|2 = N LE2|2. When N < 1 the consumer creates an internality for

himself in period 2. We take a reduced-form approach to behavioral welfare economics and do

not specify the source of the behaviors that create the internalities (Mullanaithan et al. 2012).

Possible sources of the internalities include imperfect information, present bias, time

inconsistency, and projection bias. Our simple approach to model the regulation captures the

Thaler and Sunstein (2009) definition of a nudge. The nudge N does not enter the budget

constraint or directly influence utility. Instead, increasing N helps correct consumers’ mistakes

and moves their perceptions of the adverse consequences of smoking closer to what they will

actually experience.

       Third, a paternalistic regulation R changes cigarette quality, which we assume scales the

utility from consuming cigarettes. We assume unregulated quality is the same in both periods (G1

= G2 = G) and exogenous to the consumer. 7 Normalizing unregulated quality to 1, the paternalist

regulation reduces cigarette quality to G = 1 – R.



7
 We do not explicitly model the choice of quality, but our approach is consistent with the
assumption that in the unregulated market profit-maximizing firms provide the consumer’s
preferred quality level. The regulation prevents the market from providing that level of quality.
                                                Page 10 of 57
       Substituting the policy variables into the model, the decision utility-maximizing choices

of cigarette consumption A1* and A2* solve the first order conditions:

                                 𝜕𝑈1
                       (1 − 𝑅)         − 𝑃(𝑇) − 𝑁𝐿𝐸2|1 = 0                                   (4a)
                                 𝜕𝐴1

                                 𝜕𝑈2
                       (1 − 𝑅)         − 𝑃(𝑇) − 𝑁𝐿𝐸2|2 = 0                                   (4b)
                                 𝜕𝐴2

       The first order conditions can be re-arranged to show the familiar condition that the

consumer compares the marginal benefits of consuming cigarettes to the price:

                                 𝜕𝑈1
                       (1 − 𝑅)         − 𝑁𝐿𝐸2|1 = 𝑃(𝑇)                                       (5a)
                                 𝜕𝐴1

                                 𝜕𝑈2
                       (1 − 𝑅)         − 𝑁𝐿𝐸2|2 = 𝑃(𝑇)                                       (5b)
                                 𝜕𝐴2

       Figure 1 illustrates the impact of a nudge regulation on the consumer’s optional choice of

cigarette consumption. The Figure shows the case of linear demand curves and assumes the

initial levels of the policy variables are N*, R*, and T*. The period 1 and period 2 subscripts are

supressed in the Figure. The left hand sides of equations (5a) and (5b) show the marginal

benefits from consuming cigarettes, taking into account the reductions in quality due to the

regulation paternalistic regulation R*, and net of the perceived adverse consequences. Because

utility is in a money metric (through the assumed quasi-linear utility), these expressions

correspond to the consumer’s Observed Demand curve for cigarettes. In Figure 1, increasing the

nudge regulation from the initial level N* to 1 shifts the demand curve down by the corrected

internality given by (N* – 1) LE. The consumer’s cigarette consumption drops from A* to A**.

Because a nudge regulation that reaches N = 1 fully corrects the internality, the new demand

curve is labeled “Rational Demand;” this demand curve is used for social welfare analysis below.

                                               Page 11 of 57
       Figure 2 illustrates the impact of a paternalistic regulation. The regulation scales marginal

utility in the first order conditions, so increasing the paternalistic regulation from R* to R**

rotates the demand curve downwards to the Post-Regulation Demand curve. In order to compare

the different types of regulations, we show the case where the paternalistic regulation R** also

reduces cigarette consumption from A* to A** (the level reached by the nudge regulation that

reaches N=1).

Welfare Analysis

       We now turn to develop expressions for the impact of tobacco regulations on social

welfare. We assume social welfare depends on lifetime experience utility, not decision utility

(Kahneman, Wakker and Sarin 1997). In particular, we assume that experience utility depends

upon the true experienced consequences of cigarette consumption (LE2|1 and LE2|2), even though

when making decisions the consumer only considers a fraction N of these consequences. We

further assume that cigarette consumption creates an externality X per unit of consumption. The

externality includes the health consequences of non-smokers’ exposure to tobacco smoke. We

assume tax revenues are re-distributed back to the consumer by lump-sum transfers.

       Following Chetty’s (2009) “sufficient statistics” approach to welfare economic and

letting C ( ) be the cost function for producing cigarettes, social welfare is then given by:



       𝑊 = �𝑚𝑎𝑥 (1 − 𝑅)𝑈(𝐴1 ) + 𝑍1 − 𝐶(𝐴1 ) − 𝑇𝐴1 + (1 − 𝑅)𝑈(𝐴2 ) + 𝑍2 −

       𝐶𝐴2−𝑇𝐴2−𝐿2|1𝐸𝐴1−𝐿2|2𝐸𝐴2+𝑇𝐴1+𝑇𝐴2−𝑋𝐴1−𝑋𝐴2                                                  (6)

       The marginal impact of taxation on social welfare is given by:

       As Chetty (2009) emphasizes, under assumptions of utility-maximization, profit-

maximization and perfect competition, the envelope theorem quickly simplifies expressions like

equation (7). Profit-maximization and perfect competition imply that marginal cost MC = C’ ( ).

If there are no behavioral biases, or equivalently if N = 1, the { } terms in equation (7) would

equal zero by the first order conditions for utility maximization. With behavioral biases, to

simplify equation (7) further we add and subtract N LE2|1 dA1/dT and N LE2|2 dA2/dT. Exploiting

the first order conditions now simplifies equation (7) to:

               𝜕𝑊                 𝜕𝐴1                𝜕𝐴2                    𝜕𝐴1                    𝜕𝐴2

       In a similar way, the expressions for the impact of nudge and paternalistic regulations on

social welfare simplify to:

       Equations (8), (9) and (10) demonstrate four important results about the impact of

tobacco control policies on social welfare.

       First, equations (8) and (9) show that in the presence of uncorrected externalities and

internalities, a tax or a nudge to reduce cigarette consumption improves social welfare. 8 As other

analyses of tobacco regulations recognize, a tax and a nudge have the same implications for

social welfare (Cutler et al. 2015, Levy, Norton and Smith 2016).

       Second, and in sharp contrast to a tax or a nudge, equation (10) shows that even in the

presence of uncorrected externalities and internalities a paternalistic regulation might either

improve or worsen social welfare. In equation (10) the social welfare gains from reducing

externalities and internalities (given by the first four terms on the right-hand-side of equation 10)

are balanced against the utility losses created by the regulation (given by the last two terms of

equation 10). The paternalistic regulation is like a tax in that it creates losses for consumers, but

there is no offsetting consumer gains from the lump-sum re-distribution of tax revenues (Glaeser

2006, Loewenstein and O’Donoghue 2006).

       Third, equations (8), (9) and (10) show that the social welfare gains from new policies do

not only depend on the size of the internalities and externalities, but also depend on the extent to

which current policies already correct the problems. The terms (N – 1) LE2|1 and (N – 1) LE2|2

show the size of the uncorrected internalities. When N is a small fraction, the uncorrected




8
 Equations (8) and (9) and their derivations parallel Mullainathan et al. (2012, pp. 521 – 522)
equations (6) and (7).
                                                Page 14 of 57
internalities are larger (in absolute value), so any of the policies – a tax, a further nudge, or a

paternalistic regulation – tend to yield larger welfare gains. If N = 1 current policies already fully

correct the internalities, so the only welfare gains stem from reducing externalities. Because the

nudge policy is intended to correct consumer mistakes, it is natural to think of N as a fraction

that cannot exceed one. However, consumer heterogeneity means that it is not always clear in

which direction consumers should be nudged (Goldin 2015). For example, salience-based

information campaigns have the potential to over-correct consumer perceptions of the adverse

consequences. Surveys find that both smokers and non-smokers on average over-estimate the

mortality risks of smoking (Viscusi 1990). If N > 1, new policies (T, N, or R) that reduce

consumption exacerbate the welfare losses from the pre-existing over-correction of the

internalities. 9

          Fourth, although internalities are the main focus of FDA regulations, equations (8), (9)

and (10) show that welfare analysis of anti-smoking policies should include the value of reduced

externalities. 10 However, it is crucial to take into account the extent to which current taxes

already correct for the externalities. Chaloupka et al. (2015, p. 113) argue that failing to account

for a reduction in non-smokers’ exposure to tobacco smoke is a “major omission” in the FDA’s

CBA of graphic warning labels. Equations (8), (9), and (10) show that Chaloupka et al. are

wrong because they ignore current cigarette taxes. Sloan et al. (2004, p. 256) conclude that at the

    But if there are uncorrected externalities, the new policies might still increase social welfare.
10
  Allcott, Mullanaithan and Taubinsky (2014, p. 76) show that an energy tax can improve social
welfare through two channels: externality reduction and internality reduction. They call this an
“internality dividend from externality taxes.” Equations (9) and (10) show that there can be an
externality dividend from internality regulations.

time of their study the average U.S. cigarette tax was about equal to the external cost per pack,

i.e. T ≈ E. Jin et al. (2015) point out that since the Sloan et al. study cigarette taxes have tripled,

while other policies have independently decreased externalities from smoking. For example,

from 2000–2009 the fraction of the U.S. population covered by smoke free worksite laws

increased from 3 percent to 54 percent and the fraction covered by smoke free restaurant laws

increased from 13 percent to 63 percent (Gonzalez, Sanders-Jackson, Song, Cheng & Glantz,

2013). The fraction of households with home smoking bans increased from 42 percent in

1992/1993 to 82 percent in 2010/2011. 11 We are not aware of estimates of external costs that

update Sloan et al. (2004), and such an update is far beyond the scope of our study. We note the

important possibility that current taxes might already over-correct for externalities. If T > E, new

policies (T, N, or R) that reduce consumption exacerbate the welfare losses from the over-

correction of the externalities. Hereafter we will adopt the simplifying assumption that T = E,

which means the terms involving externalities drop out of equations (8), (9), and (10).

Information Needed for CBA of FDA Regulations

Information on FDA Regulations and Cigarette Demand

        Equations (9) and (10) provide the behavioral welfare economics foundation for CBAs of

an FDA nudge or paternalistic regulation. Integrating each equation provides an expression for

the difference in social welfare with and without the regulation in question. The shaded areas in

Figures 1 and 3 illustrate the welfare impacts. In both Figures 1 and 3, because we consider




11
  Authors’ calculations from analysis of data from the Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current
Population Survey.
                                                 Page 16 of 57
regulations that reduce cigarette consumption by the same amount, the regulations create

identical triangular areas of welfare gains from correcting the internalities. In Figure 3 there is an

additional area that reflects the welfare losses from reducing cigarette quality and hence

consumer utility.

        The key pieces of information needed for CBA of tobacco regulation are estimates of the

internalities smokers imposes on themselves: (N* – 1) LE. Figures 1 and 3 illustrate a useful way

to describe the approach: conduct standard welfare analysis using the Rational Demand curve for

cigarettes, which incorporates the true experienced adverse consequences LE. In general,

deriving Rational Demand from Observed Demand requires an estimate of the uncorrected

internality.

        Figure 1 shows the special case where the nudge changes from N* to 1, completely

eliminating the internality. In this case, to measure the nudge regulation’s impact on social

welfare only requires estimating the pre- and post-regulation demand curves, because they

correspond to the Observed and Rational Demand curves. This is consistent with the insight that

observing consumers’ responses to nudges provides information about the size of the internality

(Levy, Norton, and Smith 2016, p. 26). In a non-tobacco example, Allcott and Taubinsky (2015)

evaluate a field experiment where consumers were given information about the cost savings from

adopting energy‐efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs). Allcott and Taubinsky use the

post‐information demand curve to measure the benefits of correcting internalities that lead to

under‐use of CFLs.

        To capture the general case when the nudge does not fully correct the internality, Figure 1

would be modified to show that the post-regulation demand curve remains higher than the

                                                Page 17 of 57
Rational Demand curve. In this case using the pre- and post-regulation demand curves provides a

lower bound estimate of the welfare gain from the nudge. Because the nudge only partially

corrects the internality, the post-regulation demand curve only partially captures the value of the

internality. To completely measure the welfare gain from the nudge requires additional

information about the size of the full internality, not just the part of the internality corrected by

the nudge. Jin et al. (2015) use this approach in their retrospective CBA of U.S. anti-smoking

policies: they attribute shifts in the observed demand for cigarettes to the combined impact on

anti-smoking nudge policies (policies that improved consumer information about the

consequences of smoking). As will be discussed in more detail below, they measure the size of

the internality based on the cigarette demand by a comparison group of consumers whose

choices are assumed not to involve internalities.

       Figure 3 shows that in addition to an estimate of the internality, CBA of a paternalistic

regulation also requires an estimate of the value of the utility loss from the regulation-induced

decrease in product quality. Paternalistic regulations change tobacco product attributes that are

valued by consumers. The value of the attributes can be estimated using revealed or stated

preference data. A retrospective CBA of a paternalistic regulation can rely on revealed

preferences and compare the pre- and post-regulation demand curves: the demand shift reveals

the value of the attribute changed by the regulation. A separate estimate of the internality is still

required to complete the CBA. 12




12
  If a single policy functions partly as a nudge and partly as a paternalistic regulation, the shift in
the demand curve does not separately identify the value of the internality and the value of the
reduced product quality. For example, graphic warning labels might nudge some consumers but
                                                 Page 18 of 57
       A prospective CBA of a paternalistic regulation might also be able to rely on revealed

preferences. In principle, observed choices between tobacco products with different attributes

such as flavors and nicotine levels reveal the value consumers place on these attributes. In

practice, it might often be difficult to identify and estimate structural preference parameters. The

FDA regulations might also involve attribute changes beyond the range observed in the market,

most notably when attributes like flavors or menthol are completely banned. In these situations,

analysis of stated preference data from discrete choice models is a promising alternative

approach (Pesko et al. 2016, Marti et al. 2016). As Louviere, Hensher and Swait (2000, pp. 228 –

230) put it, data from DCEs show “the world as it could be … if we wish to consider markets

fundamentally different from existing ones.”

       A complete CBA of a paternalistic regulation requires information about heterogeneity in

consumer preferences for the attributes changed by the regulation. The shaded area of welfare

loss in Figure 2 is analogous to the “rectangle” loss of consumer surplus from a tax. The shape of

the shaded area of welfare loss in Figure 3 captures another insight about the costs of

paternalistic regulation: the marginal cost of the regulation is higher at lower levels of

consumption. This reflects diminishing marginal utility combined with our modelling

assumption that by reducing the good’s quality the regulation scales utility and thus marginal

utility. Although the result reflects a specific modelling assumption, the prediction is consistent

with broad patterns in cigarette demand. Smokers who consume fewer cigarettes per day are




impose direct utility costs on other consumers. Because both effects cause the demand curve to
shift, additional information would be needed to determine the shift due to the nudge versus the
shift due to direct utility costs.

more likely to smoke premium brands and pay higher prices. 13 Because lighter smokers are

willing to pay more for higher-quality cigarettes, a paternalistic regulation that decreases

cigarette quality imposes a relatively higher cost on lighter smokers and a relatively lower cost

on heavier smokers.

The Consumer Surplus Offset

       The first step of another approach to CBAs of tobacco regulations requires an estimate of

the value of the health benefits from reduced cigarette consumption (FDA 2011, 2014, Ashley et

al. 2014). In the second step, this estimate is combined with an estimate of the consumer surplus

offset – how much of the benefits of improved health are offset by consumer surplus utility

losses from the reduced consumption. The first step introduces an additional demand curve that

corresponds to N = 0 and shows demand when none of the adverse consequences of cigarette

consumption are taken into account. The vertical distance between this demand curve and the

Observed Demand curve is given by (N* - 1) LE. The second step conducts standard welfare

analysis of the change in consumption with respect to the Rational Demand curve. The second

step – variously termed the consumer surplus offset, the utility offset, or the lost pleasure




13
  In a descriptive linear probability model of smokers’ brand choice in the 2001 – 2014 National
Survey on Drug Use and Health, light smokers are about 13 percentage points more likely to
smoke a premium brand. In a descriptive ordinary least squares model of the price paid for
cigarettes in the 2006 – 2012 TUS-CPS, light smokers pay on average about $0.47 more per
pack. Results available upon request.

approach – has been quite controversial. Comments submitted to the FDA and commentaries in

public health journals object to the concept of consumer surplus from tobacco consumption. 14

       The consumer surplus offset approach still requires an estimate of the size of the

internality in order to calculate the offset (Levy, Norton and Smith 2016). As a simple example

in our model, consider estimating the benefits that a marginal nudge creates for period 2

consumers. The health consequences of period 2 consumption are given by LE2|2 A2. The value of

the health benefits (H) when the nudge reduces period 2 consumption is given by:



                                      𝜕𝐻               𝜕𝐴2
                                           = −𝐿𝐸2|2                                          (11)
                                      𝜕𝑁                𝜕𝑁

       The offset is one minus the ratio of the impact of the nudge on social welfare and its

health benefits:

                                         𝜕𝑊 𝜕𝐻
                         𝑂𝑓𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑡 = 1 −      �   = 1 − �(𝑁 − 1)𝐿𝐸2|2 ���−𝐿𝐸2|2 �

       When consumers make large mistakes and fail to consider almost all of the consequences

of smoking, N is close to zero. In this case, almost all of the consequences are internalities. The

health benefits from reduced consumption approximate the social welfare gains from reduced

  Levy, Norton and Smith (2015) provide a more detailed discussion of the consumer surplus
offset controversy. FDA (2011, 2016) summarize the public comments received about the
consumer surplus offset. Commentaries in public health journals criticizing the use offset include
Song, et al. (2014), Chaloupka, et al. (2014) and Chaloupka et al. (2015). Popular press
discussions include Tavernise (2014), New York Times Editorial Board (2014) and a Sunday
Doonesbury comic strip by Garry Trudeau (September 14, 2014).

consumption: only a small fraction N of the health benefits are offset. If consumers are perfectly

informed and rational, N = 1. In this case, there are no internalities because consumers make

fully optimizing choices. None of the health benefits reflect social welfare gains: one hundred

percent of the health benefits are offset. If existing nudges over-correct the internalities, N > 1. In

this case, a further nudge reduces social welfare: more than 100 percent of the health benefits are

offset by losses in consumer utility from reduced consumption. Our derivation and discussion of

equation (12) parallels Levy, Norton and Smith’s (2016) graphical analysis and discussion of the

consumer surplus offset.

Re-examining the Evidence Base on Internalities

       Recent reviews emphasize the difficulty of empirically measuring internalities in general

and in the specific context of cigarette consumption (Mullanaithan, Schwartstein, and Congdon,

2012, FDA 2016, Levy, Norton and Smith 2016). However, two recent studies reach strong

conclusions that cigarette consumption involves large internalities. In a commentary on the

FDA’s CBA of the graphic warning label regulation, Chaloupka et al. (2015, p. 117) argue that

“Nearly all of the ‘lost pleasure’ from tobacco use, as represented by conventionally measured

consumer surplus, should not be included as a cost in FDA analyses….” In a White Paper about

methods to conduct CBA of regulations that affect addictive consumption, Cutler et al. (2015, p.

43) suggest that regulations that reduce cigarette consumption do not impose very large costs on

consumers because: “people deterred from smoking have no utility loss;” and “most regulations

will induce quitting among smokers who will not miss smoking in the long term.” Both of these

studies frame the question in terms of the consumer surplus offset and suggest that the offset

ratio is very small. As discussed above, this conclusion is mathematically equivalent to the

                                                Page 22 of 57
conclusion that the internalities from cigarette consumption are very large. In this section we use

our model as a framework to re-examine the evidence base for this strong conclusion.

Evidence Base from Chaloupka et al. (2015)

       Chaloupka et al. (2015) base much of their argument about the size of the consumer

surplus offset and internalities on what they term the “principle of insufficient reason.” They

argue that laws restricting youth access to cigarettes mean that for individuals under the legal age

“society has clearly decided that the decision to initiate smoking is an irrational decision.” (p.

116). In our model, the term (N – 1) LE2|1 captures the internalities adolescents’ irrational

decisions to smoke in period 1 impose on their future selves in period 2. Our model makes the

important distinction between this internality and the internality created by continuing to

consume cigarettes in period 2: (N – 1) LE2|2. If insufficient reason in period 1 is the only source

of consumer mistakes, currently rational adults will make consumption choices in period 2 that

maximize their period 2 experienced utility. As a result, the terms involving LE2|2 envelope out of

the welfare expressions in equations (9) and (10). In this case the welfare gains from tobacco

regulations depend upon the size of the internality given by (N – 1) LE2|1|.

       Available empirical evidence suggests that the distinction between the two types of

internalities captured by the terms LE2|1 and LE2|2 is quite important. The term LE2|1 captures

addiction and reflects the withdrawal costs in period 2 created by period 1 consumption. Cutler et

al. (2015, p. 31) estimate that the utility cost of withdrawal is in the range from $6,200 to

$20,100. By comparison, Cutler et al. (2015, Table 5, p. 30) estimate that the value of the




                                                Page 23 of 57
lifetime health consequences (LE2|2) is in the range from about $450,000 to $1.5 million. 15

Chaloupka et al. (p. 31) cite suggestive evidence that many adolescents under-estimate the

difficulty of quitting, which implies that the relevant N is a small fraction. However, even if N is

close to zero, the internality created by adolescents’ failure to consider future withdrawal costs is

likely to be small.

       In addition to the principle of reason applied to internalities from period 1 consumption,

Chaloupka et al. (2015) review evidence from surveys of smokers. The evidence helps establish

that most smokers face internalities from period 1 and/or period 2 consumption. However, the

evidence is not very informative about the size of the internalities. Chaloupka et al. (2015, p.

116) cite survey evidence that more than 90 percent of smokers agree or strongly agree with the

statement: “If you had to do it over again, you would not have started smoking.” This suggests

most smokers experience internalities from their period 1 decision to start: (N – 1) LE2|1 > 0.

They also point out that in many surveys almost 70 percent of current smokers express an

interest in quitting, but less than 3 percent of smokers quit each year. This suggests that many

smokers are not able to make optimal period 2 consumption choices and continue to impose

internalities on themselves: (N – 1) LE2|2 > 0. Unlike contingent valuation surveys, the cited

surveys were not designed to elicit stated preferences about the value consumers place on

smoking or quitting. Nevertheless, they provide suggestive evidence of internalities: cigarette




15
   The ranges of the estimates reflect different assumptions about the appropriate social discount
rate and value of a statistical life or QALY.
                                                Page 24 of 57
consumers make choices that they regret, and the decisions might be inconsistent with their

experience utility.

       Even if the survey responses are interpreted as meaning that most smokers fail to make

optimal cigarette consumption choices, the responses provide very little information about the

size of the internalities. For example, the survey responses might mean that 90 percent of

smokers regret having imposed small internalities on themselves. 16 Evidence that 90 percent of

smokers face internalities is not evidence that 90 percent of smokers receive no utility from

smoking. Similarly, the gap between stated interest in quitting and quit behavior might reflect

fairly small deviations in the optimal timing of quitting. Although the annual cessation rate is

low, many smokers quit in time to avoid some or even most of the adverse health consequences

of smoking: one-third of ever-smokers quit by the age of 40; one-half of ever-smokers quit by

the age of 50; and two-thirds of ever-smokers quit by the age of 60. 17




16
   Respondents to the survey cited by Chaloupka et al. (2014) indicated whether they strongly
agreed, agreed, neither agreed nor disagreed, disagreed, or strongly disagreed with the statement
about doing it over again. About 50 percent strongly agreed and 39 percent agreed. It seems
reasonable to infer that the 50 percent who strongly agreed feel that they imposed relatively
larger internalities on themselves, but it is hard to infer much about the absolute sizes of the
internalities of the different groups of respondents.
17
  Authors’ calculations from the TUS-CPS; detailed results available upon request. As noted
above, epidemiologic and econometric studies provide evidence that quitting by the age of 40s
avoid almost all of the excess mortality risk due to smoking. For example, Jha et al. (2013)
estimate that of the 10 years difference in life expectancy between never-smokers and current
smokers: smokers who quit by age 40 gain 9 years of life expectancy; smokers who quit by age
50 gain 6 years of life expectancy; and smokers who quit by age 60 gain 4 years of life
expectancy.

Evidence Base from Cutler et al. (2015)

         Cutler et al. (2015) develop a general approach and piece together evidence to quantify

the size of the internalities from cigarette consumption. The goal of their analysis is to compare

the consumer’s lifetime utility with a new regulation to their utility in a counter-factual world

without the regulation. In the notation of our model, this is the comparison of lifetime experience

utility from consuming A1** and A2** with the regulation to lifetime experience utility from A1*

and A2* without the regulation. The comparison can also be expressed as the difference between

lifetime decision utilities each period (equations 1 and 2) adjusted for the difference in

internalities:

                 Lifetime utility gain = 𝑉1 (𝐴1∗∗ ) − 𝑉1 (𝐴1∗ ) + 𝑉2 (𝐴∗∗         ∗
                                                                       2 ) − 𝑉2 (𝐴2 )

                        (𝑁 − 1)𝐿2|1 [𝐴1∗∗ − 𝐴1∗ ] + (𝑁 − 1)𝐿2|1 [𝐴1∗∗ − 𝐴1∗ ]                 (13)

        Cutler et al. (2015) focus on the consumer surplus or utility offset. Equation (12) shows

the offset ratio for a marginal change in a nudge regulation. The analogue for the offset ratio for

a discrete change in a nudge regulation from N* to N** simplifies to:

        Offset ratio    = 1 – (Lifetime Utility Gain) / (Health Gain)

                            [𝑉1 (𝐴∗∗       ∗        ∗∗       ∗
                                  1 )−𝑉1 (𝐴1 )+𝑉2 (𝐴2 )−𝑉2 (𝐴2 )]
                        =                                                                    (14)
                              �𝐿𝐸     ∗   ∗∗   𝐸     ∗   ∗∗
                                2|1 (𝐴1 −𝐴1 )+𝐿2|2 (𝐴2 −𝐴2 )�


         Cutler et al. (2015) piece together estimates of the terms of equation (14) to develop a

range of empirical estimates of the offset. For the denominator of equation (13) they compute

standard estimates of the value of the health consequences of smoking (Cutler et al. 2015, p.29).

Their main focus is on developing new evidence about the terms in the numerator of equation


                                                Page 26 of 57
(14). More precisely, they focus on the utility losses, i.e. the negative of the numerator which

shows the utility losses due to the regulation’s impact on lifetime utility from cigarette

consumption and other goods in periods 1 and 2:

                        𝑉1 (𝐴1∗∗ ) − 𝑉1 (𝐴1∗ ) = 𝐺𝑈(𝐴1∗∗ ) − 𝑃𝐴1∗∗                               (15a)

                        𝑉2 (𝐴∗∗         ∗         ∗∗      ∗∗
                             2 ) − 𝑉2 (𝐴2 ) = 𝐺𝑈(𝐴2 ) − 𝑃𝐴2                                      (15b)

It is important to stress that the regulation’s impact on lifetime experience utility through

improving health and avoiding addiction is already captured in the denominator of equation (14)

and should not be double-counted in the numerator.

        Revealed preference evidence casts doubt on Cutler et al.’s conclusion that deterred

initiators suffer no utility loss. Of course, an inherent challenge for behavioral welfare economics

is that internalities mean that revealed preferences are not a reliable guide to the consumption

choices that maximize lifetime experience utility. However, to put together the pieces of

equation (14) it is useful to first consider the simpler question: Is there is a loss in period 1 utility

that offsets part of the period 2 health and addiction benefits from the nudge regulation? To use

equation (15a) to analyze deterred initiation we assume that with the regulation at N** cigarette

consumption and utility from cigarette consumption drop to zero. The expression for the utility

loss then simplifies to: G U (A1*) – P A1*. The classic revealed preference argument is that

because A1* solves the consumer’s maximization problem, the utility from consumption must

exceed the costs: G U (A1*) > P A1*. Cutler et al. (2015, p. 35) estimate that the costs of

cigarette consumption are $1,350 per year. Their problematic claim is that the utility from A1* is

approximately zero. This claim leads to their conclusion that the nudge regulation benefits

consumers because it results in $1,350 of savings per year for deterred initiators. Revealed
                                                 Page 27 of 57
preferences imply instead that in period 1 the regulation creates a net utility loss for consumers

because the period 1 utility loss exceeds the savings.

       The validity of the revealed preference argument does not require lifetime utility

maximization, but rests on the much weaker assumption of period 1 utility maximization. Most

discussions of the need for a behavioral economics approach to model cigarette consumption

emphasize failures of inter-temporal optimization. For example, Gruber and Koszegi (2001)

review evidence from psychology and behavioral economics research that suggests that

consumers are time inconsistent. Based on this evidence they propose a model with quasi-

hyperbolic discounting and present bias. Similarly, Chaloupka et al. (2015) emphasize time

inconsistency and other biases in inter-temporal optimization. These studies do not provide an

evidence base to conclude that period 1 consumption fails to maximize period 1 utility. 18

       Evidence from revealed and stated preferences also casts doubt on Cutler et al.’s

conclusion that induced quitting does not create long-term utility losses in period 2. If the utility

function does not change between period 1 and 2, the revealed preference argument from period

1 carries over: the utility from cigarette consumption must exceed its costs. From equation (15b)

the utility loss from quitting (A2** = 0) simplifies to G U (A2*) – P A2*. The problematic claim



18
   As discussed in more detail below, Cutler et al. (2015, pp. 34-35) identify a comparison group
of consumers whose smoking behavior might approximate consumer demand without
internalities (in our notation, for whom N = 1). They estimate that 7 percent of this comparison
group initiates smoking, compared to 17 percent of consumers with externalities. In terms of our
Figure 1, this exercise compares Observed Demand to Rational Demand. The difference between
these demand curves is due to the internality (N – 1) LE, so the comparison does not shed light
on the utility loss terms in the numerator of equation (14). That is, the comparison group is less
likely to initiate smoking because they take the future consequences LE2|1 into account, not
because they derive less utility from smoking in period 1.
                                                Page 28 of 57
is that the direct utility from period 2 consumption – G U (A2*) – is very small. If the utility

function has not changed, revealed preference again implies that the utility loss is larger than

$1,350 per year and more than offsets the money cost savings. Note that the issue is not whether

the former smoker will “miss smoking in the long term” (Cutler et al. 2015, p. 43). Instead, the

utility loss is in comparison to the consumer’s utility in a counter-factual world without the

regulation.

       Stated preference evidence suggests that changes in the utility function do not drive most

changes in cigarette consumption between periods 1 and 2, i.e. quitting. Surveys of former

smokers find that only a minority cite costs as the reason for quitting: in studies of the most

important reason an average of 14 percent of former smokers mention cost; in studies that

allowed multiple responses an average of 32 percent mentioned cost (McCaul et al. 2006). This

is suggestive evidence that most quitting is not due to a change in the period 2 utility function

that makes the utility from consumption no longer worth the monetary costs. More former

smokers cite social concerns as the reason for quitting. This is suggestive evidence that for these

smokers G is lower in period 2: anti-smoking norms reduce the utility from cigarette

consumption, making the utility from consumption no longer worth the costs. 19 However, many

more former smokers mention health concerns as the most important reason (average 47 percent)

or among the reasons (75 percent) for quitting. This is suggestive evidence that if there were no




19
  Our model treats G as determined by regulations, but in a more complete model it could reflect
social norms about smoking. The impact of the norms might vary over the life cycle. For
example, in period 1 the utility from smoking might be scaled up to reflect the value of “looking
cool,” but this value might fade in period 2.
                                                Page 29 of 57
health consequences the majority of the smokers would find the period 2 utility from

consumption worth the costs: G U(A2*) > P A2**. As above, we interpret the evidence as only

suggestive because the surveys were not designed to elicit stated preferences about the value

smokers place on different aspects of smoking.

       The claim that the direct utility from period 2 consumption is very small rests on the

argument that period 2 consumption is mainly driven by addiction and the desire to avoid

withdrawal costs. Weimer, Vining and Thomas (2009) report results from a contingent valuation

survey that elicited smokers’ stated preferences for a treatment that would eliminate addiction.

About 30 percent of smokers refused to make the purchase at the lowest bid price offered -- $50

for a treatment effective for one year. The preferred specifications of the bid functions yield an

estimated median willingness to pay of around $200. This relatively low willingness to pay to

eliminate addiction is consistent with the FDA’s (2014) analysis of smokers’ willingness to pay

to quit smoking as revealed in the market for smoking cessation products. The evidence from

these two studies that many smokers are not willing to pay much to avoid withdrawal costs

suggests they derive other utility from consuming cigarettes.

       Another source of revealed preference evidence that continued smoking is not driven by

addiction and the desire to avoid withdrawal costs comes from the rates of re-initiation among

groups of smokers who have quit for extended periods. Because many U.S. prisons and jails

completely ban smoking, many prisoners undergo “forced abstinence”. As many as 97 percent of

inmates return to smoking as soon as they are released (Clarke et al. 2013). In data from the

Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System over 50 percent of women who smoked prior to

pregnancy reported quitting by the last three months of pregnancy. About half of those women

                                               Page 30 of 57
re-start smoking within approximately four months after delivery (Tong et al. 2013). The

prisoners and pregnant women have gone through withdrawal and are no longer physically

dependent on nicotine: they do not resume smoking to avoid nicotine withdrawal. Because they

have quit in the past, it also seems likely that they are well-informed about the difficulty of

quitting again in the future. To the extent decisions to re-initiate smoking after forced abstinence

maximize experience utility, it follows that smokers’ decisions to continue in the absence of

forced-abstinence might also be rational choices that reveal a preference for the utility gained

from smoking.

       To sum up, in this section we have used our model as a framework to re-examine the

empirical evidence base on the internalities from cigarette consumption. Our review suggests

that the evidence base is thin and does not support the strong conclusions reached by Chaloupka

et al. (2014) and Cutler et al. (2015) that the internalities are large. However, we agree with

Cutler et al. (2015) on several key points. First, Cutler et al. (2015, p. 43) stress that CBA should

not disregard “the utility losses people may experience from regulations aimed at curbing

consumption of products with health risks.” Second, throughout their study Cutler et al. discuss

and present evidence that cigarette consumers will experience three types of utility losses from

FDA regulations: short-term withdrawal costs; longer-term utility losses; and additional utility

losses from the regulations we term paternalistic that remove valued product attributes. While we




                                                Page 31 of 57
agree with these points, for the reasons discussed above we disagree when Cutler et al. make the

strong simplifying assumptions that the longer-term utility losses are approximately zero. 20

Potential of Empirical Approaches to Estimate Tobacco-related Internalities

       After using our model to re-examine the current evidence base on tobacco-related

internalities, we now turn to examine the potential of empirical approaches in more detail. We

begin by examining two approaches used in previous research: structural estimation, and

comparison groups. We then turn to two less-developed approaches: subjective well-being, and

consumer demand for commitment devices and nudges.

Structural Estimation of Models of Internalities

       The first established approach to empirical behavioral welfare economics relies on

structural estimation. Structural estimation is a demanding form of the revealed preference

approach. By estimating the parameters of a fully specified behavioral model of consumer

behavior, structural estimation identifies the extent to which observed consumer choices depart

from the choices that maximize experience utility. In terms of our model, it identifies the size of

the internalities (N – 1) LE. In terms of Figures 1 or 3, the structural parameter estimates can be

used to identify both the Observed Demand curve and the Rational Demand curve. Chetty (2015)

points out that behavioral welfare economics based on structural estimation relies on strong

modeling assumptions. This is particularly problematic when results are highly model-specific.

In a non-tobacco example, Abaluck and Gruber (2011) use a structural model to analyze




20
  As a corollary, we also disagree with the Cutler et al. estimate that the money savings from
deterred initiation and induced quitting should be counted as a net benefit for consumers.
                                                Page 32 of 57
Medicare Part D choices and conclude that “welfare would have been 27 percent higher if

patients had all chosen rationally.” Ketcham et al. (forthcoming) re-analyze the data and

conclude that “AG’s evidence of welfare reducing optimization mistakes is driven primarily by

their assumptions about the parametric form of utility and by interpreting econometric error as

consumer mistakes….A simpler version of AG’s model that assumes people maximize expected

utility often makes better out‐of‐sample predictions.”

       The FDA (2011, 2014) and Ashley et al. (2015) use the structural approach to complete

CBAs of tobacco regulations. They rely on parameter estimates and assumptions from Gruber

and Koszegi’s (2001) structural model of cigarette addiction with quasi-hyperbolic

discounting. 21 Three of the key structural parameters are common to rational and behavioral

addiction models: the effect of past consumption on the marginal utility of current consumption

(adjacent complementarity); the rate at which the stock of addictive capital depreciates; and the

standard exponential discount rate δ. The fourth structural parameter is the extra discount rate β

that captures the essence of hyperbolic discounting and leads to present bias: “the discount factor

between consecutive future periods (δ) is larger than between the current period and the next one

β that captures the essence of hyperbolic discounting and leads to present bias (β δ).” (Gruber

and Koszegi 2001, p. 1280). Based on a range of values for the structural parameter estimates,

Gruber and Koszegi (2001, p. 1291) present a range of estimates of the optimal tax on cigarettes

to correct internalities. The optimal tax provides a way to estimate the size of the internality and




21
  In an earlier and related approach, Colman and Remler (2008) use the Gruber and Koszegi
results to explore the regressivity of cigarette taxes in a behavioral economics model.
                                                Page 33 of 57
the difference between the Observed Demand curve and the Rational Demand curve. Ashley et

al. (2015) use Gruber and Koszegi’s results to estimate that the consumer surplus offset ratio is

in the range from 67 percent to 99 percent. Recalling the relationship between the offset ratio and

the size of the internalities, these estimates imply the internalities are moderate to very small.

        Because Gruber and Koszegi’s estimates rely on strong modeling assumptions, they

provide an uncertain evidence base about the size of the internalities. Gruber and Koszegi

estimate a rational addiction model and compare it with their behavioral model with time-

inconsistent addiction. They conclude that “we are unable to empirically distinguish the two with

our data.” (p. 1263). The empirical challenge is to use consumer responses to price changes at

different points in the future to back out the two discounting parameters β and δ. Laporte, Dass

and Ferguson (2016) conduct Monte Carlo experiments and find that in the rational addiction

model the presence of an unstable root to the consumer’s optimal control problem makes it

difficult to extract the exponential discount rate δ. Structural estimation that separately identifies

β and δ is even more challenging. Instead, based on evidence from psychological research

Gruber and Koszegi (2001) assume values for β and δ. In the rational addiction model, which

Gruber and Koszegi cannot rule out, all cigarette consumption choices are optimizing. The

evidence from Gruber and Kocegi (2001) thus rests on modeling assumptions and cannot rule out

the possibility that there are no internalities so the correct offset ratio is zero.

Evidence from Comparison Groups of Consumers

        A second established approach to estimate internalities is to use evidence from

comparison groups whose consumption choices appear likely to reveal their true preferences

over experience utility. In our notation, these consumers do not impose internalities on

                                                  Page 34 of 57
themselves so N = 1 and their demand curve corresponds to the Rational Demand curve in

Figures 1 and 3. Using the information from the comparison group to estimate the Rational

Demand curve, the welfare impacts of the regulations can be measured as the areas shown in

Figure 1 and 3. In a non-tobacco example of this approach, Ketcham et al. (2015) evaluate

consumers’ choices over Medicare Part D prescription drug insurance plans. 42 percent of

consumers were categorized as making suspect choices that involve internalities, either because

their choices violated basic axioms of rational choice or because the consumers making the

choices were badly informed. Ketcham et al. calibrate the preferences of the subset of consumers

who made suspect choices based on proxy measures derived from the behavior of

observationally similar consumers who made non-suspect choices.

       Jin et al. (2015) and Cutler et al. (2015) use the comparison group approach to estimate

the impact of anti-smoking policies and regulations on consumer welfare. Both studies use a

comparison group based on the smoking behavior of highly educated consumers aged 30 – 45. 22

The age restriction focuses on adult consumers who made the decision to start smoking well after

the health consequences of smoking were well-established and widely publicized. The restriction

to highly educated consumers focuses on consumers most able to align their behavior with their

well-informed preferences.

       Although the restrictions used by Jin et al. (2015) and Cutler et al. (2015) probably rule

out most consumers with internalities, they might also rule out cigarette consumption differences




22
  In an alternative approach, Cutler et al. (2015) use a measure of nicotine addiction to identify
consumers who make non-suspect choices about smoking.
                                               Page 35 of 57
that reflect heterogeneity in consumers’ true preferences over experience utility. Consumers

with less schooling might value smoking differently due to differences in time and risk

preferences (Barksy et al. 1997). 23 Moreover, as shown in Table 1 consumers with different

levels of schooling make different choices across various domains: consumers with less than a

high school education are less likely to purchase hardcover books, listen to classical music, or

play golf, and are more likely to enjoy watching religious television.

       The evidence about differences in preferences and consumer behavior by schooling level

casts doubt on whether highly educated consumers are an appropriate source of information

about the non-suspect choices of less educated consumers. Bernheim and Rangel (2005, p. 3)

stress the need for a unified framework for behavioral welfare economics: “If we can classify,

say, the consumption of an addictive substance as contrary to an individual’s interests, what

about choices involving literature, religion, or sexual orientation?” We do not think behavioral

economics provides a principled rationale to over-ride the choices less-educated consumers make

about books, music, television, and golf. Similarly, the various sources of non-suspect preference

heterogeneity make it problematic to use highly educated consumers as a comparison group to

identify the Rational Demand curve of less-educated consumers.

Internalities and Subjective Well-Being

       A third and less-developed approach to behavioral welfare economics is to use data from

surveys of subjective well-being (Chetty 2015). Surveys of subjective well-being (SWB) ask



23
  Time-inconsistent smoking choices that reflect present bias due to hyperbolic discounting
should be considered suspect. But smoking choices that reflect higher conventional discount
rates should be considered non-suspect.
                                               Page 36 of 57
respondents to rate their happiness or life-satisfaction. On the assumption that SWB provides a

measure of individual utility and social welfare, the potential approach is to estimate the impact

of policies on SWB, i.e. estimate dW/dT, dW/dN or dW/dR (the left-hand-sides of equations 9,

10, and 11).

       Some previous research estimates the reduced-form relationship between tobacco control

policies and SWB. In a study using U.S. data from 1973-1998, Gruber and Mullanaithan (2005)

find that higher cigarette taxes lead to higher SWB of consumers likely to smoke. They interpret

this as evidence that a high tax serves as a commitment device that improves the experienced

utility of time-inconsistent smokers. However, subsequent research yields very mixed results

about the relationships between taxes or smoking bans and smokers’ SWB. For example,

Odermatt, Reto & Alois Stutzer (2015) use data for 40 European countries between 1990 and

2011 and find that higher cigarette prices reduce SWB of likely smokers. Within the group of

smokers, higher cigarette prices even reduce SWB of smokers who want to quit. However, the

results suggest that smoking bans improve SWB among smokers who want to quit. 24 In contrast,

Brodeur (2013) uses U.S. data and finds no differential effects of higher taxes on smokers’

versus non-smokers’ SWB. He finds that smoking bans improve the SWB of smokers who do




24
  Instead of examining the impact of a tobacco control policy on SWB, Weinhold and
Chaloupka (2016) examine the association between smoking status and SWB. They find that
former smoker status is not associated with lower well-being and in some specifications is
associated with higher well-being. Because smoking status is endogenously chosen, their results
tend to support the rational model. The results are not informative about whether current
smokers’ consumption involves internalities.
                                               Page 37 of 57
not quit. He suggests this might reflect smokers’ feeling less guilty because with the bans their

smoking does not impose externalities on others.

       An important limitation to the use of SWB data for behavioral welfare economics

concerns the assumption that SWB provides a measure of individual utility and social welfare.

After noting the potential value of SWB data, Chetty (2015) points out: “Self-reported measures

of happiness can be systematically distorted by transient contextual factors, are affected by

selective memory and projection bias, and do not have a clear cardinal interpretation.” Adler

(2016) stresses that by highlighting widespread failures of utility-maximization, behavioral

economics research might even weaken the case for the use of SWB data. If people commonly

make mistakes about which choices will improve their experience utility, their answers to

questions about life satisfaction also might not be very informative about their experience utility.

       Fully incorporating SWB analysis into CBA raises additional unresolved issues. Even

putting aside more recent research and taking the evidence from Gruber and Mullanaithan (2005)

at face value, it provides an estimate that higher cigarette taxes reduce the probability that

consumers who are likely to smoke respond that they are “not happy.” Interpreted as informative

about equation (8), the Gruber and Mullanaithan estimate implies non-zero internalities but does

not provide evidence about the size of the internalities in a dollar metric. A related problem is

how to compare changes in SWB to the costs of a regulation. Bronsteen, Buccafusco and Masur

(2013) use SWB to conduct an analysis of the impact of an environmental regulation on social

welfare. They use an estimate of the impact of an exogenous increase in income on SWB to

translate the regulation’s costs into a SWB-metric. After reviewing this study and the unresolved

questions it raises, Sunstein (2016, p. 117) argues that their exercise represents the state-of-the-

                                                Page 38 of 57
art but “involves far too much guesswork…The most sensible conclusion is that studies of

reported well-being cannot be used as anything like a substitute for cost-benefit analysis, and that

they should not yet play a significant role in regulatory analysis.”

Consumer Demand for Commitment Devices and Nudges

          Another less-developed approach to behavioral welfare economics is to analyze

consumer demand for commitment devices and nudges. When consumers recognize that they

make time-inconsistent choices that impose internalities on their future selves, they value

commitment devices and nudges. Revealed preferences in the form of consumer demand for

commitment devices and nudges thus sheds light on the size of the internalities. Equations (9)

and (10) above can be re-interpreted as showing the consumer’s marginal willingness to pay for

devices and nudges that reduce the internalities they impose on themselves. 25 In principle, either

a structural approach or a reduced-form sufficient statistic approach could be used to analyze

consumers’ revealed preferences and infer the value of tobacco regulations. To the best of our

knowledge, neither approach has been used in this market. Scattered evidence sheds light on the

extent of consumer demand for commitment devices and nudges.

          Some smokers appear to limit their consumption by purchasing cigarettes by the pack

rather than more inexpensively by the carton. Khwaja, Sloan, and Silverman (2007) find that 27

percent of surveyed current smokers at least somewhat agree with the statement that they buy

packs rather than cartons to limit their smoking. DeCicca, Kenkel and Liu (2014) find that

smokers who are more interested in quitting – as indicated by their past attempts to quit or their



25
     In this re-interpretation, the terms involving the externalities drop out.
                                                   Page 39 of 57
stated future intentions to quit – are about seven to eight percentage points more likely to

purchase cigarettes by the pack. Purchasing by the pack increases the price of cigarettes by about

30 percent. Putting these pieces of evidence together with the estimate that the average smoker

spends $1,250 on cigarettes annually, it appears that perhaps 10 to 20 percent of smokers are

willing to pay about $400 annually to limit their smoking. Khwaja et al. (2007) find that in a

response to an open-ended question 81 percent of smokers report using some sort of commitment

device or strategy. Most of the listed strategies, such as actions to distract themselves from

thinking about smoking, appear to involve low costs. Consumer choices to buy packs or use

lower-cost strategies can be thought of as tracing out a demand curve for commitment devices.

Although the evidence base is thin, the market demand for these commitment devices appears to

be small relative to the demand for cigarettes.

       Consumer demand for analogues to potential FDA regulations is another source of

evidence about consumer preferences about internalities. If graphic warning labels provide a

valuable nudge, consumers should be willing to pay extra for packs that carry the warnings.

Evidence from experimental auctions suggests this is true for only a small sub-set of smokers

(Thrasher et al. 2011, Rousu et al. 2104). In the experimental auctions subjects bid on cigarette

packs that either carried versions of a text-only warning label or a graphic warning label. On

average, subjects bid about $0.50 (about 15 percent of the average price) less for packs that

carried a graphic warning label. Almost half of the subjects bid the same amount for packs with

and without a graphic warning label. Only ten percent of the subjects bid more for packs that

carried a graphic warning label.



                                                  Page 40 of 57
         Evidence on revealed preferences in actual markets also tends to suggest that not many

consumers value graphic warning labels as a nudge to help them limit their smoking. The

potential demand for graphic warning labels as a nudge creates a potential profit opportunity for

manufacturers to voluntarily adopt graphic warnings and market the labeled packs to smokers

interesting in quitting or cutting down. To the best of our knowledge, there is not a significant

private market for cigarettes with voluntarily adopted graphic warning labels. However, in

countries that require graphic warning labels there is an active market in cigarette cases and

covers that help consumers avoid seeing the labels.

         The potential FDA ban on menthol cigarettes also has a private analogue: menthol

smokers can voluntarily switch to non-menthol cigarettes. In data from the 2010-11 TUS-CPS,

about four percent of menthol smokers who attempted to quit in the past year report having

switched to non-menthol in order to try to quit (authors’ calculations).

         Over the past 10 years or so, a private market in commitment contracts has emerged.

Cigarette consumers can now use these services to limit or quit smoking. In these contracts,

smokers set a goal of quitting within a specified time period and agree to a financial stake that is

lost if they fail to meet their goal. They can also agree to a third-party referee to monitor their

progress towards the goal. The company stickK advertises that their commitment contracts have

resulted in over 16 million cigarettes not smoked. 26 Without the details about this estimate, it is

impossible to precisely compare private sales of commitment contracts to the size of the cigarette

market, but it appears to be very small. 27 In an online survey of a national sample of smokers, 19

percent of smokers were at least somewhat interested in a commitment contract to quit smoking

(Kenkel et al. 2016).

       The approach of using revealed willingness to pay for private sector commitment devices

and nudges to estimate the value of tobacco regulations faces two challenges. First, many private

sector devices and nudges are fundamentally different from regulations because they are

voluntary. Decisions to buy a pack rather than a carton of cigarettes, to buy a pack with a

voluntarily adopted graphic warning label, or to switch to non-menthol only bind smokers until

their next purchases in a day or two. Smokers who recognize the internalities they impose on

themselves might not be willing to pay much for many private sector devices and nudges

because they are non-binding over longer time periods. Second, only smokers who are

sophisticated enough to recognize their internalities are willing to pay for commitment devices

and nudges. A small willingness to pay might reflect a small internality as in equations (9) and

(10), or naïveté about the existence of a large internality.

Discussion

       In this paper we develop expressions for the impact of tobacco regulations on social

welfare. We use the expressions to re-examine the existing evidence base and to judge the future

potential of empirical approaches to conduct CBAs of FDA tobacco regulations. The analytical



27
   From footnote 5, annual consumption of cigarettes is around 14.4 billion packs, which
corresponds to 288 billion cigarettes. The 16 million cigarettes not smoked make up only a tiny
fraction of total consumption. Even if stickK has a small share of the national market for
commitment contracts, the market demand appears to be very small compared to the market for
cigarettes.
                                                Page 42 of 57
and empirical challenges are not unique to tobacco regulation, or even to regulations that affect

addictive consumption. Instead, CBAs of consumer financial protection regulations,

environmental regulations, and many other types of regulations face similar challenges.

Fortunately, practitioners conducting regulatory CBAs required by Executive Order 12866 can

look to the rapidly growing body of academic research on behavioral welfare economics

(Mullanaithan et al. 2012, Chetty 2015). Our paper helps bridge research on behavioral welfare

economics in general to the specific context of FDA tobacco regulations.

        We do not contribute new empirical evidence on the costs and benefits of FDA tobacco

regulations, but throughout our discussion we cite empirical evidence and discuss the

information that is needed to shed more light on the magnitudes of key parameters. The most

important information needed for CBAs of tobacco regulations are estimates of the internalities

created by tobacco consumption. Our review of previous research identifies not-so-promising

and promising approaches to measure the internalities. Structural estimation of behavioral

models, finding appropriate comparison groups, and analysis of subjective well-being data face

daunting challenges. More promising is the careful analysis of revealed and stated preferences,

including preferences for private sector commitment devices and nudges. An important need is

to move past establishing that internalities exist to the difficult step of measuring the size of the

internalities.

        Our critical review suggests that the evidence base is thin and does not support strong

conclusions that the internalities from cigarette consumption are large. The balance of the

evidence tends to suggest that the internalities might be modest or small. A retrospective CBA of

U.S. anti-smoking policies from 1964 – 2010 provides important context for this tentative

                                                Page 43 of 57
conclusion (Jin et al. 2015). Warner (2007) calls the drop in smoking over this period “the

developed world’s greatest public health achievement in the past half-century.” The retrospective

CBA provides an estimate of the dollar value of the achievement: the 1964-present value of

consumer benefits is $573 billion, which is larger than the 1964-present value of actual cigarette

sales from 1964-2010. Our analytical expressions show that the welfare gains from future anti-

smoking policies diminish when past policies have already partly corrected for internalities. Put

differently, the past public health achievement is perhaps reflected in the empirical evidence that

currently internalities from smoking are modest or small. In this context, it would not be

surprising to find that new tobacco regulations only have limited potential to improve social

welfare.

       The question then becomes: What, if any, new anti-smoking policies are justified by

internalities? Nudge regulations can improve social welfare, but there might not be that many

more opportunities to nudge consumers towards smoking less. Prominent FDA tobacco

regulations are paternalistic: they are like taxes that impose costs on smokers but do not generate

any offsetting tax revenues. Another lesson from our analysis is that tobacco tax hikes might be a

better policy approach than paternalistic regulations.

       Chetty (2015) offers a pragmatic perspective on the implications of behavioral economics

for public policy. He argues that behavioral economics research makes three types of

contributions: it suggests new policy tools such as nudges; it provides better predictions about

the effects of existing policies; and it yields new implications for social welfare. The regulatory

impact analyses of the FDA and other federal agencies rely on the insight from behavioral

welfare economics that internalities mean that regulations might improve social welfare.

                                               Page 44 of 57
However, to a large extent tobacco regulations are not corrective nudge policies but instead

remove options and impose significant costs on smokers. A useful direction for future research

and policy is to explore insights from behavioral economics about new policy tools that might

simultaneously reduce smoking, improve health, and improve social welfare.
