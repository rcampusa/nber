An Economic Analysis of Platform Sharing

                                               ABSTRACT

We explore the managerial implications and economic consequences of platform sharing under models
of horizontal and vertical product differentiation. By using a common platform across different products,
firms can save on fixed costs for platform development. At the same time, platform sharing imposes
restrictions on firms' ability to differentiate their products, and this reduces their profitability. It might
appear that platform sharing across firms makes consumers worse off because firms cooperate in their
product development processes to maximize their joint profit. We find, however, that platform sharing
across firms benefits consumers in our framework because it intensifies competition in our horizontal
differentiation model, and because it increases the quality of the lower-end product in our vertical
differentiation model. We also show new channels through which a merger makes consumers worse
off in the presence of platform sharing.

1         Introduction
Product platforms, which are component and subsystem assets shared across a family of
products,1 have recently attracted increasing attention in the product development/design
literature (see e.g. Meyer and Lehnerd, 1997; Nobeoka and Cusumano, 1997; Robertson
and Ulrich, 1998). Robertson and Ulrich (1998) conceptually articulated the trade-off that
firms face when they share a common platform across multiple products. On the one hand,
by sharing components and production processes across products, firms can develop differ-
entiated products efficiently. That is, platform sharing reduces product development cost
and time because parts and assembly processes developed for one model do not have to be
developed and tested for the others. On the other hand, since components and produc-
tion processes are important factors in determining the nature of products, platform sharing
reduces the distinctiveness of products, which is valuable in the marketplace. Given this
important trade-off, Robertson and Ulrich proposed the platform-planning process through
which firms can achieve an optimal balance of commonality and distinctiveness.
        Platform sharing has become common in the automobile industry; an automobile plat-
form means the core framework of cars which includes the floorpan, drive train, and axles.
An automobile manufacturer often uses a common platform for different products with simi-
lar quality levels. For example, Mitsubishi shares a common platform between its Endeavour
and Galant, and Honda shares a common platform between its CR-V and Civic.2 A com-
mon platform can also be shared across manufacturers. Renault and Nissan have developed
a common platform for the Nissan Micra and the Renault Clio, and they plan to reduce the
number of platforms they use to 10 in 2010 from the 34 they had in 2000 (see e.g. Tierney et
al., 2000; Bremner et al., 2004). See also Szczesny (2003) for platform sharing between Ford
Motor and Mazda. These are examples of platform sharing across horizontally differentiated
products within a firm and across firms.
        An automobile manufacturer can also share a common platform across multiple products
with different quality levels. For example, Toyota uses a common platform for its Landcruiser
    1
        This definition of product platforms is from Krishnan and Gupta (2001). Several authors have offered
different definitions. For example, Robertson and Ulrich (1998) defined a product platform as the collection
of assets that are shared by a set of products.

     Mitsubishi’s Endeavour and Galant are in a similar price range, where the former is an SUV while the
latter is a sedan. Honda CR-V and Civic are also in a similar price range, where the former is an SUV while
the latter is a small sedan and hatch-back. See Rechtin and Kranz (2003) and Anonymous (2006).

and Lexus LX 470, and Honda uses a common platform for its CR-V and Acura RDX.3 As
an example of platform sharing across firms, Porshe and Volkswagen use a common platform
for Porshe’s Cayenne and Volkswagen’s Touareg,4 where the former is more luxurious than
the latter. These are examples of platform sharing across vertically differentiated products
within a firm and across firms.
      This paper explores the managerial implications and economic consequences of platform
sharing under product differentiation models. Motivated by examples in the automobile
industry as mentioned above, we consider platform sharing under horizontal product dif-
ferentiation and platform sharing under vertical product differentiation, and compare the
economic consequences of platform sharing under the two setups.
      In Section 2 we incorporate platform sharing into a standard model of horizontal prod-
uct differentiation, due to Dixit (1979) and Singh and Vives (1984), where we consider the
monopoly case and the duopoly case. In the monopoly case, one firm produces two differen-
tiated products 1 and 2, while in the duopoly case each firm i (= 1, 2) produces product i.
Demand side of the model is characterized by the representative consumer who prefers prod-
uct variety. Platform sharing reduces the degree of product differentiation, which in turn
reduces the representative consumer’s willingness to pay. Because of this effect, platform
sharing makes consumers worse off in the monopoly case. However, we find that platform
sharing makes consumers better off in the duopoly case because platform sharing intensifies
competition between the two firms by reducing the degree of differentiation in their prod-
ucts. Firms can still choose to share a common platform in order to save on their fixed
costs for developing platforms. We then explore welfare consequences of horizontal mergers
in our framework and demonstrate a new channel through which horizontal mergers could
hurt consumers.
      In Section 3 we explore the connection between platform sharing and vertical product
differentiation under a standard framework of product-line pricing (Mussa and Rosen, 1978),
where we focus on the two-type consumer case consisting of high-valuation consumers and
low-valuation consumers. On the production side, we again consider monopoly as well as
duopoly, and compare the two. In the case of monopoly, a single firm can produce a high-
quality product (H-product) and a low-quality product (L-product), while in the case of
  3
      Lexus LX 470 is more luxurious than Toyota Landcruiser, and Acura RDX is more luxurious than Honda
CR-V. See Anonymous (2006) and Rechtin and Kranz (2003).

      We have confirmed this by our written inquiry to Volkswagen.


                                                     2
duopoly one firm can produce a high-quality product and the other firm can produce a
low-quality product. Platform sharing between an H-product and an L-product imposes
restrictions on firm’s abilities to differentiate the quality of products, which in turn increases
the amount of surplus captured by consumers in the equilibrium. In other words, platform
sharing increases the consumer surplus because its benefit of fixed cost savings has to be
shared between producers and consumers. We find that a platform is more likely to be
shared in the duopoly case than in the monopoly case, and we demonstrate a new channel
through which the merger between H-firm and L-firm could make consumers worse off; that
is, the merger makes platform sharing less attractive for producers, and this can reduce the
consumer surplus because platform sharing benefits consumers.
       We will then conclude in Section 4 by discussing relationships between platform sharing
under horizontal product differentiation and that under vertical product differentiation.
       The present paper is related to the previous analyses on cooperative research and de-
velopment (R&D) and research joint ventures (RJVs), given that platform sharing can be
regarded as an example of cooperative R&D and RJVs (see Katz, 1986; d’Aspremont and
Jacquemin, 1988; Kamien et al., 1992; Suzumura, 1992; Motta, 1992; Choi, 1993, among
others). These previous papers, however, have not considered cases in which cooperative
R&D and RJVs affect product characteristics.
       A few previous papers have considered models that incorporate product platforms in
product differentiation models. Krishnan and Gupta (2001) incorporated product platforms
into a model of vertical product differentiation in which a firm chooses whether or not to
introduce a common platform across two separate products, and demonstrated that using a
common platform tends to result in the overdesign of low-end products (or the underdesign
of high-end products) in the firm’s product family. Ghosh and Morita (2006) considered a
differentiated duopoly model in which two firms can share a common platform to save on
their procurement costs from suppliers at the expense of the reduction in their horizontal
product differentiation. Ghosh and Morita (2006) also offered an informal discussion on a
monopoly analysis of platform sharing under vertical product differentiation.5
       The present paper’s contribution is to offer more comprehensive and systematic analyses
of platform sharing by conducting both monopoly and duopoly analysis of platform sharing
   5
       See also Lambertini, Poddar, and Sasaki (2002, 2003), who considered models of RJVs in which RJVs
between firms reduce the degree of their product differentiation, and explored the effects of forming an RJV
on the sustainability of implicit price collusion.

under horizontal product differentiation and that under vertical product differentiation. As
mentioned above, Krishnan and Gupta (2001) focused on a monopolist’s platform-sharing
decision under vertical product differentiation, while Ghosh and Morita (2006) focused on
platform sharing under horizontal product differentiation in the duopoly case with an infor-
mal discussion on a monopoly analysis of platform sharing under vertical product differenti-
ation. Through our comprehensive and systematic analyses of platform sharing, we explore
effects of mergers in the presence of platform sharing, and compare welfare consequences of
platform sharing under horizontal product differentiation and that under vertical product
differentiation.


2       Platform sharing under horizontal product differen-
        tiation
In this section we incorporate platform sharing into a standard model of horizontal product
differentiation, due to Dixit (1979) and Singh and Vives (1984). On the production side, we
consider and compare monopoly and duopoly. In the monopoly case, a single firm produces
two differentiated products, while in the duopoly case, each firm produces one product.


2.1     Monopoly
2.1.1    The Model

Consider a monopolist who produces two products, 1 and 2. Let pi and qi denote the
price and quantity of product i(= 1, 2). There is a continuum of consumers with identical
preferences, and the representative consumer’s utility function is given by U (q1 , q2 ) = a(q1 +
q2 ) − (q12 + 2bq1 q2 + q22 )/2, where a > 0 and b ∈ (0, 1). The parameter b captures the degree
of differentiation between the two products, where the degree of product differentiation
decreases as b increases. The representative consumer maximizes U (q1 , q2 ) − p1 q1 − p2 q2
which yields linear inverse demands

                             pi = a − qi − bqj , i, j ∈ {1, 2}; i 6= j.                      (1)

Inverting the inverse demand system yields the direct demands:
                                (1 − b)a − pi + bpj
                         qi =                       , i, j ∈ {1, 2}; i 6= j.                 (2)
                                      1 − b2

                                                  4
       The monopolist’s cost for producing qi units of product i(= 1, 2) is ci qi + Fi where ci and
Fi respectively denote the constant marginal cost and the fixed cost for production. Without
loss of generality we normalize c1 = c2 = 0.
       We incorporate the option of platform sharing in the following way: Assume that F1 =
F2 = F (> 0) if the monopolist uses different platforms for the two products, while F1 = F2 =
(1 − s)F if it uses a common platform for both products, where s ∈ (0, 1) captures the degree
of cost saving. That is, by sharing a platform, the monopolist saves 2[F − (1 − s)F ] = 2sF
of its total fixed costs. On the other hand, the monopolist loses some product differentiation
by sharing a platform. We capture this effect by assuming that b = b0 if the monopolist
does not share a platform, while b = b0 + x if it does share a platform, where b0 ∈ (0, 1)
and x ∈ (0, 1 − b0 ).6 That is, under platform sharing, the degree of product differentiation
decreases by x.
       We consider the two-stage game described below:
[Stage 1] The monopolist decides whether or not to use a common platform for the two
products, 1 and 2. If the monopolist does not share a platform, then F1 = F2 = F and
b = b0 , while F1 = F2 = (1 − s)F and b = b0 + x if it does share a platform.
[Stage 2] The monopolist chooses (p1 , p2 ) to maximize its profit.

2.1.2       Analysis of the monopoly case

The game described above has two Stage 2 subgames. One is the subgame in which the
monopolist shared a platform at Stage 1, while the other is the one in which it did not share
a platform. We call the former subgame a platform-sharing subgame, and the latter, a non-
                                                                        (1−b0 −x) a (1−b0 )2         2
platform-sharing subgame. Throughout the analysis we assume F < min{ a4(1+b0 +x)
                                                                                 , 8(1+b0 ) },
which ensures that the fixed cost for production is low enough for the monopolist to sell a
strictly positive amount of each product i (= 1, 2) in the equilibrium of each subgame.
       At stage 2, the monopolist chooses p1 and p2 to maximize its stage 2 profit, which
                       p1 ((1−b)a−p1 +bp2 )+p2 ((1−b)a−p2 +bp1 )
is p1 q1 + p2 q2 ≡                      1−b2
                                                                 .   Let pm          m
                                                                          i (b) and qi (b) denote product i’s
price and quantity, respectively, in the equilibrium of the stage 2 subgame characterized by
differentiation parameter b (recall that b = b0 + x in the platform-sharing subgame while
   6
       This set up for platform sharing under horizontal product differentiation was employed by our previous
model analyzed in Ghosh and Morita (2006). See also Lin and Saggi (2002) for a related modelling choice
in their analysis of the relationship between process and product R&D.

                                                                  a

                                                           2(1 + b)

where π m (b) denotes the monopolist’s stage 2 profit in the equilibrium.
   At stage 1, the monopolist anticipates that its overall profit will be πN P ≡ π m (b0 )−2F if it
does not share a platform, and πP S ≡ π m (b0 +x)−2(1−s)F if it does share a platform. Hence
the monopolist chooses to share a platform if and only if πP S ≥ πN P , which is equivalent to

                                    2sF ≥ π m (b0 ) − π m (b0 + x).                            (3)

We are now ready to present our first result.

Proposition 1: There exists a function xm (s) such that the monopolist shares a platform
in the equilibrium if and only if x ≤ xm (s), where xm (s) is strictly increasing in s and
xm (s) ∈ (0, 1 − b0 ) for all s ∈ (0, 1).

   Proposition 1 tells us that the monopolist chooses to share a platform when the loss of
product differentiation due to platform sharing, captured by x, is relatively small. Under
platform sharing, a lower degree of product differentiation between products 1 and 2 reduces
the representative consumer’s willingness to pay because he/she prefers product variety. The
lower willingness to pay, in turn, reduces the monopolist’s profitability. This disadvantage of
platform sharing is represented by the RHS of inequality (3), π m (b0 ) − π m (b0 + x). We have
that the monopolist’s stage 2 profit π m (b) is strictly decreasing in b, given that the degree
of product differentiation decreases as b increases in this model. Hence the disadvantage is
increasing in x, while the fixed cost saving due to platform sharing, captured by 2sF in the
LHS of inequality (3), is not affected by x. The result is that the monopolist chooses to
share a platform if x is relatively small, where the threshold xm (s) is strictly increasing in s.
That is, the monopolist is more likely to share a platform as the degree of fixed-cost savings
due to platform sharing (captured by s) increases.
   Next we analyze the welfare consequences of platform sharing.



                                                    6
Proposition 2: Let CSP S (CSN P ) denote the consumer surplus in the equilibrium of the
platform-sharing (non-platform-sharing) subgame, and define T SP S (T SN P ) analogously for
the total surplus. Then
(i) CSP S < CSN P holds for all x ∈ (0, 1 − b0 ).
(ii) There exists a function x̃(s) such that T SP S > T SN P holds if and only if x < x̃(s), where
x̃(s) ∈ (0, xm (s)) for all s ∈ (0, 1).

   As mentioned above, platform sharing reduces the representative consumer’s willingness
to pay, and this reduces the consumer surplus as well as the monopolist’s stage 2 profit. Hence
the consumer surplus is lower under the platform-sharing subgame for all x. This negative
impact to consumers is not taken into account when the monopolist, who can benefit from
platform sharing through fixed-cost savings, determines whether or not to share a platform.
If x < x̃(s), the benefit of platform sharing to the monopolist is greater than its negative
externality to consumers so that platform sharing increases the total surplus. While, if
x̃(s) < x < xm (s), the monopolist still shares a platform but its benefit to the monopolist is
dominated by its negative impact to consumers so that platform sharing reduces the total
surplus.


2.2     Duopoly
2.2.1      The Model

We consider the case of duopoly under the demand and the cost structures that are the same
as in the monopoly case. The only difference is that now there are two firms, firms 1 and 2,
where each firm i (= 1, 2) produces product i.
   We consider the two-stage game described below:
[Stage 1] Firms 1 and 2 jointly decide whether or not to use a common platform for their
products. If they do not share a platform, then F1 = F2 = F and b = b0 , while F1 = F2 =
(1 − s)F and b = b0 + x if they do share a platform.
[Stage 2] Each firm i chooses pi to maximize its own profit, taking pj as given.

2.2.2      Analysis of the duopoly case

As in the monopoly case, the stage 2 subgame in which the two firms shared (did not share) a
platform at stage 1 is called platform-sharing (non-platform-sharing) subgame. Throughout

fixed cost for production is low enough for each firm i to sell a strictly positive amount of
product i in the equilibrium of each subgame.
   Each stage 2 subgame has a unique and symmetric equilibrium. Let pdi (b), qid (b) and
πid (b) respectively denote firm i’s price, quantity, and profit of firm i in the equilibrium of
the stage 2 subgame characterized by differentiation parameter b (recall that b = b0 + x in
the platform-sharing subgame while b = b0 in the non-platform-sharing subgame). We find:

                                                (2 − b)(1 + b)

                                               (2 − b)2 (1 + b)



   At stage 1, each firm i anticipates that its overall profit will be πN P ≡ π d (b0 ) − F if the
two firms do not share a common platform, and πP S = π d (b0 + x) − (1 − s)F if they do share
a platform. Hence the two firms choose to share a platform if and only if πP S ≥ πN P , which
is equivalent to
                                     sF ≥ π d (b0 ) − π d (b0 + x).                           (4)

Proposition 3 below identifies the condition in which this inequality holds.

Proposition 3: There exists a function xd (s) such that firms 1 and 2 share a common
platform in the equilibrium if and only if x ≤ xd (s), where xd (s) is strictly increasing in s
and xd (s) ∈ (0, 1 − b0 ) for all s ∈ (0, 1).

   As in the monopoly case, platform sharing reduces the degree of product differentiation
between firms 1 and 2, which decreases their profitability by reducing the representative
consumer’s willingness to pay. Equally important is that in the duopoly case, the lower
degree of product differentiation intensifies the competition between the two firms, which
further reduces their profitability. The result is that firms 1 and 2 choose to share a common
platform if x, the loss of product differentiation due to platform sharing, is relatively small.
The threshold xd (s) is strictly increasing in s, the degree of fixed-cost savings due to platform
sharing.


                                                    8
    Next we analyze the welfare consequences of platform sharing.

Proposition 4: Let CSP S (CSN P ) denote the consumer surplus in the equilibrium of the
platform-sharing (non-platform-sharing) subgame, and define T SP S (T SN P ) analogously for
the total surplus. Then
(i) CSP S > CSN P holds for all x ∈ (0, 1 − b0 ).
(ii) There exists a function x̂(s) such that T SP S > T SN P holds if and only if x < x̂(s), where
x̂(s) ∈ (xd (s), 1 − b0 ) for all s ∈ (0, 1).

    In the monopoly case, we found in Proposition 2 that platform sharing reduces the
consumer surplus because it reduces product variety, which consumers prefer. In contrast,
Proposition 4 tells us that platform sharing increases the consumer surplus in the duopoly
case. This is because the lower degree of product differentiation intensifies the competition
between the two firms, and this positive effect on consumers dominates the negative effect
associated with lower product variety. Regarding the total surplus, platform sharing increases
the total surplus for all x ∈ (0, xd (s)] because platform sharing increases the two firms’ joint
profit whenever they choose to share a platform. In fact, the threshold x̂(s) is greater than
xd (s), because the higher consumer surplus dominates the lower profits of the firms when
xd (s) < x < x̂(s).



2.3     Comparison
Finally, we compare the monopoly case and the duopoly case, and discuss the welfare con-
sequences of a merger in our framework.

Proposition 5: A platform is more likely to be shared in the monopoly case than in the
duopoly case. More precisely, xd (s) < xm (s) holds.

    As mentioned earlier, platform sharing in this model reduces the representative con-
sumer’s willingness to pay in the monopoly case as well as in the duopoly case. Furthermore,
in the duopoly case, platform sharing intensifies the competition between the two firms. Be-
cause of the latter effect, the disadvantage of platform sharing for firms is greater in the
duopoly case than in the monopoly case, while the advantage of platform sharing (fixed-cost
saving) is the same across the two cases. Hence, platform is more likely to be shared in the
monopoly case as stated in the proposition.

                                                9
        Now suppose xd (s) < x < xm (s) holds so that a platform is shared only in the monopoly
case, and suppose that firms 1 and 2 merge to become a monopolist. In this parameter range,
the horizontal merger makes consumers worse off in two ways. On the one hand, the merger
eliminates competition between the two firms, which hurts consumers by raising prices. In
addition to this standard effect, the merger induces the merged firm to share a platform,
which makes consumers worse off by reducing product variety. By capturing the connection
between platform sharing and horizontal product differentiation, our analysis shows a new
channel through which mergers could hurt consumers.

          tion
In this section, we explore the connection between platform sharing and vertical product
differentiation under a standard framework of product-line pricing (Mussa and Rosen, 1978),
where we focus on the two-type consumer case.7 On the production side, we consider and
compare monopoly and duopoly. In the case of monopoly, a single firm can produce a high-
quality product and a low-quality product, while in the case of duopoly one firm can produce
a high-quality product and the other firm can produce a low-quality product.


3.1         Monopoly case
3.1.1        The Model

Consider a monopolist that faces two groups of consumers, and which can produce output
of two levels of quality: a high-quality product (H-product) and a low-quality product (L-
product). The quality of the product is in part determined by the quality of the platform.
In particular, assume that the quality of H-product is given by QH = H + x ≡ QH (x),
where H > 0 is a given constant and x ≥ 0 is a choice variable representing the quality
of the platform. Analogously, the quality of L-product is given by QL = L + x ≡ QL (x),
where H > L > 0. The monopolist can produce k-product (k = H, L) at constant marginal
cost ck + φ(x), where φ(.) is a convex cost function with standard properties, and cH and
cL are given constants satisfying cH > cL > 0. In addition, the monopolist incurs fixed

        See, for example, Waldman (1996) for an analysis focusing on the two-type case.


                                                       10
costs for developing platforms. If the monopolist develops just one type of platform with
quality level x, the fixed cost is η(x). Alternatively, if it develops two types of platforms
with quality levels xH for H-product and xL for L-product (xH 6= xL ), then the fixed cost
is η(xH ) + η(xL ), where η(.) is a convex cost function with standard properties. In order
                                                                                            x2                θx2

where θ > 0.
      Let the two groups of consumers be denoted groups 1 and 2, where group j consists of
a continuum of nonatomic consumers of mass mj , j = 1, 2. A representative individual in
group j consumes either zero units or one unit of the products, and derives a gross benefit
of vj Qk (x), k = H or L from the consumption of one unit of quality Qk (x) product, where
                  cL 8
v1 > v 2 >        L
                    .
      We consider the two-stage game described below.
[Stage 1] The monopolist determines whether it develops one type of platform with quality
x, or two types of platforms with quality levels xH for H-product and xL for L-product,
xH 6= xL .

[Stage 2] If the monopolist sells both H-product and L-product, then it chooses their prices,
denoted PH and PL respectively. If the monopolist sells k-product only, then it chooses its
price Pk . Consumers then make purchase decisions.

      In what follows, we say that the monopolist shares a platform between H-product and
L-product if it produces both H-product and L-product by using one type of platform
with quality x, while we say that the monopolist does not share a platform if it produces
both H-product and L-product by using two types of platforms with qualities xH and xL
respectively.

3.1.2        Analysis of the monopoly case

Suppose that the monopolist develops two types of platforms with qualities xH and xL , and
sells both H-product and L-product; that is, the monopolist does not share a platform.
Under this option, it can be easily shown that the monopolist sells H-product with quality
QH (xH ) to all type 1 consumers and L-product with quality QL (xL ) to all type 2 consumers,
where xH > xL > 0 holds. At stage 2, the monopolist charges the price PL ≡ v2 QL (xL ) to
type 2 consumers and the price PH ≡ v1 QH (xH ) − (v1 − v2 )QL (xL ) to type 1 consumers.
  8          cL
      v2 >   L    implies that the net value of L-product is positive even for lower-valuation consumers.


                                                          11
Note that the monopolist can capture the entire surplus from type 2 consumers, while, due
to imperfect substitutability between H-product and L-product, the monopolist has to leave
(v1 − v2 )QL (xL ) as a surplus for type 1 consumers. Hence the monopolist’s overall profit
under this option is given by πN P (xH , xL ) (“NP” stands for non-platform-sharing), where

            πN P (xH , xL ) ≡ m1 [v1 QH (xH ) − (v1 − v2 )QL (xL ) − cH − φ(xH )]
                              +m2 [v2 QL (xL ) − cL − φ(xL )] − η(xH ) − η(xL ).                      (5)

   Alternatively, suppose that the monopolist develops one type of platform with quality x.
Then, there are three relevant options for the monopolist. First, the monopolist can share a
platform between H-product and L-product, sell H-product with quality QH (x) at the price
of v1 QH (x) − (v1 − v2 )QL (x) to all type 1 consumers, and sell L-product with quality QL (x)
at the price of v2 QL (x) to all type 2 consumers. The monopolist’s overall profit under this
option is given by πP S (x) (“PS” stands for platform sharing), where

 πP S (x) ≡ m1 [v1 QH (x) − (v1 − v2 )QL (x) − cH − φ(x)] + m2 [v2 QL (x) − cL − φ(x)] − η(x). (6)

The second option for the monopolist is that it can sell just H-product to type 1 and type 2
consumers or to type 1 consumers only. Finally, the third relevant option for the monopolist
is to sell just L-product to type 1 and type 2 consumers or to type 1 consumers only.
   In what follows, we will proceed with our analysis under several parameter restrictions in
                                                                                         cH −cL
order to focus our analysis. First, we assume that v2 H − cH > v2 L − cL ⇔ v2 >           H−L
                                                                                                  holds.
Under this assumption, H-product is more profitable than L-product for the monopolist in
the sense that, if it chooses to sell one type of the product, it chooses to sell H-product.
Second, given that our focus is on the monopolist’s decision concerning whether or not to
share a platform between H-product and L-product, we consider a range of parameterizations
in which, even if the monopolist develops just one type of platform, it sells both H-product
                                                                         cH −cL       (m1 +m2 )v2 −m1 v1
and L-product. In particular, given Lemma 1 below, we assume (i)          H−L
                                                                                  >         m2
                                                                                                         ,
(ii)(m1 + m2 )v2 − m1 v1 > 0, and (iii) L > L̃. Condition (i) implies that the monopolist
is better off by selling type-2 consumers L-product rather than H-product, and condition
(ii) and (iii) together imply that the monopolist is better off by selling type-2 consumers
L-product rather than nothing.

Lemma 1: Suppose that the monopolist develops one type of platform only. For any
                                          cH −cL
given parameterization satisfying v2 >     H−L
                                                 ,   there exists a unique value L̃ ≥ 0 such that

                                                12
the monopolist sells both H-product and L-product in the equilibrium if and only if (i)
cH −cL       (m1 +m2 )v2 −m1 v1
 H−L
         >         m2
                                ,   (ii) (m1 + m2 )v2 − m1 v1 > 0, and (iii) L > L̃. There exists a range
of parameterizations in which (i)-(iii) are satisfied.

   We are now ready to present our results.

                                                                   m1

                                                                  m1 +m2 1
                                                                                < ṽ2 < v1 , such that:
(i) If v2 > ṽ2 , the monopolist chooses to share a platform, and sells H-product with quality
QH (x∗ ) to all type 1 consumers and L-product with quality QL (x∗ ) to all type 2 consumers,
where x∗ =        m1 +m2
                         v.
                 θ+m1 +m2 2
(ii) If v2 < ṽ2 , the monopolist chooses not to share a platform, and sells H-product with
quality QH (x∗H ) to all type 1 consumers and L-product with quality QL (x∗L ) to all type 2
                                                         (m1 +m2 )v2 −m1 v1
consumers, where x∗H =               m1
                                        v
                                    θ+m1 1
                                             and x∗L =        θ+m2
                                                                            .

   Suppose that the monopolist develops two types of platforms with qualities xH and xL
for H-product and L-product respectively. Given that the platform’s quality is an important
determinant of the product’s quality, the monopolist sets the level of xL lower than the level
of xH for two reasons. First, since L-product is sold to low-valuation (type 2) consumers and
H-product is sold to high-valuation (type 1) consumers, the marginal benefit of raising the
platform’s quality is lower for L-product. Second, due to imperfect substitutability between
H-product and L-product, the price that the monopolist can charge for H-product increases
as the quality of L-product decreases, and hence it can increase its revenue from H-product
by reducing xL . In other words, by reducing xL , the monopolist can reduce the amount of
surplus (v1 − v2 )QL (xL ) that has to be left with each type 1 consumer.
   Platform sharing reduces the monopolist’s profitability by preventing the monopolist
from differentiating the quality of the platform for H-product and L-product. As the value
of v2 increases, the difference between type 1 consumers and type 2 consumers becomes less
important, which in turn reduces the disadvantage of platform sharing for the monopolist.
Proposition 1 tells us that when the value of v2 exceeds the threshold ṽ2 , the disadvantage of
platform sharing is dominated by its advantage of fixed-cost savings so that the monopolist
chooses to share a platform.
   Next we turn to welfare consequences of platform sharing.

Proposition 7: Let CSP S (CSN P ) denote the consumer surplus in the equilibrium of the
platform-sharing (non-platform-sharing) subgame, and define T SP S (T SN P ) analogously for

                                                            13
the total surplus. Then
(i) CSP S > CSN P holds for all v2 ∈ ( m1m+m
                                           1
                                             2
                                               v1 , v1 ).
(ii) There exists a value ṽ20 ∈ [ m1m+m
                                       1
                                         2
                                           v1 , ṽ2 ) such that T SP S > T SN P holds if v2 > ṽ20 , while
T SP S < T SN P holds if v2 < ṽ20 .

       As mentioned earlier, in the equilibrium of both subgames the monopolist captures the
entire surplus from type 2 consumers, while it has to leave a surplus to be captured by type
1 consumers. If the monopolist does not share a platform, it can reduce the amount of the
surplus by reducing the platform’s quality for L-product. Under platform sharing, however,
the monopolist cannot differentiate the quality of platforms for H-product and L-product,
and consequently the surplus for type 1 consumers becomes higher. The result is that
the consumer surplus is higher in the platform-sharing subgame than in the non-platform-
sharing subgame. The monopolist saves on fixed costs by sharing a platform, but the benefit
of the fixed-cost saving is in part captured by type 1 consumers. Because of this positive
externality to consumers, the total surplus is higher in the platform-sharing subgame than
in the non-platform-sharing subgame whenever the monopolist chooses to share a platform.


3.2        Duopoly case
3.2.1       The Model

We consider the case of duopoly under the structures of supply and demand that are analo-
gous to those in the monopoly case analyzed in the previous subsection. Consider two firms,
firm H and firm L, that face two groups of consumers. The quality of each firm’s product
is in part determined by the quality of the platform. In particular, assume that the quality
of firm H’s product is given by QH = H + x ≡ QH (x) and the quality of firm L’s product
is given by QL = L + x ≡ QL (x). As in the monopoly case, x ≥ 0 is a choice variable
representing the quality of the platform, and H > L > 0.9 Firm k (= H, L) can produce
product of quality Qk (x) at constant marginal cost ck + φ(x) and fixed cost η(x), where
            x2                θx2
φ(x) ≡      2
                 and η(x) ≡    2
                                    (θ > 0) and cH > cL > 0. The structure of the demand side is the
same as in the monopoly case.
       We consider the two-stage game described below.
   9
       We also assume H − L > v1 in the duopoly case, which is a sufficient condition to rule out an equilibrium
in which firm H sells H-product to type 2 consumers while firm L sells L-product to type 1 consumers.



                                                        14
[Stage 1] The two firms jointly determine whether to jointly develop one type of platform
or to separately develop their own platforms.
• If they develop platforms separately, each firm k (= H, L) simultaneously and non-
                                                                                                   θx2k
cooperatively determines the quality of its platform xk by incurring a fixed cost                   2
                                                                                                        .
• If they jointly develop one type of platform, firm H and firm L jointly determine the
                                                                                         x2C
quality of the common platform xC by incurring the joint fixed cost of                    2

                                                                                                     x2C
time, they determine a sharing rule (yH , yL ) for the fixed cost, where yH + yL =                    2
                                                                                                            holds.
                                                                                         x2C 10
Under the sharing rule, firm k contributes yk towards the joint fixed cost                2
                                                                                            .

[Stage 2] Each firm k simultaneously and non-cooperatively announces the price Pk of its
product, and consumers then make purchase decisions.

       In what follows, we say that the two firms share a platform if they jointly develop one
type of platform, while we say that they do not share a platform if they develop platforms
separately.

3.2.2       Analysis of the duopoly case

In what follows we impose the same parameter restrictions as in our analysis of the monopoly
case, and focus on cases in which each firm k (= H, L) sells a positive amount of k-product
in the equilibrium of any stage 2 subgame. In particular, given Lemma 2 below, we assume
that L > L̂ holds.

Lemma 2: Suppose that firms H and L develop platforms separately at stage 1. There
exists a unique value L̂ ≥ 0 such that in the subsequent stage 2 equilibrium, each firm k sells
a positive amount of k-product if and only if L > L̂.

       Suppose that firms H and L jointly develop one type of platform with quality xC at stage
1. Under this option, we find that firms H and L maximize their joint profit by choosing
xC =      m1 +m2
                 v
         θ+m1 +m2 2
                      ≡ x̂∗C , which is the same as the monopolist’s choice of platform quality under
platform sharing. In the subsequent stage 2 equilibrium, firm H sells H-product with quality
QH (x̂∗C ) at the price of v1 QH (x̂∗C ) − (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗C ) to all type 1 consumers, and firm L
sells L-product with quality QL (x̂∗C ) at the price of v2 QL (x̂∗C ) to all type 2 consumers. Hence
  10
       We allow the possibility of either yH or yL being negative. In such a case, a side payment is made from
one firm to the other.



                                                       15
their joint profit is the same as the monopolist’s overall profit when it shares a platform,
πP S (x̂∗C ).
       Alternatively, suppose that firms H and L develop platforms separately at stage 1. Under
this option, firm H sells H-product with quality QH (xH ) at the price of v1 QH (xH ) − (v1 −
v2 )QL (xL ) to all type 1 consumers, and its overall profit is

                πH (xH , xL ) ≡ m1 [v1 QH (xH ) − (v1 − v2 )QL (xL ) − cH − φ(xH )] − η(xH ).              (7)

On the other hand, firm L sells L-product with quality QL (xL ) at the price of v2 QL (xL ) to
all type 2 consumers, and its overall profit is

                           πL (xH , xL ) ≡ m2 (v2 QL (xL ) − cL − φ(xL )) − η(xL ).                        (8)

We find that firm H’s optimal choice of platform quality is x̂∗H ≡                 m1
                                                                                      v,

optimal choice is x̂∗L ≡       m2

                 firm H sells H-product with quality QH (x̂∗C ) to type 1 consumers, and firm L
sells L-product with quality QL (x̂∗C ) to type 2 consumers.
(ii) If v2 < v̄2 , firms H and L separately develop platforms with quality x̂∗H ≡                  m1
                                                                                                      v
                                                                                                  θ+m1 1
                                                                                                           and
x̂∗L   ≡    m2
               v
           θ+m2 2
                    respectively. Then, firm H sells H-product with quality            QH (x̂∗H )   to type 1
consumers, and firm L sells L-product with quality QL (x̂∗L ) to type 2 consumers.

       In addition to the fixed cost savings, there is an additional advantage of platform sharing
in the duopoly case. That is, firms H and L can jointly choose the quality of the shared
platform at the level that maximizes their joint profit in the subsequent equilibrium. Because
of this, firms H and L can achieve a joint profit which is the same amount as the monopolist’s
profit when it shares a platform. At the same time, however, the quality of platform for H-
product and L-product cannot be differentiated, and this is the disadvantage for the two
firms sharing a platform. As in the monopoly case, the disadvantage of platform sharing
becomes smaller as the value of v2 increases. Proposition 8 tells us that when the value of v2
exceeds the threshold v̄2 , the disadvantage of platform sharing is dominated by its advantage
so that the two firms choose to share a platform.

                                                     16
   We now turn to the welfare consequences of platform sharing.

Proposition 9: Let CSP S (CSN P ) denote the consumer surplus in the equilibrium of the
platform-sharing (non-platform-sharing) subgame, and define T SP S (T SN P ) analogously for
the total surplus. Then
(i) CSP S > CSN P holds for all v2 ∈ ( m1m+m
                                           1
                                             2
                                               v1 , v1 ).
(ii) There exists a value v̄20 ∈ [ m1m+m
                                       1
                                         2
                                           v1 , v̄2 ) such that T SP S > T SN P holds if v2 > v̄20 while
T SP S < T SN P holds if v2 < v̄20 .

   Platform sharing by firm H and firm L could be perceived as an anticompetitive action
because the two firms jointly choose the quality of a shared platform to maximize their joint
profit. However, Proposition 9 tells us that platform sharing increases both the consumer
surplus and the total surplus whenever the two firms choose to share a platform. The logic
here is as follows: Whether or not the two firms share a platform, firm L captures the entire
surplus from type 2 consumers by selling them L-product at the price of v2 QL . On the
other hand, due to imperfect substitutability between H-product and L-product, firm H
has to leave (v1 − v2 )QL as a surplus for type 1 consumers. Given that the quality of the
platform cannot be differentiated for H-product and L-product when the two firms share
a platform, platform sharing increases the quality of L-product in the equilibrium, which
in turn increases the consumer surplus by leaving more surplus to be captured by type 1
consumers. The result is that the consumer surplus is higher in the platform-sharing subgame
than in the non-platform-sharing subgame. As in the monopoly case, the fixed cost savings
from sharing a platform are shared between the firms and the consumers. Consequently, the
total surplus is higher in the platform-sharing subgame than in the non-platform-sharing
subgame whenever the two firms choose to share a platform.


3.3     Comparison
In this subsection we compare the monopoly case and the duopoly case, and explore the
welfare consequences of mergers in our framework.

Proposition 10: Platforms are more likely to be shared in the duopoly case than in the
monopoly case. More precisely, v̄2 < ṽ2 holds.

   The logic here is as follows: Recall that because of imperfect substitutability between

                                                  17
H-product and L-product, the maximum price that can be charged for H-product declines
as the quality of L-product increases. Under non-platform sharing in the monopoly case, the
monopolist takes this effect into account when it chooses xL (the quality of the platform for
L-product). On the other hand, under non-platform sharing in the duopoly case, firm L does
not take this effect into account when it chooses xL . The result is that under non-platform
sharing, the two firms’ joint profit in the duopoly case is lower than the monopolist’s profit
in the monopoly case, which in turn implies that the producers’ benefit of platform sharing
is higher in the duopoly case. This results in v̄2 < ṽ2 .
   Finally, in Proposition 11 we consider welfare consequences of the merger between firm
H and L.

Proposition 11:
(i) If v2 < ṽ2 , then the merger between firm H and firm L increases the producer surplus
while it reduces the consumer surplus and the total surplus.
(ii) If v2 > ṽ2 , then the merger between firm H and firm L does not affect the producer
surplus, the consumer surplus, or the total surplus.

   If v2 < v̄2 (< ṽ2 by Proposition 10), a platform is not shared in the monopoly case or
the duopoly case. The monopolist maximizes its profit by lowering the platform’s quality
for L-product at an optimally low level, while the quality of the platform for L-product is
chosen to be higher in the duopoly case. The higher platform quality of L-product results
in a higher consumer surplus and total surplus and a lower producer surplus in the duopoly
case. Suppose v2 takes a higher value so that v̄2 < v2 < ṽ2 holds. Then a platform is shared
in the duopoly case and not shared in the monopoly case. Platform sharing further increases
the platform quality of L-product, which results in a higher consumer surplus and total
surplus in the duopoly case. Finally, if v2 > ṽ2 , a platform is shared in both cases. In the
duopoly case, firm H and firm L jointly choose the quality of the platform that maximizes
their joint profit in the subsequent equilibrium, and so the equilibrium outcomes are the
same across the monopoly case and the duopoly case.
   In our framework, the merger can reduce the consumer surplus through two channels
when v2 < ṽ2 (so that the monopolist does not share a platform). The merged firm maxi-
mizes its profitability by setting the platform quality of L-product lower, which reduces the
surplus captured by type 1 consumers. Furthermore, the merger makes platform sharing less
attractive for producers, and this can further reduce the consumer surplus because platform

                                                18
sharing benefits type 1 consumers by increasing the surplus they can capture.


4     Conclusion
We have explored the managerial implications and economic consequences of platform shar-
ing by analyzing two models; one model incorporates platform sharing into a horizontal
product differentiation model, and the other incorporates it into a vertical product differ-
entiation model. In this section we conclude the paper by discussing relationships between
platform sharing under horizontal product differentiation and that under vertical product
differentiation.
    In both models, the advantage of platform sharing is, simply, fixed-cost savings. That
is, firms can save on fixed costs for platform development by using a common platform
across two different products. In the horizontal product differentiation model, platform
sharing reduces firms’ profitability by decreasing the representative consumer’s willingness
to pay. Also, in the duopoly case, platform sharing further reduces firms’ profitability by
intensifying competition between firms. In the vertical product differentiation model, the
quality of platform for the high-quality product and that for the low-quality product cannot
be differentiated under platform sharing, and this is the disadvantage of platform sharing
for producers. The disadvantage is relatively small when the loss of product differentiation
due to platform sharing is small (in the former model) or when the difference between
high-valuation consumers and low-valuation consumers is small (in the latter model), and a
common platform is shared in the equilibrium when the disadvantage is small enough.
    It might appear that platform sharing across firms makes consumers worse off because
firms cooperate in their product development process by sharing a common platform to
maximize their joint profit. We have found, however, that in our duopoly cases, platform
sharing increases consumer surplus in both models. In the horizontal product differentiation
model, platform sharing reduces product variety which consumers prefer. At the same time,
platform sharing also intensifies competition between the two firms, and we have found that
this positive effect on consumers dominates the negative effect of reduced product variety
so that platform sharing increases consumer surplus. In the vertical product differentiation
model, the equilibrium quality of the low-quality product is higher under platform sharing,
and this in turn increases the amount of surplus that high-valuation consumers can capture.
    In the monopoly case, platform sharing under vertical product differentiation makes

                                            19
consumers better off through the same logic as in the duopoly case mentioned above. On the
other hand, platform sharing under horizontal product differentiation makes consumers worse
off, because platform sharing cannot benefit consumers by intensifying competition in the
monopoly case. In other words, welfare consequences of platform sharing under horizontal
product differentiation critically depends on the competitiveness of the product market. This
finding suggests that antitrust authorities should carefully investigate the competitiveness of
product market in order to determine welfare consequences of platform sharing if it is under
horizontal product differentiation.
   By incorporating platform sharing into product differentiation models, our analyses have
shown new channels through which mergers negatively affect consumers. In the horizontal
differentiation model, a merger can induce the merged firm to share a platform, which further
decreases the consumer surplus by reducing product variety. In the vertical differentiation
model, a platform is less likely to be shared when the two firms merge to become one firm.
This negatively affects consumers because more surplus can be captured by consumers under
platform sharing in this model.
   In this paper we have analyzed platform sharing under horizontal product differentiation
and that under vertical product differentiation separately in two different models. In reality,
a common platform is often shared across products that are differentiated both horizontally
and vertically. In our future work, we plan to analyze platform sharing in such a setup.

Proof of Proposition 5: Recall that platform is shared in the monopoly case if 2sF ≥
π m (b0 ) − π m (b0 + x) while it is shared in duopoly if sF ≥ π d (b0 ) − π d (b0 + x). Proofs
of Propositions 1 and 3 then imply that, to prove Proposition 5, it suffices to show that
π m (b0 ) − π m (b0 + xd (s)) < 2π d (b0 ) − 2π d (b0 + xd (s)) = 2sF . Define L(b) ≡ π m (b) − 2π d (b),
                                   b2
and we find L0 (b) =          2(1+b)(2−b)2
                                              > 0. This implies L(b0 + x) > L(b0 ) ⇔ π m (b0 ) − π m (b0 + x) <
2π d (b0 ) − 2π d (b0 + x) holds for all x ∈ (0, 1 − b0 ). This implies the result. Q.E.D.

Proof of Lemma 1: Suppose that the monopolist develops just one type of platform with
quality x. We first establish the following claim.
Claim 1: There does not exist an equilibrium in which the monopolist sells H-product to
type 2 consumers and L-product to type 1 consumers.
Proof: Suppose such an equilibrium exists, and let PH (PL ) denote the price of H-product
(L-product) in the equilibrium. Then PH ≤ v2 QH and v1 QL − PL ≥ v1 QH − PH must hold,
where QH ≡ QH (x) and QL ≡ QL (x). We then have that v2 QL −PL ≥ v2 QL −v1 QL +v1 QH −
PH > v2 QH − PH , where the second inequality is implied by (v1 − v2 )(QH − QL ) > 0. But
v2 QL −PL > v2 QH −PH implies that type 2 consumers purchase L-product. A contradiction.
Q.E.D.

   Claim 1 implies that, if the monopolist sells both H-product and L-product, it sells H-
product to all type 1 consumers and L-product to all type 2 consumers, and the monopolist’s
overall profit under this option is πP S (x) as defined in the text. Substituting and rearranging
yield
                                                θ + m1 + m2 2
                            πP S (x) = (m1 + m2 )v2 x −       x + Z1 ,                   (9)
                                                      2
where Z1 ≡ m1 v1 H + [(m1 + m2 )v2 − m1 v1 ]L − m1 cH − m2 cL . Hence, under this option the
monopolist chooses x =         m1 +m2

                                           ≡ x∗ , and its maximized profit is

   Given v2 >     H−L
                        ,   the relevant alternative option for the monopolist is to sell H-product
only. The monopolist can sell H-product to type 1 consumers at the price of v1 QH (x), and
its overall profit in this case is
                                                          θ + m1 2

where Z2 ≡ m1 v1 H − m1 cH . The monopolist chooses x =             m1

maximized profit is
                                         (m1 v1 )2

Alternatively, the monopolist can sell H-product to both type 1 and type 2 consumers at
the price of v2 QH (x), and we find that its maximized overall profit in this case is

    We have that πP S (x∗ ) > πH12

     ∗
and πH1 yields that (m1 + m2 )v2 − m1 v1 > 0 must hold for πP S (x∗ ) > πH1

Proof of Proposition 6: Suppose that the monopolist sells H-product with platform
quality xH and L-product with platform quality xL in the equilibrium, where xH 6= xL .
Through the procedure analogous to the proof of Claim 1, we find that the monopolist sells
H-product to all type 1 consumers and L-product to all type 2 consumers in the equilibrium,
and the monopolist’s overall profit under this option is πN P (xH , xL ) as defined in the text.

Proof of Proposition 7: First note that each type 2 consumer’s surplus is zero in the
equilibrium of both subgames. Each type 1 consumer’s surplus is (v1 − v2 )QL (x∗ ) ((v1 −
v2 )QL (x∗L )) in the equilibrium of platform sharing (non-platform sharing) subgame, where

                                                     v2      implies (v1 − v2 )QL (x∗ ) > (v1 − v2 )QL (x∗L ). This
implies (i). Regarding the total surplus, given T SP S = πP S (x∗ ) + m1 (v1 − v2 )QL (x∗ ) ≡
T SP S (x∗ ) and T SN P = πN P (x∗H , x∗L ) + m1 (v1 − v2 )QL (x∗L ) ≡ T SN P (x∗H , x∗L ), we find that

Proposition 6 and 7(i) then imply 7(ii). Q.E.D.

Proof of Lemma 2: Suppose that firms H and L develop platforms separately at stage 1,
and each firm k (= H, L) sells a positive amount of k-product in the subsequent equilibrium.
Through a procedure analogous to the proof of Claim 1, we find that there does not exist
a subsequent equilibrium in which firm H sells H-product to type 2 consumers and firm
L sells L-product to type 1 consumers. Then, firm k’s overall profit in the equilibrium is
πk (xH , xL ), which is as defined in the text. Substituting and rearranging yield
                                                             θ + m1 2

where Z4 ≡ m1 [v1 (H − L) + v2 L − cH ], and
                                                                         θ + m2 2
                                   πL (xH , xL ) = m2 v2 xL −                  x L + Z5 ,                            (17)

where Z5 ≡ m2 (v2 L − cL ). We then find that the optimal choices of platform quality of firms

   Now suppose that, given xL = x∗L , firm H chooses xH and sells H-product to all type 1
and type 2 consumers at stage 2. Then v2 (H + xH ) − PH = v2 (L + x∗L ) − PL holds, where
                                                                                               (x∗L )2
Pk denotes the price firm k chooses. In the equilibrium PL = cL +                                 2
                                                                                                         holds, and hence
                                                     (x∗L )2
PH = v2 (H + xH ) − v2 (L + x∗L ) + cL +                2
                                                             .   Firm H’s overall profit under this option is then

where Z6 ≡ (m1 + m2 )[v2 (H − L) − (cH − cL )]. We then find that firm H chooses xH =

Now suppose that, given xH = x∗H , firm L chooses xL and sells L-product to all type 1 and
type 2 consumers at Stage 2. Through the analogous procedure we find that firm L chooses
xL =    m1 +m2

                    ≡ x∗∗

    We then find that in the subsequent stage 2 equilibrium, each firm k (= H, L) sells a
positive amount of k-product if and only if πH (x∗H , x∗L ) > π̃H (x∗∗   ∗            ∗    ∗

π̃L (x∗H , x∗∗
            L ) hold, where the latter inequality holds for all L. Finally, comparison of (18) and
(21) yields that there exists a unique value L̂ ≥ 0 such that πH (x∗H , x∗L ) > π̃H (x∗∗   ∗

if and only if L ≥ L̂. Q.E.D.

Proof of Proposition 8: Suppose that firms H and L jointly develop one type of plat-
form with quality xC . The analysis of the monopoly case implies that their joint profit is
maximized when they choose xC =            m1 +m2

                                                       ≡ x̂∗C , and then firm H sells H-product with
quality QH (x̂∗C ) to all type 1 consumers while firm L sells L-product with quality QL (x̂∗C ) to
all type 2 consumers. We establish the following claim.

Claim 4: Suppose that firms H and L jointly developed one type of platform with quality
x̂∗C at stage 1. Then, in the subsequent equilibrium, firm H sells H-product with quality
QH (x̂∗C ) to all type 1 consumers while firm L sells L-product with quality QL (x̂∗C ) to all type
2 consumers.
Proof: In the equilibrium described above, firm H’s stage 2 profit is
                                                          (x̂∗C )2                                       (x̂∗ )2
πH (x̂∗C ) ≡ m1 [v1 QH (x̂∗C )−(v1 −v2 )QL (x̂∗C )−cH −            ] = m1 [v1 H−(v1 −v2 )L−cH +v2 x̂∗C − C ].
                                                             2                                              2

Now suppose that firm H sells H-product with quality QH (x̂∗C ) to all consumers at the price
of PH in the subsequent equilibrium. Then v2 QH (x̂∗C ) − PH ≥ v2 QL (x̂∗C ) − PL ⇔ PH ≤
                                                     (x̂∗C )2                                  (x̂∗C )2
v2 (H − L) + PL must hold, where PL = cL +               2
                                                              .   Let PH = v2 (H − L) + cL +       2
                                                                                                        .   Then
firm H’s stage 2 profit is
                                             (x̂∗C )2
     π̃H (x̂∗C ) ≡ (m1 + m2 )(PH − cH −               ) = (m1 + m2 )[v2 (H − L) − (cH − cL )].              (24)

Note that we have (m1 + m2 )v2 x̂∗C − (θ + m1 + m2 )                             2
                                                                                        > 0 ⇒ v2 x̂∗C −           2
                                                                                                                         > 0, and
v2 L − cL > 0. We then have that πH (x̂∗C ) > m1 (v1 H − v1 L + v2 L − cL − cH + cL ) >
m1 [v1 (H − L) − (cH − cL )] > (m1 + m2 )[v2 (H − L) − (cH − cL )] = π̃H (x̂∗C ), where the last
                               cH −cL       (m1 +m2 )v2 −m1 v1
inequality is implied by        H−L

                                                               .        Hence, there does not exist an equilibrium
in which firm H sells H-product with quality QH (x̂∗C ) to all consumers. Similarly, we find
that there does not exit an equilibrium in which firm L sells L-product with quality QL (x̂∗C )
to all consumers. Finally, through a procedure analogous to the proof of Claim 1, we find
that there does not exist an equilibrium in which firm H sells H-product to type 2 consumers
and firm L sells L-product to type 1 consumers. Q.E.D.

    Claim 4 implies that, if firms H and L jointly develop one type of platform, they choose
xC = x̂∗C to maximize their joint profit, where the maximized joint profit is
                                                       [(m1 + m2 )v2 ]2

where Z1 ≡ m1 v1 H + [(m1 + m2 )v2 − m1 v1 ]L − m1 cH − m2 cL .
    From Lemma 2 and its proof we have that, if firms H and L develop platforms separately,
their joint profit in the subsequent equilibrium is

                       πH (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) + πL (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) = gN P (θ, m1 , m2 , v1 , v2 ) + Z1 ,                           (26)

Proof of Proposition 9: First note that each type 2 consumer’s surplus is zero in the

                                                               26
v2 )QL (x̂∗L )) in the equilibrium of platform sharing (non-platform sharing) subgame, where
x̂∗C =     m1 +m2

          θ+m1 +m2 2
                            > x̂∗L =      m2
                                             v
                                         θ+m2 2
                                                    implies (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗C ) > (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗L ). Regarding
the total surplus, given T SP S = πP S (x̂∗C ) + m1 (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗C ) ≡ T SP S (x̂∗C ) and T SN P =
πH (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) + πL (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) + m1 (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗L ) ≡ T SN P (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ), we find that    ∂

                                                              > 0 for all v2 ∈ ( m1m+m
                                                                                     1

                                                                                         v1 , v1 ). Proposition 8 and
9(i) then imply 9(ii). Q.E.D.

Proof of Proposition 10: We have that πN P (x∗H , x∗L ) − [πH (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) + πL (x̂∗H , x̂∗L )] =
[m1 (v1 −v2 )2 ]
  2(θ+m2 )
                   > 0. Given the definitions of v̄2 and ṽ2 , this implies v̄2 < ṽ2 . Q.E.D.

Proof of Proposition 11: Suppose v2 > ṽ2 . Then Proposition 10 implies that a platform
is shared in the equilibrium of the monopoly case as well as the duopoly case. Propositions
6 and 8 then imply (i).
     Next suppose v2 < v̄2 . Then a platform is not shared in the equilibrium of the monopoly
case as well as the duopoly case. In the equilibrium of the monopoly case, (a) each type
1 consumer’s surplus is (v1 − v2 )QL (x∗L ), (b) the monopolist’s profit is πN P (x∗H , x∗L ), and
(c) the total surplus is T SN P (x∗H , x∗L ). In the equilibrium of the duopoly case, (a) each
type 1 consumer’s surplus is (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗L ), (b) the joint profit of firms H and L is
πH (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) + πL (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ), and (c) the total surplus is T SN P (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ). We have that (v1 −
v2 )QL (x∗L ) < (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗L ) and πN P (x∗H , x∗L ) > πH (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) + πL (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ). Also, given that
(xH , xL ) = (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) maximizes the value of T SN P (xH , xL ), we have that T SN P (x∗H , x∗L ) <
T SN P (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ).
     Finally, suppose v̄2 < v2 < ṽ2 . Then a platform is shared in the equilibrium of the duopoly
case but not shared in the equilibrium of the monopoly case. In the equilibrium of the
monopoly case, (a) each type 1 consumer’s surplus is (v1 − v2 )QL (x∗L ), (b) the monopolist’s
profit is πN P (x∗H , x∗L ), and (c) the total surplus is T SN P (x∗H , x∗L ). In the equilibrium of
the duopoly case, (a) each type 1 consumer’s surplus is (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗C ), (b) the joint
profit of firms H and L is πP S (x̂∗C ), and (c) the total surplus is T SP S (x̂∗C ). We have that
(v1 − v2 )QL (x∗L ) < (v1 − v2 )QL (x̂∗C ), and πN P (x∗H , x∗L ) > πP S (x̂∗C ). Also, given Proposition
9 we have that T SP S (x̂∗C ) > T SN P (x̂∗H , x̂∗L ) > T SN P (x∗H , x∗L ). This completes the proof.
