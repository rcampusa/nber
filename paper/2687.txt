               U.S. TAX LAWS AND CAPITAL FLIGHT FROM LATIN AMERICA

    The               between   the   tax    laws   of   the   United   States   and those   of the
          interplay
countries of Latin America creates inducements for capital flight. Most Latin
American countries tax only income originating within their boundaries. If
other countries tax income of foreigners originating within their boundaries as
                                                                      countries
heavily, there is no tax advantage to capital flight. Latin American
thus depend on other countries for the prevention of tax—induced capital flight
and the loss of public revenues, investment funds, and equity it implies.
     Income from a U.S. trade or business conducted by foreigners, including
                                                         real estate and div-
capital gains, is subject to U.S. tax. Capital gains on
idends are generally taxed, but it may be possible to reduce those taxes sub-

stantially.  The United States does not tax most other capital gains realized
                                                                       from
by foreigners. Most interest income paid to foreigners is also exempt
U.S. tax.  Thus U.S. tax laws help attract capital from Latin America.

     A solution to this problem does not seem likely. The United States seems
                                                          from adoption of a
unlikely to reverse its policies. Little is to be gained
residence-based approach by Latin American countries. A more radical approach
                                                                           tax-

ation in which interest income is neither taxed nor allowed as
would reduce the attraction of favorable U.S. tax treatment by making equally

attractive treatment available at home, but raises troublesome issues of equity,
the treatment of foreign investment, and transition.

I.   Introduction

      Most countries of Latin America attempt to tax          only   income deemed to

have its source within their boundaries; they do not attempt to tax

income of their residents (or citizens) deemed to originate in the rest

of the world.    That is, they employ a territorial (or source—based)

system   of taxation, and    do not attempt to implement worldwide (or

residence—based) taxation.1 To the extent that residents of nations
relying on source—based taxation invest their capital in other countries,
they can avoid taxation in their home country. Even when Latin American
nations attempt     to implement worldwide taxation, success in this endeavor

is likely to be difficult for administrative reasons. Taxpayers in most

Latin American countries that employ the residence principle who are

willing to coimnit fraud are generally able to evade tax on foreign—source

income with relative impunity.

      The direct result of the failure or inability of such countries to

tax foreign—source income is loss of tax revenues potentially available

on such income.      A   more serious threat is the loss of capital that       could

productively be invested at home       and   the further diminution of the tax
base and the    loss of equity it implies. Of course, to the extent           that

other    countries tax all income deemed to originate within their
boundaries    at rates at or above those levied in Latin American countries,

there is no tax advantage to capital flight, regardless of the tax

                                             1
 treatment (residence or source) in the hone country.2           In   a sense then,

 the countries of Latin America that do not tax (or cannot effectively

 tax) income earned abroad are dependent to some degree on other countries

 for the prevention of tax—induced capital flight and the loss of
                                                                  public
 revenues, investment funds, and equity it implies.3

        Income from a U.S. trade or business conducted by foreigners is

 subject to tax in the U.S. on the same basis as a business conducted by

 residents of the U.S.    But this is probably much less relevant for the

 present discussion of capital flight induced by favorable U.S. taxation
 than the tax treatment of income earned on passive investments.

        The United States does not tax most capital gains realized by

foreigners, except those on real estate and those effectively connected

with a trade   or business. Most interest income paid to unrelated
foreigners   is exempt from   U.S.   tax,   whether   paid by financial
institutions or by others.      Dividends on corporate shares and         capital
gains    real estate are generally subject to tax, but in the case of
        on
dividends it nay be possible to reduce taxes substantially through the
use of nominee accounts in treaty partners of the U.S. Thus the United
States acts as an enormous magnet poised to attract capital from Latin
America, especially debt funds.
     This paper examines the inducements to capital flight produced by

the interplay between the tax laws of the United States and those of the
countries of Latin America. Complicating this interaction is the
possibility of channeling investments through tax haven countries with

which the United States has tax treaties. Fortunately for the countries
of Latin America, there are relatively few such countries. While the
United States has moved in recent years to reduce the opportunities to
                                            2
use "treaty shopping" to reduce taxes, it has followed domestic tax

policies that aggravate the problem of capital flight from Latin America.

       Section II describes the general principles that govern the taxation

of income from capital moving across national boundaries, including

relevant provisions of major model treaties for the prevention of double

taxation.      This description is provided to set the stage for the

discussion of the rest of the paper.               It includes a limited discussion of

the   background and     apparent   rationale for the existing tax        treatment   of
such    income in order to serve as background for the discussion in the

final section of potential remedies to the problem of capital flight from

Latin America induced by generous treatment of certain forms of income

earned in the United States by foreigners.

        Section III focuses briefly on the tax systems             of Latin   American

countries.      The purpose is to indicate how problems            of capital flight and
tax    avoidance and evasion    created by the U.S.        tax law are aggravated by

the    tax        of capital income typically found in these countries.
             treatment

Besides noting that most countries of Latin America do not attempt to tax
foreign—source income, it indicates why it is difficult for the few that

attempt to impose tax       on a worldwide basis to        do so   effectively.
     This description       of tax systems employed in Latin ?imerica is quite

brief for several reasons. Most obviously, it is difficult to go beyond

the basic characterization of a system as being based on either source or

residence, without becoming embroiled in minute details.                 More important,

little would be gained from a detailed examination of the tax laws of

Latin American countries.           A   basic premise of this paper is that every

tax system in Latin America is in effect likely to resemble a

source—based system, especially in its taxation of passive income, even

                                               3
if the tax   law     states that worldwide        income   is to be   taxed.
       Section   IV describes how     the   United States taxes five kinds of

income received by foreigners:             income from the conduct of a trade or

business, interest on bank deposits, interest earned on portfolio

investments in debt, income (including capital gains) from other

portfolio investment, and capital gains from investment in real estate.

Attention focuses on the last four items of non—business income, as they

appear to be the forms in which income is most likely to be earned by

Latin Americans wishing to invest in the United States without leaving

their home countries.

       Section   V   discusses potential solutions to the problem of capital

flight induced by attractive U.S. tax treatment of income earned by

foreigners. Approaches considered include both changes in the tax system

of the United States and changes in the tax systems of Latin American
countries Many of the current provisions of U.S law can be traced to

the perceived need to respond to eonetitive pressures from foreign
countries arid to abuses of international tax treaties with the United

States; as a result, resolution of the problem based on changes in U.S.

law   might require cooperation by other developed countries, including

treaty partn5rs of the United States, and various tax haven countries.
That this is true indicates clearly that there is not nuich room for
optimism thtt a solution to the problem addressed here based on U.S.
action will quickly be       found   and   adopted.

                        said above, it is clear that most Latin American
       From what has been

countri'.' wnid gain little benefit from adoption of a residence—based
approach. A more effective approach, but one that is ITruch more radical,
            tch to a consumption—based system of direct taxation in
                                              4
which interest income is neither taxed nor allowed as a deduction.    This

would reduce the attraction of favorable U.S. tax   treatment by making
equally attractive treatment available at home.    It does, however, raise

troublesome issues of equity, the treatment of foreign investment, and

transition.

        It may be appropriate to state clearly, before proceeding, that the
discussion that follows is not based on a naive view that taxes are the

onlydeterminant of international capital flows, or even the most
important determinant. Clearly much more important than taxes as reasons
for capital flight from developing countries are such concerns as
political instability and fears of economic crises and currency

fluctuations. Similarly, any tax advantages of investment in the United

States   are likely to be dwarfed, inter alia, by the attraction of

political stability.    Yet, all things    , the    tax treatment of various

items of U.S. source income in the United States and elsewhere almost

certainly does exert an influence on investment decisions at the margin.

The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the most important    of
the    features of U.S. tax law that may have this effect, especially those

that result from liberal U.S. tax treatment of income earned in the

United States by foreigners.

        No attempt is made to quantify either the attraction offered by

these tax benefits, relative to other forms of attraction (e.g.,

differences in political stability) or the amount of capital that may be

drawn into the United States by them. Attempting to answer either of

these questions would be a hopeless task; the difficulty in the second

case of holding all other influences constant is compounded by the lack

of reliable data.

                                       S
      Finally, attention focuses on U.S. tax policy as an attraction to

capital; no effort is made to provide either a detailed description of

the tax laws of Latin merican countries or a comparison of U.S. law with

tax provisions found in the laws of other countries, especially those of

.7apan arid the developed countries of Europe.        Of course, to the extent

that foreign investors are treated generously in other countries,

comparably generous U.S. treatment may, at least in part, merely divert

investment from them, rather than inducing additional capital flows from

Latin America.       If generous taxation of the income of foreigners

continues elsewhere, the tax—induced attraction of funds from Latin

American countries way not be reduced much by a unilateral tightening of

U.S. taxation of such income.



II.   Principles of International Taxation
      There are two basic approaches to the taxation of income flowing

between countries, Under the source principle all income originating in

a given lurisdiction is taxed, but that originating elsewhere is not.

This is sometimes also called     a   territorial approach.   The residence or

worldwide approach, by comparison, taxes all the income of residents of

the taxing jurisdiction, wherever earned.3 Many countries, including the

United   States, employ both   approaches.   That is,they tax both income
originating within their     borders and all the income of residents,
wherever   earned.

      Advocates   of the                       the following primary
                           residence principle cite

advantages. First, residence—based taxation does not discriminate
between income flows, depending on their country of source; that is,
income is taxed the same, whether earned in the United States or in a
                                         6
foreign country (and    regardless which foreign country). This feature of

residence—based taxation is sometimes called "capital—export neutrality."

If employed effectively by all nations, residence—based taxation would

not interfere with the allocation of economic resources among nations; in

principle, it would lead to the allocation of the world's capital to the

most productive uses.    By comparison, source—based taxation (if not

matched by benefits of public spending)     discourages investment in

high—tax jurisdictions and encourages investment in law—tax

jurisdictions.4

     Second,   implementation of   the ability—to—pay principle   of taxation

requires that residents of a country pay tax on their entire income under

the personalized system prevailing there, rather than having it taxed at

the rates applied in the countries where it is earned.     This objective is

also achieved by residence—based taxation.      Finally, capital—exporting

countries support residence—based taxation because they want the revenue

at stake.5

     Advocates   of source—based taxation argue, in part, that the source
country is   entitled to capture for its public coffers part of the income
originating within its borders.6       Moreover, they argue, residence—based
taxation is inevitably difficult     to administer, especially in a

developing country.7     These difficulties are examined further in the next

section. To the extent that worldwide taxation cannot be administered

effectively, capital flight (from the countries with inadequate

administration) is encouraged and the theoretical advantages of

capital—export neutrality are not actually achieved.8

     Double taxation would result from the application of both source and

residence—based taxation to a particular international flow of income.

                                        7
Countries employing the residence principle corsnonly               defer   to the fiscal

claims of source countries. In the United States this is achieved

unilaterally by allowing credit against domestic tax                liability   for income

taxes paid to foreign governments, up to the average rate of taxation

paid in the United States.9 As long as the foreign tax rate does                    not
exceed the domestic tax rate, capital—export neutrality is achieved. As

an alternative, a taxpayer can, at its option, take a deduction for

foreign taxes, rather than         a credit)0      u.s. tax treaties also regulate

the    tax        of income flowing between treaty parthers.
             treatment                                                        The

problem, then is to establish norms for taxation by countries                 of

source

        In deciding both whether to utilize source or residence—based

taxation and whether the tax system of the source or residence nation

should be given precedence in international tax conventions,                  nations

face conflicting objectives.            For example, a capital—importing nation

might like to enact heavy source—based taxes, in order to capture tax

revenue      for   its treasury.
                              the other hand, it may fear the adverse
                                   On

effects source—based taxation that is not offset by foreign tax credits
in capital—exporting countries would have on foreign investment in the
country. Indeed, a decision may be made by the source country to forgo

tax revenues in order to attract capital. This is especially likely
where   potential foreign investors reside in             countries that do not or
cannot tax     foreign—source income,

       For                a capital—exporting country can be expected to
             revenue reasons,
prefer residence—based taxation. This pattern is exemplified in the tax
laws of the United States and,           sometimes      to a lesser degree, in those of
many other developed countries.           Long   (but   no   longer) the premier example
                                             8
of a capital—exporting nation, the United States employs residence—based

taxation. Whereas it unilaterally extends priority in taxation to the

source country through its foreign tax credit, it attempts to protect its
                                                          in its foreign
position as a capital exporter by pressing for provisions

tax treaties that reduce source—country taxation of interest, dividends,

and various other forms of payments to its residents. Capital—importing

countries can be expected to favor an international system in which

source—based taxes on these types of income are higher than proposed by

capital—exporting   countries and    in which   the latter   countries provide

foreign   tax credits   for source—based taxes.     Such a situation allows them

to raise revenue from foreign multinational corporations with little fear

of adverse economic consequences, as long as the tax rates applied to

these forms of income by the source country do not exceed those in home

countries allowing foreign tax credits.

     These contrary pressures of conflicting objectives can be seen by
                                                          Convention
comparing the United Nations (U.N.) Model Double Taxation

between Developed and Developing Countries with the Draft Double Taxation

Convention on Income and on Capital published by the Organisation for

Economic Cooperation and Developoent      (OE).      The latter draft convention

is relevant primarily for fiscal relations between developed countries.

Since capital flows aiing such countries can be expected to be roughly in

balance (at least multilaterally over the long run), the distinction

between capital—importing and capital—exporting countries may be have

little significance.      Thus the   OE draft treaty, reflecting the
                                                           calls for
preference of these countries for the residence principle,
                                          10 percent of the gross amount
limiting withholding taxes on interest to

of interest.

                                         9
       By comparison, the U.N. model convention involves both developing

countries that are generally capital importers and developed ones that

export capital.      It leaves the limitation on the tax rate on interest

unstated, to be the subject of bilateral negotiations between the

contracting parties.      This difference reflects the conflict between "the

strong view on the part of members from developing countries that those

countries should have the exclusive, or at least the primary right to tax

interestu and the view of the representatives of developed countries that

the home country of investors should have the primary or even exclusive

right to tax such income.12 Analogous ambiguity and latitude for

negotiations characterizes the U.N. guidelines on withholding rates on

dividends, in contrast to the definite limits stated in the OECD model

convention,

       Foreign tax treaties of the United States conmnly give the country

of residence an increased secondary claim in the taxation of certain

types of income (e.g., interest, dividends, and capital gains) by

providing reduced taxation by the source country. Besides capturing tax

revenues on income from U.S. capital invested abroad for the U.S.

Treasury                                       treaty parthers and the
           and encouraging capital flows between
United States, such treaties are subject to abuse; the most connon forms
of abuse are described in section IV. Moreover, for certain types of
income earned in the U.S. by foreigners the United States does not

attempt to impose source—based taxation as a matter of domestic tax
policy.

III.   Latin   American Practice

       Most   countries of Latin America attempt to tax most income from

                                       10
business and capital earned within their borders by both residents and

non—residents.13 The top tax rates applied to individual income range

from 30 percent in Bolivia, Colombia, and Paraguay, to 55 percent or

above in Chile, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua,

and Panama.   Corporate rates are generally similar, but commonly somewhat

lower.   (See Table 1.)   Of course, the actual burden on domestic source

income depends on the details of the tax law of various countries. But

one thing is certain. Unless income earned abroad by    residents is also

taxed, either by the home country or by the country in which capital is
invested, there are tax—induced incentives for capital flight.

     The countries of Latin America have traditionally been strong

proponents of the source principle of taxation.'4 This is reflected in
the pattern   of jurisdictional standards reported in Table 1.   Of the 18

countries covered, only five attempt to tax the worldwide income of

corporations and only seven do so for individuals. Although several of

the more advanced countries of Latin America do attempt to tax on a

worldwide basis (e.g., Brazil, but only for individuals, Chile, Colombia,

and Mexico), several others do not (e.g. Argentina and Venezuela), and

several of the countries attempting worldwide taxation are not highly

advanced (e.g., El Salvador, but only for individuals, Honduras, and

Peru).   With few exceptions (Honduras and Brazil, which allows credit

only as permitted by treaty) the countries that follow the worldwide

approach   allow foreign tax credit for taxes paid to source countries.
With the exception of Argentina (eight treaties) and Brazil (fifteen),
Latin American countries are parthers to few tax treaties other than the

Andean Pact between Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. No
Latin American country has a foreign tax treaty with the United States.
                                     11
        Even the figures in Table 1 almost certainly greatly overstate

effective reliance on residence—based taxation.        Major domestic Latin
Pmerican corporations operating abroad, whether through subsidiaries or

branches, can be expected to report income to their home countries,

though perhaps not with total accuracy)5 The accuracy of reporting is

likely to depend, inter alia, on the existence and effectiveness of

exchange controls, on the availability of (and limitations on) the

foreign    tax    credit   in the          the extent of exchange of
                                    home country, on
information between fiscal authorities of the source country and the home
country, and on the feasibility of structuring intercorporate relations
in such a way as to circumvent such exchanges of information and other
administrative controls of the home country. But this does not seem to
be of primary importance for the purpose at hand, both because (as is
documented further below) income from the conduct of a trade or business
in the U.S.      is subject to tax, even if it is earned by   a   foreign person,
and because this type of foreign investment (investment in a trade or

business)    by   zatin ?dnericans does not seem to be the essential problem of

tax—induced capital flight.'6

        The real potential for tax—induced capital flight would appear to

involve investment in interest—bearing securities and bank accounts,

corporate    shares, and   estate in the United States. The U.S. does
                             real

not tax ist interest paid to unrelated foreigners, and capital gains on
assets other than real estate realized by foreigners are exempt from u.s.
tax. It may also be possible to reduce substantially U.S. taxes on
corporate dividends (and with greater risk and less flexibility those on
capital gains on real estate). Provisions of U.S. law dealing with these
types   of income are      discussed in the next section. The question to be
                                            12
addressed briefly in the remainder of this section is whether a Latin
American country that attempts to impose taxation on a worldwide basis
can effectively do so on these types of income from passive investment.
     It appears that a negative answer is virtually inevitable.
Exceptions would be likely to occur only in the simplest cases.    For

example, someone might repatriate funds through legal channels to a

country with strong exchange controls and not be able to prove that the

funds do not constitute income.   In fact, one would not ordinarily expect

that passive income earned abroad on which neither foreign nor domestic

tax had been paid would be repatriated through legal channels. Moreover,

since no country in Latin America, including those employing the

worldwide approach, has a double taxation treaty with the United States,

the exchange of tax information with the United States is nonexistent.

Even if there were such a treaty, it would be simple and relatively safe

to give the bank or other payor of interest a false address of

convenience, for example, in another Latin American country that employs

the territorial system or in a tax haven country that has a treaty with

the U.S.   In the case of bank   interest, even this is not necessary.

Since financial institutions are not required to report payments of

interest to foreign investors to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, an

exchange of information agreement would serve little purpose; under U.S.

law there would be no information to exchange.

     Given the difficulties the United States has in preventing its own

citizens from evading taxes on domestic—source interest and dividend

income (through means to be described in section V), there is little

reason to believe that any Latin American country can effectively apply a

worldwide system of taxation to non—business income earned in the United

                                     13
States by its residents, either with or without cooperation from the

United States,          Of course, under current U.S. law and         in   the absence of

treaties there is little such cooperation.



IV.     U.S. Law:       Principles and Facts
        The United States has traditionally been a strong advocate of the

principle of residence—based taxation. Even so, it is also coomonly said

to apply source—based taxation to income originating within the country,
as well as to the foreign income of U.S. persons. In fact, aside from
income earned in a trade or business, interest paid to affiliates, and

capital gains on real        estate, much     income    from   capital originating in    the
United States         is legally exempt from tax if earned
                                                           by foreigners)'7             More
cart   be taxed   at   low rates if channelled through treaty partners           of the
United      States.

A.     Income from a Trade or Business

        Income   received by   foreigners from the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States has long been              subject to U.S. taxation.
The Foreign Investors Tax Act          (FITh) of 1966 made two important changes

that restrict the scope        of taxation in this area in ways that encourage
capital     flight from other countries to the United States to avoid taxes.

First, it provided that investment income (conmionly termed "fixed                 or

determinable annual or periodical," or FDAP income) received by

foreigners also engaged in business in the United States would be
included in the taxable income from the conduct of a trade or business
only   if   "effectively connected" with such a trade or business.18               (The
most   important items of      FDAP   are   interest,   dividends, rents and

                                              14
royalties.     Gains on the sale of capital assets may also be characterized

as effectively connected.) By comparison, the "force of attraction"

doctrine of prior law had provided that investment income earned by            a

foreign corporation or individual engaged in a trade or business would

automatically be included in the taxable income of that trade or

business.

      This distinction is important, because investment income       (FDA.P)   was

subject to tax at a fixed rate, cometonly 30 percent unless reduced by

treaty,   on the gross amount.     By comparison, income deemed to be derived

from pursuit of a trade or business (including that drawn by the force of

attraction) was subject to progressive rates reaching as high as 70

percent, though only on net income after deductions.'9

      The    second important change made by   the    to clarify that
                                                     FITP was

holding securities for investment purposes did not constitute a trade or
business, even if an agent resident in the United States was granted
authority to use    discretion in managing a portfolio. Together these two

provisions reduced substantially the        likelihood that investment income
would   be subject to tax as income from a trade or business.20       Initially

they implied primarily that such investment income would be subject to

the 30 percent withholding rate (or lower rate, as provided by treaty);

with the increased use of treaty shopping and the eventual repeal of 30

percent withholding on portfolio interest these provisions have assumed

even greater importance; see parts      C   and D of this section.

       The FITh was passed in response to concern about the balance of

payments problems the United States was experiencing in the early l960s.

That the purpose was to     attract foreign capital into the United States
was   made   quite explicit in   the report of a task force appointed by

                                         15
President Kennedy in 1963 that transmitted its report to President

Johnson in April 1964.          The task force report stated, "revision of U.S.

taxation   of foreign investors is one of the most ixmnediate and productive
ways   to increase the flow of foreign capital to this country." With this
purpose   in   mind,   it          "that a nonresident alien individual
                            recolx!nended,

engaged   in trade or business within the United States be taxed at regular
rates only on     income connected with such trade or business."2'



B.   Bank Interest

       Interest   on bank accounts has long been      exempt  taxation
                                                               from U.S.
when paid to foreigners. This exemption (which was implemented by the

construction of attributing such income to foreign sources prior to
rationalization via an explicit exemption in the 1986 Tax Reform Act) is
justified as responding to competitive pressures from abroad; it is

argued that without such an exemption U.S. banks would be unable to

compete for funds in international capital markets.22

       U.S. financial institutions paying interest to a foreign recipient

are under no obligation to report the payments to the U.S. Internal

Revenue Service.       As indicated more fully in part F of this Section, some

U.S. residents probably use this exemption, as well as that for interest

on debt securities and the reduced rates provided by treaties, to avoid

U.S. taxes.     This is relevant because it indicates just how difficult it

would be for Latin      American     countries employing the worldwide approach to

tax U.S. source    inc of these types.

C.   Portfolio Interest

       until 1984 interest on portfolio investment in debt securities

                                             16
issued in the U.S. was subject to 30 percent withholding (or lower rates,

as provided by treaty).        It was, however, a relatively   conuiion   (though far

from simple) matter for a U.S. corporation to avoid paying this tax by

using a finance subsidiary incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles, with
which the U.S. had a quite favorable treaty.
     The following     is a   simple example of this abuse of the treaty
process. The finance subsidiary of a U.S. corporation chartered in the
Netherlands Antilles (N.A.) would float a public issue in the Eurodollar
bond market and loan the proceeds to       its U.S. parent.parent would
                                                               The
obtain a deduction for interest paid to the finance subsidiary, but the
interest payments made by the U.S. parent to its finance subsidiary would
be exempt from U.S. withholding taxation under the terms of the treaty
between the Netherlands and the United States, as extended to the
Netherlands Antilles. The finance subsidiary would be subject to tax on
interest   income in the Netherlands Antilles only to the extent of the

spread between the     interest paid and   interest received, consnonly

approximately one percentage point.        Interest payments made by the

finance subsidiary to bond holders would be exempt from taxation in both

the United   States and the Netherlands Antilles. Moreover, subject to

certain   limitations, the income tax    paid to the Netherlands Antilles

could be used to offset dollar for dollar the U.S. parent's U.S. income

tax liability via the foreign tax credit.23

     The Tax Reform of 1984 repealed the 30 percent tax on interest paid

to foreigners for portfolio obligations issued after July 18, 1984, the

date of enactment.      Several justifications can be given for the repeal of

30 percent withholding on portfolio interest. First, repeal increased

tax equity and   the   efficiency of international transactions by extending

                                         17
to all borrowers and       lenders the    tax treatment that had previously been

available    only to those able (perhaps because of size) to take advantage

of the type of "treaty shopping'         manipulation   described above.24      It was
deemed inadvisable simply to attempt to close the treaty shopping
loophole, since to do so would place U.S. borrowers at a disadvantage in
Eurodollar markets, since lenders cormonly insisted upon             a   return high
enough   to compensate for the U.S. withholding tax.25          Of course, repeal

of 30 percent withholding increased the attraction of U.S. investments

for those from all countries with mobile capital.26 As a result it

facilitated financing the large deficits in the U.S. balance of payments.

Second, it would enable the U.S. government to reduce interest outlays

necessary to finance the large and rapidly growing debt of the federal

government.

      Following years of debate and negotiations the          U.S.   government

announced on June 30, 1987 the termination of its tax treaty with the

Netherlands antilles, effective January 1, 1988.            Because of the outcry

from world financial markets, the termination was eventually rescinded

for interest payments, leaving them eligible for benefits of the

treaty.27     The repeal of 30 percent withholding makes this largely

academic, except for interest on existing debt.            While repeal of the

Netherlands antilles treaty will eliminate the most egregious opportunity

for treaty shopping, it       will not    totally eliminate the problem posed by

third—country use of treaties especially for non—interest payments.                (For

nre   on   this,   see   the next part   of this section and, in a different

context, section     V below.)


D.   Other   Portfolio Income

                                            18
     Capital gains on assets other than       real   estate (to be considered

irtunediately below)   realized   by foreign persons are generally exempt from

U.S. tax.   Such   gains are subject to tax   only    if they are "effectively

connected' with a U.S. trade or business (see part        A of   this section),

or, in the case of an individual, if the owner was present in the U.S.

for more than 182 days during the year of disposition.

     Dividends, royalties, and other forms of portfolio income paid to

foreigners and not yet discussed are subject to 30 percent withholding,

except as reduced by treaties.28 As with interest income under pre—1984

law, there are opportunities for residents of nations having no treaty

with the United States (as well as U.S. citizens) to channel funds

through treaty countries in order to benefit from the reduced withholding

rates provided by treaty.

     Abuse of the treaty mechanism is relatively straightforward. Under

U.S. law the recipient of U.S.—source dividends need only provide an

address in a treaty country to the payor of dividends in order to benefit

from the reduced rate of withholding provided by treaty.          Unless the

withholding agent has knowledge that the recipient of dividends is not

actually a resident of the treaty country, it is allowed under U.S. law

to apply the reduced withholding rates specified in the treaty with the

relevant country.      Though slightly different, the withholding

requirements for non—dividend income are equally lax; it is a simple

matter to obtain reduced withholding rates by certifying residence in a

treaty country.     Since U.S. regulations do not require that payors of

portfolio income determine the identity and residence of the beneficial

owners of nominee accounts, such accounts held in treaty countries can be

used to evade U.S. withholding tax on such income.29

                                         19
E.   Capital Gains on Real Property

      Before passage of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of

1980 (FIRPTP), a foreign investor could easily invest in real property in

the United States and incur no U.S. tax liability on gains realized on

disposition of the property.      A   simple way to achieve this result would

be to hold the real property through a U.S. or foreign corporation and

then sell the corporation's stock.3°

      FIRPTP changes this situation dramatically. Under FIRPTP tax is

imposed on gains realized after June 18, 1980 by a foreign person upon

the disposition of a 'United States real property interest'       (USRPI).

This effect is achieved through the formal mechanism of deeming all gains

and losses from dispositions of USRPIs as effectively connected with a

U.S. trade or business.31      (FIBPTh does not, however, change the basic

rule that mere ownership of U.S. real property does not cause a foreign

person to be deemed to be engaged in U.S. trade or business, in the

absence of active management or the exercise of an option to be treated

in this way.)      In so doing it over—rides foreign tax treaties that

allowed the taxpayer the     option   of choosing annually whether gains and

losses would   be   deemed to be from a trade or business.32

     In addition to direct fee—simple ownership of property, such

arrangements as leaseholds and options to acquire property interests are

included in the scope of the definition of a USRPI.       Noreover, an

interest in   a   U.S. corporation (other than simply as a creditor), half of

whose assets are U.S. property (a United States real property holding

corporation or USRPHC) is also a USRPI.33        For purpose of FIRPTh real

property is defined broadly, and includes interests in cooperative

apartments, residential dwellings, plants and factories, rental property

                                         20
and    hotels,   and interests in mineral,     timber,   and   oil    and   gas   properties.

        The passage of FIRPTP seems to have been motivated both                by   concern

that    foreign investors were     bidding up the price of American            farm   land

and by      the view that   it was unfair that foreigners could profit from
investment in U.S. real estate without paying any              U.S.    tax,   while
Americans could not.34

       As   originally passed, FIRPT imposed extensive reporting
requirements on U.S. nonpublic corporations, partherships, trusts, and
estates which had a foreign investor whose pro—rata share of the entity's
USRPI exceeded $50,000 and on       any foreign person not engaged             in a trade
or business in the United States owning a USRPI exceeding                   that figure in
value and not otherwise required to file an information return.35
Alternatively,   security deposit for the payment of federal income taxes
                   a
could be furnished in lieu of filing certain of the information reports
described     above.
     These requirements for information reporting were extremely complex
and ambiguous, as well as intrusive. They were strongly resisted. It
was generally felt that many foreign persons and U.S. entities through
which foreign persons hold tJSRPIs would be unwilling or unable to comply
with   the reporting and/or security requirements of the law.                 As a result

the tax reform     act passed in   1984 substituted a system of withholding for

the system based on reporting and       security   deposits.36         In general the

transferee of a USRPI is required to withhold 10 percent of the amount

realized from the disposition of a USRPI. Under certain circumstawes
the withholding requirements are placed on corporations, partherships,

and trusts. In addition a foreign corporation that distributes a tJSRPI
to its shareholders (whether foreign or domestic) in             a    transaction in

                                          21
which gain is taxable under FIRPTP must withhold 34 percent of such gain.

These obligations can      be avoided    if the transferor of the USRPI certifies

that the transferor is not a foreign person and provides the U.S.

taxpayer identification number of the transferor.37

         There has been some concern that       FIRPT might   be having less impact

than originally envisaged, in part because it has been interpreted quite

narrowly     and   the repeal of 30 percent withholding has been given an

overly broad interpretation. Regulations indicate that the 1984 tax act

repealed     withholding on interest payments on certain private placements,
as well as for portfolio investments in publicly traded securities.             It

has been unclear whether under FIRPTA it would be possible to structure

an interest in real estate as a creditor having strong elements of equity

participation in such a way that it would not constitute a USRPI. If so,
investments with the economic features of an equity investment but the

legal features       of debt could be used   to circumvent the purpose of FIRPTA.

If   a   foreign creditor were given fixed interest bonds with additional

payments contingent on appreciation of property, a USRPI would almost
certainly be found to exist. Actual transactions would generally be much
more complicated than this, so that         the economic nature of the matter
would be less transparent. The tax          treatment of debt with contingent

interest/equitykickers based        on   net operating profits, appreciation of
property,     or gain on the                               certain. The
                               sale of property is somewhat less

U.S. Treasury Department has, however, warned taxpayers that it will

interpret debt with "equity kickers" as USRPI5 subject to FIBPT

     other potential gap in FIBPTA results from the fact that it may be
possible to structure ownership arrangements in such a way as to avoid a

taxable disposition under U.S.       tax   law.   For example, a USRPI might be

                                           22
held by a foreign corporation; the ownership of the foreign entity could

change without triggering U.S. taxation under FIRPTP.           Even though a

foreign corporation can be characterized as        an   RPHC, disposition of its

stock by a foreign person is not subject to U.S. tax under FIRPTP. Of

course,     this is likely to be a quite clumsy investment vehicle,

particularly since the buyer assumes the corporation's "tax history" in
such a case. It can be assumed, moreover, that the purchaser of stock in
such a corporation would reduce the        price paid for   such stock to reflect

the   tax   that     paid upon liquidation; since the buyer (through the
                   must be

corporation) retains the seller's basis in the real property, tax can be
deferred indefinitely, but it cannot be avoided completely.          On balance,

the most appropriate conclusion is probably that the taxation of capital

gains on U.S. real estate realized by foreigners has been tightened

substantially, though some gains may escape tax or may be deferred for

long periods.



F. Suxmtary Assessment

      Recent years have seen a pattern in the evolution of the U.S.

taxation of income from capital earned by foreigners.           First, income

from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States remains

fully taxable.       There  to be no inclination to lighten the tax
                             seems
burden of foreigners doing business in the United States; indeed, it was

increased in relative terms by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, especially by

the provisions pertaining to the branch profit tax. Moreover, gains
from the sale of U.S. real estate are now subject to income tax, and
withholding is applied to the gross proceeds from such sales in many

cases.      This change was   made   explicitly to forestall foreign investment
                                           23
in U.S. real estate and to equalize tax treatment of American and

foreign investors in real estate.

       By comparison, portfolio interest has joined interest paid by
financial institutions in being exempt from withholding tax.           To a large

extnt    this simply ratified the status quo, since many large

corporations had come to use financing subsidiaries chartered in the

Netherlands Antilles to circumvent the previously existing withholding

requirements.      It is noteworthy, however, that this problem was attacked

by exempting portfolio interest, rather than by simply abrogating the

Netherlands Antilles treaty, because of the express desire to avoid

putting American borrowers at a disadvantage relative to their foreign

competitors, who are said to have ready access to financial markets

abroad   without the requirement to pay withholding        taxes.

       Other   forms   of portfolio income received by foreigners remain

subject   to   withholding   tax, but                      substantially
                                        these taxes can be reduced

by channeling                                          the United States
                  investments through countries with which
has tax treaties. Residents of non—treaty countries, as well as U.S.
residents, can use these techniques to avoid U.S. withholding taxes on
payments to residents of non—treaty nations. It is thus not surprising
that in 1978 almost ninety percent of investment income sent from the
United States to foreign countries flowed to countries having tax
treaties with the United States. Even more telling is the fact that
approximately     one—half of dividends     and one—third of non—bank interest

paid   to foreign addressees (at that time       still   subject to withholding
tax) went to only three countries, Switzerland, the Netherlands, arid the

Netherlands Antilles, nations that are notorious for their use by those

interested     in "treaty shopping."38

                                           24
V.    Potential Solutions

       Faced with the situation just described, Latin xnerican countries

that are concerned about the possibility that generous tax treatment in

the United States may induce capital flight have three basic options.

This section examines these options.       It concludes that none of the

three approaches is likely to be effective in eliminating tax—induced

incentives for capital flight

      First, they can attempt to adapt to the international tax

environment in order to minimize the damage to their economies.      This

would imply adoption of the worldwide principle and negotiation of

foreign tax treaties with the United States; presumably such treaties

must contain exchange of information agreements if they are to be

effective.    This approach is unlikely to be effective.

      Second, they can attempt to change the external environment by

persuading the United States and other developed countries to alter

their tax treatment of income earned by foreigners.      In essence this

means convincing the U.S. and other developed countries to reverse their

long—standing preference for residence—based taxation     — or at least
actually to apply source—based taxation to income originating within

their jurisdictions in order to avoid attracting funds from Latin

Mterica.    The outlook for this strategy is also not bright.

      A   third and far more extreme option would be to adopt a

fundamentally different system of direct taxation that exempts capital

income from domestic investment. Such an approach would place

domestic—source income from business and capital on even terms with

income from foreign investment. chile this approach would produce a

nre   nearly level playing field, it has certain obvious probleu.
                                      25
A.   Switch to Residence Principle

     At a superficial level it might appear that the problem addressed

in this paper could be eliminated if Latin American countries now using

the territorial principle would adopt worldwide taxation of the income

of residents. In fact, such an attempted solution would probably be

largely ineffectual, for reasons suggested in section III.         By   i,   elf,

simply requiring that residents pay tax on worldwide income would have

liotie effect,    except on those who comply with tax laws as a matter of

moral principle. It is true that failing to pay tax involves fraud and

the psychological cost of fearing the consequences of detection.             Even

more rigorous tax administration is unlikely to have a major effort in

inducing compliance with the tax law, since the receipt of

foreign—source income is extremely difficult to detect.       In the absence

of exchange of information agreements between the United States and

Latin American countries, there would be little possibility that tax

could be collected on capital income earned in the United States by

residents of those countries.

      Even if exchange of information agreements would be completely

effective, but could be obtained only as part of a comprehensive tax

treaty with the United States, it is not obvious that pursuing such

agreements would be in the interest of most Latin American countries.

It can be expected    that the United States would require   low   withholding

rates   on   interest and dividends as part of any such treaty.     The revenue

loss that would result from accession to such U.S. demands might be too

great a price to pay.     This issue, while important, cannot be pursued

here.

      In fact, exchange of information agreements would stop only the

                                       26
simplest forms of abuse, those in which the Latin American investor

accurately reports his or her name and        address   to the U.S. payor of

interest,   dividends, etc.    A   relatively simple way to circumvent the

fiscal authorities would be to provide false information to the payor.

For example, a resident of Colombia might give a Venezuelan address, if

the U.S. had an exchange of information agreement with Colombia, but not

with    Venezuela.

       To prevent this form of abuse it would be necessary for the United

States   arid   the home country of the investor to detect the use of

addresses of convenience in countries imposing no tax on such income.

In order to understand the difficulty of relying on exchange of

information agreements to assist Latin American countries in the

implementation of worldwide taxation of the income of their residents,
it is instructive to contemplate the opportunities for tax evasion on

U.S.—source income that are open even to residents of the United States

created by the combination of liberal U.S. treatment of income

ostensibly paid to foreigners and lax administrative procedures.39

       Even before passage of the 1984 legislation that eliminated

withholding on portfolio interest paid to foreigners, the following

assessment was made of the ease with which U.S. residents could evade

tax on interest received from domestic financial institutions:

       Evidence is mounting that some United States residents are

       posing as foreign persons, establishing interest—bearing

       savings and checking accounts at United States banks and

       savings and loam institutions, directing that the interest

       income be sent to them at an address     f   convenience in a

       foreign country, and omitting that interest as income on

                                         27
     their United States tax returns. The failure of a United

     States resident to report this interest.           .   . constitutes
     willful tax evasion.        (Karzon,   1983,   pp. 764—65)

Nor is the cause of this growing source of evasion difficult to ident—

i.    Krzon     (1983) writes:

     The scheme appears to succeed only because many barriers impede tax

     officials from detecting the transaction. At the United States end

     of the transaction the financial institution paying the bank

     interest is not required to withhold tax or report the

     transaction...     [Al survey of the practices of representative
     ban ing institutions has indicated that many payors rely solely

     upon the foreign address submitted by the depositor and have little

     or no internal safeguards to verify a depositor's true residency.

     (Karzon,    1983, p. 765,766)

one can only assume that similar abuses will result from the exemption

of portfolio interest paid to foreigners, despite the safeguards

contained in the 1984 law.4°

     The implications for Latin xnerican countries            wishing to tax   the

worldwide income of their residents is obvious:             If the government of

the United States takes so little pains to prevent this type of             evasion

by its own residents, there is little reason to expect it to provide
much U.S. assistance in helping Latin american countries prevent evasion

of worldwide taxes on their residents. It is unrealistic to expect the

United States, through its fiscal authorities, to do for other countries

what it cannot   — or will not — do for itself.
     Aggravating the problem just described is the increased secrecy

being provided by certain countries as part of an attempt to attract

                                            28
intermediation of international capital movements.41 Such secrecy laws

"conceal the transaction and the identity of the taxpayer, and       block
United States authorities from gaining the information necessary to

trace and prove the fraud." (Karzon, 1983, p. 779)42 Needless to say,

problems of this type would be compounded if Latin American countries

attempting to implement worldwide taxation tried to penetrate the

shield of secrecy or asked the United States to assist them in doing
    43
so.

       Before the 1984 law exempting portfolio interest was passed, both

Americans and foreigners could resort to the use of nominee accounts in

countries having favorable tax treaties with the United States to evade

completely or partially withholding taxes on portfolio income, including

interest and dividends. While this technique is no longer necessary in

the case of portfolio interest, its use remains a possibility (for both

Americans                other countries) in the case of other forms of
            and those from

portfolio income. Again, it does not appear that cooperation between

the United States and a Latin American country, without the help of the
U.S. treaty partner,   is likely to reduce this   problem   significantly.
But   relying on U.S. treaty partners is truly likely to be an     exercise in
futility.44   While the United States has an interest in persuading it

treaty partners not to allow U.S. residents to use this device to evade

U.S. taxes, neither it nor the treaty partners has much interest in

preventing its use by residents of third countries. It seems quite

unlikely that the United States will expend much more of its scarce

political capital in convincing its treaty partners to cooperate with

Latin American countries to protect their fiscal resources45

      There is also an interesting question of whether a switch to

                                     29
residence—based taxation would constitute sound        public   policy.   To see

this,   suppose that a Latin american country
                                              were to attempt,        even   if
unsuccessfully,   to implement taxation on    a worldwide basis.     ny
taxpayer repatriating funds from abroad would irrnuediately face several
questions: whether the repatriation represented a return flow
                                                                 of

                                                      on income earned
capital or taxable income; whether tax had been paid
                                                            invested
abroad in   previous years; if such funds were subsequently

abrrad.   would they be presumed   to earn   income   subject to tax?     All

thirgs    considered, a risk—averse taxpayer might be well—advised not to

make the repatriation or to hide it.



B. Changing the International Tax Environment

        As an alternative to the futile attempt to implement

residence—based taxation,     the countries of Latin american might try

                                                        countries that
again to convince the United States and other developed
                                                 and should increase
they are wrong to favor residence—based taxation

their source—based taxes. At this point it is appropriate to quote at
                                                  to the residence
length from a recent paper that blames allegiance
                                                                 the
principle for the increase in tax evasion by U.S. citizens using

types    of ruses described earlier in this paper:
        Responsibility for the burgeoning tax evasion by United States
        residents does not lie solely on the doorsteps of the many nations

        accused of being tax or secrecy havens. The fault also lies in the
        historical United   States insistence on a treaty policy which

        fosters international tax evasion by favoring residency basis

        taxation over source basis taxation for portfolio income... .The

        tilt in treaty policy from source—based to residency—based taxation

                                        30
        of portfolio income has widened the opening for tax evasion.                             It is

        most difficult for a residence country, such as the United States,

        to detect all portfolio income earned abroad by the United States

        residents and all United States—sourced portfolio income and bank

        interest received abroad by United States residents masquerading as

        foreigners. with false foreign addresses....The treaty policy

        orientation toward residency country taxation of portfolio income

        should be reappraised, and a return to source country taxation

        should be reconsidered.. . .The merit                of source     country   taxation        lies

        in its   simplicity           of administration        and certainty      of tax

       collection.     ..   .   In   view of the sizeable amount of United

       States—owned, foreicri—sourced portfolio income, this shift might

       enhance rapport with developing countries, long advocates of source

       taxation.      (Karzon,          1983,    pp. 827—31;    emphasis added)



       If the United States would actually implement the source principle

that ostensibly underlies its tax treatment of income earned in the

United States by foreigners, the problems described in this paper would

be much less importanL                  (They would not be eliminated as long as other

developed countries continued generous treatment of such income.                                We

return    to this    point       below.)        It seems unlikely, however, that there is

much   reason to expect that this approach will soon be fruitful.
       As indicated in section IV, current U. S. practice in this area

seems to reflect certain objectives.                      Income   from   a U.S. trade or

business    operated by          a   foreign person is taxed in full, in order to

avoid   conferring a competitive advantage on such persons, relative to

americans.       Gains on the sale of real estate are now                      considered   t be
                                                     31
derived from a trade or business, and thus subject to tax.   Again, there

was a desire to equalize the tax treatment of U.S. and foreign investors

in real estate and reduce what were seen to be inappropriate incentives

for foreign investment in U.S. real estate.

     y comparison, interest from bank accounts and   interest earned on

portfolio investments is exempt from U.S. tax, as long as it is not

"effectively" connected with a U.S. trade of business.   These

execQtions—which are totally inconsistent with source—based taxation of

income originating in the United States—are provided in part in order

to attract foreign capital into the United States and in part to avoid

putting American financial institutions and non—financial borrowers at a

competitive disadvantage, relative to their counterparts in other

developed countries. Contrary to the situation with income from a trade
or business and capital gains on real estate, there is no offsetting

concern that foreigners have an unfair competitive advantage over

Americans because of more favorable tax treatment. Dividends (and other

forms of 'fixed or determinable or periodical" income) continue to be

subject to withholding, but this tax can be reduced by routing

investment funds through a treaty partner of the United States.

     Given the recent repeal of 30 percent withholding on portfolio

interest and the explicit expression of the sentiments described

previously as a reason for that legislation, it seems highly unlikely

that the United States will soon reverse this policy.    Certainly it

seems unlikely that the United States will follow such a policy if other

developed countries do not follow suit.   American opponents of taxation

of interest income earned by foreigners would point to the continued

availability of debt instruments in Europe on which there is no
                                    32
withholding as justification for continuation of the exemption.

?'loreover,   as long as such instruments continue to be available in other

countries, taxation of interest by the             United States would not be

totally effective in solving the problem of tax—induced capital flight

from Latin America, in any event,             Of course, powerful political forces

oppose   changes of    this type     in Europe.

       The strongest impetus for a change of this type in the               United
States   is likely to be convincing evidence that Americans are evading

substantial amounts of U.S. income tax by such illegal means as

channelling investments through foreign nominee accounts and buying

bonds of F'merican issuers that are targeted to foreign lenders. While

there is good reason to believe both that abuses of this type existed

before repeal of 30 percent withholding on portfolio interest and that

they   have beert   aggravated by repeal of 30 percent withholding, there

presently does no       seem   to be uch     sentiment in Congress to attempt to

do anything about the problem. Further impetus could come from the need
for deficit reduction. Additional federal revenues could be raised by
curtailing     the exemption of interest       going to foreign addresses.
       Even   if the United States could be convinced to tax interest income

earned by foreigners      the problem examined in this paper probably would

not be eliminated, as long as reduced rates are applied to interest

earned by residents of countries with which the United States has tax

treaties. As indicated earlier, funds of Latin American investors could

be channelled through selected tax haven" treaty countries in order to
benefit from such reduced withholding rates. This giimnick would
presumably    be   available   on   both   interest   and dividends (and,    indeed,   on

any   payment for which reduced withholding taxes are provided by -reaty).

                                              33
It seems quite unlikely that the developed countries of the world,

traditionally advocates of residence—based taxation, will reverse the

historical trend of using treaties to reduce source—country taxation of

these income flows, especially if the primary justification is to assist

the   developing countries in avoiding capital flight.     (Developed

countries might be somewhat more sympathetic to an appeal from LDCs

based    the need for assistance in implementing their income taxes. Of
        on
course, such an appeal has little force as long as the developing
countries continue to employ the territorial principle.)
      A   less ambitious approach would be for developing countries to

appeal to the developed countries for assistance in preventing their

residents from using treaty shopping to avoid payment of source—based

taxes in other developed countries. In this effort they might have as

allies those developed nations who believe their own residents are

engaging in similar abuses.      Of course, this approach will have no

effect, except for income subject to withholding. As long as interest

remains largely untaxed when paid to foreigners, it is the use of such
devices as false addresses of convenience and nominee accounts by
residents of countries employing the residence principle that poses the

problem.      Again, there does not seem to be much reason to believe this

approach will be fruitful.



C.   A More   Radical Ppproach

       The discussion to this point has been conducted in the context of a

traditional income tax in which interest is a deductible expense and in

which interest income is subject to tax, unless explicitly exempted, as

in the case of foreign—source interest income earned by residents of a

                                       34
country with a territorial system.   As indicated above, there seems to

be little reason to expect that the tax—induced incentives for capital

flight from Latin Anerica will be reduced in such an income—based tax

system.   It is possible, however, that a more extreme reform offers

somewhat more hope.   The remainder of this section examines this

possibility.

     An alternative to   the traditional income tax that has gained favor

among some academic observers provides tax treatment for interest and

dividends that is very different from that under the income tax laws of

most countries.46 In particular, no deduction is allowed for interest

expense, and interest income is not subject to tax.   In addition,

dividends are not taxable in the hands of the recipient, and as under

the income taxes of most countries, they are not a deductible expense.

Thus interest and dividends are placed on equal footing from a tax point

of view, thereby eliminating the bias against equity finance found in

the tax systems of most countries.47 Irmnediate deduction is allowed for

all business purchases, including those of capital goods; thus there is

no need for either depreciation allowances or special accounting for
•           48
inventories.    The base of sucn a tax can be shown to be consumption,

rather than income.9

    The extreme simplification of tax law that this alternative would

make possible has led some observerss to suggest that it should be given

serious consideration by developing countries for that reason alone.50

But for the present discussion another aspect of this tax is more

relevant. This approach essentially combats the problem of capital

flight from LDC5 created by the tax exemption of certain income in its

country of source by also exempting much domestic—source income   fm
                                     35
business and     capital.51

       1. LDC   Policy
       Predicting the full implications of adoption of a system such as

this for the problem of tax—induced capital flight is quite difficult.

If only a single developing country were to adopt the system, interest

and   dividends   earned on domestic investment would be exempt         arid   business

income   would    be subject to a zero marginal effective tax rate;            of

course under most income tax systems that are administered reasonably
well (and have adequate provisions for withholding on interest) this
benefit is      now generally   available only for income on capital invested
abroad    (under either the territorial system or an ineffectively

administered      worldwide system). This change would appear to reduce the

tax incentives for capital flight.           But interest paid by domestic

businesses would no longer be a deductible expense.              Depending on the

relation between the marginal tax rates currently applied to interest

income and to the net income of business, the net effect of such a

change might be either to increase or reduce the total taxation applied

to domestic interest flows.         Given   cortnnonly   observed patterns of asset

ownership, marginal tax rates, and evasion of tax on interest income, a

small net increase in the taxation of interest paid by business might be

expected.       By comparison, there would be no offset to the exemption of

interest on public debt.         Total taxation of domestic—source dividends

would clearly drop, except in cases where substantial relief from double

taxation of dividends already exists.

       But this is only part of the story.           The immediate expensing of all

business purchases, including capital goods and items added to

                                             36
inventory, would further reduce the taxation of business income from

equity investment in most countries. This would be true especially

where neither rapid depreciation (or other generous investment

allowances) nor inflation adjustment of depreciable basis is allowed.

The net effect of these changes would be too country—specific to allow

easy generalization.      For example, some countries might allow such rapid

depreciation that expensing would provide little additional benefit.

Similarly, in a country that adjusts interest expense for inflation the

total disallowance of deductions for interest expense and the exclusion

of interest income from the tax base may be relatively unimportant.         But

movement from full deduction of nominal interest to no deduction would

be dramatic. Though capital flight might be either worsened or reduced

as the net effect of a change such as this, a reduction seems most

likely fcr most countries that do not allow either inflation adjustment

of depreciable basis or generous capithi consumption allowances.

     Of course, this is still only part of the story.        The taxation of

income from foreign capital invested in the country would also be

affected by a change as far—reaching as this.      As for domestic firms,

interest expense would no longer be deducrlble, but immediate expensing

would be allowed,     Net effects would again be very country specific (or

even industry of firm specific), but it appears that taxation would

conaonly be reduced. Revenues from       foreign investors might,   however, be

recouped through increased remittance taxes on interest and dividends.

     Further   complicating matters    is uncartainty about how   capital
exporting countries that provide foreign tax credits for source-'untry
taxes on net moons would treat such a tax and an increased rerttanc
taxes that   might   eccompany it.   Since no deduction   is allowed
                                        37
interest expense, there is some risk that such a tax would not be

allowed as a credit against home—country taxes.52      Of   course,   to the

extent that the tax—saving benefits of expensing outweigh the

tax—increasing costs of the loss of the interest deduction, tax

liabilities would fall and there would be less of a problem than loss of

the foreign   tax credit   under an income tax.   But the problem would

resurface if higher remittance taxes were used to prevent a drop in

rewtue from income on investments from foreigners.

     It is difficult to know how capital—exporting countries would treat

this tax.53    The United States has traditionally been zealous in its

denial of foreign tax credits for any taxes other than those on net

income, in order to prevent the credit being taken for gross receipts

taxes, severance taxes, disguised state royalties, etc., especially

those paid on the exploitation of natural resources. This focus on net

income is evidenced by the insistence that deductions be allowed for all

expenses of earning income.

     Of course, the disallowance of interest deductions under the tax

being considered here is quite different from the failure to allow

deductions for expenses under a gross receipts tax.         The interest

disallowance is an integral part of a direct tax system based on

consummtion, rather than income.      Noreover, it may typically be offset

— or more      offset — by the allowance of expensing of all
              than

purchases.'4 This is potentially quite important under U.S. law, which
provides   that a tax can be creditable even if it does not allow

deductions for all expenses, provided a compensatory benefit of at least

equal value is allowed.      On balance, it appears that there is at least

some chance that the tax in question would be creditable, at least in

                                        38
 the United States.         If it is (is not) creditable, then the withholding

 tax on foreign remittances would almost certainly (not) be
                                                            creditable,
 since its creditability would probably depend on the creditability of

 the underlying consumption—based tax.

      A   final word   on     creditability is appropriate before leaving that
 issue.   The U.S. foreign tax       credit   is, in rough terms, limited to the

 average U.S. tax      rate   on foreign—source income.     !'loreover,    this limit is
 calculated on an "overall" (worldwide) basis, rather than on a

 country—by—country basis.         Any foreign taxes in excess of         the average

U.S. rate result in "excess         foreign tax credits." Recent          changes in
U.S. law, including rules for the determination of the source of income,

as well as rate reduction, make it more likely than before that American

firms will be in an excess foreign tax credit position. To the extent

this is true it may make relatively little practical difference whether

the tax under consideration in this section is credited. As long a the

firm is in an excess credit position in the aggregate, additional taxes

on foreign income cannot be credited,            even if, in principle, they are

creditable,

     2. Advanced Country Policy

     Widespread adoption of this approach by the developed countries
could do much to elitainate the present tax advantages for foreigners to

invest in such countrios, Under curLert law interest paid to these

investors benefits from the combination of the interest deduction and

the exclusion of interest income from withholding tax; in effect the

combined (payor cum payee) marginal tax rate applied to such inccne in

the country of source is negative, the          n: tx benefit   being eqval in
magnitude to the product of the          interest flow and the tax rate applied

                                            39
to business income.    (For present purposes we can   assume   that such

income is not effectively taxed by the country of residence.)          Under the

simplified alternative being examined here, the combined marginal tax

rate on   such income would rise to zero, since the deduction for interest

expense would be eliminated. This would essentially eliminate the tax

advantages of   capital flight examined in this paper, even if LDCS did

nothing, at least for debt capital.

     Perhaps as important, the possibility of abusing this system

through the use of foreign nominee accounts,    addresses of convenience,

and treaty shopping would be eliminated. Tax would, in effect, be

collected through the disallowance of interest deductions, rather than

withholding, and withholding taxes could be eliminated.55

     A    switch to a system of this type clearly does not offer a "quick

fix.'     Its adoption would run counter to decades of develonent of the

tax on net income.    There are also important concerns about equity and

transition that must be addressed satisfactorily. Moreover, under this

approach taxation of capital income is, in effect, placed on a source

basis, rather than a residence basis.      Thus the entire system of

international conventions dealing with flows of income between nations

would need to be rethought.56

     In particular, the developed countries that have fought so

diligently for residence—based taxation would need to reverse that

stance.    Given the worldwide proclivity to adopt "beggar —     thy   neighbor"

policies   — even by developed countries in their dealings with LDCs,
quick action of this type seem unlikely. It is likely to come about

only if LDC5 bind together in insisting that present international tax

conventions do not function satisfactorily and push for reconsideration
