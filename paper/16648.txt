1       Introduction
Stock prices move substantially relative to measures of fundamentals, such as dividends. The
question of what moves stock prices has received an enormous amount of attention in the finan-
cial economics literature. Time variation in the price-dividend ratio is intimately linked to time
variation in expected returns and in expected dividend growth rates. Therefore, the question can
alternatively be posed as whether stock returns and dividend growth rates are predictable. The
answer is of paramount importance to our understanding of the risk-return relationship, which lies
at the core of finance theory.
    Until the early 1980s, the standard model assumed constant expected returns for stocks. Then,
empirical evidence was uncovered showing that returns were predictable by financial ratios, such
as the price-dividend or price-earnings ratio. Later other variables, such as the spread between
long-term and short-term bond yields, the consumption-wealth ratio, macroeconomic variables,
and corporate decision variables were also shown to have predictive ability. The literature has
expanded its interest to returns on other asset classes, such as government bonds, currencies, real
estate, and commodities, and to many countries.
    Initially, the finding of predictability was interpreted as evidence against the efficient market
hypothesis.1 Fama (1991) proposed the alternative explanation of time-varying expected returns.
In the past twenty years, research in asset pricing has proposed several equilibrium models with
efficient markets that generate time variation in expected returns: models with time-varying risk
aversion (Campbell and Cochrane, 1999), time-varying aggregate consumption risk (Bansal and
Yaron, 2004; Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron, 2009), time-varying consumption disasters (Gabaix, 2009),
time-variation in risk-sharing opportunities among heterogeneous agents (Lustig and Van Nieuwer-
burgh, 2005), or time-variation in beliefs (Timmermann, 1993; Detemple and Murthy, 1994). The
dominant view today is that predictability of asset returns is no longer prima facie evidence of
market inefficiency.
  A large partial equilibrium literature takes time variation in expected returns as given and asks
how it affects optimal asset allocation decisions (see Wachter, 2010, for a recent review). Return
predictability is of considerable interest to practitioners who can develop market-timing portfolio
strategies that exploit predictability to enhance profits, if indeed such predictability is present.
   Despite the theoretical developments, return predictability is a subtle feature of the data.
A parallel literature developed in the 1990s questioning the strength of the statistical evidence.
This literature points out problems such as biased regression coefficients, in-sample instability of

    The efficient market hypothesis states that financial markets are efficient with respect to a particular information
set when prices aggregate all available information (see Fama, 1965, 1970; Jensen, 1978; Shiller, 1984; Summers,
1986; Fama, 1991). Testing the efficient market hypothesis requires a “market model” that specifies how information
gets incorporated into asset prices.

estimates indicating periods with and without predictability, and poor out-of-sample performance.
    Recently, the literature has turned to the question of whether measures of cash-flow growth, such
as dividend growth, are predictable as well. While interesting in its own right and important for
model design, dividend growth directly speaks to return predictability. Through the present-value
relationship, which links asset prices today to future returns and future dividend growth, dividend
growth and return predictability are two sides of the same coin (Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh,
2008; Cochrane, 2008; Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010).
   In this article, we survey the return and dividend growth predictability debate, with an emphasis
on recent developments.2 The organizing principle is the present-value relationship between asset
prices and their cash flows, broadening the discussion from return predictability to include cash
flow growth predictability. While our emphasis is on U.S. stock return and dividend growth
predictability by the price-dividend ratio, we discuss other return forecasters, return predictability
in other asset classes, as well as in other countries. We conclude by offering some thoughts for
future work.


2     U.S. Stock Return and Dividend Growth Predictability
We start by revisiting the basic findings on aggregate U.S. stock return predictability.


2.1     Motivating Predictive Regressions
Define the gross return on an investment between period t and period t + 1 as

                                                     Pt+1 + Dt+1
                                            Rt+1 =               ,
                                                          Pt

where P denotes the stock price and D denotes the cash flow, hereafter dividend. Campbell and
Shiller (1988b) log-linearize the return to obtain:

                                     rt+1 = k + ∆dt+1 − ρdpt+1 + dpt .                                       (1)

All lower-case letters denote variables in logs; dt stands for dividends, pt stands for the price,
dpt ≡ dt − pt is the log dividend-price ratio, and rt stands for the return. The constants ρ =
exp(−dp)/(1 + exp(−dp)) and k = log(1 + exp(−dp)) + ρdp are a function of the long-run average
log dividend-price ratio dp.

     Earlier reviews include the special issue in the Review of Financial Studies (Spiegel, 2008), Koijen and Van
Nieuwerburgh (2009), Lettau and Ludvigson (2010), and discussions in Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997);
Cochrane (2001, 2006).



                                                       2
   Iterating forward on equation (1) and by imposing a transversality condition, one obtains:
                                         ∞
                                         X                                 
                         dpt = dp + Et         ρj−1 (rt+j − r) − (∆dt+j − d) .                    (2)
                                         j=1


Since this equation holds both ex-post and ex-ante, an expectation operator can be added on the
right-hand side. This equation is one of the central tenets of the return predictability literature,
the so-called present-value equation. As long as the (expected) returns and dividend growth are
stationary, the dividend-price ratio is stationary. Deviations of the dividend-price ratio (dpt ) from
                      ¯ ought to forecast either future returns or future dividend growth rates or
its long-term mean (dp)
both. One alternative possibility we return to later is low-frequency changes in the long-run mean
                            ¯ We also discuss the literature that argues that the dp ratio displays
of the dividend-price ratio dp.
(near-) unit root behavior.
    Equation (2) motivates some of the earliest empirical work in the stock return predictability
literature, which regresses returns on the lagged dividend-price ratio, as in equation (3):

                                                                  r
                                   (rt+1 − r̄) = κr (dpt − dp) + τt+1 ,                           (3)
                                                                d
                                 (∆dt+1 − d) = κd (dpt − dp) + τt+1 ,                             (4)

where r̄ is the long-run mean return and τ r is a mean-zero innovation. However, the logic of (2)
suggests that the dividend-price ratio could predict future dividend growth rates instead of, or in
addition to, future returns. Testing for dividend growth predictability would lead one to estimate
equation (4), where d denotes the long-run mean log dividend growth.


2.2    Data
The U.S. stock market return is the CRSP value-weighted market return containing all NYSE,
AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks. Our sample is January 1926 to December 2009. We start from
monthly cum-dividend and ex-dividend returns. Their difference, multiplied by the lagged ex-
dividend price is the monthly dividend:

                                      Dt = (Rtcum − Rtex ) Pt−1 .

This dividend has a strong seasonal pattern. To de-seasonalize the data, the typical solution is to
aggregate the dividends paid out over the year.
   One important question, recently highlighted by Chen (2009) and Binsbergen and Koijen (2010),
is what to assume about the reinvestment rate on these monthly dividends received within the year.
We study three alternatives we have been used interchangeably in the literature. The first option is

                                                    3
to reinvest them at a zero rate. This amounts to adding up the dividends in the current month and
the past eleven months. The second option is to reinvest the dividends at the risk-free rate. For
example, the dividend received in month t-2 is reinvested at the one month interest rate prevailing
at t-2 and again reinvested one more month at the one month rate prevailing at t-1. We use the
CRSP 30-day T-bill rate as our risk-free rate. The third option is to reinvest the dividends at the
cum-dividend stock market return. CRSP computes quarterly or annual return series under the
stock market reinvestment assumption.
   We believe that this third approach is problematic because it imparts some of the properties
of returns to cash flows. To underscore this point, we compute annual returns (Dt + Pt )/Pt−12 − 1
and dividend growth rates Dt /Dt−12 − 1, where D is the 12-month dividend annualized under each
of the three reinvestment assumptions. This generates a time series of 84 observations (December
1926 until December 2009). While all three approaches generate nearly identical annualized return
series, they generate quite different annual dividend growth series, and dividend-price series. While
the first two approaches generate dividend growth series with the same mean (5.12%), volatility
(11.9% vs. 12.0%), and a high correlation of 99.88%, the dividend growth series with market
return-reinvestment has a mean of 5.62%, a much higher volatility of 15.1%, and a correlation of
only 40% with the other two series. To gauge the discrepancy, it suffices to look at the year 2009:
The cash-reinvested dividend growth rate was -17.0% while the market return-reinvested growth
rate was +30.5%. In what follows, we use the annual return series constructed from monthly data
under the assumption of reinvestment at the risk-free rate as our default, and compare results with
those of the market return reinvestment strategy.
   For the return predictability exercises below, we define log returns by equation (1) above, unless
explicitly stated otherwise. Hence, we assume that the approximation is accurate. In addition to
the full sample of firms, we also study the universe of firms without NASDAQ (CRSP data).


2.3    Univariate DP-Predictability Evidence
The return predictability equation (3) was tested among others by (Rozeff, 1984; Campbell and
Shiller, 1988b; Fama and French, 1988; Cochrane, 1991b; Hodrick, 1992; Goetzmann and Jorion,
1993; Lewellen, 2004). It generally found statistically significant evidence for return predictability,
i.e., κr > 0.
    We review and update the empirical evidence on U.S. stock return predictability by the dividend-
price ratio using the latest available data. The estimation is by Ordinary Least Squares with
Newey-West t-statistics with one lag. The return predictability coefficient κr = 0.077 with a t-
statistic of 1.31; the R2 is 2.90%. A high dividend-price ratio at the end of a year predicts a
higher return over the following year, as suggested by the present-value equation, but the point


                                                  4
estimate suggests that there is no statistically significant evidence for return predictability over
the full 1926-2009 sample. See the three most left columns of Table 1, first row. The results are
very similar if we use actual log returns instead of log-linearized returns (second row of Table 1),
if we predict log returns in excess of the log risk-free rate (row 2),3 real returns instead of nominal
returns (row 4), if we exclude NASDAQ stocks (row 5).4
   The results are quite different if we focus on the post-1945 sample (first observation on dp is
1945, first return is 1946). In the post-war sample, the evidence for stock return predictability is
much stronger. Row 6 of Table 1 shows a point estimate that is almost twice as high as in the full
sample, at κr = 0.130, with a t-statistic of 2.56, and an R2 of 10.84%. One important take-away is
that the sample period matters for the evidence on return predictability, using simple predictability
regressions with dp as the predictor. We return to the sample specificity and instability of the results
in the next section and to a different method in section 4.
    The full sample results stand in sharp contrast with the ones obtained using the market-return
reinvestment strategy instead of the risk-free rate-reinvestment strategy. The right columns of
Table 1, panel A, show that the evidence for predictability is considerably stronger. The point
estimate of κr = 0.104 is one-third higher with a t-statistic of 2.08 and a respectable R2 of 4.82%.
The difference between the left and right columns arises because the dividend-price ratio is different
across reinvestment methodologies, while the return series are almost identical. Thus, the evidence
on return predictability in the full sample depends strongly on the reinvestment assumption. Our
interpretation is that the stronger evidence of return predictability arises from assigning some of
the intra-year movement in prices to dividends (and therefore to the return predictor dp) rather
than to cash-flows. Because the results are similar across reinvestment strategies in the post-1945
sample, the contamination is concentrated in the pre-1945 era.
    To interpret the economic magnitudes of the coefficients, consider the 0.13 point estimate for κr
in the post-1945 sample. A swing in dp from one standard deviation below its mean to one standard
deviation above its mean (a 0.89 change) results in an increase in annual stock market return of
11.5% (or 0.58 return standard deviations). Given an average Sharpe ratio of 36% on the U.S.
stock market, Campbell and Thompson (2008) calculate that an annual R2 of 10.80% corresponds
to a doubling in the expected return of a dynamic equity strategy compared a static one that
does not exploit predictability. Or, it corresponds to an increase of 6.7% in expected return for an
investor with a relative risk aversion coefficient of two.5 Return predictability significantly affects

     The proportional/percentage increase in the expected return is 1−R 2  S 2 , where S is the unconditional Sharpe
ratio of the asset and R2 is the R-squared of the return predictability regression. In our case, S = 0.36, R2 =
0.108, and we obtain an increase of 105.53%. The additive/percentage point increase in the expected return is

an individual’s expected portfolio returns, at least in the post-war period.
   Dividend growth predictability has received relatively little interest; exceptions are Fama and
French (1988) and Lettau and Ludvigson (2005). To the limited extent that it has, the consensus
view seems to be that growth rates of fundamentals, such as dividends or earnings, are much less
forecastable than returns when using financial ratios as predictors. This view implies that most of
the variation in the price-dividend or price-earnings ratio comes from variation in expected returns,
not expected future cash-flow growth. We retrieve this result in the right columns of Panel B of
Table 1 for the dp ratio. Indeed, under the market-reinvestment assumption, the point estimate
on κd (equation 4) is not statistically different from zero (right columns). The R2 is essentially
zero, whether we look at the pre-war, post-war, or full sample. We have argued that this case
suffers from mismeasurement of dividend growth and the dividend-price ratio. Also, Binsbergen
and Koijen (2010) show that lagged market returns mechanically predict dividend growth in this
case.
   In contrast, the evidence for dividend growth predictability by the dividend-price ratio is sub-
stantially stronger under the cash- (or no) reinvestment assumption; left columns of Panel B.
Indeed, the full sample point estimate is large (as large as the return coefficient) and negative, as
suggested by equation (2). The regression’s R2 is as high as 7.64%, 2.6 times the value for the
return equation’s R2 . While the R2 is high in economic terms, the standard error remains too
large for statistical significance at conventional levels, at least when using simple predictive regres-
sions. The results are similar with real dividend growth (row 8) or in the no-NASDAQ sample
(row 9). In the post-1945 sample, when we find stronger evidence for return predictability, there
is no evidence for dividend growth predictability (row 10). While based on a short sample, we find
strong dividend growth predictability evidence in the 1927-1945 sample. The point estimate for
κd is -0.642 with a t-stat of -6.24 and an R2 of 74.4% (not reported in the table). These results
are consistent with Chen (2009), who shows that dividend growth is predictable in the 1871-1945
period. In contrast, he shows that earnings growth is predictable in both eras (implying that
the dividend-earnings ratio is predictable post-war). Chen, Da, and Priestley (2010) argue that
dividend growth predictability disappears once firms started smoothing dividends in the post-war
period. We return to alternative cash flow measures below.
   In sum, when our favorite dividend reinvestment procedure is used, returns do not appear to
be predictable while dividend growth rates do (marginally) for the full 1927-2009 sample. These
conclusions reverse in the post-1945 sample. In section 4, we argue that the return and dividend
growth predictability results are closely related to one another and explore their link in depth.

3     Statistical Issues
Findings regarding the predictability of stock returns, like the ones presented in the previous
section, are controversial because the forecasting relationship of financial ratios and future stock
returns exhibits three disconcerting statistical features.
  First, correct inference is problematic because financial ratios are extremely persistent. The
empirical literature typically augments equation (3) with an auto-regressive specification for the
predictor variable,
                                                                dp
                                  (dpt+1 − dp) = δ(dpt − dp) + τt+1 ,                               (5)
      ¯ is the long-run mean of the dividend-price ratio. The estimated autoregressive parameter
where dp
δ is near unity and standard tests leave the possibility of a unit root open (i.e., δ = 1). Nelson
and Kim (1993), Stambaugh (1999), Ang and Bekaert (2007), Ferson et al. (2003), and Valkanov
(2003) conclude that the statistical evidence of forecastability is weaker once tests are adjusted
for high persistence. Amihud and Hurwich (2004), Ang and Bekaert (2007), Campbell and Yogo
(2006), Lewellen (2004), Torous et al. (2004), and Eliasz (2005) derive asymptotic distributions for
predictability coefficients under the assumption that the forecasting variable follows a local-to-unit
root, yet stationary, process. We note that in our annual 1926-2009 sample, the persistence of
the cash-reinvested dividend-price ratio is 0.86, smaller than the 0.93 persistence of the market
return-reinvested ratio. Hence, the predictor we advocate is less persistent than the measure that
is traditionally considered in the literature.
   Second, the forecasting relationship of returns and financial ratios exhibits significant instability
over time. The left panel of Figure 1 shows that in rolling 30-year regressions of annual log
CRSP value-weighted returns on lagged log dividend-price ratios, the ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression coefficient κr varies between zero and 0.5 (solid line). The right panel shows that the
corresponding t-statistic fluctuates between 0 and 5 (solid line). In other words, for thirty-year
samples ending between 1965 and 1995, there was evidence for stock return predictability, but this
evidence disappeared after 1995. It was absent for the pre-war period as well. The figure also
investigates how dividend growth predictability evidence depends on the sample (dashed line). In
contrast with the return predictability picture, there was considerable evidence for dividend growth
predictability for samples ending before 1965. Afterwards, the κd coefficient is indistinguishable
from zero.
    Recognizing this instability, Viceira (1996) and Paye and Timmermann (2006) report evidence
in favor of breaks in the OLS coefficient in the forecasting regression of returns on the lagged
dividend-price ratio, while Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) report evidence for structural
shifts in the mean of the dividend-price ratio. We return to the latter idea below. Constantinides
and Ghosh (2010) study return predictability in the presence of structural breaks in consumption

and dividend growth. Working in a Bayesian setting, Pastor and Stambaugh (2001) estimate
structural breaks in the equity premium, while Dangl and Halling (2009) and Johannes, Korteweg,
and Polson (2008) consider drifting regression coefficients to address parameter instability.
   Third, financial ratios have poor out-of-sample forecasting power, as shown in Bossaerts and
Hillion (1999) and Goyal and Welch (2003, 2008). Inoue and Kilian (2004), Campbell and Thomp-
son (2008), and Kelly and Pruitt (2010) have a different take on the out-of-sample tests and
evidence. Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) attribute most of the poorer out-of-sample perfor-
mance with the difficulty of estimating the new mean of the dp ratio after the economy undergoes
a structural break, rather than with detecting the break itself.


3.1      Structural Break Adjustment
Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) report evidence for structural shifts in the mean of the
                     ¯ in 1954 and 1994. They advocate using a demeaned dp series as return
dividend-price ratio dp
predictor, where regime-specific means are used in the demeaning procedure. The correspondingly
break-adjusted dp ratio displays much less persistence. The first order autocorrelation of the break-
adjusted dp ratio is 0.502 under the cash reinvestment assumption and 0.641 under the market
return reinvestment assumption. The reduced persistence alleviates the upward small-sample bias


                                                                              9
in the return predictability coefficient (see Stambaugh, 1999). The traditional dp ratio’s persistence
is 0.858 and 0.927, respectively. The break-adjusted dp series are also only half as volatile.
    Table 2 shows that the adjusted dp ratio leads to much stronger return predictability and
reduced in-sample coefficient instability. For example, in the 1926-2009 sample, the return pre-
dictability coefficient is κr = 0.212, three times higher than the benchmark 0.077 slope in row 1
of Table 1. It has a t-stat of 2.32 compared to 1.31. The R2 is 6.2% compared to 2.9%. Panel B
shows that dividend growth predictability is now also significantly negative with a point estimate
of κd = −0.240, a t-statistic of -2.53, and an R2 of 20.5% per annum. These numbers are almost
three times higher as in the benchmark case without dp  ¯ adjustment.6 In sum, the low-frequency
movements in the unadjusted dp ratio mask evidence of return predictability as well as dividend
growth predictability.
    Low-frequency changes in expected returns or expected dividend growth can reflect a variety
of structural changes to the economy. Lettau, Ludvigson, and Wachter (2008) argue that a per-
sistent decline in the volatility of aggregate consumption growth leads to a decline in the equity
premium. The latter decline also arises in models with persistent improvements in the degree
of risk-sharing among households or regions, for example due to developments in the market for
housing-collateralized debt (Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh, 2007, 2009; Favilukis, Ludvigson, and
Van Nieuwerburgh, 2010), if the tax code changes persistently (McGrattan and Prescott, 2005),
or if there is a gradual entry of new participants in stock markets (Calvet, Gonzalez-Eiras, and
Sodini, 2004). Other models argue that there was a persistent increase (or at least a perception
thereof) in the long-run growth rate of the economy in the 1990s (Quadrini and Jermann, 2007).
Either effect lowers the steady-state level of the dividend-price ratio dp. Other candidates for
the non-stationarity in the traditional dp measure are persistent changes in firms’ payout poli-
cies, including dividend smoothing, discussed above, or share repurchases, discussed below. While
such slow-moving changes are obviously important for long-run asset prices, they mask the time
variation in expected returns and expected dividend growth at higher frequencies.


4       The Present-Value Relationship
As indicated by the present-value equation (2), return and dividend growth predictability by the
dp ratio are tightly connected to one another. In fact, weaker evidence for dividend growth pre-
dictability points to stronger evidence for return predictability and vice versa (Lettau and Van
Nieuwerburgh, 2008; Cochrane, 2008; Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010). The two slope coefficients in
equations (3) and (4) are closely connected to each other.
    6
   Using the market return reinvested dividend price ratio (in the right columns), the κr point estimate is 0.393
compared to 0.103 and the t-statistic is 4.29 compared to 2.08. Dividend growth remains unpredictable.

The table reports Ordinary Least Squares point estimates, Newey-West t-statistics (1 lag), and R-squared statistics for regressions of
annual log stock returns (Panel A) or annual log dividend growth rates on the lagged log adjusted dividend-price ratio. The adjusted
dividend-price ratio is computed from the raw dividend-price ratio by demeaning, and adding back in a regime-specific mean for 1926-
1953, 1954-1994, and 1994-2009. The 1954 and 1994 breakpoints are estimated in Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008). In the left
columns, returns, dividend growth rates, and dividend-price ratios as computed assuming that dividends are reinvested at the risk-free
rate within the year, whereas the right columns assume reinvestment at the stock market return. The sample runs from December 1926
until December 2009 (84 annual observations).

   To better understand this connection, we introduce a simple model that assumes that expected
returns, µt , and expected dividend growth, gt each follow AR(1) models.

                            ∆dt+1 − d = gt + εdt+1 ,       gt+1 = γgt + εgt+1 ,                       (6)
                               rt+1 − r̄ = µt + εrt+1 ,    µt+1 = δµt + εµt+1 .                       (7)

The model has three shocks: an innovation in unexpected dividends εdt+1 , an innovation in ex-
pected dividend growth εgt+1 , and an innovation in expected returns εµt+1 . We assume that all
three shocks are serially uncorrelated and have zero cross-covariance at all leads and lags, except
for a contemporaneous correlation between expected return and expected dividend growth inno-
vations Corr(εg , εµt ) = ρµg , and a correlation between expected and unexpected dividend growth
innovations Corr(εdt , εµt) = ρµd .
    In steady-state, the log dividend-price
                                          ratio is a function of the long-run mean return and
                                 r̄−d
dividend growth rate dp = log 1+d     . The log dividend-price ratio in (2) can then be written as
the difference between an expected return and an expected dividend growth term:

                                                     µt     gt
                                      dpt − dp =         −       .                                    (8)
                                                   1 − ρδ 1 − ργ

Campbell (1991)’s return decomposition implies that the innovation to unexpected returns follows
from the three fundamental shocks (i.e., combine (1) with (6)-(8)):

                                            −ρ µ           ρ
                                εrt+1 =          εt+1 +       εg + εdt+1 .                            (9)
                                          1 − ρδ        1 − ργ t+1

Since ρ, δ, and γ are positive, and ρδ < 1 and ργ < 1, a positive shock to expected returns
leads, ceteris paribus, to a negative contemporaneous return. Likewise, a shock to expected or
unexpected dividend growth induces a positive contemporaneous return.
    The simplest case of this setup is considered in Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008), where
the persistence of expected dividend growth is assumed equal to that of expected returns: δ = γ.
In that case, the log dividend-price ratio in equation (8) follows an AR(1) process, as in equation
(5), with persistence δ. In the more general case, considered in Binsbergen and Koijen (2010),
δ 6= γ and dp follows an ARMA(1,1). Similar models can be derived for financial ratios other than
the dividend-price ratio (Vuolteenaho, 2000).


4.1    Present-Value Relationship
The second insight from the model is that there is a linear relationship between the three innova-
tions τ = (τ d , τ r , τ dp ). Starting from the definition of a return in (1), and subtracting the linear


                                                     12
projection on dpt , we can write return innovations in terms of dividend growth and dp innovations:

           rt+1 − E (rt+1 | dpt ) = ∆dt+1 − E (∆dt+1 | dpt ) − ρ (dpt+1 − E (dpt+1 | dpt )) ,

or, equivalently:
                                            r      d       dp
                                           τt+1 = τt+1 − ρτt+1 .

By the same logic, there is a tight relationship between the predictive coefficients of returns and
dividend growth rates, and the persistence of the dividend yield. In the simplest case where the
dp ratio is assumed to be an AR(1), this relationship is:

                    Cov (rt+1 , dpt )   Cov (∆dt+1 − ρdpt+1 + dpt , dpt )
            κr =                      =                                   = κd − ρδ + 1.           (10)
                      V ar (dpt )                 V ar (dpt )

Evidence that dividend growth is not forecastable is evidence that returns are forecastable: if κd = 0
in equation (10), then κr > 0 because ρδ < 1. If estimating (4) uncovers that a high dividend-
price ratio forecasts lower future dividend growth (κd < 0), then this is indirect evidence of return
predictability. Cochrane (2008) dubs the lack of dividend growth predictability predictability “the
dog that did not bark,” highlighting that the null hypothesis of no return predictability (κr = 0)
is a joint hypothesis, because it implies a negative coefficient in the dividend growth equation
(κd < 0). The lack of evidence for κd < 0 is evidence in favor of κr > 0.


4.2    Price Variation
We can use the present-value model to understand why asset prices fluctuate over time. Variation
in the price-dividend ratio reflects variation in expected returns (discount rate news), variation in
expected dividend growth (cash-flow news), or their covariance:

                        Var(µt )       Var(gt )        2Cov(µt , gt )
         Var(pdt ) =            2
                                   +            2
                                                  −                    ,
                       (1 − ρδ)      (1 − ργ)       (1 − ρδ)(1 − ργ)
                               σµ2                      σg2                   2ρµg σµ σg
                     =       2           2
                                           +          2          2
                                                                    −                          ,   (11)
                       (1 − δ )(1 − ρδ)        (1 − γ )(1 − ργ)       (1 − δγ)(1 − ρδ)(1 − ργ)
                         Cov(pdt , µt ) Cov(pdt , gt )
                     = −                +                .                                         (12)
                           1 − ρδ            1 − ργ

Alternatively, we can decompose the variance of the pd ratio into the covariance with expected
returns and the covariance with expected growth rates (equation 12). The first covariance equals
the first term in equation (11) plus half the third term, while the second covariance equals the
second term plus half the third term.

4.3     Long-Horizon Regressions
The evidence favoring return predictability, as measured by the R2 statistic, tends to be stronger at
longer horizons.7 We investigate long-horizon return R2 in the context of the present-value model.
We start from the h-period stock return:

                                                          Pt+h + Dt+h
                                             Rt+h =                   ,
                                                               Pt

and log-linearize as before:

                                                   h
                                                   X
                                  rt+h (h) = k +          ∆dt+i − ρdpt+h + dpt .                               (13)
                                                   i=1


We compute the R2 value of the h-period return predictability regression

                                                                     r
                                        rt+h (h) = r̄h + κr,h dpt + τt+h ,

as R2 (h) = κ2r,h Var (dpt ) /Var (rt+h (h)).
    To simplify the exposition, we assume that dividend growth is unpredictable (σg = 0) and that
dividend growth shocks are independent of discount rate shocks (ρµd = 0). Then the per-period
variance of returns is
                                                                               
                             Var (rt+h (h))                  1 ρ2 + 1 − 2ρδ h σµ2
                                            =       σd2    +                        .
                                   h              |{z}       h (1 − δ 2 )(1 − ρδ)2
                                                Cash flows   |         {z          }
                                                                    Discount rates


This equation clearly shows that, as h → ∞, all variation in returns reflects cash-flow risk (see
Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent, 1991; Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh, 2008).
  Returning to the return predictability R2 , we get
                                                           2
                                   2           1 + ρ2 δ h − 2ρδ h
                                 R (h) =                                                                       (14)
                                         hσd2 /Var (pdt ) + 1 + ρ2 − 2ρδ h

It is easy to see that limh→∞ R2 (h) = 0. However, in an intermediate range, the R2 first increases
in h before decreasing. Figure 2 reports model-implied R2 for long-horizon return predictability
equations. It uses the observed volatility of dividend growth for σd , as well as the estimated
   7
    See Fama and French (1988); Campbell and Shiller (1988b). However, Boudoukh et al. (2008) argue that long-
horizon and short-horizon predictability estimators are highly correlated, presenting little independent information
on the presence of return predictability. Cochrane (2008) reconciles both views arguing that the power advantage
arises form horizons beyond five years.

around 35 years.


                                   Figure 2: Long-horizon R-squared in Present-value Model
The figure plots the long-horizon return predictability R2 from the equations rt+h (h) = r¯h + κr,h (dpt − dp) + τt+hr , as implied by the

present-value model. It uses equation (14). The parameter values are based on the post-war sample. We match σd = 0.0688 to the
volatility of dividend growth, δ = 0.9112 to the AR(1)-coefficient of the dividend yield, the variance of the dividend yield equals 18.19%,
and the linearization constant equals ρ = 0.9691.

4.4       Estimation Results
We estimate the present-value model in (6) - (7), following Binsbergen and Koijen (2010). We use
the Kalman filter to construct the model’s likelihood, maximize that likelihood, and obtain the
filtered expected return and dividend growth series µ̂t and ĝt as a byproduct.
    Table 3 contains the point estimates. The first column uses the raw data (without adjustments
for structural breaks) for the full sample. All results in this section assume that dividends are
reinvested at the risk-free rate. We find expected returns to be more persistent than expected
growth rates (δ = 0.93 > γ = 0.26). The volatility of annual expected returns is 4.2%, while the
volatility of expected dividend growth rates is 12.2%. Expected returns and expected growth rates
have a modest positive correlation of 18.5%, consistent with Lettau and Ludvigson (2005) and
Menzly et al. (2004).
   We estimate the total amount of return predictability, measured as 1−(V ar[rt+1 −µ̂t ]/V ar[rt+1 ]),
to be 3.0% in the full sample. The total amount of dividend growth predictability, measured as


                                                                   15
1 − (V ar[∆dt+1 − ĝt ]/V ar[∆dt+1 ]), is estimated to be a very large 46.8% in the full sample. In
comparison with the simple predictability results reported in Table 1, we see that using the dp ratio
as a predictor captures most of the total return predictability (2.9% versus 3.0%), but substan-
tially understates the total dividend growth predictability (7.6% versus 46.8%). This reinforces our
conclusion that returns are only modestly predictable over the full sample, while dividend growth
rates are strongly predictable.
    Despite the strong predictability of dividend growth rates, most of the variation in the price-
dividend ratio arises from discount rate news. This happens because of the much higher persistence
of expected returns (see also Lettau and Ludvigson, 2005). Our benchmark full-sample estimates
imply a variance decomposition of the price-dividend ratio that assigns 93% of the variability to
expected returns, 13% to expected growth rates, and -6% to their covariance (see equation 11). The
last three rows of Table 3 report these shares. Alternatively, we can think of the variance of dp as
coming 90% from covariance with expected returns and 10% from covariance with expected growth
rates (see equation 12). The discrepancy between the amount of dividend growth predictability
in simple predictability regressions and in the present-value model is caused by a severe errors-
in-variables problem in the standard predictability regression (see also Fama and French, 1988;
Kothari and Shanken, 1992; Goetzmann and Jorion, 1995; Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010). Indeed,
the dividend-price ratio is not a good proxy for the expected dividend growth rate because it
mostly captures fluctuations in expected returns.
   Column 2 of Table 3 re-estimates the parameters on the post-war sample. In this sample, the
volatility of expected growth rates is only half as big as in the full sample (6.9% versus 12.2%),
while the volatility of expected returns is similar (4.6% versus 4.2%). Returns are substantially
more predictable in the post-war period, with an R2 of 9.1%. Dividend growth remains strongly
predictable as well, with an R2 of 18.9%. The latter result stands in strong contrast with that in
Table 1, where we found no return predictability by the dp ratio in the post-war sample (1.1% R2 ).
The discrepancy is again caused by the errors-in-variables problem. The increased volatility and
undiminished persistence of expected return raise its contribution to the variation in dp to 98%
(103%-5%), leaving only 2% for the covariation of the dp ratio with expected dividend growth.
   In Columns 3 and 4, we adjust the dividend-price ratio for structural breaks, as in Section 3.
Since the dividend-price ratio is now less persistent, either expected returns or expected growth
rates must be less persistent. We find that it is mostly the persistence of expected returns that is
lower (0.66 versus 0.93). At the same time, the volatility of shocks to expected returns (σµ ) more
than triples. The resulting standard deviation of expected returns is 7.8% (8.5%) in the full (post-
war) sample while the volatility of expected dividend growth rates is 12.3% (6.8%). Expected
returns are much more volatile once the low-frequency component in the dp ratio is removed,
while expected dividend growth rates are unaffected. Consistent with the results in Table 2, the

predictability of returns increases substantially with the break-adjustment, especially in the full
sample. In contrast, predictability of dividend growth rates is not affected much. As with the
unadjusted data, the total predictability of returns is captured almost completely by the dp ratio
while the predictability of dividend growth rates is severely understated. For the full sample,
the Campbell-Shiller decomposition assigns 64% of the variation of the break-adjusted dp ratio to
expected returns and 36% to expected growth rates.
   In sum, once a low-frequency component in expected returns is removed, it is clear that both
returns and dividend growth rates are strongly predictable in both the full sample and the post-
war sample. OLS regressions with the dp ratio as predictor severely under-estimate the extent of
dividend growth predictability. This problem is so severe that they lead to the wrong conclusion
regarding dividend growth predictability in the post-war sample. Dividend growth predictability,
however, is more short-lived than that of returns. The higher persistence of expected returns leads
the present-value model to assign the bulk of variation in price-dividend ratios (90% before and
64% after removing a low-frequency component in expected returns) to discount rate news.


5         Extensions
This section discusses extensions beyond U.S. stock return and dividend growth predictability by
the dividend-price ratio. We discuss repurchase-adjusting returns, other return predictors, evidence
from other countries, and evidence from other asset classes.


5.1         Repurchase Adjustment
A branch of the literature considers returns, dividend growth, and dividend-price ratios that are
adjusted for stock repurchases. The idea is that dividends maybe too narrow a cash-flow mea-
sure because firms can substitute from dividend payments to share repurchases without reducing
shareholders’ payouts per share. In fact, the fraction of dividend paying firms dropped from 66.5%
in 1978 to 20.8% in 1999 (Fama and French, 2001), while repurchases gradually rose. The ob-
served low-frequency decline in the traditional dividend-price ratio in the 1990s may be partially
attributable to this change in the composition of payouts.
    Boudoukh, Michaely, Richardson, and Roberts (2007) show that the repurchase-adjusted dp
ratio more strongly predicts U.S. stock returns. Updating their results to 2009, we find that the
(market-reinvested) return predictability coefficient κr is 0.188 for the sample 1926-2009, with a
t-stat of 2.96 and an R2 of 6.88%.8 Comparing this to the non-repurchase-adjusted results of Table
1, this is indeed higher than the 0.104 slope with t-stat of 2.08 and R2 of 4.82. In the post-1945
    8
        We thank Itamar Drechsler for making his repurchase-adjusted data available to us.


                                                          18
sample, the return predictability coefficient increases from 0.126 (with t-stat of 2.58) to 0.205 (with
t-stat of 3.17). Dividend growth remains unpredictable in both samples.
    However, we have advocated the use of cash-reinvested dividends. Under that reinvestment
assumption, κr increases from 0.077 without repurchase adjustment to 0.117, while the t-statistic
increases from 1.31 to 1.47 and the R2 from 2.90 to 3.27. Hence, we continue to find no evidence
for return predictability in the full sample using standard predictability regressions, despite the
repurchase adjustment. In the post-1945 sample, we estimate κr = 0.194 (with t-stat of 3.23),
higher than the benchmark coefficient of 0.130 (with t-stat of 2.56). One important finding is that
dividend growth is predictable by the (cash-reinvested) repurchase-adjusted dp ratio in the full
sample. The coefficient κd is -0.221 with a t-stat of -2.60 and an R2 of 17.10%. For comparison,
without repurchase adjustment, we found that κd is -0.078 with a t-stat of -1.48 and an R2 of
7.64%. Dividend growth in the post-1945 sample continues to be unpredictable.
   The reason for these quantitatively and qualitatively different findings is that the repurchase
adjustment makes the dp series less persistent. This alleviates some of the statistical issues re-
viewed on above.9 At a mechanical level, the repurchase adjustment works similarly to the break-
adjustment we discussed above. Put differently, changes in firms’ payout policies may well be
an important contributor to the non-stationarity in the traditional dp ratio.10 Finally, whether a
repurchase adjustment is appropriate or not depends on the question at hand: does one consider
an investor who always holds one share of the stock or an investor who participates in every stock
repurchase. Yet another alternative is to consider an investor who participates both in stock re-
purchases and in all initial public offerings (see Larrain and Yogo, 2008; Bansal, Fang, and Yaron,
2005). Larrain and Yogo (2008) show that about half of the variation in the price-dividend ratio is
due to variation in expected growth rates, once repurchases and issuances are included in the cash
flow measure.


5.2     Other predictors
There is a voluminous literature documenting stock return predictability by other variables than the
dividend-price ratio. They can be grouped in four categories: other financial ratios, term structure
   9
      The first order autocorrelation of the repurchase-adjusted dp ratio is 0.680 under the cash reinvestment assump-
tion and 0.825 under the market return reinvestment assumption. The traditional dp ratio’s persistence is 0.858
and 0.927, respectively. The repurchase-adjusted dp series are about one-third less volatile.
   10
      However, there is evidence that it is not the only or maybe even not the main determinant of the non-stationarity.
Lettau and Van Nieuwerburgh (2008) find evidence for structural breaks in the repurchase-adjusted dividend-
price ratio. Break-adjusting this series further strengthens return predictability under market-reinvestment of
dividends. Under the cash-reinvestment assumption, the return predictability coefficient also increases, but is still
not statistically significant at the 10% level. Since repurchase adjustment intensities are higher among NASDAQ
firms, another (cruder) way to repurchase-adjust the data is to omit these firms. As we showed above, the results
are similar with or without these firms.



                                                          19
variables, macro-economic quantity variables, and corporate decision variables. Among financial
ratios, the earnings-price ratio (Campbell and Shiller, 1988b,a, 2003), the book-to-market ratio
(Kothari and Shanken, 1997; Pontiff and Shall, 1998), the dividend-payout ratio (Lamont, 1998),
the variance risk premium (Bollerslev et al., 2009; Drechsler and Yaron, 2010), a linear combination
of dp ratios of various stock portfolios (Kelly and Pruitt, 2010); among interest rate variables, the
term and default spreads on bonds and the short-term interest rate (Fama and Schwert, 1977;
Campbell, 1987; Fama and French, 1989; Hodrick, 1992; Ang and Bekaert, 2007); among macro-
economic variables, the investment rate (Cochrane, 1991a; Lamont, 2000), the consumption-wealth
ratio (Lettau and Ludvigson, 2001), the labor income-to-consumption ratio (Menzly et al., 2004),
the housing collateral ratio (Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh, 2005), the housing to non-housing
consumption ratio (Piazzesi et al., 2007); and among corporate decision variables, equity share in
total new equity and debt issues (Baker and Wurgler, 2000) or IPO activity.11
   The multitude of predictors naturally leads to the question whether a few factors effectively
summarize the dynamics of expected returns. Using dynamic factor analysis, Ludvigson and Ng
(2007) summarize the information of 172 financial series into a volatility factor and a “risk pre-
mium” factor. The R2 of a regression of quarterly excess stock market returns (from 1960-2002)
on these two lagged factors is 9%. Adding cay increases the R2 to 16%. The first common factor
of 209 macro-economic series is especially useful for predicting the conditional volatility of excess
stock returns.12 A different approach to deal with the multitude of possible predictors is a Bayesian
averaging approach, which takes into account the uncertainty that investors may have about the
“right” return predictors (e.g., Avramov, 2002; Cremers, 2002). Finally, Pastor and Stambaugh
(2009) incorporate various return predictors in a “predictive system.” They specify realized and
expected returns as in equation (7), but augment the measurement equation of the system with
a vector-autoregression for observables. Compared to the standard predictability regressions, this
recognizes that a linear combination of these observables is an imperfect proxy for expected returns.
An interesting extension would be to integrate their approach with the present-value model.


5.3     International Evidence
Predictability of stock returns does not only arise for the US. Studies by Ferson and Harvey
(1993), Harvey (1995), Campbell (2003), Paye and Timmermann (2006), Ang and Bekaert (2007),
and Hjalmarsson (2010) analyze a large cross-section of countries. Generally, they find evidence
  11
     In addition, there is a large literature predicting the stock returns of individual firms using firm-level variables
such as the market-value to replacement cost (Q) ratio, the investment rate, the labor hiring rate, etc; see for
example Zhang (2005); Bazdrech et al. (2009).
  12
     Ludvigson and Ng (2007) find a robust positive correlation between expected returns and volatility of returns
using this methodology, clarifying a mixed bag of results in the prior literature on the risk-return relationship (see
also Brandt and Kang, 2004; Guo and Whitelaw, 2006; Pastor et al., 2008, on the risk-return tradeoff).


                                                           20
in favor of predictability by financial ratios in some countries but not others and more robust
results for the predictive ability of term structure variables. In recent work, Plazzi (2009) uses
the present-value identity in a two-country predictability framework for the U.S. and the U.K. He
finds evidence for increasing real and financial integration between the two economies.


5.4     Other Asset Classes
While the focus of this review is on aggregate stock returns, there is a large literature on pre-
dictability in the cross-section of stock returns as well as predictability of other asset classes. In
the cross-section of stock returns, Cohen et al. (2003) show that the expected return difference be-
tween value stocks (with high book-to-market ratios) and growth stocks (with low book-to-market
ratios) is especially high when the lagged book-to-market ratio difference between value and growth
is high. The latter is high in recessions. Using the structure of a present-value model, they argue
that the cross-sectional variance in book-to-market ratios mostly reflects variation in expected cash
flow growth rather than variation in expected returns. This result stands in contrast to the typical
time series result that most of the variation in valuation ratios reflects expected return variability.
   Among other asset classes, government bond returns of various maturities are predictable by
the term spread, e.g., the difference between the five year and the one year yield (Campbell and
Shiller, 1991), or by a linear combination of forward rates Fama and Bliss (1987); Stambaugh
(1988); Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005). In the language of the term structure literature, the latter
paper is consistent with a price of level risk that varies with the Cochrane-Piazzesi factor (Cochrane
and Piazzesi, 2008). In related work, Joslin, Priebsch, and Singleton (2010) find that the price
of both level and slope risk moves around with real economic activity, e.g. industrial production.
Koijen, Lustig, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2009) connect bond return predictability to the cross-
section of stock returns by showing that value stocks’ returns are more sensitive to innovations
in the Cochrane-Piazzesi factor than growth stocks’ returns. This sensitivity differential can be
traced back to value stocks’ dividend growth which falls much more in recessions than growth
stocks’ dividend growth. Such joint treatment of bond and stock returns suggests consistent risk
pricing between both markets. The connection with the business cycle suggests that the value
premium is consistent with rational asset pricing theories.
    Like for bond markets, the expectations hypothesis has been rejected for foreign currency mar-
kets. High interest rate currencies do not appreciate as much as predicted by the EH theory, leading
to return predictability.13 Bekaert and Hodrick (1992) show that dividend-price ratios, forward
premiums, and lagged excess stock returns all predict currency returns. More recently, Lustig,
  13
   Time-varying risk premiums lead to an omitted variables bias in the EH tests, to the extent that the variable
moving risk premia is correlated with interest rates. In contrast to the foreign exchange literature, the expectations
hypothesis for bonds cannot be rejected for several countries (see Bekaert et al., 1997; Bekaert and Hodrick, 2001).


                                                         21
Roussanov, and Verdelhan (2010) show that interest rates, exchange rates, and U.S. industrial
production strongly predict returns on portfolios of currencies and that currency expected returns
are counter-cyclical. Binsbergen, Koijen, and Neiman (2010) relate fluctuations in the net foreign
asset position to currency return predictability. Several structural models have been shows to
generate predictable (and counter-cyclical) currency returns (e.g., Bansal and Shaliastovich, 2010;
Verdelhan, 2010; Gabaix and Farhi, 2009).
   Present value models have been used to explore return predictability in residential real estate
(Campbell et al., 2009) and commercial real estate (Plazzi et al., 2010). Commodity returns are
also predictable by interest rates, the yield spread, the forward premium, and by capital flows
into commodity markets measured as open interest (see Hong and Yogo, 2010, and the references
therein). Finally, Brandt, Binsbergen, and Koijen (2010) study the risk-return properties of equity
dividend strips. They find that the prices of short-term dividend strips are more volatile than their
subsequent realization. This implies that the returns on short-term dividend strips are strongly
predictable using the price of the dividend strip normalized by the dividend as predictor, which is
analogue of the price-dividend ratio for the aggregate stock market.


6     Conclusion
In this paper, we review the literature on return and cash flow growth predictability from the
perspective of the present value model. The present-value model allows for both time variation
in expected returns and expected growth rates as drivers of stock price-dividend ratios and dis-
entangles both sources of variation. The main conclusions of our paper can be summarized as
follows:

    1. Stock returns are less and dividend growth are more predictable over the full 1927-2009
       sample than commonly believed, when using standard predictability regressions with the
      dividend-price ratio (dp) as predictor. This conclusion hinges on the dividend reinvestment
      assumption one makes to construct the dividend-price ratio and dividend growth. We have
      advocated reinvestment at the risk-free rate, not the stock market return.

    2. In the post-1945 sample, these results reverse with no dividend growth and stronger return
       predictability, again using simple predictability regressions with the dp ratio as predictor.

    3. The dp ratio displays near-unit-root behavior. Removing a low-frequency component from
       the dp ratio results in substantially stronger stock return and dividend growth predictability
       over the full 1927-2009 sample, using predictive regressions.



                                                 22
  4. No predictability using the univariate regression approach does not imply no predictability.
     While standard dp regressions uncover about the same amount or return predictability as the
     present-value model, there is a huge discrepancy for dividend growth predictability. Standard
     regressions strongly understate the amount of dividend growth predictability in both the full
     sample and the post-war sample. In the latter sample they fail to detect predictability
     completely.

  5. While dividend growth predictability is strong, it is short-lived. In contrast, return pre-
     dictability is modest, but expected returns are persistent. As a result, about 90% of the
     variation in price-dividend ratios is due to variation in expected returns. Removing a low-
     frequency component in expected returns lowers this estimate to 64%.

   These results all point to the importance of going beyond simple predictive regressions and
considering the present-value identity. The same present-value framework has been used to study
predictability in other asset markets. These results have immediate implications for those mod-
eling the risk-return trade-off in asset markets. Such models should feature both time-varying
dividend growth (at business cycle frequency) and time-varying expected returns (at generational
frequency). While substantial progress has been made developing structural asset pricing models
with these properties, no model we are aware of is quantitatively consistent all these conclusions.
A further challenge is to understand better the economic reasons for dividend growth and return
predictability. This ultimately requires studying firms’ investment and financing policies more
closely, as well as strengthening the link between asset prices and macroeconomic activity. Finally,
future work should aim to integrate the results on predictability in equity, bond, currency, and real
estate markets.
