On the Controversies behind the Origins of the Federal Economic Statistics

                                          ABSTRACT

Although attempts to measure trends in prices, output, and employment can be traced back for
centuries, in the main the origins of the U.S. federal statistics are to be found in bitter debates
over economic policy, ultimately debates over the distribution of income, at the end of the
nineteenth century and during the world wars and Great Depression. Participants in those debates
hoped that statistics that were widely accepted as nonpolitical and accurate would prove that their
grievances were just and provide support for the policies they advocated. Economists – including
luminaries such as Irving Fisher, Wesley C. Mitchell, and Simon Kuznets – responded by
developing the methodology for computing index numbers and estimates of national income.
Initially, individuals and private organizations provided these statistics, but by the end of WWII
the federal government had taken over the role. Here I briefly describe the cases of prices, GDP,
and unemployment.

                                Introduction

       Our federal economic statistics originated in the economic and

political divisions in the United States and the bitter debates over economic

policy they engendered at the end of the 19th century and during the

world wars and Great Depression. Workers were angry because they

believed that they were being exploited by robber barons who were

capturing all of the benefits of economic growth, while employers were just

as sure that the second industrial revolution had brought workers an

unparalleled increase in real wages. Other debates centered on the

effects of unrestricted immigration on wages and employment

opportunities of native-born Americans, on the effects of tariffs on prices

paid by consumers, on the effects of frequent financial panics on

employment, and, during the world wars, on the effects of wage and price

controls on the living standards of workers. Participants on all sides of

these debates believed that nonpolitical and accurate statistics

constructed by experts would help to win support for the policies they

favored.

       In most cases, the development of these statistics was led by

individuals, private organizations, and state governments, although the

federal government eventually took over the role of producing these

statistics on a regular basis. Here I provide brief histories of the origins of

US statistics on prices, national income and product, and unemployment

to illustrate this story.




                                        2
                               Price Indexes

   The honor of creating the first price index probably belongs to the

Italian G. R. Carli, who published an index based on the prices of grain,

wine, and oil in 1764 as part of an examination of the effects of precious

metals from the New World on the European price level (Mitchell 1938, p.

7). The origins of the US government price indexes can be traced at least

to the 1860s. During the Civil War, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon

Chase published averages of prices, perhaps with the intention of showing

that inflation—prices about doubled in the North during the war—was not

as extreme as some critics of the government’s financial policies

suggested.

   For economists, the work of William Stanley Jevons (1863) has long

been considered transformative because it marked a sharp break

between statisticians as compilers of statistics and economists as

producers and users (S. Stigler 1982). Jevons did not weight the individual

prices he collected. Credit for weighted indexes belongs, as much as any

economic ideas have identifiable inventors, to Etienne Laspeyres and

Hermann Paasche (Persky 1998). Jevons computed price relatives (ratios

of the price in a given year to the price in the base year) and then took

a geometric average. A geometric average avoided distortions resulting

from very large increases in individual prices. Jevons, moreover, went on

to use the quantity theory of money to explain the inflation. He found that

prices had risen about 30 percent between 1848 and 1860 and attributed

this to the discoveries of gold in the mid-1800s. He confirmed his


                                      3
explanation by estimating the amount of gold in use, and showing that it

had increased by about the same percentage as prices. He then explored

the effects of the inflation on various classes such as bondholders, wage

earners, and so on. Jevons’s choice of the geometric mean motivated the

important work of British economist and statistician Francis Y. Edgeworth

(1887, 1889). Edgeworth showed that the best mean depended on the

distribution of prices, and that the margin of error associated with a

particular mean depended on how the actual distribution differed from

what was assumed (S. Stigler 1978, p. 297–98).

    A crucial step in the path to our modern price statistics was the

establishment of the US Bureau of Labor in 1884. 1 Organized labor

wanted an organization that would fight for the rights of labor, while

employers resisted. The compromise was an agency that would simply

collect and distribute statistics about labor. President Chester Arthur

chose Carroll D. Wright, who had built a reputation for competence and

integrity as head of the Massachusetts Bureau of the Statistics of Labor—

the first such agency—and who was acceptable to both labor and capital,

to direct the new federal agency.

    In the early 1890s, the Bureau of Labor produced indexes of wages

and prices at the behest of the Aldrich Committee—named after Senator

Nelson Aldrich, a Republican who later played an important role in

establishing the Federal Reserve. The underlying motivation for the study,

produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Duncan and Shelton (1978) provide
a chronology of the work of the Bureau to 1976.

                                           4
I surmise, was labor’s claim that wages had fallen while prices had risen as

a result of Republican tariff increases; a claim that some committee

members, including Aldrich, believed could be laid to rest with

comprehensive statistics of untainted provenance. The Committee’s report

was based on data collected by a research group directed by Roland Falkner,

a professor of statistics at the University of Pennsylvania. 22 The group

painstakingly collected 52,393 price observations (Conforti 2016, p. 3)—the

era of big data had arrived! With this data in hand, Falkner produced

wholesale and retail price indexes stretching from 1860 to 1891. A survey of

expenditures by “normal” households—no more than five children, did not

own their own home, among other characteristics—served as the basis for

weighting the prices. Data on the number of workers by industry provided a

basis for weighting the wage series. The report did show, as it turned out, that

prices had risen after the controversial McKinley tariff of 1890 had gone into

effect, although it also showed that workers had prospered if a longer period

was considered. The work for the Aldrich Committee led to further studies of

prices by the Bureau of Labor. Beginning in 1902, the Bureau began

producing continuing series of wholesale prices and retail food prices. The

retail price series used weights from a survey of expenditures by working

class families undertaken in 1901 (Weiss 1955, p. 21).

index.

   The data produced for the Aldrich Committee was soon put to good

use by economists attempting to address the crucial issues of the day. The

inflation investigated by Jevons, produced by the discoveries of gold in

the 1850s and by the printing of the greenbacks during the Civil War, gave

way to deflation as more countries joined the gold standard and massive

new supplies of gold could not be found. The deflation, measured by a

modern consumer price index, averaged –3.5 percent per year from 1865

to 1879, when the United States returned to the gold standard, and then

averaged a milder –1.0 percent per year from 1879 until 1896, when new

supplies of gold reversed the trend (Carter et al. 2006, series CC2). The

deflation produced a long and bitter political debate. The Populists,

eventually led by William Jennings Bryan, claimed that debtors (they were

thinking first about farmers) had been hurt. The Populists wanted to

switch to a bimetallic monetary regime that would include both gold and

silver in the monetary base. The result, they believed, would be an

inflation that would reduce the real value of the farm debts that had been

made unfairly burdensome by the deflation.

   Were the Populist claims valid? The deflation had been ongoing for

several decades, and once it was anticipated, it would tend to produce,

some economists argued, lower nominal interest rates; farmers who had

signed mortgages after deflation was anticipated could not fairly claim that

they had been wronged by the gold standard. Moreover, rates on new

mortgages would reflect higher expected inflation after a switch to a

bimetallic standard. Enter Irving Fisher. In “Appreciation and Interest”


                                       6
(1896), one of the most influential papers in the history of economics,

Fisher explored the relationship between deflation and the rate of interest.

Fisher was not the first to propose that nominal interest rates adjust to

reflect expected price changes, but he produced the first thorough

theoretical and empirical study. Fisher examined a large body of data,

relying in part on Jevons’s data for the United Kingdom and the Aldrich

Committee’s data for the United States. He found that while the rate of

interest had fallen during periods of deflation, the adjustment was slow. As

a result, some borrowers had indeed been hurt by the deflation. But Fisher

also concluded that most loans then outstanding had been contracted

during a time when the downward trend in prices was well-understood,

and so for most outstanding loans, there was no injustice to be corrected

by inflation.

    Later, Fisher (1922) explored the best method of computing price

indexes. Fisher reviewed the indexes recommended by Jevons,

Laspeyres, Paasche, and others and subjected them to a battery of tests.

One concern was what to do about the problem that an index using

Laspeyres’s base-year-weighting normally differed from an index using

Paasche’s end-year-weighting. Marshall (1887) had suggested the chain-

weighted approach that government bureaus have used increasingly in

recent years. But when weights are only available at discrete intervals

something else must be done. Fisher famously concluded that a

geometric average of Laspeyres’s index and Paasche’s was “ideal.” 3

   An important use of the Bureau of Labor’s price data in a political

controversy came during the anthracite coal strike of 1902. The anthracite

fields of Pennsylvania provided coal to America’s eastern cities. The strike

brought mining to a halt and promised a very cold winter. President

Theodore Roosevelt made repeated efforts to mediate. Eventually, he got

the two sides to agree to abide by the recommendations of an Anthracite

Coal Strike Commission, constructed to balance the interests of the mine

owners and the miners. One of the key inputs in the Commission’s work

was information about food prices in the mining districts collected by the

Bureau of Labor. To provide convincing data, Commissioner Wright

flooded the mining districts with agents who collected reams of data. He

even authorized the hiring of interpreters because many of the miners

were foreign-born. In the end, the Strike Commission’s recommendations

appear to have been an attempt to split the difference between labor and

capital, but the compilation of data to decide what a “fair” increase in

wages would be was both an obvious move by an administration

determined to end the strike and an important precedent.

   Federal price indexes again became important in World War I. Wages

were controlled soon after the war began to hold down the cost of the vast

supply of materiel being purchased by the government, but it was

understood that wages would need to be raised with the “cost of living.”

The retail food price index was pressed into service as a tool for adjusting

wages set by government agencies. As early as May 1917, just one month




                                       8
after the United States entered the war, Irving Fisher wrote to Assistant

Secretary of Labor Louis F. Post suggesting that because food prices by his

reckoning rose about twice as fast as prices in general, about one-half of

the increase in the food price index would be the appropriate adjustment

for wages. Post countered that wages should be raised to the full extent of

the increase in the retail food price index (Goldberg and Moye 1985, pp.

102–103).

   Clearly, a food price index alone was not a sufficient basis for adjusting

wages. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as the Bureau of Labor was

renamed when it was moved to the newly established Department of

Labor in 1913, made its first foray into constructing a more comprehensive

index at the request of the Ship Building Labor Adjustment Board, which

had the job of setting wages in the shipyards. The BLS began by

conducting a survey of prices paid by workers in shipbuilding centers. In

June 1918, with the National War Labor Board calling for data on the

cost of living that covered the entire workforce, and with a substantial

emergency grant from President Wilson to finance the effort, the BLS

launched a national survey. The resulting report, issued in 1919, was

the BLS’s first report on the cost of living for the nation as whole. This

study provided the weights for the estimates of an index of the “cost of

living,” which continued to be published after the war (Goldberg and Moye

1985, pp. 102–105). Interest in the cost of living waned in the prosperous

1920s, and in the 1930s attention focused more on estimates of income

and employment. But the return of inflation and wage and price controls


                                       9
in World War II refocused attention on the cost of living index. Labor

leaders—George Meany of the AFL was especially vocal—claimed that

workers were hurt when the Bureau’s index was used to adjust wages

because it substantially understated the true increase in the cost of

living. Criticism of the index led to the appointment of the President’s

Committee on the Cost of Living by the War Labor Board. It was a

“tripartite committee” with representatives from labor, management, and

the public tasked with investigating the index. In January 1944, the labor

members issued a stinging indictment of the index. They argued that the

true increase in the cost of living between January 1941 and December

1943 was not 23.5 percent as the Cost of Living Index showed, but rather

43.5 percent. What were the errors? The cost of living index, the labor

members claimed, failed to take account of the many costs imposed on

workers and their families by the war. It did not properly account for the

shortage of household workers, the costs of moving to or commuting to

jobs in war production centers, higher taxes, quality deterioration, black

markets, discontinuance of the production of new consumer durables,

rationing, the elimination of sales, and “forced up-trading.”

   The last item, although unfamiliar today, was an important problem

that the Office of Price Administration, the agency that set prices for

consumer goods, confronted but never resolved. Manufacturers of

products as diverse as underwear and steel normally produced several

lines of merchandise: low-quality lines on which the profit margin per unit

was low but that the manufacturer could sell in large quantities, and


                                      10
higher-priced lines of higher quality goods sold in smaller quantities but

with higher margins per unit. With prices controlled and demand strong,

manufacturers could discontinue their lower-priced line, forcing consumers

to “trade up” to the higher-priced line while still claiming that they had not

raised their prices. The Office of Price Administration tried various

methods for dealing with the problem. For example, it issued regulations

that required clothing manufacturers to keep a weighted average of prices

of all lines below a maximum, but forced up-trading remained a headache

(Rockoff 1984, pp. 151–54).

   The claim that the true increase in the cost of living was nearly twice

as much as shown by the BLS index led to the appointment of a

nonpartisan committee of experts, chaired by Wesley Mitchell of the

National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and including Simon

Kuznets, then at the War Production Board, and Margaret Reid from the

Budget Bureau’s Office of Statistical Standards. The committee

exonerated the index. It found that the index in December 1943 was

understated by about 3 or 4 percent because of unmeasured quality

deterioration and by another 0.5 percent because smaller cities were not

represented. The committee agreed with labor that the war had imposed

many new costs on workers, but doubted that these special war-related

costs could be accurately measured, and thought that even if they could

be, they should not be included in the cost of living index. The committee

did endorse a change in name of the index from “cost of living” to

“consumer price,” the name we know it by today (Mitchell 1944; Rockoff


                                       11
1984, pp. 167–71).

   The accuracy of the index receded as a political issue when price and

wage controls were removed soon after World War II, but resurfaced

when the index began to be used in escalation clauses in contracts. The

United Auto Workers, for example, negotiated long-term contracts with

wages that escalated with the Consumer Price Index. Labor contended,

as it had in the war, that the index understated inflation. For example, the

index still did not include taxes. Management, on the other hand, argued

that the index failed to take quality improvements fully into account.

Although the accuracy of the index was not as pressing an issue as it had

been during the war because only part of the labor force was affected;

lots of money was at stake. Again, the beleaguered BLS appointed a

group of outside experts to investigate the Index and make

recommendations. The Price Statistics Commission, popularly known as

the Stigler Commission after its chair, economist George Stigler, delivered its

report in 1961 (National Bureau of Economic Research, Price Statistics

Review Committee 1961).

   The Commission was unsympathetic to most of the criticisms that

implied the index understated inflation. Taxes are an example. The case

for including taxes was straightforward: taxes are the prices paid for

services provided by government and should be included just as prices

paid for, say, private legal services. Indeed, George Stigler’s famous price

theory textbook said exactly that (Stigler 1966, 75 fn. 18). But the

Commission for a variety of reasons recommended that taxes be


                                       12
excluded. The Commission was more sympathetic to the notion that the

index overstated inflation because it did not take quality improvements

fully into account. One of the staff papers written for the Commission was

the well-known study by Zvi Griliches (1961) of automobile prices.

   Griliches, using hedonic methods, estimated the part of the upward

trend in automobile prices that was due to the incorporation of gradual

improvements. He concluded that the hedonic method was promising as a

research tool, although not yet ready for adoption. The problem of

unmeasured quality change due to technological improvement did not

end, of course, in the 1960s; it returned with a vengeance with the

development of the personal computer and information technology. The

Commission’s recommendations included establishing a regular schedule

of revisions for the weights, introducing new products more promptly, and

establishing a research division to develop methods for coping with quality

changes.




                                     13
                            National Income and Product

    There is a long history of attempts to measure national income, dating

back at least to the 1665 estimates made by William Petty (Coyle 2014, p.

8). 4 In the United States, the early estimates made by George Tucker

(1843) and Ezra Seaman (1846) have earned high praise from modern

students of national income accounting (Gallman 1961). Both relied

mainly on census data to produce estimates of population and income,

and both sets of estimates were created to address important political

issues.

    During the depression that followed the Panics of 1837 and 1839, a

number of states defaulted on their debts. Tucker (1843, 210–11) argued

that this was unnecessary: his state-level estimates of income

demonstrated that the states had ample means to repay their debts. Both

Tucker and Seaman, moreover, produced revised estimates after the

release of the 1850 census. Both also addressed the relative economic

strengths of the North and the South, obviously a comparison of crucial

importance as the crisis over slavery gathered momentum.

    The decisive push for regular publication of estimates of national

income came from intense debates over the distribution of income at the

turn of the 19th century. Shortly before the United States entered World

War I, Scott Nearing (1915) and Wilford Isbel King (1915) published

quantitative studies of the distribution of income and wealth. Both studies



4
  Kendrick (1970) provides an international history of attempts to measure national
income and product.

                                            14
highlighted the high degree of inequality prevailing in the United States.

Nearing’s book was not well-received by mainstream economists, who

thought it was not done carefully and was influenced too heavily by

Nearing’s leftist political views. However, King’s book was praised—for

example by Allyn Young (1916)—and proved to be of enduring influence.

King (1915, pp. 50–1) explained his purpose clearly: “Some of these

writers … contend that the past half century has been an era in which all

gains have been absorbed by a few plutocrats while the great masses of

the population have become poorer and poorer. Such arguments can only

be verified or disproved by a direct study of the facts …” For data, King

relied on the census, as had Tucker and Seaman. But he also utilized

death duties from Massachusetts and Wisconsin to construct Lorenz

curves of wealth. These showed that although wealth inequality was great

in the United States, it was less than in several industrialized European

countries.

   Like Nearing (1915), King (1915) estimated the shares of national

income going to the factors of production. King found a relatively stable

share of rent, refuting the claim that landowners were grabbing a larger

and larger share of the national income. The share of rent, moreover, was

barely able to cover the expenses of government in 1910, which implied

that a single tax on land as proposed by Henry George was infeasible.

King (1915, p. 160) did find a sharp decline in the share of wages and

salaries from 53.5 percent in 1890 to 46.9 percent in 1910. These numbers

might seem to confirm labor’s claim that exploitation of labor by capital


                                      15
had increased. But King (p. 163) argued that the decline in labor’s share

was due to the disappearance of free land in the West and the influx of

immigrants of “low efficiency.”

   King (1915) went on to calculate the real wage per employee. He found

a gratifying increase from 1870 to 1900, but then a decrease of about 2.5

percent between 1900 and 1910 (pp. 175–176). He was clear about the

cause: not robber barons, but immigrants. King (p. 179) concluded: “The

evidence, then, indicates that all the entrenchments of organized labor, all

the legislation in favor the working class, all of our new inventions have

failed to prevent the invaders from forcing down the commodity wages of

American labor.” I have dwelled on King, a forgotten figure, not to draw

attention to the beliefs and prejudices of an earlier generation of

economists, but rather to emphasize that national income accounting

grew out of highly charged political controversies over the distribution of

income—controversies remarkably similar to those that roil us today.

   In 1918, Irving Fisher delivered his presidential address to the

American Economic Association. Fisher described the dire condition of

the working class, backing up his description with statistics from King and

one of his own students. He then argued for tougher inheritance laws and

greater participation of the state in the financing and running of industry to

reduce inequality. The expansion of the federal government in World War

I proved that the government had the capacity to run the economy more

efficiently and more equitably than private business. Although Fisher

(1919, p. 10) favored a degree of socialism—“we are all socialists now”—


                                      16
he also warned about the danger of supporting extremists who favored

class warfare. Fisher’s embrace of socialism was not unusual. Republican

Warren Harding would easily win the 1920 Presidential election with his

call for a return to normalcy, but Socialist Eugene V. Debs would win

nearly a million votes—even though he was in jail at the time for urging

opposition to the draft.

   In the same address, Fisher (1919) suggested an endowment to

finance economic research that lay beyond the resources of any one

professor. The idea for such an endowment was in the air. For example, a

short-lived Bureau of Economic Research had been started in 1899,

directed by John R. Commons and financed by George H. Shibley, a

wealthy New York lawyer (Bureau of Economic Research 1900). It published

a number of quantitative studies, including the first comprehensive index

of US stock prices (Bishop 1965). But Shibley was mainly interested in

documenting deflation to support his case for bimetallism. Indeed, he wrote a

number of Populist tracts including a 700+ page tome called The Money

Question (1897). When the price level began to rise at the turn of the 19th

century, Shibley lost interest and stopped financing the Bureau.

   But Fisher got his wish for a research institution when the NBER was

established. The necessary entrepreneurship had come from a business

economist Malcolm C. Rorty and liberal economist Nahum I. Stone, then

at the US Tariff Commission. Rorty was impressed by Stone’s devotion to

objective facts and by Stone’s criticism of Nearing’s work on the

distribution of income (Fabricant 1961). Rorty then assembled a team of


                                      17
economists and business leaders who in June 1917 formed the

“Committee on the Distribution of Income,” which can be considered the

first name of the NBER. World War I delayed further action, but the

groundwork had been laid.

   The NBER was chartered in January 1920. Wesley Mitchell was

appointed its first leader, and Mitchell directed its first project: an estimate

of national income and its distribution. Mitchell assembled a team that

included King, Frederick R. Macaulay, and Oswald W. Knauth. The result

was a detailed set of estimates of national income and product that

led directly to the modern estimates produced by the federal government.

Income in the United States, Its Amount and Distribution, 1909–1919 was

published in two volumes (National Bureau of Economic Research, Mitchell,

et al. 1921). Nearly 600 pages in all, it far surpassed anything that had

come before in terms of the amount of data utilized     and the care taken in

thoroughly double-checking the component estimates. The study made a

clever use of the circular flow. King was tasked with estimating national

income from the payments-for-final-products side, and Knauth with estimating

it from the payments-for-productive-services side. The two estimates

turned out to be reassuringly close. The study identified and tried to

deal with many of the problems inherent in estimating national income

that continue to be sources of debate and criticism. For example, it

noted that its estimate of the national income in 1918 of $61 billion

did not include the monetary value of unpaid work in the household, which

probably amounted to “several billions” (National Bureau of Economic


                                       18
Research, Mitchell, et al. 1921, p. 143).

       Inequality was discussed in the penultimate chapter of the

summary volume. This chapter reviewed estimates of the distribution of

income by factor of production, estimates of the proportion the population

earning less than $2,000 per year (which is about $33,000 per year in

2018 dollars inflating with the consumer price index), and estimates by

Frederic Macaulay of the personal distribution of income in 1918 based on

the newly available income tax returns. The data revealed substantial

inequality: the share of income going to the top 1 percent was 14 percent,

and the share going to the top 10 percent was 35 percent. The

World Inequality Database (at https://wid.world/, accessed in September

2018), put these figures for 1918 at similar levels of 16 percent and 40

percent. The chapter on inequality in that first volume, true to the

principles of the NBER, does not end with rabble-rousing or policy

recommendations policy recommendations. Instead, it ends with a chart and an

explanation of a 1918 Lorenz curve.

       Although the report itself was just-the-facts, many economists at the time

thought that better data could contribute to the design of better legislation.

Indeed, Mitchell thought that economic data could do even more. Armed with

good data on the state of the economy, including perhaps “leading indicators,”

businesses could make wiser decisions about investment and employment. In

other words, the business cycle could be tamed with more and better data. The

NBER’s estimates of national income and product continued in the 1920s. But

they only appeared with a lag and so were of limited value in meeting the fast-


                                          19
changing economic circumstances of an economic depression, as would shortly

become clear.

       In 1930, Simon Kuznets, a student of Mitchell, took over the Bureau’s

project on national income. Kuznets did not invent the concept of national income

or national product, nor was he the first to measure them, but he greatly

advanced the field. Even a partial list of his achievements must include his

creativity in showing how data from a wide array of sources could be combined to

build persuasive estimates of national income and product; his investigations of

the economic and philosophical issues that bedevil the estimates; his

demonstration that many important questions about economic development can

be addressed with these estimates (the basis of his Nobel prize); and the role he

played as a model scholar-teacher for a generation of economists (Fogel, Fogel,

Guglielmo, and Grotte 2013).

       The economic catastrophe from 1929 to 1932 produced a US Senate

resolution, introduced by Senator Robert La Follette Jr., the Wisconsin

Progressive, calling on the Department of Commerce to provide estimates of

national income (Dorfman 1959, p. 669). The political point, clearly, was to justify

sweeping governmental economic initiatives. Kuznets was seconded to the

Department of Commerce to work on an official set of estimates. His first report,

submitted in January 1934, showed that national income halved between 1929

and 1932, and although the depth of the Depression was obvious by that time,

the report was still an important call to action. President Roosevelt cited the

figures, and later cited the updated figures that ran through 1937 when he sent a

supplemental budget to Congress in 1938 (Coyle 2014, pp. 12–13).


                                          20
       During World War II, Kuznets joined the War Production Board where he

used national income accounting to challenge the spending plans of the War and

Navy Departments. Kuznets and Robert Nathan (Kuznets’s student) argued that

the spending plans needed to be scaled back, both to prevent competition over

supplies from slowing production and to prevent an unacceptable decline in the

flow of final goods to consumers. Ultimately, the economists won the “feasibility

debate” and forced a cutback in the demands of the Army and Navy.

Counterfactual spending plans are hard to evaluate, but two careful students of

the feasibility debate have credited the economists with a crucial contribution to

the ultimate success of the US munitions program (Edelstein 2011; Lacey 2011).

       Kuznets was deeply concerned with the limitations of net national product

and related concepts as measures of welfare. He recognized, for example, that

improvements in education and healthcare were not measured adequately

because they were measured by costs, and he provided some speculative

estimates of how the growth of the net national product was affected by these

biases. Ultimately, however, he opted for excluding these speculations from his

final estimates.

       Military spending presented another problem. In one of his last

discussions of national income and product before US entry in World War II,

Kuznets (1941, pp. 19–20) explained that his estimates included “dreadnoughts,

bombing planes, poison gas, and patent medicines because they are rated

economic goods in our country today,” even though they “might well be

considered worthless and even harmful” in a society organized differently. In a

footnote, Kuznets (p. 31, fn. 5) used an analogy with private spending to buttress


                                         21
his case for including military expenditures: “If the activities of the private police

used by many large corporations are productive, why not those of the municipal

police? And if of the domestic police, why not of the international police, i.e., the

armed forces of the nation?” During World War II, however, Kuznets (1945)

modified his thinking. He argued that military spending should be counted in

national product during a time of total war, but it should be excluded during

peacetime because military spending was then an intermediary good for

producing a flow of consumption to consumers. Other economists, including

decisively those at the Department of Commerce, thought otherwise (Gilbert,

Staehle, Woytinsky, and Kuznets 1944).

       A number of economists, however, have found Kuznets’s concept of a

peacetime national Income to be attractive. Higgs (1992), for example, argued

that the then-current interpretation of the impact of World War II on the American

economy, that it created unprecedented prosperity, was reversed when one used

Kuznets’s peacetime concept rather than the conventional measure. Higgs even

took exception to Kuznets’s decision to include some military durables such as

aircraft in investment because Kuznets thought that they could later be turned to

peacetime purposes.

       In retrospect, a number of concerns weighed against adopting Kuznets’s

concept of peacetime national product. One reason, as Coyle (2014, p. 20)

suggests, was the rise of Keynesian economics. In principle, one could use

Kuznets’s peacetime version of national product to analyze the macroeconomy,

but the conventional measure fit more smoothly into the simple Keynesian model

taught to a generation of economics students in Samuelson and other textbooks.


                                           22
Perhaps the most important reason for rejecting Kuznets’s concept, however,

was the Cold War. In his famous study of productivity, Kendrick (1961, p. 25)

chose to include all defense spending in his estimates of national product partly

on the grounds that “national security is at all times [Kendrick’s italics] a prime

objective of economic organization.” In political terms, excluding national defense

from national product would create the appearance that the government’s

statistical agency was siding with the critics of America’s defense budget. Of

course, no one was required, as Kuznets had pointed out, to use only one

measure of aggregate product. To the contrary, Kuznets thought that it would be

best to produce a series of measures, some specialized for one purpose and

some for another. But as we have learned, public attention does tend to focus on

a single measure of national product, so the decision to ignore Kuznets’s

peacetime concept may have had important consequences.

                              Unemployment

       The federal unemployment statistics have in common with the price and

income statistics that they were born and lived in political controversy. Unlike the

price and income statistics, however, the contribution of economists to the

thinking about the measurement of unemployment was modest. Their major

contribution was mainly in suggesting methods for designing questionnaires and

sampling procedures. As Card (2011) put it, the unemployment statistics are

more of a case of “Measurement without Theory.”

       The first systematic collection of unemployment statistics in the United

States seems to have been a survey conducted by the Massachusetts Bureau of

the Statistics of Labor in 1878 (Keyssar 1986, pp. 1–5). The head of the Bureau,

as noted above, was Carroll D. Wright. Unemployment was running high as a

result of the depression that followed the Panic of 1873. Some estimates

circulating at the time put the number of unemployed in Massachusetts at

250,000. Wright surveyed local officials who were asked to report on the number

of men without work, but to report only those “who really want work,” a definition

of unemployment, obviously, that would make for a smaller number than one that

included discouraged workers. Wright seems to have been pleased with the

results of his survey, which showed at most about 30,000 unemployed workers.

This survey appears to be the beginning of an emphasis on people actively

seeking work. Close to a century and a half later, the question of whether

discouraged workers should be counted as unemployed in the headline

estimates of unemployment remains a highly charged political issue.


                                          24
       Questions about unemployment were included in each federal census

from 1880 to 1910. The lack of more frequent data was obviously a problem and

was felt acutely in 1914 when the outbreak of World War I sparked a financial

panic and economic contraction in the United States. The newly renamed Bureau

of Labor Statistics (BLS) attempted to estimate the level of unemployment. In

1916, working with agencies in New York, it produced “Unemployment in New

York City.” Working with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (which surveyed

its industrial policyholders), it produced “Unemployment in the United States.”

The latter study reported a high level of unemployment, which it attributed to

several factors including the policy of employers of keeping “40 men in line

outside the gates for every job that might open” and the immigrants pouring into

the country (Goldberg and Moye 1985, p. 97). In addition, the Bureau of Labor

Statistics began tracking and reporting levels of employment in several

industries.

       Questions about unemployment were dropped from the 1920 census.

The timing was unfortunate because the United States suffered a severe “V-

shaped” economic contraction in 1920–21. In response, President Harding

arranged a conference on unemployment (Hoover 1921). One key question, of

course, was the level of unemployment. The conference received contrasting

estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Employment Service.

       Before looking at the different estimates, a short digression on the

Employment Service is warranted, because its history displays the political and

economic forces at work. The idea of publicly funded employment offices to

match people seeking work with employers who needed workers had a long


                                         25
history in Europe. An employment service was established in Ohio in 1890, and

the idea soon was adopted in other states. The “Ohio idea” moved to the federal

level with the establishment of the Division of Information in the Bureau of

Immigration and Naturalization in 1907. Net immigration had reached a high of

767,000 in 1907, an addition of nearly 0.9 percent to the population (Carter et al.,

2006, series Aa7 and Ad22). Many workers and labor leaders complained that

the flow of immigrants was providing strike breakers and depressing wages. One

idea behind the Division of Information was to take the pressure off urban labor

markets on the east coast by finding jobs for immigrants in agricultural areas.

The Division set up the first federal employment office on Ellis Island in 1907

(Guzda 1983). World War I created an enormous demand for labor. The Division

of Information received a large infusion of funds so that it could aid in the

placement of war workers; and in recognition of its expanded role, its name was

changed to the US Employment Service.

       The Hoover Commission received two estimates of unemployment. The

Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated the “shrinkage of employment” to be 5.5

million (Goldberg and Moye 1985, p. 126). The BLS emphasized that because it

was surveying employers, all it could measure was whether employment had

risen or fallen. It didn’t know, for example, how many people were actively

seeking work as opposed to how many had decided to leave the labor force. The

US Employment Service provided an alternative estimate for September 1921 of

2.3 million for a restricted set of cities based on a survey of state and municipal

employment services, employers’ and employees’ organizations, and other

sources. The Commission’s Committee on Unemployment Statistics, which


                                          26
included several prominent economists, thought that the Employment Service’s

estimate was better, and after extrapolating it to reflect the country as a whole,

concluded that the number of unemployed workers was certainly no more and

probably less than 3.5 million. The retrospective estimate developed by David

Weir (1992), perhaps the best recent estimate, however, is 4.8 million in 1921,

much closer to the BLS figure (Carter et al. 2006, series Ba474).

       The Committee on Unemployment Statistics made several

recommendations for improving the unemployment statistics. For one thing, it

was especially skeptical about “reporting over the telephone” (Hoover 1921, p.

40). Interest in the rate of unemployment declined in the prosperous 1920s and

funding for the Employment Service dried up. 5 But another controversy over the

level of unemployment erupted soon after the stock market collapse in October

1929. On January 21, 1930, President Hoover announced that information

supplied to him by the Department of Labor showed that employment was rising

(New York Times, January 22, 1930, p. 1). Frances Perkins, New York State’s

Industrial Commissioner, publicly disagreed: her data from surveys of employers

in New York State showed that employment had continued to decline (New York

Times, January 23, 1930, p. 11; Perkins 2011, pp. 91–93).

       About six weeks later, Hoover reiterated his claim (New York Times,

March 7, 1930): “The low point of business and employment was the latter part of

December and early January. Since that time employment has been slowly



5 When Frances Perkins became Secretary of Labor in 1933, the feeling in the administration was
that the Employment Service had become merely a letterhead. Consequently, the First US
Employment Service was formally abolished in 1933 and a second one created. Later, its
programs were absorbed by the Education and Training Administration of the Department of
Labor. The employment service still receives funding, but the offices are located with the
Department of Labor's American Job Centers.
                                              27
increasing, and the situation is much better today than at that time.” To support

this claim, Hoover’s press release included a memorandum by Robert P. Lamont,

the Secretary of Commerce, and James J. Davis, the Secretary of Labor. It

included a weekly employment index, which apparently began in mid-December.

This index reached a trough of 86.0 on December 30 and then began a steady

rise. 6

          Hoover’s optimism again received a rebuke from Perkins (New York

Times, March 11, 1930), who complained that Hoover’s weekly figures were not

publicly available and guessed that they covered a limited set of firms capable of

reporting employment at a weekly frequency, and so were unrepresentative. The

publicly available monthly statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and her

statistics for New York State showed that the labor market continued to

deteriorate. Events soon confirmed Perkins’s pessimism. Her willingness to

challenge Hoover on this and subsequent occasions impressed Franklin

Roosevelt, then governor of New York, which helped to launch Perkins upon the

path to becoming the first woman to serve in a President’s cabinet.

          Questions about unemployment were asked in the 1930 census. The

initial findings, published in June 1930, indicated a rate of unemployment of

about 6.6 percent. But by the time the data was published, this seemed much too

low, and the Census Bureau was asked to do a follow up. This study, conducted

in 21 cities, showed unemployment rising from 9.7 percent at the time the 1930



6I have not located a source for the weekly statistics. However, an NBER monthly index of
automobile production shows increases from the previous month in January, February, March, and
April 1930. Also, an NBER monthly index of transportation workers shows an increase from
December 1929 to January 1930 (NBER series retrieved from FRED). Thus, it seems possible that
Department of Labor might have found some data to support its claims.
                                              28
census was conducted to 22.2 percent in January 1931. Other special surveys

were conducted during the 1930s, but it had become obvious that something

frequent and continuous was needed.

      Today we take it for granted that unemployment rates should be

estimated monthly by asking a random sample of people questions about

whether they are working, and if not, whether they are seeking work, along

with additional questions to learn about discouraged workers, parttime

work, and related topics. But it was not until 1940 that the Works Projects

Administration began a regular monthly survey of employment. The main

purpose of the Works Projects Administration was to create jobs, but many

of its projects, such as interviewing Americans born into slavery, turned out

to be of enduring value. The unemployment survey is another example.

When the Works Projects Administration was terminated in 1942, the

unemployment survey was turned over to the Census Bureau. In 1959,

responsibility for the survey was transferred to the Bureau of Labor

Statistics (Goldberg and Moye 1985, p. 166).

      Long after the Depression, economic historians would debate the “true”

rate of unemployment during the Great Depression. For some years, the

standard estimates were those constructed by Stanley Lebergott (1964).

Lebergott’s estimates were challenged in a well-known paper by Michael Darby

(1976), who maintained that Lebergott’s decision to count people working for

government relief programs produced an overstatement of the true amount of

unemployment and understated the rate of recovery in the mid-1930s. In 1936,

the year when the two series differ the most, Lebergott’s shows an


                                         29
unemployment rate of 17 percent while Darby’s shows an unemployment rate of

10 percent. Lebergott's figures were updated by Weir (1992) to take account of

Darby's critique and make other refinements. Margo (1993) provides an overview

of this controversy as well as an overview of a number of related issues raised by

the unique labor market experience of the 1930s.

      The monthly rate of unemployment became a much-watched statistic soon

after World War II ended. Many of the criticisms that have dogged the estimates

of unemployment in recent years had already surfaced by the late 1950s, such

as complaints by the AFL-CIO and others that discouraged workers were not

counted as unemployed in the headline number on which the media focused.

Taking a longer view, we are still debating who should be counted as

unemployed, an issue that influenced the construction of that first unemployment

survey conducted by Carroll D. Wright in 1878.




                                        30
                                    Conclusions


   The major federal statistical series are one of the great achievements

of economics. True, the federal statistics have not fulfilled the highest

hopes that economists had for them such as providing an early warning

system for financial panics and economic contractions, as we learned in

2008. Economists have some ideas about where the fault lines lie: for

example, they know that there have been more panics in the United

States than in Canada, and they suspect that this will hold in the future

(Bordo, Redish, and Rockoff 2015). But economists, like seismologists,

cannot yet predict when and where the next earthquake will occur despite

the vast amount of data they have collected and studied. Indeed, the

regular production of these statistics has not resolved the divisive political

debates—such as the debates over the impact of monopolies and

immigration on the distribution of income—that called them into being.

   A case could be made, I believe, that the federal economic statistics

contributed to the development of the macroeconomic policies that were

deployed with some success after the last financial panic. We engaged in deficit

spending and monetary expansion based partly on statistics-heavy research by

economists. It also seems likely that the federal statistical series have been of

considerable value to the private sector. Most private business plans depend in

some measure on ideas about where the economy is headed. A manufacturing

firm deciding whether to expand production, a financial firm deciding whether to

invest in real estate, or a service provider deciding whether to hire more workers,
                                         31
all must make some allowance for the general economic weather. Trends can

change unexpectedly, but trends projected from accurate data are more likely to

be right than trends based on intuition or the prognostications of uninformed

pundits.

   Although the role that economic statistics have played in improving the

functioning of the economy has been less than was hoped, it seems to me that

the development of federal economic statistics has made for less strident and

more reasoned debates. Extreme claims about the state of economy can be

rejected by pointing to economic statistics produced by the federal government

that are widely regarded as sound, if imperfect; and that contribution is clearly

important.
