We develop a theory of career paths and earnings in an economy in which agents organize in
production hierarchies. Agents climb these organizational hierarchies as they learn stochastically
from other individuals. Earnings grow over time as agents acquire knowledge and occupy
positions with larger numbers of subordinates. We contrast these and other implications of the
theory with U.S. census data for the period 1990 to 2010. The model matches well the Lorenz
curve of earnings as well as the observed mean experience-earnings profiles. We show that the
increase in wage inequality over this period can be rationalized with a shift in the distribution of
the complexity and profitability of technologies relative to the distribution of knowledge in the
population.

          We develop a theory of career paths and earnings in an economy in which agents
      organize in production hierarchies. Agents climb these organizational hierarchies as they
      learn stochastically from other individuals. Earnings grow over time as agents acquire
      knowledge and occupy positions with larger numbers of subordinates. We contrast
      these and other implications of the theory with U.S. census data for the period 1990
      to 2010. The model matches well the Lorenz curve of earnings as well as the observed
      mean experience-earnings pro…les. We show that the increase in wage inequality over
      this period can be rationalized with a shift in the distribution of the complexity and
      pro…tability of technologies relative to the distribution of knowledge in the population.




1. Introduction


  This paper develops a new model of an economy that generates sustained productivity
growth. One distinctive feature of the model is that all knowledge in the economy is held
by the individual people who comprise it: there is no abstract technology hovering above
them in the ether. A second feature, necessarily involving heterogeneous labor, is a kind
of complementarity in production involving people with di¤erent skill levels: the marginal

tions and conferences for helpful comments.


                                                   1
product of any one person is contingent on the people he works with. A third feature, closely
related to the second, is that improvements over time in individual skill levels depend on
imitation or stimulation or inspiration from other people in the economy. All growth is
taken to arise from this force.
  Mathematically we will study the behavior of a continuum of agents, each with di¤erent
skill levels. Production at any date will depend on the way people are organized, on which
tasks are assigned to which people at di¤erent skill levels. Production increases by any one
person will depend on the knowledge of the people with whom he interacts. We add to
these features a cohort structure with a stationary birth and death process. The resulting
model then has the familiar ingredients of human capital theory and so invites comparisons
to census cross-section evidence and age-earnings pro…les, to panel evidence on individual
careers over time. After working out the logic of the model, then, we address some of these
empirical challenges.
  We begin in Section 2 with a static model built on the hierarchical structures pioneered
by Garicano (2000) and Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2004, 2006). These models describe
a very speci…c complementarity among agents of di¤erent productivity types. Agents can
contribute to production as workers or else as managers to whom a worker can turn for
help with a problem that is too hard for him to solve on his own. Each manager can review
several unsolved problems that are passed up to him. Those problems that are within the
manager’s ability are then solved by the worker with his advice. Unsolved problems at this
higher layer can be passed up to managers with still higher abilities, and so on.
  One can think of successive layers of managers. Caliendo, Monte, and Rossi-Hansberg
(2015) identify di¤erent occupations within a data set of French …rms with these theoretical
layers, and show that changes in …rms’ actual occupational structure are well correlated
with theoretical changes. It seems natural to think of these complementarities as organized
into …rms, as in this example, but one can also think of these managers as independent con-
sultants, and workers as buyers of consultant services. What matters for overall production
is not the corporate structure in place but the assignment of people of diverse skill levels to
di¤erent roles in the production process.

                                              2
  For our purposes, the census evidence covers the entire economy and we need a theory at
a general equilibrium level. Since our focus is on the labor market, we want to determine the
prices— earnings or wages— of people at every skill level. We view every agent as endowed
with a given type, which we identify as the goods he could produce on his own.1            In
the hierarchical model we use here, given types are central too but until we know the
occupational structure we can’t determine earnings. A general equilibrium must be solved
to connect types and earnings.
  The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We begin with the static problem of
solving for equilibrium wages and productivity. In Section 2 we set out the notation for
this model, work out the assortative matching linking workers and managers, and de…ne
the hierarchy that we work with. In Section 3 we formulate and study the problem of an
idealized planner who wants to maximize total goods production. The planner assigns some
agents to be workers, others to be managers, and de…nes the matching function connecting
them. Then in Section 4 we decentralize this planning problem to obtain a competitive
equilibrium in which the earnings of all managers and workers are determined. In this
modeling of assigning agents to tasks, only agents’skill levels matter for earnings. The time
and e¤ort that may have led to those levels— years of schooling, age, luck, or any other
qualities— are immaterial.
  The framework we propose has two key di¤erences relative to the previous work by
Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2004, 2006). First it features distributions of skills and
problems with unbounded support. Second, and perhaps more important, we assume that
problems that are harder to solve also yield higher output. These two features are essential
to introduce dynamics and growth into our theory since they facilitate the incorporation of
knowledge di¤usion in a setup that features a balanced-growth path. We do this in Section
5 where we introduce some dynamics into this model. We introduce a …xed demography,
learning, and a cohort structure. Then we interpret the static model developed in Sections
2-4 as cross-sections evolving along a balanced growth path. With these elaborations, we
connect the distribution of types studied in Sections 3 and 4 to age-earnings pro…les.
  1
      We refer to the type of the agent interchangeably as his skill or knowledge level.


                                                       3
  As in Lucas (2009), we interpret age-earnings pro…les as outcomes of a balanced growth
path with a constant growth rate driven by a process of learning from others. An agent is
identi…ed by his type and at any date there is a distribution of types. Agents learn— improve
their types— by interacting with people some of whom have higher types than their own.
The type distribution has a Pareto tail, ensuring that every agent will always …nd someone
who knows more than he does. In the balanced growth path, an agent’s career path starts
at the bottom of the hierarchy and evolves over time taking him to higher management
positions, with more subordinates, and higher wages. These transitions depend on his
learning, which is stochastic, and on the distribution of knowledge in the economy. The
learning process we use implies that the distribution of knowledge shifts over time, but
maintains its shape and the thickness of its tail.
  In this paper, however, the type distribution does not, by itself, de…ne production in the
economy or its age-earnings pro…les. For this we need a second distribution, describing the
di¢ culty of the problems that agents are asked to solve. If these problems were held …xed
over time while agent’s skills kept improving, all agents would eventually be able to solve
virtually all the problems that confront them and there would be no need for a hierarchy.
In the same way, a problem distribution that moved too fast to the right would eventually
eliminate production. Using the language of Goldin and Katz (2007), the race of skills and
technology would be won by one side or the other. In order to maintain a balanced growth
we need to rule out these possibilities. Throughout, though, we are silent about the source
of the evolution of the problem distribution and just assume that it evolves in a manner
that guarantees the existence of a balanced growth path.
  In Section 6 we show how we calibrate the model to …t the fraction of managers and
the distribution of earnings in 1990 and discuss several comparative statics exercises. In
Section 7 we compare the balanced growth properties of the calibrated model to age-earnings
pro…les, as well as the dispersion of the wage distribution across age classes. The model is
able to …t the observed age-earnings pro…le quite well, although it cannot account for the
increase in dispersion of wages for older agents. This pattern was also hard to …t in models
without a hierarchical structure, such as Lucas (2009).

                                              4
  We …nish our analysis in Section 8 where we show that, in the calibrated the model, shifts
in the distribution of the complexity of problems relative to the distribution of knowledge
can account well for the increase in wage inequality between 1990 and 2010. The results
suggest a cause for the evolution of wages during this period: New technologies that only
the most knowledgeable experts can utilize but that also pay more than in the past. The
evidence seems to suggest that this technological change was not accompanied by a similar
shift in the distribution of knowledge in the population. This technological change leads to
relatively large changes in the wage distribution but, in our calibration, to modest declines
in de-trended output. Section 9 o¤ers some …nal remarks.


2. Planning Problems: Examples


  We consider a closed economy in which people of di¤erent types are employed to produce
a single consumption good. Everyone is endowed with one unit of work time. The labor
force is de…ned by a cdf F (z) (density f ) on (0; 1) ; where z indexes a person’s skill level.
Call F the population distribution. An idealized planner organizes these people so as to
maximize total production, given a production technology. This technology is modeled
closely on earlier work by Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg but some of the details are new
and we will provide a self-contained description.
  First consider production under autarky. Every agent z uses his unit of time to generate
a production possibility that involves taking a draw from a distribution of problems, de…ned
by a cdf G(z) (density g) which we call the problem distribution. If he draws y         z then
he produces y units of the good, which is to say he solves the problem given to him. If he
draws y > z he produces nothing. We think of many people at each z level, who produce
           Rz
the average 0 yg(y)dy: Total production at all levels z is then
                                   Z       1Z z
                                                  yg(y)dyf (z)dz:
                                       0     0

The remaining problems,
                                   Z       1Z 1
                                                  yg(y)dyf (z)dz
                                    0        z



                                                    5
are simply discarded. In this example, the planner does nothing except collect all the
goods that are individually produced. Clearly, knowledge is not optimally employed; more
knowledgeable agents solve the same set of problems than less knowledgeable ones.
  Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg propose a second role for agents, which we adopt here. Call
the agents who generate problems and produce on their own, as described above, workers.
Other agents, whom we call managers, can be used as advisors, using their time to help
workers to solve some of the problems that they themselves could not solve. We assume
that each manager can review         1 unsolved problems with his endowed unit of time. A
problem y that is reviewed by a manager z will be solved if y                 z and otherwise will remain
unsolved. In this more complicated situation, the planner must determine which agents
are workers and which are managers and he needs to assign                      unsolved problems to each
manager. We emphasize that no one in this economy, worker, manager, or planner, knows
how di¢ cult an individual problem is unless he either generates the problem himself and
can solve it or he reviews the problem himself and knows how to enable the worker who
drew the problem to solve it. Understanding the di¢ culty of a problem is thus equivalent
to knowing how to solve it.
  Consider then a second example in which agents z 2 [0; zw ] are assigned to be workers
and the rest, z 2 (zw ; 1) ; are assigned to be managers in an economy. Suppose the planner
chooses a cuto¤ zw and a continuous, increasing matching function ' : [0; 1) ! (zw ; 1)
that together satisfy
                                           Z   y
                 [F ('(y))    F (zw )] =           [1       G(z)] f (z)dz; all y 2 [0; zw ]:        (2.1)
                                           0

The right side is the number of problems that people in [0; y) cannot solve on their own.
The left side is the number of problems that the assigned managers in ('(0) = zw ; '(y)]
can review. That is, equation (2.1) guarantees that there are enough managers to deal
with all the problems generated by workers: a sort of market clearing of problems. Clearly,
generating problems that will not be reviewed, or allocating unemployed management time,
is not optimal. An optimal allocation necessarily satis…es (2.1).
  Now suppose that zw is chosen so that every unsolved problem in [0; zw ] is reviewed by

                                                        6
exactly one manager in (zw ; 1) and that all managers are so employed. Then equation
(2.1) would imply
                                                               Z   zw
                                                           1
                                 1       F (zw ) =                      [1       G(z)] f (z)dz:                               (2.2)
                                                               0

In this case, total production would become
                        Z zw Z z                  Z                              zw   Z   '(z)
                                 yg(y)dyf (z)dz +                                                yg(y)dyf (z)dz               (2.3)
                            0        0                                       0        z
                          Z     zw   Z   '(z)
                     =                           yg(y)dyf (z)dz
                            0        0

This is a feasible plan, but is it optimal?
  The reason this plan might not be optimal is that all problems above '(z) for z 2
(0; zw ] are discarded. Could it be the case that the planner prefers to have some of the
more knowledgeable agents deal with the problems that the less knowledgeable managers
discard? Maybe it is optimal to have managers solve other manager’s discarded problems.
To allow for this possibility, let z1 = '(zw ) and impose the following condition for managers
performing this role,
                                         Z   y
                                                     1     G (z)
          F ('(y))       F (z1 ) =                                  f (z)dz;                 for all y 2 (zw ; '(zw )]:
                                          zw     1       G(' 1 (z))

The right side is the number of problems that managers in (zw ; y) cannot solve (conditional
on workers below them not being able to solve them either, 1                                           G('   1 (z)))   and thus are
passed up to managers in the second layer, (z1 ; y). Again, if this condition is not satis…ed,
a manager’s time is clearly not allocated e¢ ciently.
  In general, a matching function that includes agents that solve the problems discarded
by i + 1 groups of agents will have to satisfy
                                 Z y
                                        1 G (z)
           F ('(y)) F (zi+1 ) =                     f (z)dz, for all y 2 [zi ; zi+1 ]                                         (2.4)
                                  zi 1   G(' 1 (z))

where
                                          zi+1 = '(zi ) for i = 1; 2; :::                                                     (2.5)

Following the practice of Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg we refer to the intervals (zi ; zi+1 )
with z0 = zw as managerial layers, denoted L1 ; L2 ; :::

                                                                   7
  All of these task assignments of the given labor force F (z) are feasible, as are many other
assignments not yet discussed.2 But which, if any, of these can maximize total production?
This question is answered in Section 3.


3. Planning Problems: Optimality


  To consider all possible assignments we need a better notation. Let Zw                                          [0; 1) denote
the set of agents that the planner assigns to the role of generating problems (workers). Let
Zm          [0; 1) denote the set of managers with subordinates and a manager above them. Let
Ze         [0; 1) denote the set of top managers without a manager above them (whom we call
entrepreneurs). Note that Zw \ Zm = ? and Zm \ Ze = ? but Zw \ Ze could be non-empty
since some workers might be self-employed. Furthermore, Zw [ Zm [ Ze = [0; 1): all agents
belong to one of these sets.
  As shown in Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006), the production process described above
implies a technology that is supermodular in the talent of an agent and its subordinates.
This implies that the assignment function, ' : (Zw nZe ) [ Zm ! Zm [ Ze ; is monotone
increasing. With some abuse of notation let '(Z) denote the set of managers assigned to a
set of agents Z:
  The problem of a planner is then given by
                                 Z        Z   1                               Z      Z   1
                                                                                                      g (y)
                max                               yg (y) dyf (z)dz                           y                  dyf (z)dz; (3.1)
  f'( )g(Zw nZe )[Z;Zw ;Zm ;Ze       Zw   0                                     Ze   z           1   G(' 1 (z))

         For example, in all the examples above we assumed that agents generating problems are the least knowl-
edgeable ones and that the interval of workers is connected. Clearly, there exists other feasible allocations
that do not satisfy these properties.




                                                                        8
where the …rst term in the objective function (3.1) is the value of all the generated problems
if all of them are solved, and the second term is the value of the discarded problems. The
constraints just replicate the ones we introduced in equations (2.1), (2.4) and (2.5). Note
that, given the sets Zw , Zm , and Ze , the two constraints (3.2) and (3.3) fully specify the
assignment function '. Hence, the problem of the planner can be reduced to choosing the
sets of agents that become workers, managers, and entrepreneurs.
  In this section we report what we can establish about the solution to this planning
problem. The next theorem shows that in the optimal allocation, the sets of workers,
managers (if non-empty) and entrepreneurs are connected and ordered by their skill level,
where workers are the least skilled agents and entrepreneurs the most skilled ones. The
results allows us to eliminate many feasible allocations as solutions. All proofs are relegated
to the Appendix.

  Theorem 1. Suppose that F ( ) and G ( ) are di¤erentiable. Then any solution to the
planning problem is characterized by a matching function ' ( ) ; and a pair of thresholds
zw and ze such that Zw = [0; zw ], Zm = [zw ; ze ], Ze = [ze ; 1). If Zm 6= ? then zw < ze ;
otherwise, zw = ze .

  The proof of Theorem 1 relies on the next three lemmas.

  Lemma 1: Let (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solve the planner’s problem. Then for " su¢ ciently
small [0; ") * Zw \ Ze :

  Lemma 2: Let (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solve the planner’s problem. Then if zm 2 Zm and
ze 2 Ze we have zm < ze :

  Lemma 3: Let (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solve the planner’s problem. Then z 2 Zw implies
that z     z 0 for all z 0 2 Zm [ Ze .

  Together, these three lemmas imply that the optimal allocation is such that Zw ; Zm ; Ze
are ordered with Zw        Zm      Ze ; where Zm is potentially empty.3 This implies that in any
optimal allocation with a maximum number of layers L, the set of hierarchies active in the
  3
      We use Zw   Zm    Ze to mean that for any zw 2 Zw , any zm 2 Zm ; and any ze 2 Ze , zw   zm   ze:



                                                    9
allocation has either L or L       1 layers. For example, in an economy where the maximum
number of layers is 3, there cannot be any self-employed agents working on their own, a
feature also present in Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006).
  Theorem 1 implies that the problem of the planner can then be rewritten as
                           Z zw Z 1                  Z 1Z 1

A solution to the planning problem is thus fully described by a matching function '( ) :
[0; ze ] ! [zw ; 1) and two cuto¤s (zw ; ze ) :
  As we mentioned above, for any pair of cuto¤s we can construct the matching function
' using (3.5) and (3.6). That is, provided that F ( ) is strictly increasing, we have
                                        Z
               1                       1 y
    '(y) = F      F (min fzw ; ze g) +     [1 G(z)] f (z)dz , all y 2 [0; min fzw ; ze g]

              1                                                           1 G(z)
  '(y) = F         F (' (min fzw ; ze g)) +                                          f (z)dz          ,
                                                         minfzw ;ze g   1 G(' 1 (z))

Moreover, if we assume that F ( ) is di¤erentiable then ' ( ) is continuous and di¤erentiable
except possibly at min fzw ; ze g, where there is a kink in the matching function if                              6= 1.
  In light of these facts, our task is to …nd the cuto¤s (zw ; ze ) that solve the planning
problem. We …rst consider the situation where there are no intermediate managers, or
where Zm = ?. In this case, zw = ze and only one cuto¤ needs to be determined. Note

                                                               10
further than in this case '(zw ) = 1 and so (3.5) implies, for y = zw , that equation (2.2)
holds. That is,
                                                               Z       zw
                                                           1
                                    1    F (zw ) =                          [1   G(z)] f (z)dz:
                                                                   0
Clearly, violating this constraint is not optimal since it implies that either too many prob-
lems are generated, or there is excess managerial capacity to review problems. Lemma 4 in
the appendix makes this argument precise. Hence, when zw = ze ; equation (2.2) determines
the value of zw that maximizes output. In turn, '( ), is determined by (3.5) for y < zw :
  Focus next on the case where Zm 6= ? and so zw < ze . Then we can restate the problem
of the planner as
            Z zw Z          1                                  Z    1Z 1

We have shown in Lemmas 1-4 that an optimal plan must satisfy (3.7) - (3.9). We now add

  Theorem 2. Suppose that F ( ) and G ( ) are di¤erentiable. Then there is a pair (zw ; ze )
that satis…es (3.6) - (3.8).

  This argument is not constructive and does not address uniqueness, so in the Appendix
we describe the numerical algorithm we use to calculate maxima. In particular, we compare
solutions in which all problems are eventually solved and so ze = 1 and solutions in which
ze is …nite and so some problems are optimally discarded. We also solve the case with
zw = ze . We can then compare total production in these allocations and easily compute
the maximum.


4. Decentralized Equilibrium


  The planning problem studied in Section 3 was a step toward obtaining a competitive
equilibrium. To this end, we next describe a decentralization of the planner’s allocation

                                                                       11
('( ); zw ; ze ), given F; G and . We are looking for a wage function that gives incentives
to …rms to build the same production teams as the planner. Given that agents are income
maximizers, they just choose the job that is willing to pay more for their services, conditional
on their skill.
  We consider organizations de…ned by a single worker z 2 [0; zw ] that hires managers at
levels
                                       '(z); ' ('(z)) = '2 (z); :::; 'L (z)

where L denotes the maximum number of layers. This organization generates one problem
with an expected return of
                                                 Z   'Lz (z)
                                                               yg(y)dy
                                                 0

where 'L (z) is the top manager matched to worker z. We need to price the labor time of
these managers w('i (z)); i = 1; :::; L, and the residual value w(z) of worker z: The units of
manager-of-layer-i’s time that the …rm of worker z hires, ni (z); is equal to the fraction of
problems that subordinates one layer below cannot solve, relative to the number of problems
a manager can handle, : That is,

                                          1    G('i      1 (z))
                              ni (z) =                            ,   all i = 1; :::; L:                   (4.1)

Let L be the maximum number of managerial layers consistent with the planner’s solution
('( ); zw ; ze ): Firms in such an economy can then have either L or L                         1 layers.
  The pro…t of an organization with worker z 2 [0; zw ] and Lz layers is given by

                          Z   'L (z)                 Lz
                                                     X  1        G('i    1 (z)))

                          0                          i=1

The problem of this organization is

                                              w(z) = max              (z):                                 (4.2)

The associated …rst order conditions are

                                    g(z)
                   w0 (z) =                w('(z));                                                     (4.3)
                                      g('i (z))
               w0 ('i (z)) =                      w('i+1 (z)) for i = 1; :::; Lz              1;

             w0 ('Lz (z)) =                                 'Lz (z)g('Lz (z)):
                                    1     G('Lz    1 (z))

  The equilibrium wage schedule w(z) is therefore calculated by solving the following dif-
ferential equations, starting from the last layer in the economy, L,

                                  g(z)
                    w0 (z) =             w('(z))                     for     z 2 [0; zw ];              (4.4)
                                 g(z)
                    w0 (z) =                w('(z)) for z 2 [zw ; ze ];
                             (1 G(' 1 (z)))
                                g(z)z
                    w0 (z) =                       for z 2 [ze ; 1):
                             1 G(' 1 (z))

The matching function and the cuto¤s ('( ); zw ; ze ) are given by the solution to the plan-
ner’s problem. The choice of Lz is a discrete choice problem that also coincides with the
hierarchies present in the planner’s allocation, namely L                   1 or L.
  Workers with knowledge given by 'i (0); i = 1; :::; L; should be indi¤erent between working
in layer i   1 or layer i, since otherwise some agents close to them would like to work for
a di¤erent employer which would imply that '( ) cannot be continuous. Since the planner
chooses a continuous matching function '( ), in equilibrium the wage function needs to be
continuous as well. Hence,

                                 lim w(z) = lim w(z) all i = 1; :::; L:                                 (4.5)

Furthermore, the pro…ts of the least productive worker/organization                      (0) have to be equal
to zero since workers are the residual claimants of the …rm. Namely,
                   Z    'L (0)               L
                                             X 1       G('i     1 (0))

The conditions in (4.5) and (4.6) provide the L initial conditions that we need to solve the
system of …rst order di¤erential equations in (4.4).

  It should be clear that what we have called an “organization” in this section is only
one of many possibilities. Our choice to consider organizations de…ned by a single worker
z 2 [0; zw ] was adopted only as a convenience. This is a constant returns competitive
equilibrium model in which pro…ts are zero. We have developed a production technology
involving a speci…c kind of complementarity about workers with di¤erent skill levels, not a
theory of the …rm. In equilibrium individual earnings depend jointly on an agent’s type and
on the way he contributes to the productivity of others. This is all internalized— there are
no external e¤ects— but there are no distinctions between …rms of di¤erent sizes or between
employees and consultants.


5. Age-Earnings Pro…les: Theory


  We have developed a Garicano/Rossi-Hansberg type model that generates a model of
individual earnings for the economy as a whole, w(z). Now we merge these ideas with a
model that admits strati…cation by age and other attributes. The knowledge distribution
F now evolves over time, so we write F (z; t); and we introduce a family of cohort type
distributions H(z; s; t); interpreted as the probability that a person of age s at date t will
have a type no larger than z.
  The addition of calendar time to the distributions F and H and, as we will see, to a
problem distribution G(z; t); will set the stage for a model of growth. We suppose that age


                                                      14
is continuously distributed on s 2 [0; 1] with stationary distribution                                         (s). In particular
we assume a continuous arrival model of di¤usion of ideas, in which agents have                                            (s)ds
meetings per unit of time that take the form of draws from individuals of all ages. An agent
z who engages with an agent of type z 0 emerges from the match with type max(z; z 0 ). If h
is a time interval, then the probability that a person of age s + h who was born at t                                      s has
productivity less than or equal to z is                4

integrating this last expression from t                    s to t we get

  It is convenient for our purposes to assume that the distributions                                                   are Fréchet , so that


                                                                                         1=

The Fréchet distributions have the property that they will be preserved under the operations
we use. As long as the parameter                is positive, individual careers will involve learning from
others and on average older workers will have higher z values than younger ones. Then

So F (z; t) is the average of Fréchet distributions, with the invariant distribution of types in
the balanced growth path       ( ) given by

                                            0

Given this invariant distribution of types in the balanced growth path, we will assume
that the problem distribution is also an average of Fréchet distributions with potentially
a di¤erent location parameter, K; but with the same tail parameter . The value of K
measures the location of the distribution of problems relative to the distribution knowledge

6. Calibration and Comparative Statics


  The implications of the decentralized model of Section 4 involve only types z and the
implied earnings w(z). They do not depend on age, schooling levels, or other individual
characteristics. Given information on the population F; the problems G that agents must
solve in order to produce, and the ability       of managers to advise in solving harder problems,
we can determine the occupations and earnings of everyone in the economy. Here we use the
F (z; t) and G (z; t) ; that satisfy the balanced growth conditions discussed in the previous
section. So let
                                     F ( (t) z; t) =      (z)

and
                                     G(K (t) z; t) =       (z)

That is, as discussed above, we assume that the shape parameter          of the underlying cohort
distributions is the same for the knowledge and problem distribution. This facilitates some
of the intuition of the comparative statics and given that we are not addressing the economic
underpinnings of the distribution of problems G, any other choice would have been arbitrary
as well. We also assume an economy on a balanced growth path, with                   (t) = e   t   and
K(t) = K e t . Hence, F (z; t) =      ze     t    and G (z; t) =   (K   ze   t ).   On the balanced
growth path, then, the distribution of knowledge and problems grow at the same rate, .
That is, on a balanced growth path, the race between knowledge and technology is always
tied.
  We calibrate the model by setting K = 0:59;            = 0:28; and    = 1:2: These parameters,
together with C and     ; are chosen to match the degree of inequality as measured by the
U.S. Lorenz curve in 1990, the observed number of …rst layer managers in the data, and the
mean of the wage distribution across experience levels. We discuss these statistics and the
earnings data in the next section.
  Figures 1 to 6 show the resulting matching and wage functions for this parameter con…g-
uration, as well as the corresponding equilibria when we vary , K and : In Figures 1, 3,
and 5 we show the relation of types F (z) (on the horizontal axis) to the managers assigned

                     to them, F ('(z)) : The small circles identify F ('(0)) ; F ('('(0))) ; etc. Using our baseline
                     parameter values implies that 63% of individuals are workers (F ('(0)) = 0:63) which is
                     approximately consistent with the evidence in Caliendo, et al. (2015) in French manufac-
                     turing, although somewhat larger than what we observe for the whole U.S. economy (about
                     50%). Figure 1 also shows that F ('('(0)))                                    F ('(0)) = 0:92                 0:63 = 0:29 is the fraction

                     increases the number of workers. It also raises the earnings of all workers and many man-
                     agers, although not all of them. Some of the top agents command lower wages since their
                     talent is less scarce. Overall, an increase in                           increases output and reduces wage inequality.

                       In Figures 3 and 4 we present comparative statics with respect to the location of the
                     distribution of problems, K, relative       to the distribution of knowledge.6 Higher KStudent

                     that problems are more complicated to solve, relative to the available knowledge in the
                     economy, and also pay more. The result is that the number of workers declines and the

                            The means of the distribution of problems and knowledge are both growing at rate                                           . A change in
                     K generates a one time shift in the mean of the distribution of problems beyond the constant drift in the
                     mean. Hence, with a rise in K, technology becomes more complicated and pro…table permanently relative
                     to knowledge in the balance growth path.

number of managers increases. Furthermore, the wages of workers decline since the relative
value of generating versus solving problems declines. Inequality at the the bottom of the
distribution tends to decrease, but at the very top it increases since more problems require
the skill of the very best experts. These experts are the ones that obtain the big gains from
the more pro…table and complicated problems.
  The implications of a rise in K are reminiscent of the evidence for the U.S. labor market
during the last few decades, as documented by Acemoglu and Autor (2013). An increase in
K leads to an increase in output only if there are enough talented agents in the population
to take care of the more complicated problems, namely, if K is relatively low or       is high
enough. Otherwise, it can lead to a decline in output since high-z problems, although more
pro…table, cannot be solved by a large fraction of agents and so, on average, require more
managerial time. We return to changes in K in Section 8 where we argue that a change in K;
on its own, can go a long way towards rationalizing the observed changes in cross-sectional
wages in the U.S. economy between 1990 and 2010.
  The last comparative static we analyze here involves the tail parameter of the distribution
of knowledge and the distribution of problems. An increase in increases the mass in the tail
of these distributions and so increases the availability of hard and pro…table problems as well
as the availability of agents that can solve them. Because, by assumption, we are changing
both distributions in the same manner, the matching across agents when measured in terms
of their position in the distribution hardly changes (see Figure 5). The perceived changes
are the result of increases in the optimal number of layers of management. As is evident in
Figure 6, an increase in    decreases the wages of workers and increases that of managers.
A higher   implies that the best managers face, and can solve, more complicated problems
that pay more. An increase in the tail parameter of the distribution has a similar e¤ect to
an increase in K on the distribution of wages, although it has only minor e¤ects on agent’s
occupational choices. It leads to lower wage inequality among workers but higher inequality
across managers. Worker’s time becomes less valuable since there are more knowledgeable
agents that can solve the problems they cannot solve. An increase in       also increases total
output as it makes problems more pro…table but not more di¢ cult relative to the knowledge

                     7 shows the Lorenz curves for 1990 and 2010, together with three alternative calibrations of
                     our model when we let K vary between 0:49 and 0:69. Clearly, the calibration that matches
                     the Lorenz Curve in 1990 quite precisely is the one for K = 0:59 which is the value we chose
                     for our benchmark calibration. As we argued above, increases in K can generate changes
                     in the Lorenz curves similar to the ones observed in the data. Namely, it increases overall
                     wage inequality, but it reduces income dispersion at the bottom of the income distribution
                        7
                            We discuss the earnings data we use in detail in Section 7.



                                                                                          22
                                and increases it for the very top managers. In Section 8 we return to this comparative static
                                when we measure the change in K that can rationalize the change in wage inequality during
                                the 1990 - 2010 period.
                                     Figure 8 presents the Lorenz Curves for the benchmark case of                                                                    = 0:28 as well as lower
                                and higher values. An increase in                                yields, as with K, an increase in wage inequality.
                                However, it distorts the Lorenz curve in a way that does not resemble the data. It increases
                                the inequality at the top of the distribution too much. The extra mass at the tail of the
                                distribution simultaneously creates harder and more pro…table problems and the agents to
                                solve them. These agents make gains relative to the rest of the distribution of income that
                                look too large relative to the data. The evidence in Figures 7 and 8 shows that observed
                                changes in wage inequality can be explained by the existence of harder and more pro…table
                                problems. However we also need the distribution of knowledge not to catch up fully with
                                these changes, as is the case with a change in K: We come back to this argument in Section
                                8.

7. Career Paths


  The evidence on wages we use in this paper includes log means and log variances from the
1990 and 2010 IPUMS-USA.8 We used yearly nominal wages data for white males, heads
of households, that worked more than 30 weeks and 30 hours per week the previous year.
We focus on full time workers only since we have not modeled the labor supply decision of
agents. The 1990 census data correspond to a sample of 5% of the US population, while
the 2010 survey contains the compiled American Community Survey (ACS) 1% sample for
5 years (2006-2010) 9 . Of course, good data are available for many decades prior to 1990
and there are many more categories of workers than those we use here.
  In order to compare the implications of the model to the data of wages of a worker’s
life-cycle, in this section we carry forward the function w(z) that maps types into earnings,
as well as the parameters K = 0:59;                = 0:28; and            = 1:2 that we used in Section 6. To
calibrate the moments (5.7) and (5.8) we use the parameters of (5.3), namely,

                                                                       ( = )s
                                             (s) =       (1       e             )

In the balanced growth path the growth rate of the economy is given by                                   : In the U.S.
this rate is about 0.02 so we let             = 0:02. We can then use equation (5.4) together with
a uniform distribution over experience levels to obtain                             : That is, we let s 2 [0; 44] and
 (s) = 1=44: Then equation (5.4) implies that                     = 0:1027:
  To calculate the parameters C in (5.7) we minimized the mean squared di¤erence between
the predicted value of the mean log wages in the model and the actual value of the data for
experience years fNl ; :::; Nu g. We can compute C^ explicitly as,

                                           Nu
                                           X              Z       1
                                  1                                                             1=
                      C^ =                        !(s)                log w(z) de        (s)z
                                                                                                     ;
                             Nu       Nl                      0
                                           s=Nl

where !(s) denotes the observed mean of log wage data for individuals with s years of
experience . In the simulations below, we use Nl = 1 years of experience and Nu = 40,

      We have also analyze the data for 2000 and found similar patterns.

      In the survey nominal income is measured in 2010 dollars.

                        wages as a function of experience for the same year and for the model. On both plots,
                        the straight dashed lines are theoretical, calibrated as described above. The dots are data.
                        These are all displayed as experience-earnings pro…les (as opposed to age-earnings pro…les).
                        The level of all the mean earnings pro…le is set to match up to observed levels between 1
                        and 40 years of experience. We have started all careers at levels of zero productivity.
                          Consistent with the data, the experience-earnings pro…le increases over the career of
                        individuals. In fact, the model is able to capture the rate of increase, as well as the curvature
                        quite well. The main discrepancy is observed beyond 30 years of experience where earnings
                        decline in the data but not in the model. This may be a Ben Porath e¤ect, or an early
                        semi-retirement e¤ect. These are earnings per year, but the same downturn appears in the

hourly earnings data provided by IPUMs. These issues require adding labor supply and
retirement decisions that are not present in the model described here.10
  The variance pro…le shown on Figure 10 show that the dispersion of wages …rst increases
and then decreases with years of experience. Everyone starts with similar prospects but over
time some are lucky, learn and get promoted, while others meet less interesting people, learn
less, and do not climb as high in the organizational ladder. Over time, these di¤erences
become much more pronounced and so the cross-sectional dispersion of wages increases.
However, most older agents in the model do end up eventually meeting knowledgeable
individuals and learning from them. Thus even though the variance of wages remains high
relative to their initial years in the labor force, it declines with the years of experience
after the initial increase. The data exhibit a di¤erent pattern, with a smooth rise in wage
inequality as agents go through their careers. Part of this increase might again be the
result of changes in labor supply and other decisions of individuals. Our model can match
relatively well the level of the variance of wages, but not its pattern over the career path of
individuals.


8. Matching Observed Changes in Wage Inequality


  During the period 1990 to 2010, and perhaps starting a couple of decades before, the U.S.
economy has experienced large changes in the distribution of earnings. These changes have
been documented in a variety of studies including, for example, Katz and Murphy (1997),
Goldin and Katz (2007) and Acemoglu and Autor (2013). These authors have pointed to
the increase in overall inequality evident in the Lorenz curves portrayed in Figures 7 and
8, as well as to several other facts, such as the increase in the skill premium and wage
polarization among skill groups. Polarization refers to the declines in the wages of agents
in the middle part of the distribution relative to the ones at the top and the bottom, or, in
other words, a decline in earnings inequality at the lower-half of the distribution, together
with an increase at the upper-half.

      Our model could readily be modi…ed to add Ben Porath-like properties as in Lucas and Moll (2014).




                                                    26
                                  We have already alluded to the fact that these changes can be replicated, at least quali-
                                tatively, as a result of an increase in K. As the distribution of problems shifts to the right
                                relative to the distribution of knowledge, problems become more di¢ cult but also provide a
                                larger return if successfully solved. The result is an increase in inequality generated by an
                                increase in the skill premium. High-skilled agents are more useful since their knowledge is
                                relatively scarce and the problems they can solve are more valuable. Moreover, inequality
                                among workers tends to decrease since they solve fewer problems. Their value relies more
                                on the problems they generate (which are common to all workers) rather than the ones they
                                solve. In contrast, inequality among managers increases since the new distribution favors
                                the superstars.

                        the Lorenz curves for 1990 and 2010 together with the model-generated curves. The …t
                        for 2010 is quite good. The larger K also generates an increase in the number of all types
                        of managers; a feature consistent with the data during this period. Figure 12 shows the
                        fraction of workers and managers in each layer for both calibrations, as well as the ones we

                        of experience for 1990 and 2010, as well as the ones implied by our calibrations for these
                        years. The dashed lines correspond to K = 0:59; should be compared to the data in 1990,
                        and replicate Figure 9. The solid line correspond to K = 0:66 and should be compared to
                        the data in 2010. In the model, an increase in K increases the slope and level of the mean
                        experience-earnings pro…les. Figure 13 shows that these changes match the observe changes


                                                                                             28
between 1990 and 2010 well. According to our model experience became more valuable in
the later period, since the acquired knowledge could be applied to a larger pool of more
di¢ cult but valuable problems.
  In Figure 14 we present the change in the variance of log wages over the period 1990
to 2010, together with the implied change in the model when we increase K from 0:59 to
0:66. The model implies that the variance of log wages is always zero for agents with no
experience, independently of the value of K; since all agents start with zero knowledge.
The change in variance then increases rapidly with experience and stabilizes after about 10
years in the labor force. These changes track the observed changes in the data reasonably
well, although the data exhibit more variation. Higher K implies that knowledge is more
valuable and so agents with lucky matches bene…t relatively more. The magnitude of this
e¤ect generated by the model seems accurate, at least on average.
  As emphasized above, we have not developed a model of the individual actions that
might generate the problem distribution or its evolution over time. The results above are
simply a thought-experiment involving the single parameter K, one that seems to provide a
good …t to changes observed in the labor market. An increase in K re‡ects a technological
change that favors extreme outcomes, in the form of superstar ideas that are extremely well
compensated. This shift can in principle increase or decrease output. The change in K
that we measure during this period reduces de-trended output. Changing from K = 0:59
to K = 0:66, reduces de-trended output by approximately 2%.11 We underscore that we do
explain or analyze the source of this change. We only identify it as a likely cause relative to
other potential phenomena during this period. Consider, for example, an improvement in
communication technology measured by an increase in the parameter . Such a technological
change has the opposite e¤ect on overall inequality and so does not allow us to match
the 2010 Lorenz curve. Another possibility is a technological change that increases the
thickness of the tail of the distribution of problems and knowledge (an increase in ). Such
  11
       In the Appendix, Figure A2,we show that for our calibration total output is increasing in K for small
values of K and decreasing for large values (inverted U-shaped pattern). The location of the maximum
depends on other parameters, including      as we pointed out in Section 6.

a change does increase overall inequality but, as we showed in Figure 8, it generates too
much inequality at the top of the distribution .


9. Final Remarks


  Individual’s earnings are determined by their skill and schooling, but also by the charac-
teristics of the agents with whom they interact. As individuals age, acquire more experience,
and learn, their career paths take them progressively to jobs with more subordinates: they
climb the organizational hierarchy. Some agents climb fast because they are highly educated
or because they are lucky and manage to learn quickly from people they encounter during
their careers. Others learn and climb the hierarchy slowly, if at all, since they meet the
wrong people from whom they learn little. In this paper we build a model of an economy
in which agents go through these career paths. Formally we have combined a model of the
hierarchical organization of production similar to the one in Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg
(2004, 2006) with a model of learning based on Lucas (2009). The outcome is a theory
where, on the balanced growth path, individuals progress through the hierarchy according
to the random set of people they encounter during their lives.
  The model we propose is successful in replicating a variety of features of the U.S. data.
In particular, the model can match well the Lorenz curve of income, as well as the slope
and curvature of the mean experience-earnings pro…le. Furthermore, the model identi…es a
shift in the distribution of problems relative to the distribution of knowledge as a potential
source of the changes in wage inequality observed during the two decades between 1990
and 2010. Our theory suggests that, during this period, production became more di¢ cult
relative to the knowledge embedded in the population, but also resulted in higher rewards
than in the past. A technology more geared toward superstars, as suggested by Rosen (1981)
and more recently by Gabaix, Lasry, and Moll (2015). Can these changes be traced to the
general-purpose technologies associated with computers and the internet?12 Studying the
source of this technological change is, we believe, essential to make progress in assessing the

Appendix


  Proofs.—
  Theorem 1. Suppose that F ( ) and G ( ) are di¤erentiable, then any solution to the
planning problem is characterized by a matching function ' ( ) ; and a pair of thresholds
zw and ze such that Zw = [0; zw ], Zm = [zw ; ze ], Ze = [ze ; 1). If Zm 6= ? then zw < ze ;
otherwise, zw = ze .

  The proof is given in the next three lemmas.

  Lemma 1: Let (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solve the planner’s problem. Then for " su¢ ciently
small[0; ") * Zw \ Ze :
  Proof: Toward a contradiction, suppose [0; x0 ]                            Zw \ Ze . We will show that this
allocation can always be improved by building a hierarchy that includes workers with z
close to zero and managers with z close to x0 . Note …rst that the expected payo¤ of the
worst agent is given by

and for agent x0 is
                                              Z       x0
                                   lim =                     yg (y) dy > 0:

The total production of this team if they are all self-employed is

In contrast, if they form a team they produce
                          Z x0              Z x0                                       Z   "

                                            yg (y) dy >                   yg (y) dy:
                                   0                             0

Hence, the planner would always prefer to form these hierarchies for a non-zero measure
of agents than to have all of them as self-employed, which contradicts (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze )
being a solution to the planner’s problem.

  Lemma 2: Let (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solve the planner’s problem. Then if zm 2 Zm and
ze 2 Ze we have zm < ze :
  Proof: Toward a contradiction, suppose (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solves the planner’s problem
above but that ze < zm for some ze 2 Ze and a zm 2 Zm . In this case, note that since ze 2 Ze
the planner fails to solve all problems that require knowledge z > ze . These problems have
total value
                                         Z   z                     Z    z

                                         ze        1 G(ze )            ze
if an agent with ability z tries to solve them. In contrast, agent zm passes along the problems
he cannot solve to agent ' (zm ) : These problems have total value
                               Z '(zm )                 Z '(zm )
                                            g (y)
                  (1 G(zm ))            y          dy =          yg (y) dy
                                 zm       1 G(zm )       zm

if agent ' (zm ) tries to solve them. But, letting z = ' (zm ), given ze < zm , we have
                              Z '(zm )             Z '(zm )
                                       yg (y) dy >          yg (y) dy:
                                ze                         zm

The value of the problems discarded by agent ze exceed the value that would have been
discarded if agent zm had been assigned to agent ' (zm ) instead. A contradiction.

  Lemma 3: Let (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solve the planner’s problem. Then, z 2 Zw implies
that z   z 0 for all z 0 2 Zm [ Ze .
  Proof: Toward a contradiction, suppose (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solves the planner’s problem
above but does not satisfy this property. Then there exists a zw 2 Zw and a zm 2 Zm such
that zw > zm . Note …rst that the value of a problem passed up to a manager z by any agent
           Rz
is given by 0 yg (y) dy, independent of the ability of the worker who generated it. (It only
depends on the best agent that tries to solve it, z:) In contrast, the value of a manager for
the planner’s objective is given by
                        Z zm                                       Z   zm
                                              g (y)
                                   y                      dy                 yg (y) dy:
                          ' 1 (zm ) 1        G(' 1 (zm ))          0


                                                      34

manager, holding …xed their supervisors and subordinates. Then the gain for the planner
is given by

  Theorem 2. Suppose that F ( ) and G ( ) are di¤erentiable, then there is a pair (zw ; ze )
that satis…es (3.6) - (3.8).

  Proof : Let zw be the highest cuto¤ zw that such that all problems are solved, the unique
solution to

Total production in this case will be
                     Z zw Z 1                             Z                                               1

Also note that as zw ! 1 total production converges to the autarchy level

                                        yg(y)dyf (z)dz:

  Lemma 4: Let (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solve the planner’s problem. Then if zw = ze , zw must

  Proof: Toward a contradiction, suppose that (' ( ) ; Zw ; Zm ; Ze ) solves the planner’s
problem and that
                                                         Z   zw            Z    1
                                    [1      F (zw )] <            f (z)             g(y)dydz:

Then there are too few entrepreneurs to review all the problems unsolved by workers.
Replacing zw with zw            h < zw ; in this case will increase the left side by             [1    F (zw   h)]
 [1   F (zw )] ' hf (zw ) and this will allow the new managers to solve hf (zw ) problems
                 Rz
worth on average 0 w yg(y)dy each (since they do not know how to solve the more di¢ cult
                                                 Rz
problems). This replacement thus adds hf (zw ) 0 w yg(y)dy to production. It also reduces
the right side by
           Z   zw           Z   1                             Z    1

            zw h            z                                     zw

workers. Since all the problems harder than zw where thrown away, the planner valued
these problems only at
                                                                    Z      zw
                                         hf (zw ) [1   G (zw )]                 yg(y)dy;
                                                                       0

Since   > [1    G (zw )] ; the planner will not choose to do this: a contradiction.
  If on the other hand the left side of (3.5) exceeds the right, there must be entrepreneurs
who advise no one. They might choose to be workers, but this would violate Lemma 3: also
a contradiction.

an improvement in communication technology driven by , reduces wage inequality since
it increases the span of control of knowledgable agents, making problem generation more
valuable and the talent of knowledgable individuals less scarce.

                                Occupational Codes


                                  To obtain the fraction of agents employed in each layer, we convert the IPUMS-USA
                                classi…cation into the French PCS classi…cation used in Caliendo et al. (2015).
                                  The occupation data in the IPUMS-USA (OCC2010) is based on the occupation coding
                                used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the American Community Survey (ACS)
                                in 2010. We use three di¤erent crosswalks to translate the coding to the French PCS data
                                to de…ne the layers of our economy. First we match the OCC2010 codes to the International


                                                                                                             37
Standard Classi…cation of Occupations ISCO-08, then then to the ISCO-88 and …nally to
the PCS codes13 .
     After doing this process there are some unmatched codes. Out of the 539 di¤erent ACS
codes in our sample, 43 were unmatched (7.98%). In term of the weighted observations of
our sample, Table A1 shows the percentage of unmatched weighted observations for 1990
and 2010.

                                Unmatched 1990           Unmatched 2010

  Table A1: Unmatched Codes as a Fraction of the Weighted Observation of the Sample

     In Section 8 we computed the fraction of individuals in each layer using only the codes
that we matched directly. The results are similar if we impute to the missing codes the
value of the top (or bottom) layer implied by the immediate neighboring codes.


     Computations.—
     Here we provide a constructive method for …nding a solution to the planner’s problem.
To do so it is useful to describe the economy by the number of layers it has. Let L denote
the number of layers, where L = 0 means all the individuals in the economy are workers,
L = 1 that there are workers and one level managers, and so on. We know from Lemma 1
that if      > 1 it is never optimal to only have workers in the economy (L = 0) as it is always
preferable to have managers for the lowest productivity workers. In general, we want to
characterize the solution in terms of the number of layers the economy will optimally have.
     The idea is to choose the worker’s cuto¤ zw that maximizes total output. For a given
zw we compute total output by …rst calculating the matching function '( ; zw ) and the
entrepreneur’s cuto¤ ze (zw ) such that no managerial resources are wasted. We compute the

matching function by iterating on the number of layers in the economy. In each iteration
if the layer L manager of the individual that knows nothing z = 0, has knowledge below
the entrepreneur’s cuto¤, we add a layer to the matching function and recompute ze (zw ).
Below we describe in detail the algorithm we use to …nd the solution to this maximization
problem.
  First we introduce some notation. In an economy with L layers, each worker can be linked
to L or L   1 managers. Speci…cally, suppose that workers below some productivity level
x have L managers, while workers with productivity z 2 [x; zw ] have L     1 managers. Let
'l (z) denote the l’th manager matched with worker z 2 [0; zw ]. We de…ne this mapping by
applying the matching function l times, i.e. 'l (z) := '('(:::'(z))). Similarly we de…ne the
                                                       | {z }
                                                                 l times
inverse matching function that maps managers to their subordinates. The function 'l 1 (z),
denotes the l’th subordinate of manager z, and it is de…ned by applying the inverse of the
matching function l times, 'l 1 (z) := '    1
                                                ('    1
                                                        (:::' 1 (z))).
                                       |             {z       }
                                                l times
  To illustrate these de…nitions consider the case where
       (0; zw ) are workers of all kinds,
       (0; x) workers with access to L managers,
       (x; zw ) workers with access to L        1 managers,
       (zw ; ze ) are managers with access to other managers and
       (ze ; 1) are the top managers (entrepreneurs).

  Given this new notation we can describe an algorithm in which we choose the cuto¤ that


                                                     39
maximize output. As mentioned above, note that for a given set of cuto¤s (zw ; ze ) we can
…nd a function '( ; zw ) that satis…es equations (3.7) and (3.8). Moreover as the planner’s
objective function (total production) is increasing in both zw and ze , the idea is to …nd the
largest feasible cuto¤s such that these equations are satis…ed.
  The algorithm will consist of two steps. In step 1 we compute the worker’s cuto¤ such
                                                                    1 = z 1 de…ned by solution
that there is exactly one layer (L=1). In this case the cuto¤s are zw    e

                                                                       0
