      Why Have Private Saving Rates in the United States and Canada Diverged?




                                     ABSTRACT

        One of the central questions in macroeconomics for
                                                           many years has been
    whether government policy can affect private saving rates, and if so to
    what extent and through what channels.         The question has remained
    controversial because, as with other macroeconomic questions, experiments
    to check divergent hypotheses cannot be deliberately performed, so
    economists must rely upon the often dubious evidence from the limited
    experiments with which nature and history have endowed us. This paper
   discusses the results of an exceptionally good natural experiment that has
   been provided by Canada and the U.S. over the past thirty-five years.
   After moving in tandem for almost 25 years, American and Canadian private
   saving rates have diverged dramatically over the last decade.    The primary
   conclusion emerging from our analysis of this phenomenon is that tax
   policies can have a potent impact on private savings behavior. Differences
   in tax structures and in the interactions of taxation and inflation appear
   to be important factors explaining the divergent behavior of the American
   and Canadian private savings rates. Recognizing the importance of asset
   revaluatjons, caused partially but not entirely by tax effects, also helps
   to explain the different behavior of U.S. and Canadian savings. There may
   also be a relationship between government deficits and the private savings
   differential.

    Macroeconomists are unable to do controlled experiments.       Ceteris

paribus is a frequent analytic assumption but a rarely satisfied empirical

condition. The absence of controlled experiments forces macroeconomists to

rely on much less satisfactory statistical analyses of time series data on

economic aggregates.      Time series data are less satisfactory than

experimental data because it is difficult to sort out causation from the

observed pattern of correlations.    The identification problems posed by

natural experiments are the principal reason why even the most basic

macroeconomic relationships remain controversial after decades of study.

    This paper reports on the results of one of the few reasonably well

controlled experiments in the determinants of savings behavior that nature

has provided. After moving in tandem for almost 25 years, American and

Canadian private saving rates have diverged dramatically over the last
decade.     While the private saving rate in the United States has fallen

slightly from 8.7% of GNP over the 1971—1975 period to 6.2% over the 1981—

1985 period, the private saving rate in Canada has risen rapidly from 7.8%

to 11.9%.    Because the American and Canadian economies have so much in

common geographically and institutionally but have followed very different

fiscal policies during the last decade, recent experience provides an ideal

natural experiment for studying the effects of fiscal policies on savings.

    Our approach is more agnostic than the currently fashionable one of

fitting complex structural models.     This reflects our conviction that

movements in private saving rates are determined by processes too complex

to represent by any sort of formulation embodying the preferences and

budget constraint facing a "representative consumer." Rather than trying
                                                                    2




to postulate a single "correct" model of savings behavior which is
applicable to both the U.S. and Canada, instead we simply relate
differences in private saving rates to a variety of factors that seem

plausibly related to savings behavior.      The hope is that convincing

patterns will emerge, though we recognize that our approach cannot provide

reliable quantitative estimates of the effects of plausible policy changes

on the saving rate.   In light of the rather mixed conclusions of studies

examining consumption behavior through the prism of optimizing models,

experimenting with a more loosely structured approach seems worthwhile.

    The primary conclusion emerging from our analysis is that tax policies

can have a potent impact on private savings behavior. Differences in tax

structures and in the interactions of taxation and inflation appear to be

important factors explaining the divergent behavior of the American and

Canadian private saving rates.      Recognizing the importance of asset

revaluations, caused partially but not entirely by tax effects, also helps

to explain the different behavior of U.S. and Canadian savings. There may

also be a relationship between government deficits and the private savings

differential.

    The paper is organized as follows.      Section I documents the very

different behavior of the U.S. and Canadian saving rates over the last 10

years.   We show that the observed patterns are robust with respect to

measurement adjustments involving inflation accounting, and we demonstrate

that most of the changes in relative U.S. and Canadian private saving rates

can be attributed to changes in the Canadian personal saving rate. Section

II notes the broad similarity in the macroeconomic environment in the two

countries and then uses an econometric model to examine the extent to which
                                                                               3



differences in cyclical conditions, interest rates, and inflation can

 account for movements in the two countries' relative saving rates.      It

 finds that relatively little of the variation in saving rates can be traced

to differences in macroeconomic conditions.

    Section III examines the impact of structural and institutional

differences between the two countries on their respective private saving

rates. We show that the divergence in U.S. and Canadian private saving

rates coincides quite closely with the introduction of major savings

incentives in Canada in the early 1970s. There is also some evidence that

it may be associated with large increases in Canadian government deficits

that has taken place in recent years. Finally, we examine the role of

changes in wealth caused by capital gains and losses in determining private

saving rates. We adduce evidence suggesting that the non—deductibility of

consumer interest payments in Canada in conjunction with rising nominal

interest rates contributed to the relative increase in its private saving

rate.

    Section IV attempts to determine the relative importance of the factors

examined in Section III by placing them in the macroeconomic framework

developed in Section II. Section V concludes.

I. Documenting Diverging Saving Rates

   The divergence between the behavior of the Canadian and American

private saving rates which provides the motivation for this paper is

illustrated in Chart #la (Tables corresponding to all the charts can be

found either in the body of the text or in the appendix)     While the two

saving rates moved in parallel prior to 1971, beginning at about that time

saving behavior in the two countries diverged sharply. Canadian
                                                                    saving
                                                                                             4


increased rapidly from a relatively constant level of about 7% of GNP to an

unprecedented 10.5% in 1975 and continued to increase to about 12% in the

mid 1980s, while the U.S. rate declined slightly over the entire period.

The surge in Canadian saving in the early 1970s appears in retrospect to

have been the beginning of a permanent and fundamental difference between

the U.S. and Canadian economies.1

    Charts #lb and #lc examine differences in the behavior of the two

components of private saving — personal and corporate saving.                        It is

apparent that most of the reason for the relative increase in Canadian

private saving is the increase in the Canadian personal saving rate. The

Canadian personal saving rate averaged 3.3% of GNP for the period 1957 to

1971, and exhibited relatively little variance around this level.                       By

contrast, from 1972 to 1985 the average level was 7.6% of GNP, and saving

was less than 7% of GNP in only two years after 1974.              It rose as high as

10.9% in 1982. Patterns of corporate saving behavior are similar in the

two countries, showing mild declines reflecting reduced profitability after

1975 in general and during the sharp 1982 recession in particular (Chart

#lc) .   The   roughly similar behavior of corporate saving in the two

countries suggests that the U.S.—Canadian comparison cannot enlighten

debates about the extent to which individuals "pierce the corporate veil"

in making their saving decisions. This also suggests that we should focus

on the determinants of personal savings in explaining the differing

American and Canadian experiences.

    A number of authors, notably Jump (1980), have stressed the distortion

   We focus here on private saving rates because they seem to us the most natural
  object for the application of theory. Others, to whom the Ricardian equivalence
  proposition seems plausible on a priori grounds, would work with national saving
  rates. We address this issue explicitly below in treating the effects of
  government deficits.

in measured private saving rates created by the effects of inflation. The

main argument is that measures of saving are distorted by their treatment

of the inflationary component of interest rates as income rather than

return of principal.         Chart #ld depicts movements in an estimate of

inflation—adjusted private saving for both the U.S. and Canadian economies.

In brief, the inflation-adjusted saving rate is arrived at by deducting

from saving the erosion in the value of money-denominated assets due to

inflation.2 The divergence in saving rates for the two countries remains

evident even after the inflation adjustment.

    A fair conclusion is that the divergent behavior of American and

Canadian private saving behavior is a phenomenon requiring explanation. We

consider possible explanations below.

II.Macroeconomic Variables and the Saving Rate

    Macroeconomic fluctuations are often thought to affect personal saving

through a variety of mechanisms usually derived explicitly or implicitly

from a life cycle or permanent income model of consumer behavior. Cyclical

fluctuations also influence corporate profits and the therefore corporate

savings. While macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Canada are highly

correlated (which is why we choose to compare U.S. and Canadian saving

rates), it is possible that differences in performance such as those

documented by Ashenfelter and Card (1986) may account for some of the

divergence in saving rates.        In order to examine this possibility we ran a

battery of regressions relating differences in contemporaneous and lagged

values of the rate of inflation, the rate of growth of personal disposable

2 When definitions are changed to correspond with those in Jump (1980) our
   estimates for the inflation—adjusted U.S. personal saving rate correspond closely
  with Jump's, although we used a simplified version of his procedure. This gives us
  confidence in our Canadian results as well, since both inflation rates and the
  level of financial assets in the U.S. and Canada are similar.
                                                                              7




 income, the GNP gap, the unemployment rate, and the short term interest

 rate to differences in personal and total private saving.       All of the
equations reported in this paper are estimated using ordinary least

squares. Despite substantial positive serial correlation in the residuals,

we did not make a serial correlation correction because
                                                          quasi—differericing
would raise the sensitivity of the results to short run rather than long

run considerations. Given that our right hand side variables are measured

imperfectly, it would also exacerbate errors in variables problems. The

reported standard errors are corrected for the effects of serial
correlation assuming that the OLS residuals follow an AR(1) process. The

general conclusion from the regression results reported in Table #1 is that

macroeconomic variables cannot explain the bulk of the relative movements

in U.S. and Canadian saving rates, We now examine the justifications and

results for each of the individual variables included in the regressions,

beginning with the inflation rate.

    Had there been persistent and significant differences in U.S. and

Canadian inflation in recent years it might have been plausible to

attribute the savings divergence at least partially to mechanisms like

those described by Jump (1980), Cawdery and Prefontairie (1982), and others

in recent papers. Casual examination of the data makes it clear, however,

that inflation differences have been small and unsystematic both
historically and recently.    It is no surprise, therefore, that in our

regressions coefficients on the differential between the two national

inflation rates were virtually never statistically significant, either in

the reported regressions or in a large body of unreported ones. Similar

results are obtained from equations (not shown) using inflation—adjusted

 saving rates as the dependent variable.

    If inflation does not seem to have been an important contributor, what

about cyclical variables? The life cycle theory and the permanent income

hypothesis both indicate that unexpectedly fast disposable income growth

should be associated with high saving, and low saving should accompany low

growth. Canada experienced a somewhat faster growth in disposable income

than did the U.S. in the l97Os, but the recession in the early eighties

reduced disposable income in Canada more than in the U.S., so the growth

patterns of the economies have been less similar than their inflation

experiences.    Still, regressions attempting to explain the savings
differences by the differences in disposable income growth and its lagged

values were not successful, with coefficients remaining near zero whether

the private saving rate (Table #1) or the personal saving rate was the

dependent variable, and whether or not lagged values were included in the

regressions. In a similar vein, the GNP gap was also tested as a predictor

of saving rates; it too was found to be insignificant in both current and

lagged formulations.

    An alternative indicator of the level of economic distress in an

economy, and therefore perhaps of the need for cyclical saving, is the

unemployment rate. A temporarily high unemployment rate might be expected

to lead to a temporarily low private saving rate as unemployed individuals

drew down their savings, while an unusually low rate of unemployment might

be associated with high savings for life cycle reasons. The unemployment

rate differential proved to be the only macroeconomic variable which was

statistically significant in our regressions —   highly     so, in fact, with
R2's for associated regressions ranging up to 50% -   but   the coefficients on
                                                                                          10



the unemployment rate were positive rather than the expected negative.

    Increased relative unemployment appears to be associated with increased

saving.

       An explanation for this behavior consistent with received theory holds

that the sharp increase in Canadian saving which coincided with an increase

in Canada's relative unemployment rate was the result of a perception by

Canadians that their economy had become a significantly more risky working

environment, necessitating a higher rate of precautionary savings.                 This

hypothesis is loosely supported by polls which indicate a large drop in the

confidence of Canadians in their economy in the late seventies3 and by

the observation that the unemployment differential is statistically

insignificant when only data for the period prior to 1976 are studied.

       Finally, we examine the impact of differences in interest rates on

differences in saving rates.                  Given the other variables included in the

equations, it is probably appropriate to think of differences in nominal

rates as largely reflecting differences in real interest rates.                  While

theory does not permit an unambiguous judgement about the effects of

changes in interest rates on saving rates, Summers (1981, 1986) argues that

the likely effect of an increase in interest rates is an increase in

private savings.           The coefficients on the interest rate variable are in

fact positive and significant in all Table #1 regressions, but they explain

only a relatively small fraction of the saving behavior observed.

       In sum, differences in macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and Canada

do not explain the very different behavior of private savings in the two

countries.          This conclusion should not be surprising given the broad

similarity in the shocks experienced by the two countries and the magnitude
-

of the divergence in saving rates.        In the next section we turn to possible

institutional explanations.

III.Explaining the Divergence
    If the recent macroeconomic experiences in Canada and the U.S. are not

sufficient to account for the remarkable divergence in national accounts

basis private saving rates, a natural supposition might be that fiscal

policy differences, either in the tax structures of the two countries or in

the government deficits, may provide the explanation.                A focus on such

differences as the most profitable field to explore in U.S./Canadian

comparisons was suggested by Alan Blinder (1982), who wrote that
"Comparisons between Canada and the United States come about as close to a

controlled experiment as economists are ever likely to get.                    The two

countries are similar in so many ways that we can feel almost justified in

attributing whatever difference we observe to legal—institutional

differences." Of the many differences in the U.S. and Canadian fiscal

policy, three in particular might be expected to have had an especially

strong impact on the personal saving rate recently: differences in the

sheltered savings opportunities provided by the tax codes, differences in

the level of the government deficit/surplus, and the differing status of

deductibility of consumer and mortgage interest payments.4 Another

approach to the whole question is to consider a different definition of

saving, which unlike the National Income Accounts (NIA) measure

incorporates capital gains and losses, to determine whether it might be a

better object for study than the NIA measure, or might help to explain

 We did investigate the consequences of several other fiscal policy differences in
 the two countries, including differences in the level of income and capital gains
 taxes, but we have concluded that none of these topics was as important as those we
 are examining in detail. For more information on this subject see Carroll (1986)
                                                                                        12


trends in NIA saving.         We treat these issues in three parts: first a

discussion of sheltered savings, next a discussion of deficits, and finally

a discussion of trends in capital gains and personal wealth which contains

an analysis of the impact of tax differences in the treatment of
liabilities.

Sheltered Savings

      Canada has a complex system of government—registered private retirement

income and pension plans which was instituted in 1957 and expanded

significantly during the early seventies. Employer—sponsored Registered

Pension Plans (RPP's) and individual Registered Retirement Savings Plans

(RRSP's) are the two largest programs in the system, and most of the

smaller plans are minor variants on the structure of the RPP/RRSP programs.

The principal feature of the system is that the sum of an individual's tax

sheltered contributions and his employer's contributions on his behalf can

be at most $3500 a year. Originally the maximum contribution was $1500,

but changes to the tax laws in 1972, 1974, and 1976 expanded the limits and

allowed certain new types of contributions.5                    In addition a $1000

deduction for investment income was introduced in 1974. This permitted a

considerable portion of total savings to be effectively sheltered, since

tax deductibility of contributions is equivalent to tax deductibility of

earnings.      G.V. Jump (1982), however, has calculated that in 1979 two

thirds of all investment income was earned by taxpayers with incomes of

  For more derailed information on the chronology and nature of changes in the
  Canadian tax code see Carroll (1986) or Janet Jarrett's Personal Savings in Canada,
  p. 61, text and footnote 12. A further sheltered saving program, the Registered
  Home Ownership Savings Plan (PHOSP) was created in 1974 but is now being phased
  out. For simplicity, total individual sheltered saving in Canada will henceforth
  be referred to as RRSP saving; likewise the sum of IRA and Keogh contributions will
 be   called IRA saving.
   It is interesting to note that at the time of this writing the Canadian Parliament
  is debating a further expansion of the RASP program as a response to the
  considerable success of the program so far.
                                                                                  13



 more than $20,000, while the average level of investment income for

 taxpayers in this bracket was $3624, far above the $1000 maximum deductible

 amount, leading Jump to conclude that most personal investment is not

 sheltered at the margin. Although Jump's point is well taken, it should

 also be noted that persistently over 70% of all taxable returns claimed

 some deduction (most of which must have been less than the $1000 maximum),

and between 25% and 30% of total reported investment income during the mid

to late seventies was deducted from taxable income.6 Even if we assume

that two thirds of these deductions were by people with investment income

in excess of the $1000 limit (and therefore unsheltered at the margin),

this still leaves perhaps 10% of ordinary (non-RRSP) investment which is

sheltered at the margin. Making the assumption that 10% of investment

income (in addition to that sheltered by RRSP's) was sheltered by this tax

rule would somewhat strengthen the results of the regressions and other

analysis that follows.

     In the U.S. sheltered savings opportunities have been more limited.

Individual Retirement Accounts, available to all taxpayers, and Keogh

plans, limited to the self-employed, are the chief programs which allow

discretionary sheltered saving.          Prior to the Economic Recovery Tax Act

(ERTA) of 1981 only a small percentage of taxpayers were eligible to

participate in these plans, but the ERTA expanded IRA eligibility to all

taxpayers and increased the maximum deductible contribution to $2000; newly

legislated tax policies in the U.S. call for reducing the scope of the IRA

program.

      Note:   the Canadian figures do not include the effects of the 1974 tax revision which allowed tax deduction of up to $1000
              of investment income a year. Including this tax break in the

bills   of the U.S. and Canadian governments (which are intended to represent

a "market" pre—tax rate of return available to consumer)7 and estimates

of after—tax rates of return on unsheltered investment in T—bills.8

According to our calculations, the after—tax real rate of return on

unsheltered financial investment was negative during almost the entire

decade of the 1970's in both countries, although in the late seventies the

rate of return was much higher in Canada than in the U.S.                          Chart #2

presents the differential between the rate of return available on sheltered

and on unsheltered investment in both countries; it is clear from this

chart that the incentives to save in sheltered as opposed to unsheltered

forms were extremely powerful in both countries, but even stronger in

Canada than in the U.S.

    Table #3 presents data on levels of contributions to the RRSP and IRA

programs. Between 1971 and 1976, i.e. from the year before the expansion

in RRSP eligibility to the year of the last major change in the system, the

sum of contributions to RRSP's and our estimate of income earned within

RRSP's (see Table #3 for details) rose as a percentage of Canadian

disposable income from around .5% to 2.6%; by 1981 the figure had reached

3.4%. The expansions of RRSP contributions coincide fairly closely with

the beginnings of the rise in the Canadian personal saving rate from below

6.5% of disposable income before 1972 to around 10% in 1976—1978, and

   In the United States the T-bill rate is not necessarily a good indicator of the
  pre—tax rate of return on financial saving during much of the period because the
  Federal Reserves Regulation Q kept interest rates on many forms of personal saving
  artificially low after 1973. According to U.S. Flow of Funds statistics, more than
  half of direct personal holdings of interest—bearing assets in the seventies and
  eariy eighties were in "tire and savings deposits, " and subject to the Regulation Q
  interest rate ceilings.
8 The marginal rate of return on taxable (unsheltered) savings is measured by
   assuming that the marginal rate of taxation is 30%, and so that the after—tax
   normal rate of return is 30% less than the pre—tax rate.

higher   still to 12-13% by the early eighties.

    A closer examination of patterns and levels of contribution to RRSPs,

however, indicates that even under generous assumptions the direct effects

of RRSPs can account for only a part of the increase in Canadian saving.

If the entire increase in RRSP contributions is considered to Constitute

new saving (as opposed to a transfer of saving from other forms into RRSP

accounts) the RRSP program can account for at most half of the overall 6%

rise in the personal saving rate out of disposable income. Research has

not determined definitively the proportion of RRSP saving which is "new"

saving which would not have been undertaken had the RRSP program not

existed, but it seems certain that the figure should be substantially less

than 100%. If the relatively generous assumption is made that 2/3 of RRSP

saving would not have been done had there been no RRSP program, then RRSP's

can directly account for at most a third of the increase in Canadian

personal saving.

    However, at least two considerations can be invoked to justify

attributing more importance to RRSPTS. First, George Katona (1964) and

Philip Cagan (1965) have, under different guises, proposed a "recognition

effect" hypothesis, whereby consumers are made more aware of the benefits

of saving and as a result undertake to save more. The theory would apply

to Canada to the extent that the availability of RRSP's shifted the tastes

of Canadians to make saving more, and consumption less, attractive. This

might have been accomplished by the advertising campaigns mounted by many

banks for consumers' RRSP accounts.9              The second point which suggests

   In a recent research trip to Ottawa, one of the authors observed promotional
  posters, signs, and literature for RRSP saving schemes in prominent positions in
  virtually every downtown bank. One particularly manipulative, but probably
  effective, poster featured an impoverished, homeless old woman with a caption which
  suggested that hers was the fate awaiting anyone unwise enough not to take
  advantage of the bank's RRSP program.

that RRSP saving may have been more important than would appear at first

blush is that the increase in inflation—adjusted RRSP savings is greater

than the increase in the inflation-adjusted Canadian saving rate. In this

sense RRSPs appear very important.1°

    IRA and Keogh saving in the United States has been less important than

RRSP saving in Canada.        Steven Venti and David Wise (1985) in the only

thorough econometric evaluation of the IRA program conclude that most IRA

contributions represent new savings.            Summers (1986) reaches a similar

conclusion on the basis of other more qualitative evidence on the frequency

with which individuals make contributions at the last possible moment and

the reported wealth holdings of IRA contributors. Many other authorities,

pointing to the decline in the personal saving rate that has taken place in

recent years, believe that IRAs have had little effect. It should be noted

however that the inflation adjusted private saving rate in the U.S. has

actually increased since the expansion of IRAs in 1981 (Chart #ld)

   A final form of sheltered saving which was available in both countries

was employer-sponsored pension saving.           In both countries pension saving

outstripped all other categories of financial saving, and in both countries

the real value of pension wealth virtually doubled between 1973 and 1983.

In the U.S., where pension saving was the only form of sheltered saving

widely available before 1982, pension wealth was also the only form of

   It should be noted that the comparison of inflation-adjusted RRSP saving with
 inflation—adjusted saving in other financial assets could be misleading, in that
 during the period under study RRSP assets were much smaller in relation to RRSP
 saving (accumulated assets were small because the RRSP program was relatively new)
 than other financial assets in relation to other financial saving. Small assets
 lead to a small inflation—erosion adjustment to saving, so the fact that the
 increase in inflation—adjusted RRSP saving rate is high in comparison with the
 increase in inflation—adjusted total saving is not necessarily so striking as it
 may seem.

financial wealth to grow rapidly.     However, because the experiences in

pension saving were broadly similar in the two countries, because

definition and data differences make direct comparison difficult, and

because decisions about contributions to employer-sponsored pension

programs are only indirectly under the control of individuals, we chose to

concentrate most of our attention on RRSP and IRA/Keogh saving differences

rather than on pensions.

Fiscal Policy

   Macroeconomic theory leads us to believe that the fiscal stance of the

government may have an impact on the personal saving rate.    In its most

extreme form, the Ricardian Equivalence Proposition of Robert Barro (1974)

states that the level of government borrowing should not affect a

consumer's long—run consumption plans so long as it is not associated with

changes in government spending patterns, since he realizes that current

government borrowing must be paid for with higher taxes in the future.

This proposition holds that government borrowing will not affect the

interest rate and that changes in the government borrowing rate will be

offset one for one by changes in the private saving rate.

   Comparing Chart #la with Chart #3, we see that in Canada the initial

surge in private saving in the early seventies was followed, in the early

eighties, by massive government budget deficits. Given the volatility of

each of the subcomponents of national saving in Canada (Charts #la-c, #3),

the behavior of the Canadian national saving rate depicted in Chart #4 has

been remarkably stable during the post-77 period. It is very striking that

over the entire 1957-1985 period U.S. and Canadian overall national saving

rates have moved in parallel despite quite different movements in the

individual components of national savings.
                                                                                        22



    U.S. data, however, does not conform with Ricardian equivalence in any

period covered by our data (See the paper by Poterba and Summers in this

issue) .    Rather than rising as in Canada, the private saving rate in the
U.S. declined somewhat as the government deficit mushroomed to

unprecedented proportions in the early eighties. In addition, in the early

and middle sixties when the government was running a substantial structural

surplus there is little sign of an abnormally low personal saving rate.

Personal    Assets, Capital Gains, and Saving
    To this point we have concentrated our analysis on the measures of

saving specified in the National Income Accounts of the U.S. and Canada,

but these definitions may not be ideal measures of personal saving as

economists should define it.         This is primarily because measured income

does not include capital gains and losses on existing assets. Saving may

alternatively be defined not as the fraction of the current income stream

unspent but rather as the change in net wealth from period to period.11

Information on this measure of savings may be found in the National Balance

Sheets (NBS) of the U.S. and Canada, which attempt to measure the levels of

wealth and debt in all sectors of the economy. These data reveal wealth

saving patterns which have diverged significantly from national accounts

saving patterns in several ways. In fact, the rate of growth in the real

value of personal wealth in Canada over the 1976-1985 period averaged only

2.7% annually -     below the average rate of 4.6% during the period 1966-
1975.      Over the same period in the U.S. net wealth saving, at 2.3%, was

actually above its average rate of growth in the previous decade, 1.75

  It is not obvious that capital gains should be included in national savings.
  Treating them as savings would require regarding them as investment arid part of N?
  if nationai accounts consistency were to be maIntaIned.

 (Table #4) •12 The purpose of this section is to assess the extent to

which these differing trends in wealth saving can be attributed to the

differing tax and market incentives facing consumers in the two countries,

and to discuss the relationships between wealth saving and NIA basis

saving.

       Perhaps the area where the institutional systems in Canada and the U_s.

have differed most is in the relative incentives they provide to consumer

borrowing. The most important difference has been in the tax deductibility

of consumer interest provided by the U.S., but not the Canadian, tax code.

Regulatory and other public agencies have also worked to reduce mortgage

interest rates in the u.s)-3 Consequently real after-tax interest rates

on consumer borrowing in the U.S. have historically been lower than in

Canada, although the difference in after-tax mortgage interest rates

remained relatively constant in the 2.5-3% range until about 1976 (Table

#2)

       In the late seventies, however, institutional rigidities in the U.S.

prevented the nominal interest rate from rising fully as inflation

accelerated, and this fact combined with tax deductibility (which becomes

more valuable as inflation increases) to produce strongly negative real
after—tax interest rates. In Canada, on the other hand, the nominal rate
rose rapidly as inflation accelerated, and there was no inflation-induced
tax    deductibility boon. These forces widened the gap between the two real
12
       is important to recall here that no effort has been made by U.S. and Canadian
   statistical agencies to ensure that their measures of levels of wealth and wealth
   saving are compatible, so within—country comparisons, either historical comparisons
   or cross—sectional statistics, are likely to be more reliable than intercountry
   comparisons.

after—tax rates to fully 8% by 1981 (see Table #2 for          all   these   data)

    Blinder (1982) has suggested that the encouragement given to borrowing

by the U.S. tax code may have been one of the principal reasons for low

U.S. and high Canadian saving rates since the mid—seventies.                         It is

certainly true that following the extraordinary reduction in the relative

cost of borrowing (roughly post-1976) U.S. household liabilities
(especially mortgage liabilities) grew much faster in comparison with

Canadian liabilities than they had done previously (Chart #5) .                         To

illustrate, in the period 1970—76 the annual increase in household

liabilities averaged 10.6% of disposable income in Canada and only 6.1% in

the U.S.; in the period 1977-85 the debt formation figure fell by 3.8% of

disposable income in Canada, to 6.8%, and rose by 2.3% in the U.S., to 8.4%

(Table II) 14

   An increase in liabilities is usually used to finance the purchase of

tangible assets, particularly housing and real estate, so we should expect

movements in the tangible wealth component of personal wealth to offset the

changes in liabilities; in fact, the National Income Accounts assume that

any increase in liabilities is used to purchase an equal value of other

assets and therefore does not change net personal wealth at all. There do

indeed appear to be clear links between liabilities and other assets. The

late-seventies growth in U.S. liabilities which accompanied that period's

record-low after—tax interest rates was contemporaneous with a surge in

U.S. housing/real estate wealth and housing construction, while an

acceleration of the rate of new debt formation in Canada during the early

 Recall again that intercountry comparisons are somewhat more dubious than within—
 country historical comparisons because of uncertainties about measurement
 differences in the u.s. and Canada; thus it is not clear how significant it is that
 the Canadian rate of debt formation was generally somewhat higher than the U.S.
 rate.

seventies (also a record—low real interest rate period) was also

accompanied by a construction boom and a rapid accumulation of tangible

assets (Table #11)

      There are also links more subtle than that implied by the NIA one-for—

one liabilities—for—wealth tradeoff assumption.           Probably the most
important has to do with the fact that housing and real estate are

inelastically supplied in the short run, so that any rapid increase in

demand should produce a rapid run-up in prices, which would then decline

slowly back into equilibrium. Chart #6 presents a comparison of the annual

increase in the real market price of housing in the U.S. and Canada (see

Table #5 for the data and for a description of sources) .    Two extraordinary

facts emerge from the chart.        The first is that the early part of the

seventies witnessed an extremely rapid increase in prices of housing in

Canada, coinciding closely with the above-mentioned acceleration in

liabilities. The corresponding revaluation of housing wealth produced a

surge in net wealth saving in Canada; according to the NBS the real value

of personal holdings of housing and land increased by 65% between 1970 and

1976, and new construction, although high, can only account for a small

portion of this. After 1975, however, Canadian housing price increases

generally failed even to keep up with inflation, causing a downward
revaluation of assets.      In the U.S., on the other hand, housing prices in

the early seventies barely outpaced inflation, and tangible wealth growth

was slow, but in the middle and later seventies (when the tax incentives to

liabilites   were so strong   and borrowing accelerated) they grew rapidly, as
did   tangible   wealth. Prices (and tangible wealth) fell in both countries

during the recession of the early eighties, but the effect in Canada was

much more severe, possibly because the Canadians were not eligible for the

generous tax incentives which allowed U.S. consumers to maintain relatively

high mortgage borrowing during this period.

   The final difference in the wealth saving experiences of the U.S. and

Canada is that during the recession of the early eighties Canadians

experienced considerably larger real capital losses across the board,

partly because the Canadian recession was more severe than that in the U.S.

and partly because inflation persisted somewhat longer in Canada. Under

the hypothesis that individuals increase saving to compensate for capital

losses and decrease saving in response to capital gains (an implication of

the life cycle and permanent income hypothesis views of saving
determination; see Friend and Lieberman (1975) for a statement and

empirical tests), there should be a negative relationship between the level

of personal wealth and the private saving rate.       It is true that the

sustained increase in Canadian NIA saving coincided with the slowdown in

the growth in Canadian wealth, and that Canadian saving was highest in the

early eighties when losses were greatest. By contrast, in the U.S. where

wealth revaluation experiences were more favorable after 1976, the national

accounts basis saving rate did not grow.

IV.,Econometric Analysis

    One problem with the preceding analysis is that, while examining

individual questions in detail, it fails to provide a framework for

assessing the overall importance of the different factors in influencing

the saving rate. We address this issue now by considering three measures

of such differences in the context of the regressions reported in Section

II. We have added four independent variables to the regressions: the level

of sheltered saving as a fraction of disposable income, the weighted
                                                                              31



average real after—tax rate of return on financial assets, the overall

government deficit/surplus, and the ratio of personal wealth to GNP.

(Results are reported in Table #6)

Sheltered Savings

    In essentially all of our regression specifications the coefficient for

the level of sheltered savings was significantly positive, with
coefficients between —1 and —2 and corrected t statistics which were

significant at the 5% level. A literal interpretation of this result would

be that an increase in sheltered savings was associated with a 150%

increase in private savings, a result which is difficult to explain except

on the basis of the Cagan-Katona recognition effect hypothesis. From a

mechanical standpoint, the reason for this result is that the period of

high sheltered saving in Canada was also the period of higher total private

saving, and the increase in total saving was even larger than that in

sheltered saving.   It should be noted that when similar regressions were

run for the countries individually, the sheltered saving coefficient in the

u.s. was not significant, while that in Canada was highly significant.

    An alternative variable variable intended to capture the effect of

sheltered savings programs is the weighted average interest rate, which

attempts to measure the average rate of return on all personal saving by

combining the rate on sheltered and on unsheltered assets using appropriate

•weights corresponding to the relative sizes of the two types of saving.

This variable was usually estimated with coefficients between .6 and .9,

indicating that a 1% increase in the weighted interest rate would elicit an

increase in saving of .6 to .9% of C-NP.

    The budget deficit variable received coefficients ranging between -. 9
                                                                              32



and —1.1, with high t—statistics (Table #6). Again interpreting literally,

this would mean that an increase in government dissaving is associated with

a roughly matching increase in private saving -   the   result predicted by

Ricardian equivalence. Once again, however, caution should be exercised in

interpreting this result, since it is due entirely to the fact that the

period of highest saving in Canada, roughly post 1976, was also the period

of the escalating Canadian government deficit. Individual country

regressions show that essentially the whole significance of the
coefficients on government deficit differentials is due to the trends in

Canada after 1976, while the U.S. results are insignificant for all

periods.

   The final variable included in the regressions was the level of

personal wealth as a fraction of disposable income, which was intended to

test whether movements in national accounts basis saving might reasonably

be interpreted as resulting from efforts by consumers to maintain their

level of real wealth in the face of fluctuations in asset values due to

revaluations of their asset portfolios. The coefficient was of the correct

sign (negative) and was very strongly significant in all of the
specifications of the model, and (unlike most of the other significant

variables) was even significant in most specifications which did not

include data after 1977. This suggests that both independent movements in

asset values and the housing market booms which we attributed partially to

low after-tax rates of interest may have affected saving.

V. Conclusion

   This paper has identified three important factors contributing to the

large divergence between the private saving rate in the U.S. and Canada.

They are the greater tax incentives for financial savings in Canada, the

greater tax disincentives for borrowing to purchase tangible assets in

Canada, and the larger budget deficits recently experienced in Canada. At

this point it is difficult to gauge their relative importance since the

empirical results are driven largely by the experience of the late 1970s
and the 1980s.    But the Canadian experience does serve to call into

question the widely accepted presumption that there is little that public
