                                          ABSTRACT

Education is strongly related to participation in the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI)
program. To explore this relationship, we describe the correlation between education and DI
participation, and then explore how four factors related to education – health, wealth, occupation,
and employment –feature in this correlation. We label these four factors “pathway” variables.
We find that a large component of the relationship between education and DI participation – more
than one-third for men, and over two-thirds for women – can be attributed to the correlation of
education with health, and of health with DI receipt. We use data from the Health and Retirement
Study for the 1992-2012 period to explore the corresponding roles for each of the pathway
variables, and also to study how changes over time in these variables, such as the widening gap
between the health status of those with high and low educational attainment, have affected DI
participation.

        Understanding the relationship between education and Social Security Disability
Insurance (DI) participation is critical to projecting future trends in DI participation. The
educational attainment of cohorts approaching the traditional retirement age has
changed significantly in recent decades. In 1972, the percentages of men approaching
retirement age (50 to 62) with less than a high school degree, a high school degree,
some college, and more than a college degree were 48, 30, 11, and 12 respectively. In
2012, the percentages in these education groups were 10, 31, 28, and 31 respectively.
If there is a relationship between educational attainment and DI receipt, then these
changes in the educational composition of the population need to be considered in
projecting future DI utilization rates and program outlays.
       Several recent papers, including Autor, Katz and Kearney (2006), Goldin and
Katz (2008), and Acemoglu and Autor (2012), have emphasized the relationship
between the changing educational composition of the population and the dramatic
restructuring of the U.S. labor market in recent decades. There is growing concern that
the growth in the education of the workforce has failed to keep pace with the growth of
high-skill jobs. One widely studied consequence of restructuring has been growing
earnings inequality or “job polarization.” The restructuring of the economy has likely
also influenced retirement and disability decisions.
        This paper considers how the evolving educational composition of the workforce
may have affected rates of DI participation. The focus is on the take-up of disability
benefits by persons who are over the age of 50 but have not yet reached the Social
Security early retirement age of 62. This age restriction is motivated by the concern that
DI is used by many as a route to early retirement. A related study by Cutler and Lleras-
Muney (2010) considers the strong relationship between education and rates of
disability in old age, defined as functional disability of persons over the age of 65. They
find that those who have spent much of their career in a blue-collar job, those who
smoke, and those who are obese, are much more likely to report late-life disabilities.
Each of these factors, in turn, is closely correlated with education.
       This paper is divided into four sections. In the first, we use descriptive data to
highlight the strong relationship between education and DI participation. In section two,
we focus on the role of four “pathways,” health, employment history, occupation, and
wealth, through which education can affect the decision to apply for DI benefits. We
develop and estimate an empirical model to trace the effect of education through the
various pathways, and we also consider education’s direct effect. In section three, we
use our estimates to assess how changes in education may have affected the
probability of receiving DI benefits at each level of education over the 1992-2012 period
spanned by the HRS data, as well as over a longer post-1972 period. For the longer
period, we use data from the NHIS, SCF and CPS. There is a brief conclusion.


1. The Relationship between Education and DI: Summary Evidence
     Figures 1a and 1b show the percentage of women and men receiving DI benefits
who were between age 50 and age 62 in alternate years from 1992 to 2012. These

                                              1
figures use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), which surveyed persons
every two years between these dates. Both figures show the well-known upward trend
in DI participation in the recent past, evident here for all levels of education. The
upward trend is more pronounced for women than for men and is generally thought to
be the consequence of increasing labor force participation among women. The
differences by level of education are striking. Averaged over all years, the DI
participation rate for women with less than a high school degree is 12.3 percent and the
rate for women with a college degree or more is 2.4 percent. For men the comparable
rates are 16.9 percent and 2.6 percent.

        To describe how changing levels of education in the population have affected the
proportion of persons on DI, we need to better understand how education may affect DI
participation. We find it useful to distinguish direct and indirect effects. Direct effects
could arise, for example, if additional education raises an individual’s knowledge of the
DI system, or their capacity to navigate the DI application process, and therefore affects
the DI application and approval rate. Indirect effects could operate through individual
attributes that are related to the decision to participate in DI, such as health, wealth,
employment history, and occupation. We denote these indirect channels of influence as
“pathways,” and focus primarily on the effect of education on DI participation through
them. Our list of pathways is not exhaustive, and as a practical matter, it will never be
possible to empirically account for all of them. The direct effect we identify therefore
also includes the indirect effects of pathways we have not included in our estimation.
        We recognize that the pathway decomposition analysis that we present is only
one of many possible ways of parsing the reduced form effect of education on DI
participation rates, and that identifying causal pathways can be difficult, since
educational attainment is likely to be correlated with unobserved individual attributes
that may also affect the pathway variables. In spite of these challenges, we find the
pathway estimates potentially useful for understanding how the effect of education on DI
participation can change over time. We can, for example, obtain separate estimates of
how education affects health and how health affects DI participation. By distinguishing
two steps in this relationship, and attempting to estimate each of them, we can
demonstrate that even if there is no change over time in the distribution of educational
attainment in the population, there could be a change in the impact of education on DI
claiming. This could occur if the effect of education on pathway variables, such as
health, changed over time, for example if college graduates became healthier relative to
those with less education.
       We consider four pathways linking education to DI status: health, wealth,
employment history, and employment status. There are large differences by level of
education for each of these pathway variables. Figure 2 presents means of the four
pathway variables by level of education. The four panels are based on data for persons
age 50 to 62 from the HRS for the years 1992 through 2012. The HRS is a bi-annual
survey, so some individuals appear in the sample more than once (at different ages).
Persons who are currently receiving or have previously received DI benefits are
excluded. Thus the sample is comprised of persons who could potentially – if they meet
all program requirements - become DI recipients.

       The upper-left panel in Figure 2 shows the relationship between self-reported
health and the level of education. Each respondent was asked to report his or her
health on a five point ordinal scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4= very good, 5 =
excellent). The panel reports the average of these responses. The differences by
education level are striking. On average, men with at least a college degree report their
health to be nearly a full category higher than men with less than a high school degree.
The self-reported health gap between women with high and low levels of education is
more than a full category.
        The next panel shows how wealth differs by level of education. Because there is
enormous variation in wealth, and substantial reporting error, we use the respondent’s
wealth percentile in each year rather than the level of wealth. Our definition of wealth
includes home equity and the net value of other real estate, business assets, and
financial assets. IRA, 401(k) and Keogh balances are included in financial assets, but
the capitalized value of defined benefit plan income and Social Security benefits is not.
For this analysis the unit of observation is the person, but we measure wealth at the
household level and then assign it to each household member. We use household
measures because it is difficult to assign ownership of assets, such as housing or jointly
held financial assets, to each individual household member. Wealth differences by level
of education are substantial for both men and women. On average, men (women) with
a college degree or more are in the 66th (65th) percentile of the wealth distribution.
                                                                                4
Men (women) with less than a high school degree are, on average, in the 30st (28th)
percentile of the wealth distribution.
        The third panel in Figure 2 shows education-related differences in the percentage
of respondents who report that their longest-held job was a blue-collar job. These
differences are again large, in part because many jobs have educational entry
requirements. Men with less than a high school degree are 69 percentage points more
likely to report having worked in a blue-collar job that are men with a college degree or
more. For women, the gap is about 45 percentage points.
       The final panel in Figure 2 shows the percentage of respondents who are
employed when surveyed, by level of education.1 For men, the employment rate
ranges from about 71 percent for men without a high school degree to over 87 percent
for those with a college degree. The range for women is quite a bit larger – 44 percent
of women with less than a high school degree are employed, but 79 percent of those
with a college degree or more are employed.


2. Estimating the Direct and Indirect Effect of Education on DI Participation
       We now examine the relationship between education and DI participation in the
HRS sample, and then develop an empirical model to estimate the impact of the various
pathway variables through which education may affect DI participation. The model is
closely related to the model used in Venti and Wise (2015), with modifications that allow
us to use the model to analyze historical DI claiming behavior.
        The outcome of interest is whether a person who has not previously received DI
benefits will begin receiving benefits in a particular year. The process that leads to
receipt of disability benefits involves many steps and is complex. A person must have a
physical or mental impairment that prevents them from engaging in a “substantial
gainful activity” and have a qualifying work history (or be the spouse, child, or caretaker
for the children of a disabled worker). Persons with disabilities must then apply and be
approved by the local Disability Determination Services office. Our indicator for whether
a person who has not previously received DI benefits begins receiving benefits
collapses all of these steps into a single outcome.
       We restrict the analysis to persons between the ages of 50 and 62 and
emphasize the possibility that DI might be used by these persons as a route to early
retirement. Persons over the age of 62 are excluded because they become eligible for
early Social Security benefits at that age. Estimates are based on the 1992 to 2012
waves of the HRS. There are approximately two years between each of the 11 waves of

1
 Years of labor market experience might be a better indicator of work capacity than the measure of employment
used here. A variable measuring work experience is available in the HRS and we used it in early versions of the
analysis. However, we dropped it for two reasons. First, the reporting error rate for this variable is apparently
very high. Second, the analysis in a later section of this paper requires data (obtained from sources other than the
HRS) for each pathway variable back to 1972. There are no data sources that contain useable measures of labor
market experience over this time period.

                                                         5
the HRS. For each wave we consider only those persons who have not previously
received DI. An important consideration is that DI benefits cannot commence until at
least five months after the disability onset.2 This waiting period means that each
pathway variable must be measured at least five months prior to the date at which DI is
initially received. The baseline data (including the pathway variables) are only available
at the date of each survey interview. We thus ask: Given a person’s baseline
information (health, wealth, etc.) at the date of the interview, what is the probability that
the person will become a first-time DI recipient in the future? Using the date of the initial
receipt of DI benefits, we can determine if the respondent began receiving DI in a two
year window that commences six months after the survey interview from which the
baseline data are obtained. For example, if a respondent is interviewed on June 1,
2000, we collect values of the pathway variables on this date. Our indicator of DI
receipt in this case is whether the respondent began receiving DI in the two-year
window between December 1, 2000 and December 1, 2002.
       Table 1 reports estimates of the relationship between the initial receipt of DI
benefits, education, and our four pathway variables. These estimates combine data
from the 1992 to 2012 waves of the HRS, so each HRS respondent may contribute
multiple observations to the sample. Standard errors are adjusted to reflect this. We
included year effects in the specification, but could not reject the null hypothesis that
they are zero.
       Consider, for example, a respondent first observed in the HRS at age 50 in 1992,
who first received DI benefits in 1999 at age 57. Information on the pathway variables
and initial DI participation will be obtained at ages 50, 52, 54 and 56. At ages 50, 52
and 54 the respondent is coded as a nonparticipant in DI. At age 56 the respondent is
coded as a new DI participant because the respondent begins receiving benefits in the
2 year window that begins six months after the interview date. Subsequent
observations for this respondent are excluded from the analysis because the
respondent has already commenced receipt of DI benefits.
       Estimates are obtained by probit and the marginal effects of each covariate on
the probability of initial DI receipt over a two year period are shown in Table 1. To put
these estimates in perspective, it is helpful to note that the percentage of persons who
become DI recipients in any two year period is quite low – about 1.2% for men and
1.0% for women.




2
  Moreover, not all initial applications are approved. Typically between 40 and 50 percent of all DI
recipients were approved after (sometimes multiple) re-application, thus further delaying the receipt of
benefits for many eventual recipients.

        The first panel of Table 1 shows estimated marginal effects for three levels of
education (the lowest level – less than a high school degree – is excluded). This
specification excludes the pathway variables. All but one of the six estimates is
statistically significant. The estimated effects in the table pertain to changes in the
probability of initially receiving DI benefits. For expositional purposes, the discussion
below will multiply these effects by 100 and interpret them as percentage point changes.
The estimates suggest that having obtained a high school degree is associated with a
reduction in the rate of DI participation of about 0.23 percentage points for men and
about 0.34 percentage points for women, relative to the DI participation rate for
someone without a high school degree. Higher levels of educational attainment are
associated with even lower probabilities of DI claiming. Relative to a person without a
high school degree, a man with a college degree or more is 1.84 percentage points less
likely to claim DI and a woman with a college degree or more is 1.41 percentage points

                                                      7
less likely to claim. By comparison with the underlying probability of initially receiving
DI, these differences by level of education are substantial.
        The middle panel of Table 1 shows the estimated marginal effects for each of the
pathway variables in a specification that excludes the “direct” effect of education.
Pathway variables include the respondent’s self-reported health status as measured on
a five point scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4= very good, 5 = excellent), the
respondent’s household wealth percentile in each wave, and indicator variables for
whether the respondent was married, whether the respondent’s longest tenure job was
blue-collar, and whether the respondent was employed.3 Employment status is
measured is at least six months prior to the beginning of the person’s first DI episode.
The estimated correlation between health and subsequent DI participation is large,
negative and statistically significant for both men and women. A higher value of self-
reported health indicates better health, so a one unit increase in the subjective health of
a male (say from good to very good) is associated with a drop in the likelihood of initial
DI receipt by 0.74 percentage points. The comparable reduction for women is 0.88
percentage points. The wealth percentile is negatively related to initial DI participation
and statistically significant for both men and women. Moving up 10 percentile points in
the wealth distribution (say from the 50th percentile to the 60th percentile) is associated
with approximately a 0.1 percentage point reduction in the probability of DI receipt for
and women. Marital status is unrelated to DI participation for both men and women and
a blue-collar work history has a small positive effect for men, but little effect for women.
Prior employment is negatively related to initial DI receipt for both men and does not
have any relationship for women.
        The specification in the last panel includes the pathway variables as well as
indicators for the level of education. This specification provides evidence on the direct
effect of education, the component that is independent of the pathway variables. The
estimated marginal effects for the education variables suggest little direct effect of
education on DI participation for men. For women, the marginal effects associated with
a high school degree and college attendance (but no degree) are unexpectedly positive
and statistically significant. The effect of having a college degree is not statistically
significant. Thus for women, there is some evidence of a direct effect of education, and
this effect appears to be nonlinear. Including education measures directly in the
specification does not change the estimated coefficients on the pathway variables in
most cases. This suggests that although education is closely related to the pathway
variables, as illustrated in Figure 2, this association does not prevent reasonably precise
estimation of the association between pathway variables and the DI participation rate
even when the education variable is included in the specification.

  Venti and Wise (2015) use a health index constructed from respondent reported medical conditions and
functional limitations. In principal, the constructed index is preferred to the subjective (and ordinal) self-reported
health variable used here. However, in a later section of this study we use the estimates from Table 1 to calculate
the probability of DI participation back to 1972. To make these calculations we need data for each of the pathway
variables. The data required to construct the health index are not available prior to 1992, but self-reported health
status is available back to 1972, so we use self-reported health status to obtain the estimates in Table 1.

                                                          8
       These results suggest that the direct effect of education, the effect above and
beyond whatever indirect effects are absorbed through the four pathway variables, is
negligible for men and modest for women. However, the indirect effect through the
pathways may be substantial. To explore the indirect effects, we need to consider not
just how each pathway variable affects DI, but also how much education affects each
pathway variable. This involves combining estimates of the pathway effects in Table 1
with estimates of the effect of education on each of the pathway variables. The simplest
way to estimate the effect of education on each of the pathways is to calculate the
difference between the means of each pathway variable for those with high and low
levels of education. These calculations are shown in Table 2 for men and women. The
key calculation is shown in the last column; it is the difference between the mean for
those with a college degree or more, and those with less than a high school education.

       The indirect effect of education through each of the pathways is the product of
the effect of education on a pathway (Table 2) and the effect of each pathway on the
probability of initially claiming DI. The difference in the probability of becoming a DI
beneficiary for someone with at least a college degree, and someone without a high
school degree, operating through pathway “X”, equals
                                                           dDI dX dDI

Here dDI / dX is the estimated marginal effect reported in Table 1 and  X College  X  HS  is
the difference between the mean of the pathway variable for the two education groups.
       We illustrate this decomposition for the health pathway. The estimated effect of
a one unit increase in self-reported health on the probability of initial DI receipt, the
dDI / dX term, is -0.0073 for men (from the last panel of Table 1). The estimate of the

                                                           9
education-related difference in health  X College  X  HS  is 0.94 percent for men (from the
last column of Table 2). Combining these estimates yields the estimated effect of
education through the health pathway: -0.0073 x 0.94 = -0.0069 for men or about 0.69
percentage points. This implies that the indirect effect of education through this
pathway could account for nearly 40 percent of the 1.84 percentage point difference
between the initial DI participation rate of a person with a college degree or more and
the rate for someone with less than a high school degree.
        Table 3 presents similar calculations for each of the other pathway variables.
The first two columns show the result of the calculations described above for men and
women. While for men, 0.69 percentage points of the difference between the DI
participation rate of those with at least a college degree and those with less than a high
school degree could be accounted for by the health pathway, for women, the
comparable estimate is 1.05 percentage points. The estimates suggest that the health
pathway is the most important, and the wealth pathway is next most important, in linking
education and DI participation. The last entry in each of the first two columns shows the
sum of the four pathway effects for men and for women. This sum is 1.04 percentage
points for men, relative to the 1.84 percentage point difference between the DI
participation rates of men with at least a college degree and men with less than a high
school degree as estimated in the probit equations that exclude pathway variables. The
sum of the pathway effects is nearly equal to the 1.41 percentage point education-
related difference for women.

    Note: Bold indicates significant at 10% level or better (for included pathway effects).

      The last two columns of Table 3 show the percentage of the total effect of
education that is accounted for by the sum of the pathway variables. For men, the
pathways account for 56.7 percent of the total effect of education on initial DI take-up.
Thus the “direct” effect of education – the effect of education not operating through the


                                                     10
pathways – is smaller than the sum of the pathway effects. For women, 99 percent of
the total effect is accounted for by the effect of education through the pathways.



3. Accounting for Time Series Variation in the Education/DI Relationship

       We now consider how the effect of education on DI participation changes over
time by exploring the changing education-related differences in the pathway variables.
We cannot reject the null hypothesis that all of the year effects are zero in equations like
those in Table 1 linking the four pathway variables to the probability of initial DI receipt.
This suggests a relatively stable relationship through time. We therefore assume that
the dDI / dX terms are constant for our sample period and for the prior two decades,
the 1972-1992 period.
       For each year, we can estimate the impact of education on DI claiming by
combining our estimate of the effect of a pathway variable with an estimate of the effect
of education on that pathway variable in that year. By differencing these estimates
across years, we can investigate how much of the change in DI participation over time
can be accounted for by education-induced variation in the pathway variables. This
measure of the changing effect of education on DI claiming over time is independent of
the distribution of changes in the educational attainment of the population. For
example, the effect of education on health may vary over time if the more educated
become healthier relative to the less educated. This may affect DI participation even if
the relative proportions of the population with high and low education remains constant.
3.1 Estimates for the 1992-2012 Period
       Figures 3a and 3b show the relationship between education and the three most
consequential pathway variables – health, wealth and employment status – between
1992 and 2012. We exclude the fourth pathway, the blue-collar occupational indicator,
because the estimated effect of this pathway variable in Table 3 was very small for both
men and women. For men there is a modest decline in self-reported health at all levels
of education. The pattern for women is similar, although the decline in health is more
pronounced for women with lower levels of education. For both men and women the
wealth percentile of the lowest education group declines over time, which is not
unexpected because the fraction of persons without a high school degree has been
declining over time. With regard to wealth, the gap between the wealth percentile of
those with college or more and those with less than a high school has been widening
over time. Both of the profiles for the likelihood of employment also display a widening
gap over time between the highest and lowest levels of education.

       Figures 4a and 4b show the result of combining the means of the pathway
variables graphed in Figures 3a and 3b as well as marital status and blue-collar
occupation with the marginal effects of the pathway variables estimated in the last panel
of Table 1 to compute the predicted probability of receiving DI benefits at each level of
education for the years 1992 through 2012. We report predicted probabilities, the fitted
values from probit equations for each education group evaluated at the year-specific
means of the pathway variables, rather than observed probabilities of initiating DI
receipt each year. The time series on actual DI initial receipt probabilities is much
noisier than the time series of predicted values due to our small samples.

        For men and women with college degrees, the profiles are similar, showing a
gradual increase in the predicted probability of initial DI receipt that is consistent with
the gradual decline in health and employment for this group. However, the profiles for
persons with low levels of education are quite different. For example, the predicted
probability for men without a high school degree rises steadily between 1992 and 2008
and then falls off sharply in 2010 before leveling out in 2012. The decline can be traced
in part to a decline in the number of men in blue-collar occupations and lower levels of
employment and to an improvement in health during the Great Recession. The latter
reflects a broad tendency, reported for example by Ruhm (2000) and Cutler, Huang and
Lieras-Muney (2016), for health to improve during an economic downturn. For women
the profile for persons with less than a high school degree displays a less pronounced
decline in 2010 and a stronger rebound in 2012. These profiles show that over the past
12 years the likelihood of initial DI receipt for women has increased more for the less
educated than for the highly educated. This was also true for men until 2008, although
the pattern is not clear after that. This divergence can be attributed in substantial part to
the widening gaps in health, wealth and employment between those with more and less
education.
3.2. Estimates for the 1972-1992 Period
       The foregoing analysis was for the 1992-2012 period for which HRS data are
available. These data provided a strong base for understanding the importance of
education in affecting DI claiming. We would nevertheless like to obtain a longer-term
perspective on the relationship between education and DI receipt. Unfortunately there
is no single data source that includes data, by age and level of education, on DI receipt
and all of the pathway variables prior to the HRS, so we must combine data from
different sources.
        We make use of three: the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the Current
Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF). 4 Neither these
data sources nor any other publicly available data source contains information on DI
participation by age and level of education for years before 1988. The NHIS only
began collecting information on DI participation in 1998 and the CPS only includes
information on DI benefit receipt beginning in 1988. However, it is important to realize
that if we had data prior to 1992 on the pathway variables by age and level of education,
from any source, we would be able to impute DI participation in earlier years, even
without data on DI participation—if we assume that the education effects that we
estimate for the post-1992 period also apply to earlier years. That is, if we had
differences in health, wealth, occupation and employment by age and level of education
from any source, we could estimate DI participation. We could then compare our
estimates with aggregate (over all ages and levels of education) administrative data on
DI participation.



4
 Both the NHIS and CPS data were obtained from the IPUMS-USA project. See Flood et al. (2015) for details on the
NHIS and Minnesota Population Center (2015) for details on the CPS. The SCF data were downloaded from the
FRB website.

                                                      15
       We begin with the NHIS which includes data on health since 1972 by level of
education. The NHIS includes self-reported health measured using the same five
category scale used in the HRS since 1982 and using a four point scale in earlier
years.5 The mean of self-reported health for persons in the NHIS between the ages of
50 and 62 for each year between 1972 and 2012 is shown in Figure 5a for men and
Figure 5b for women. The mean of self-reported health for persons age 50 to 62 in the
HRS is also shown for alternate years between 1992 and 2012. Both figures suggest
that the health “gap” between those with high levels of education and those with low
levels of education that was evident in the HRS data has persisted over time. For both
men and women the health gap between those with a college degree or more and those
with less than a high school degree has widened over time – mean health for those with
more education has held steady at about 4 (on the five point scale), but the mean
reported health of those with less education has dropped from slightly over 3 to under 3.
This decline over time is more pronounced for women than for men. Beginning in 1992,
self-reported health is shown for respondents in both the NHIS and the HRS. In
general, the trends and levels evident in the NHIS data are similar to those in the HRS
data in the years that the two surveys overlap, but there are some discrepancies. In
particular, men and women with a college degree or more in the NHIS report better
health than their counterparts in the HRS.

 Prior to 1982 the scale was poor, fair, good and excellent. A fifth category, very good, was added in 1982. To
make the two scales compatible we applied the proportions for good, very good and excellent in 1982 to the sum
of good and excellent in 1981 (and earlier years) to create three categories. Calculations are made for cells defined
by year, gender and level of education. As Figure 5 shows, the “seam” effect between 1981 and 1982 is minimal.

        We use the CPS to obtain information for several other pathway variables by age
and level of education for the 1972 to 2012 period. These include marital status, a blue-
collar job indicator, and employment status. The blue-collar variable used in the
estimated model (using data from the HRS) was based on each respondent’s
occupation in the longest tenure job held, something that we can only approximately
match in the CPS data. The CPS definition for the blue-collar occupation is based on
the respondent’s occupation in the prior year.
       Wealth is not available in either the NHIS or CPS. Sources of data on wealth by
level of education include the Survey of Consumer Finances (approximately every three
years since 1983), the Survey of Income and Program Participation (for most years
since 1984), and Panel Study on Income Dynamics (1984, 1989, 1994, and every other
year beginning 1999). We use the SCF because it offers the most comprehensive
measure of wealth and because it provides us with the earliest start date, 1983.
      Figures 6a and 6b show profiles for the wealth percentile by level of education for
persons age 50 to 62 in each year since 1972. Estimated wealth percentiles from the
SCF were calculated for the years 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004,
2007, and 2010 and values for other years are imputed.6 The figures also show wealth
percentiles from the HRS for 1992 through 2012. The longer-term trends are similar,
but some shorter-term cyclical differences are evident.

  Years between the SCF surveys are interpolated. We use year-to-year changes in aggregate household net worth
from the FRB balance sheet to extend the SCF wealth series back from 1983 to 1972 and forward from 2010 to
2012. This procedure implicitly assumes that the ratio of the wealth percentile of the high education group to the
wealth percentile of the low education group remains constant over the imputation period.

       Taken together, Figures 5a-b and 6a-b suggest that the differences across
education groups in the two principal pathway variables have not been constant over
time. The gap between the health of the high and low education groups widens over
time as does (to a lesser extent) the gap between the wealth of these two education
groups. An analysis of the blue-collar occupation pathway (not shown) shows a

                                                                       18
narrowing of gap between high and low education groups for men and women. For
employment, the gap has been widening over time, particularly for men. The results
shown earlier based on the more recent HRS data suggest that these trends in pathway
variables may have important implications for the DI participation of each education
group.
        Given data for 1972 to 2012 on the pathway variables by level of education, and
assuming that the education effects for the post-1992 period also apply to earlier years,
we can predict DI participation by level of education in earlier years. We emphasize
that these predictions isolate the changing effect of education on DI claiming over time,
i.e. the changing differences between those with high and low education levels, and do
not account for the changing distribution of educational attainment in the population.
The profiles only reflect trends in DI claiming that are the consequence of changes over
time in the health, wealth, occupation and employment by level of education.
        Figures 7a and 7b present the results. For both men and women with a college
degree or more, the predicted probability of initial claiming declines through the early
1990’s and then levels off. The profiles for the other education groups have more of a
“U” shape, reaching a minimum typically in the mid to late 1980’s. It does appear that,
for either men or women, the probabilities of making an initial claim for high and low
education persons have diverged over the past 20 years. In 1990 the initial claim rate
of men with a college degree or more was about 4.28 times the claim rate of men
without a high school degree. By 2012 this ratio is 4.94 for men. For women the gap
between those with high education and those with low education increased even more,
from 3.51 to 4.31.

       The estimated profiles in Figures 7a and 7b hold the educational composition of
the population constant. However, the change in the educational composition of the
population over the past 40 years has been dramatic. CPS estimates of the percentage
of the population age 50 to 62 at each level of education in each year is shown in
Figures 8a and 8b.7 The fraction of this age group with less than a high school degree
has fallen sharply for both men and women. The proportion with a terminal high school
degree has also declined, substantially for women and marginally for men, since the
late 1980’s. For both men and women the percentage with at least some college and
the percentage with a college degree or more has increased.

 There is a discontinuity between 1991 and 1992 caused by a shift of emphasis from years of education to degree
receipt in the education question asked in the CPS.

       We also examine how the probability of initial claiming changes over time if we
allow for changes in the distribution of education in the population. Our analysis uses
the percentages graphed in Table 8 to weight the calculations from Table 7, which hold
education composition constant. The resulting profiles are shown by the solid lines in
Figure 9. Comparing Figures 7 and 9 suggests that the changing educational
composition of the population is an important driver of the overall trend in DI claiming.

        Figure 9 also shows data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) for the
percent of the population between the ages of 50 to 62 who are awarded disabled
worker benefits each year.8 The administrative data show much more year-to-year
variation than our calculations, which are based on the education-related changes in the
pathway variables and changes in the educational composition of the population, both
of which move gradually over time. As Liebman (2015) points out, major reforms to the
DI system in the late 1970’s and mid-1980’s had large effects on the incidence of new
claims. Some variation related to the business cycle is also evident.
       There are several other, more technical, reasons why our predicted DI initiation
probabilities may not track the observed aggregates. The estimates used to produce
the calculated profiles are based on all DI claimants, but the SSA profile pertains only to
awards (and not necessarily new awards) to disabled workers. SSA data by age and
year for new awards to qualifying spouses of disabled workers or for the caretakers for
the children of disabled workers are not publicly available and thus not included in the
8
 The calculations use data from Table 39 of SSA (2014) and Table 6.C7 of SSA (2015). The former source provides
DI awards by age and gender for 1970, 1975 and annually thereafter. Awards for 1972-1974 and 1976 to 1979
were imputed using the rate of growth of awards for all ages in the latter source.

dashed lines in Figure 9. This omission may be the source of the large discrepancy for
women in the first part of the figure. Another difference that may affect the fit is that the
“denominator” in the estimated rate excludes persons already receiving benefits in each
year, but the denominator in the SSA rate is the entire population age 50 to 62.
        We also caution that during the four decades that are spanned by the data in
Figure 9, there are potential changes in the meaning of different educational attainment
levels. It is possible that the relative skills associated with each of the four levels of
education may have changed over time—a high school degree in 1970 may not
represent the same skill set as a high school degree in 2014. Thus, the increasing DI
claiming rates over time that we see for persons with less than a high school degree
may reflect declining skill levels as those without a high school degree become a
smaller and more select group. Bound et al. (2015) raise a similar point with respect to
apparent declines in longevity among persons with less than a high school education,
and they propose replacing the level of education with the quantile in the education
distribution as a way of accounting for the changing meaning of a high school degree
over time. Applying a similar strategy here is a topic for future research.


4. Conclusion
        The likelihood that a person will be a Social Security Disability Insurance (DI)
beneficiary is strongly related to that person’s educational attainment. There are
several potential explanations for this relationship. On the one hand, education may
have “direct” effects on DI behavior – for example, persons with more education may be
more knowledgeable of the DI system, or be better able to navigate the DI application
process. A more likely explanation is that education has indirect effects: education
affects characteristics of individuals which in turn affect DI participation. Persons with
higher levels of education may be in better health, and thus be less likely to become
disabled. Those with more education may work in certain jobs that make them less
likely to become disabled. We refer to these indirect channels through which education
may affect disability claiming as pathways, and we focus on four: health, wealth,
occupation and employment. We estimate the relative strength of the four pathways
and use our estimates to explore how education has affected DI participation over the
past four decades.
       We focus on factors influencing the probability that persons age 50 to 62 will
make a first-time claim for DI benefits. Among women, nearly all of the strong negative
relationship between educational attainment and DI claiming can be attributed to the
indirect effect of education through the pathway variables. Roughly three-quarters of
the DI participation “gap” between women with high and low levels of education is due
to health, that is, those with lower levels of education have poorer health that results in
higher initial DI claiming rates than persons with higher levels of education. A little
under one-quarter of the “gap” is accounted for by differences in wealth associated with
different levels of education. The effects of the other pathway variables and the direct
effect of education are minimal.


                                             23
       For men, the pathway variables as a group account for more than half of the total
effect of education on initial DI take-up. Health is also the most important pathway,
accounting for 37.5 percent of the difference between the DI participation rates of
persons with high levels of education and persons with low levels of education. Again,
wealth is the second most important pathway, accounting for about 16.4 percent of the
“gap.” In contrast to the results for women, we find a large direct effect of education on
DI participation for men, about 43.3 percent of the “gap.” Because it is never possible to
empirically account for all of the indirect pathways, and we consider only four, the direct
effect we identify may include the indirect effect of omitted pathways.
        We also use our estimates to predict the probability of a first-time DI claim, by
level of education, within our sample period, 1992-2012, and in the previous two
decades. Our predicted profiles show the relationship between education and DI
claiming holding the distribution of educational attainment in the population constant;
they highlight the change in DI participation over time attributable to education-induced
variation in pathway variables. Widening health, wealth and employment disparities
between persons with high and low levels of education during our sample period
generate higher rates of growth of initial DI claiming for the less educated than for the
more highly educated during our sample period.
       We also extend the analysis by using several other data sets to estimate the
effect of education on our four pathway variables for the 1972-1992 period. The
predicted probabilities of DI claiming for this earlier period again show that education-
related changes in the pathway variables are important contributes to trends in initial DI
claiming. These predicted probabilities do not account for changes in the distribution of
educational attainment in the population over time, but only for the changing differences
in the pathway variables between education groups.
       We also consider how changes over time in the distribution of educational
attainment in the population have affected DI claiming. Between 1972 and 2012, the
fraction of the population with low levels of education has declined dramatically and the
fraction with higher levels of education has increased. This change in the composition
of educational attainment in the population places downward pressure on disability
rates. Our estimates suggest that over the past two decades, the upward pressure on
DI rates arising from increasing educational disparities in health, wealth and
employment has been roughly offset by the downward pressure arising from the
declining fraction of the population with low levels of education.
        We caution that the relationships that we estimate are not necessarily causal.
Differences in educational attainment across individuals in our sample may not be
exogenous. There may be unobserved factors – childhood health, for example – that
affect educational attainment, each of the pathway variables, and the likelihood of
disability claiming. Our findings of the potential empirical magnitude of the pathway
effects suggest the need for further exploration of these issues, with attention to
identification strategies.
