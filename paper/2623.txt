                Sovereign Debt:   Is to Forgive   to Forget?



                                  ABSTRACT



     International lending to a less-developed country cannot be
based on the debtor's reputation for making repayments.           That is,

loans to LDCs will not be made or repaid unless          foreign creditors
have legal or other direct sanctions they can exercise against          a

sovereign debtor who defaults.       Even if some lending is feasible
because of direct sanctions, having a reputation for repayment in

no way enhances a small LDC's ability to borrow.

     The period from 1973 to 1982 saw a startling increase in the

volume of international loans to less-developed countries.           A
central issue in analyzing LDC loan contracts is whether, and by

what mechanism, these contracts can be enforced.)          Whereas

domestic    loans are generally supported by substantial collateral,

the assets that can be appropriated       in the event of a foreign

sovereign's    default are generally negligible.2        For this reason

one must look beyond collateral to find incentives for repayment.

     One approach,    first explored by Eaton and Cersovitz (1981)

and adopted by many others       since3, assumes that creditors have

legal rights whatsoever (including even the right to seize the

county's    assets abroad).    This line of research holds that a

small LDC is able to borrow abroad only if it can maintain a

reputation for repaying its loans.        Lenders are willing to rely

on a country's "reputation       for repayment" (so the argument goes>

because they believe that if       a country    ever fails to honor its

implicit debt contract,       it will tarnish    its reputation and risk

being cut off from international       capital markets in the future.


        Theories that ignore contract enforcement problems
suggest that there should be far greater integration of world
capital markets than currently occurs.  For a survey of the
empirical evidence on international capital mobility, see
Obstfeld (1986).

           Though Iran in 1979 was an exception.
         Other examples include Manuelli (1986), Eaton, Gersovitz
and Stiglitz (1986), Grossman and Van Huyck (1987), and Cole and
English (1987). Eaton and Gersovitz also considered direct
punishments.

The obvious appeal of pure reputation theories          is that they seem

robust    to institutional detail.         One does not have to speoulate

on the legal rights of creditors within their own oountries'

oourts,   or on the ability of oreditors         to induoe their

governments       to take retaliatory motions.

     But we have oome to query reputation-for-repayment theories,

not to praise them.        We prove, under rather general oonditions,

that reputation-for-repayment models oannot work.           Loans   to LDCs

are possible only if creditors have legal rights          suoh as the

ability to impede       a county's   trade, or to seize its finmnoial

assets abroad (whirh is the real reason why a defaulter suffers
reduced access to capital markets).4 Otherwise,           creditors must
be able to threaten the       debtors      interests outside its borrowing

relationships.        (E.g., creditors may be able to persuade their

governments       to intervene militarily.)     Having a good reputation
for repaying       foreign loans does not in any way enhance the
ability of    a   smsll LDC to borrow abroad.




        For a discussion of the legal evidence on this point, and
an assessment of its probable empirical significance, see Bulow
and Rogoff (1987), or Alexander (1987).

         Our paradigm is of a small country that faces competitive,

risk-neutral       foreign investors.5                  The country is small in the

sense that it cannot affect the world interest rate r.

         The country is inhabited by a single,                       infinitely-lived
representative agent.              Since the proof of our theorem is based on

an arbitrage argument,             it is not necessary to place any

restrictions on the agent's utility function other than that she

prefers having more to having less.
         There is one good, which the country both produces and
consumes.        The country's production function is given by


                                                                                        (1)

where y denotes output,            and        t   subscripts       denote   time.

consumption and Y is the output of the rest of the world.
         The sequence       of events within any given period t is as

follows:       First,   a   shock         occurs which affecta output in the



        It is straightforward to extend our analysis to the case
of risk-averse foreign lenders.

current period and possibly in future periods.                        After observing
the shock,     the country decides how to divide
                                                                   y between    I_,    c,
and   X.     Net exports can be used either to make payments on

various     loans,   or to increase asset holdings abroad,                      and

can be observed by everyone;                there is no privatt inforaation

about aggregate variables.6

      It is not necessary here to formally characterize the

benefits     a small      country aight get from having access              to world

capital aarksts.          Fundamentslly,            however,    the main benefits all

have to do with consumption smoothing.7                        Through short-term
borrowing and lending,             a country        cen avoid having to match the

exact timing of import expenditures                      and export receipts.    Having
access     to long-term loans allows a country to maintain

consumption levels in the short-term while taking advantage of

high-yielding domestic investment opportunities.                        Finally, by

taking advantage of world capital markets, a country can better
insure     itself against many types of risk (such as untertainty

over its terms of trade)

      The world market value of a                       .aim to the country's entire

future gross income           is given     by

      with probability one.8   The force of this assumption   is to

rule out any "Ponzi"-type      reputational   contracts, under which a
borrower can always expect, in present value terms, to be             a net

importer of capital over some finite horizon.




        The assumption that P is finite is slightly stronger than
the assumption that the market value of the country's net income
(net of investment) is finite.  However, the assumption that
is finite can easily be replaced by the assumption that the P0
market value of the world's net income is finite. All our
results go through under this alternative assumption, with only
very minor changes in the proofs.

                    III.   TYPES OF LENDING CONTRACTS


       In a pure reputation-for-repayment ("reputation")       contract
a country's    foreign creditors have no effective legal recoucse in
the event of default,      They cannot   interfere with the country's

trade;    they cannot even seize any financia1   assets    it may hold

abroad.    The worst fate that can befall a country which defaults

on a reputation contract is that it will never again be allowed

to write reputation contracts.      However,   the defaulting country

cannot be cut off from international capital markets entirely

Though it may no longer be able to borrow for domestic
Investment,    it can still buy consumption-insurance contracts by

paying cash in advance.      A "cash-in-advance" contract is just a

conventional insurance contract under which a country makes a

payment up front in return for a state-contingent,         non-negative
future payment.     Implicitly,   we are aasuming that there are

foreign investors who can make commitments.       These commitments

are enforced by the legal system in investors'         countries.    Thus a

small country can hold foreign assets such as bank accounts,

treasury bills, stocks and other state-contingent aaaeta.9 Of
course,    it can also stockpile reserves of precious metals and

foreign currency.

A.   Reoutation Contracts

       Suppose the country were allowed to have    a    reputation

        Notable efforts to study international lending in a
general equilibrium framework include Manuelli (1986) and Cole
and English (1987)
contract which, in essence,       is an   implicit contract.   For our

purposes, it is not necessary to ask what set of off-the-
equilibrium-path beliefs might support the contract, nor is it

important to ask whether the contract is optimal in any aense)0
All one needs to know is that any reputation contract must

implicitly specify   a   state-contingent payment                  for

all possible realizations    of      and          and for all t, where
                                           'tl'
           —


    Note   that for an implicit contract to be equilibrium,        it

must be in the country's interest to honor the contract in every

possible state of nature.     In particular,      the country must never

have an Incentive   to default on Its reputation contract and

switch completely over to cash-in-advance contracts.           (Otherwise,
the contract is not the true implicit contract.)

     Given the implicit contract, one can write the world market
value of the country's reputation debt at time t,              as the
                                                          D,
expected present-discounted value of its future repayments:


         For example, the candidate equilibrium can involve
trigger-strategies as in Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), Eaton,
Gersovitz and Stiglitz (1986), and Grossman and Van Huyck (l987'.
Alternatively, the equilibrium can involve lenders having
imperfect information about the country's utility function
(provided they know that it has a positive marginal utility of
consumption)
     11   This specification does not preclude randomized
strategies. One can view 8, as a vector, one of whose elements
has no effect on fundamentls such as output. If the foreign
investor can make legal commitments, then the implicit contract
and the explicit legal contract will coincide whenever P      0. In
states of nature where P    0, any explicit legal contract is
meaningless, by assumption.

Clearly,    Dt
                 can never exceed         W,       the world market value of a

claim to the country's entire future output stream.                       Thus within

any reputational equilibrium there must exist some
o    k'    1, such that   with probability one Vt,

Let k be the amallest k' such that condition (5) holds.


B.   Cash-in Advance Contracts

      In a cash-in-advance contract,                 the country pays the amount

                        t in exchange for a contract which pays
At at the end of period
               in period t + 1.  (A cash-in-advance contract can
0t+19t+I'
always be indexed to all the same variables as the implicit
                     12                                -
       -
reputation contract.    ) Even if the country has forfeited
                                           -
                                                            its

reputation for honoring contracts, a foreign investor should

always be willing to accept a cash-in-advance contract as long as
it satisfies two requirements13:


      E{C+i(et+1 1)
                                  —    (1 + r)A1                           (6)



      12    We shall discuss           the issue of indexstion in more detail
later in section V.
     13 Here we are                       -             -       -
                     only              defining one-period cash-in-advance
contracts.  In principle,              the country could make s payment in t—1
in exchange for (strictly              positive) state-contingent payments in
t, t+l, t+2, etc.  It can              be shown, however, that multi-period
cash-in-advance contracts are superfluous.

      Condition   (6)   states that the contract must offer the risk-

neutral   foreign investor the market rate of return. Condition            (7)

says that there can be no state of nature in which the country is

called upon to make positive payments in period           t +   1.
Obvious1y    one must also have At        0, but this condition holds

whenever (6) and    (7)   hold.   If one thinks    of the initial payment

                             then condition (7) can be interpreted as
A   as being collateral,

saying that the country's collateral must be sufficient to cover
its losses on the contract even in the worat possible state of

nature.

Straightforward substitution of (11) and (12) into (8),                                              (9)   and

(10) yields            immediate confirmation of (6).                              Thus,       the sequence of

cash-in-advance contracts is feasible.                                  Furthermore,              note that

instead of paying                    P    each period,             the country must contribute

       Thus if one traces     out the game tree governed by any

reputation contract, there must exist some node at which the

country can switch to a sequence of cash-in-advance contracts
which dominates the reputation contract.           The collateral for the

cash-in-advance contracts is drawn from funds the country would
otherwise have used to pay back its reputation contract.                     Despite
the fact that the collateral may at first be quite small,                    it is

still sufficient to provide at least as much insurance as the

country could have obtained under the reputation contract.  A

reputation contract can only be equilibrium under the unrealistic
assumption that the country is not allowed to hold assets abroad,

B,     Reputation contracts when lenders have direct means fpt

punishins      default

        In the preceding analysis, we assumed that holders of

reputation contracts have no way to directly punish the country
if it repudiates.        Here we show that if there are some direct

costs which lenders can impose on a country in the event of

default,       then loans can sustained,     but only on the basis of these

costs.     A good reputation for repaying loans will not in any way

enhance    a   country's ability to borrow.

        Suppose that lenders have the ability to impose a random
penalty of                          if a borrower stands     in default in

penalty causes the country's period-t ourput ro be reduced by          ire.

Then we can generalize Theorem       I as follows:

     Actually,    the bound given by Theorem 2 may be too high,

since countries can typically bargain with their creditors.14

                      V.    LIMITATIONS AND EXTENSIONS
        Here we emphasize some limitations       on the scope of our

result.


A.     Reputation Outside the Scooe of the Lendins Relationship

        What if repudiation damages a country's general image beyond

just its reputation for repaying its loans?           One might,   for

example,    envision some countries as playing a tariff supergame,
in which either raising tariffs or defaulting on foreign debt

triggers a costly trade war.  Such a mechanism could conceivably
                                     15
support a poslttve level of lending.    However, Theorem 2

directly applies to this case.           The maximum amount the country is

allowed to borrow must be governed strictly by the costs of a
trade war.     If the costs of a trade war are very small,         then the

amount the country can borrow is very small,           We do not claim

that reputation piays no role in international          relations,   only
that a good reputation for repayina foreizn loans does not

enhance    a small   country's ability to borrow abroad.

B.     Non-Competitive Lenders
        Theorems 1 and     2 are   based on the standard assumption that

the country faces competitive          foreign investors.   In some sense,

the essence of our result is that if there are no gains for the

country in dealing with any specific lender, then reputation
contracts are impossible.           As long as the country faces

     15 Some of the broader incentives for
                                            repayment are
discussed by Feldstein, Decarmay, Narusawa and Krugiuan (1987, p.
41).
                                      14

competitive foreign investors, then any service provided by the
current lender (e.g., insurance) can equally well be provided by
a new investor.     It is possible,     of course,        that in practice

there may be some efficiency gain in having the country continue

to deal with its current lenders,            However, the upper bound on

any "reputation'    debt   is still only the real         cost to the countty

of switching its business to a new set of financial institutions.

It seems that this cost cannot be very large relative to the size

of most LDG's foreign debts.


C.   3jflgjli,jrQflemgjacfln
     We have assumed that the country can hold assets                abroad

which are indexed to the same observable exogenous shocks,                   D, as

in a reputation contract.      An alternative assumption is that               S   is

"observable but not verifiable."16 That             is,    the borrower, the

lender,   a all    potential lenders observe         8.    However, either

because it is costly to verify      8   in   court, or due to costs of

contracting,   the country is precluded from ever holding foreign

assets which are indexed to the shock.            It is doubtful that this

story can be used to explain reputation contracts of any
significant size.
     First,    it is hard to see what kind of shock would be

observable to a huge pool of potential (competitive)                lenders,       but

yet cannot be put into contracts.            (The concept of observable but

not verifiable shocks works better in the context of a bilateral


     16    Grossman and Van Huyck (1987) take this tack.

monopoly relationship.)               Second, much of the uncertainty that a

small country faces ia likely to be highly correlated with events
elsewhere      in the world.         Commodity price uncertainty,             for

example,      can clearly be hedged in world asset markets.                     So, too,

can shocka to world demand for the country's other goods;

certainly technology shocks are highly correlated with events
elsewhere in the world.              Even weather conditions can be highly

correlated across countries.                As long as the country is able to

lend in world capital             markets after a default,         it ought to be

able to construct a portfolio which is highly correlated with                         .
        FinalLy,
               to            the extent that foreign loans are used simply to

smooth predictable            seasonal fluctuations          in income, verification

is not an issue.              (Our theorem encompasses         this case.)


0.     Difficulties          in Observing the Countty's Actions

        Theorem l does not apply directly to the case where the

country has private information,                 though an extension might be

possible.17 Suppose,              for example,        that investors observe output,

y(8,   I),   but they do not directly      obsee      investment, I, or the

shock,       . In   this case, it is still possible to characterize any

reputational equilibrium as an implicit contract, except that the
country's payments, P0,             will   only be a function of y0

        tl' y02, .).     .         As before,        the   country always has the

option of switching over to cashin-advance contracts, which can


     17 Kletzer
                 (1984) considers some implications of private
information for LOG Loan contracts.  For a more recent example,
see Atkeson (1987).
                                             16

also be indexed to                However,    the terms of the post-

repudistion cash-in-advance contracts will depend on investors'
beliefs about    I
                     a,
                          I s-I etc.
                              ,           If a default at time a adversely

affects investors' beliefs about the country's capital stock,

this will hurt its ability to get good terms on its cash-in-

advance contracts (since investors will attach                 a   higher
probability to low realizations              of y).    Of course,    the country

may still be better off than under the reputation contract,

especially when       D     kW.
     The difficulty here is that sequential equilibrium places no
                                                            18
restrictions on investors' off-the-equilibrium path beliefs.

The resulting multiplicity of sequential equilibria is endemic in

models with private information.                  It seems unlikely that one can

obtain a definite result in the present context without applying

a   refinement of sequential equilibrium,              and without fully

specifying the country's utility function and production
function,    We conjecture that the intuition underlying the

present analysis should carry over to private information case,
but the question can only be resolved after further research.

       One should be cautious about attaching too much weight to

the importance of private information                 in the context of LOt loan

contracts.     For one thing,        9   is an agaresate shock, and it is

hard to argue that aggregate information                 can be private.       We

suspect that in the typical LOG, the country's leaders do not
know any more about         8 than do the country's major lenders.     Also,


       18   See Kreps and Wilson (1982)
                                       17

as we have argued above in section V.C,                is probably highly

correlated with external variables, and therefore the component
which    can potentially be private      information       ia minor.


F.   The Country's Preferences        are Unobservable

        As long as the country's actions are observable,               and as long

as investors believe that the country prefers having more to

having less, tnen it does not matter whether investors know the

country's preferences exactly.         Theoreir I would still apply,

F.   Restrictions   on the Use of Foreign-Currency Reserves

        Some authors have tried to provide            a role for   reputation by

assuming that a country cannot use its foreign-currency reserves
to buy irports needed for investment.                They assume that foreign
investment goods can only       b    urchased with new loans.19             Thus a

country can gain by repaying a lender P dollars from its foreign
currency reserves in exchange for           P    r   dollars worth of new

loans.

        We do not think such loans should be classified as

"reputational", since the lender is assumed able to directly
interfere with the country's trade.             In any event,      it is hard to

justify the assumption that a country cannot buy the same goods
with its own foreign-currency earnings that it can buy with

lenders'    foreign currency.       We believe that the conventional

assumption,    that what a country can buy depends only on how much

money it has available to spend, is the correct one.

     19
         See, for example, Eaton and Gersovitz (1983), Cole and
English (1987), or Grossman and Van Huyck (1987).

   VI.     OTHER DEFICIENCIES IN REPUTATION-FOR-REPAYMENT MODELS

     There are a number of empirical and theoretical        problems
with reputstion-for-repayment models beyond those        problems raised
thus fsr.     We have not even mentioned the coordination problem

inherent in a reputation model with a huge number of potential
lenders.     How long will a country which defaults be shut out of

credit markets? The greater the length of the "punishment

period",    the more a country can be lent.      But each creditor must

know how long other creditors will wait before resuming lending.
Of course,    the coordination problem is mitigated if the legal

system gives existing creditors equal seniority with any new
lenders, as in real-world debt contracts.         But then LDC debt

contracts    should be analyzed as a bsrgeining problem, not as       a

reputation-for-repayment problem.

     Eichengreen (1987), and Lindert and Morton (1987) have shown
that, historically,      the ability of LDC's to participate in credit

markets does not seem to depend on their past repayment records
It does depend on their volume of trade and their ONP.

Furthermore,    as Wynne (1951) and Winkler (1933)     document it is

typically necessary for      a   country to settle (reschedule)   its past

defaults before it is allowed access to new loans.

     Finally,    a   legal/bargaining approach predicts that the
countries of jurisdiction for international        loans will be major

creditor countries.       Reputation-for-repayment models make the
faisifiable    prediction that lenders should be equally willing to
have contracts adjudicated in debtor-country courts.

                                  VII.     CONCLUSIONS

            In reputational            models of LDC borrowing, a country is

willing to make transfers to foreign lenders in order to preserve
its reputation for repaying debts.                 We have shown, under rather

general   conditions,         that "reputation"       (for repayment) contracts

cannot be equilibrium unless              the country is prohibited froa

holding assets abroad.            But this prohibition seems to contradict

the central premise           of reputation-for-repayment models --         thsc
the only sanction creditors can impose in the event of a default

is a refusal to extend new loans.                 True, the set of assets

available to the country in the world's vast and varied capital

markets may not quite span the set of shocks to which an implicit

reputation contract can be indexed.                  But as long as it comes

close,    the maximum size of reputation contracts is quite limited.

     We believe that Western loans to small developing countries

in fact depend on the legal snd political rights of lenders

within their own countries,20                   The reason that an LOC cannot

simply default        on its loans and switch to cash-in-advance capital

market transactions is that existing creditors can seize its

assets abroad.2'         Admittedly,       there are many uncertainties

                      detailed discussion,     and Rogoff (1987),
or Alexander (1987).   Lenders are able to hinder a defaulter's
goods market transactions as well as its capital market
transactions.   As we argue in our earlier paper, the main cost of
repudiation may well be in lost gains from trade.
     21
          Eaton, Gersovitz and Stiglitz (1986) argue that
insurance and consumption smoothing can only provide a motive for
debt repayments in an infinite-horizon context.   Their discussion
is based on a reputational contract.   In a contract backed up by
legal rights, there is no need for the country's (leader's)
                                               20

surrounding the actual dsmage which                 a   lender can inflict on an

LOC; it is a gray area of Western law. But if one wants                    to

understand LDC loan contracts, then chese costs aust be acudied
further.       Reputation for repayment considerations are at most a

secondary factor.
     If countries who default auffer reduced access to world

capital markets,          does it really matter whether reputational or

legal sanctions are the cause?                  Yea, It certainly matters       from

an empirical perspective.                  If the cutoff is based on lenders'

legal rights,         then LDCa can bargain with their lenders, as in

Bulow and Rogoff <198?)            .   A   borrower cannot bargain over trigger-

atrategy beliefa.             Because reputation-for-repayment modela

neglect    a   county's ability to bargain, they greatly overstate the

ability of lenders to threaten to cut off an LOC from world
capital marketa,              Thus they tend to overatate the empirical

importance of capital market cutoffa relative to say,
interference         with the country'a current account transactions.

     The distinction between bargaining modela and reputation

modela     is also important for policy.                A Weatern government policy

to force LDC loans through equity marketa may be insensitive                      to

the legal reaaona why LDC loana have historically been channelled

                                                                    some have argued
through bank markets and bond marketa.22                    Alao,

that debt forgiveneas             achemes may actually harm LDCa by causing

theni   to forfeit their reputation for repayment.     We would argue

that if, through bargaining, an LDC can induce its lenders to

forgive   a   portion of its debts, it will gain.    Debts which are

forgiven will be forgotten.
