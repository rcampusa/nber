Does Multispecialty Practice Enhance Physician Market Power?

NBER Working Paper No. 23871
September 2017
JEL No. I11

                                          ABSTRACT

In markets for health services, vertical integration – common ownership of producers of
complementary services – may have both pro- and anti-competitive effects. Despite this, no
empirical research has examined the consequences of multispecialty physician practice – a
common and increasing form of vertical integration – for physician prices. We use data on 40
million commercially insured individuals from the Health Care Cost Institute to construct indices
of the price of a standard office visit to general-practice and specialist physicians for the years
2008-2012. We match this to measures of the characteristics of physician practices and physician
markets based on Medicare Part B claims, aggregating physicians into practices based on their
receipt of payments under a common Taxpayer Identification Number. Holding fixed the degree
of competition in their own specialty, we find that generalist physicians charge higher prices
when they are integrated with specialist physicians, and that the effect of integration is larger in
uncompetitive specialist markets. We find the same thing in the reciprocal setting – specialist
prices are higher when they are integrated with generalists, and the effect is stronger in
uncompetitive generalist markets. Our results suggest that multispecialty practice has
anticompetitive effects.

1. Introduction

        Economists have long understood that vertical integration – common ownership of producers of

complementary services – may have both pro- and anti-competitive effects (Joskow 2005). In markets

for health services, vertical integration is particularly important. There is almost universal agreement

that closer relationships between providers of complementary services have the potential to improve

communication and coordination, thereby enhancing the quality or reducing the cost of care. At the

same time, there is also evidence that vertical integration may enhance providers’ market power and

increase prices.

        This literature, however, has focused almost exclusively on integration between hospitals and

physicians; the phenomenon of integration of physicians of different specialties has received

significantly less attention. The lack of research on the consequences of multispecialty practice for

prices and competition is surprising, since the majority of physicians work in a multispecialty practice

and the share is increasing (Welch et al. 2013). In theory, the same mechanisms through which

hospital/physician integration operates may also determine the consequences of integration among

physicians.

        This paper seeks to fill this gap. We study empirically the relationships between prices paid by

commercial health plans to generalist and specialist physicians when they are in practices that also

include their complementary colleagues. Holding fixed the degree of competition in their own specialty,

we find that generalist physicians charge higher prices when they are integrated with specialist

physicians, and that the effect of integration is larger in uncompetitive specialist markets. We find the

same thing in the reciprocal setting – specialist prices are higher when they are integrated with

generalists, and the effect is stronger in uncompetitive generalist markets. Our results suggest that

multispecialty practice has anticompetitive effects.




                                                       1
        Our paper proceeds in five parts. Part 2 discusses previous research on the effects of vertical

integration on competition in markets for health care, focusing on the theoretical reasons why

integration between generalists and specialists may enhance market power and increase prices, and

describes the analytic approach we take. Part 3 explains how we calculate the prices paid to generalist

and specialist physicians using data from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI), and the extent of the

market power of and integration between generalists and specialists from Medicare claims, both at the

ZIP code level. Part 4 presents our models of the effects of generalist/specialist integration on prices

and our results, and Part 5 concludes.



2. Previous research and analytic approach

        Economic theory offers several hypotheses about the effects of vertical integration in general

(Bresnahan and Levin 2012), and multispecialty practice in particular, on markets for health services.

One class of models suggests that multispecialty practice could improve productive efficiency. These

models emphasize how multispecialty practice improves physicians’ ability to coordinate care and

referrals through “one-stop shopping” (Burns, Goldsmith, and Sen 2013). A second class of models

shows how integration among physicians of different specialties can reduce double marginalization

(Spengler 1950) – multiple markups by different physicians, each of whom has some market power.

        A third class of models hypothesizes that physicians join multispecialty practices in order to

make or receive hidden payments for referrals (Pauly 1979). Explicit “kickback” payments to referring

physicians are banned by law in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and banned by contract in

essentially all commercial health plans, but enforcement of a ban on transfers across specialties within a

practice is difficult or impossible. Models of hidden kickbacks therefore predict that multispecialty

practices might couple a policy of referring patients within the practice with higher generalist prices, in




                                                     2
order to compensate referring generalists for the extra revenue that they generate for referred-to

specialists.

           A fourth class suggests several channels through which multispecialty practice could be

anticompetitive. Some of these models explain how vertical integration can be used in the same way as

tying in order to facilitate price discrimination (Perry 1989). According to these models, integration

could enable generalist and specialist physicians to extract greater rents from consumers in aggregate if

consumers who value specialists more highly also demand more frequent generalist visits. Other

models explain how vertical integration can foreclose competition (e.g., Whinston 2006). According to

these models, generalist-specialist integration could enhance specialists’ market power and increase

prices if it enables specialists to deprive their rivals of the referrals from the generalists with whom they

affiliate.

           In markets with purchasing intermediaries, like health insurers, vertical integration can enhance

market power in another way. In this context, joint bargaining increases suppliers’ market power

because it enhances the suppliers’ ability to deny the intermediary’s customers the benefits of their

complementarity – benefits which the suppliers can jointly offer to one of the intermediary’s

competitors (Peters 2013). In the presence of an intermediary like a health insurance plan constructing

a network of providers, joint bargaining among producers of complements raises prices in much the

same way as joint bargaining among producers of substitutes. In both cases, it allows the suppliers to

internalize and profit from contracting externalities which would have otherwise flowed to consumers’

benefit.

           This work also highlights that changes in unit prices to physicians are not the only way that

multispecialty practice can be used to extract surplus from consumers. For example, Peters (2013)

shows that in equilibrium multispecialty practices may extract surplus through lump-sum transfers from

intermediaries who pass on that cost to consumers in the form of increased premiums. However, a


                                                       3
positive effect of multispecialty practice on all of the unit prices of physicians in the practice is sufficient

(although not necessary) to reject the absence of anticompetitive effects. An increase in all of the prices

is inconsistent with models in which multispecialty practice enhances productive efficiency, reduces

double marginalization, or facilitates welfare-enhancing price discrimination. It also cannot be explained

by a model of hidden kickbacks. Hidden-kickback models can only explain increases in the unit price of

referring physicians -- the gain to the referred-to physician arises out of an increase in quantity. 1

           To investigate the validity of these theories, we begin by testing whether the prevalence of

multispecialty practice in a small geographic area affects the price for a standard generalist (specialist)

physician office visit, holding constant the characteristics of the market for generalist (specialist)

services; patient characteristics; the procedure-code mix of office visits; the cost of medical care; the

mix of patient age, gender, and plan types; and area- and time- fixed effects. A positive effect of

multispecialty practice on both generalist and specialist prices in these models would suggest a net

anticompetitive effect; a negative effect on both generalist and specialist prices would suggest a

procompetitive effect; and opposing effects would be inconclusive.

           This interpretation, however, depends on the assumption that there are no unobserved

differences in quality, conditional on our observed covariates, that are correlated with the extent of

multispecialty practice. In particular, if multispecialty practice leads to both higher unobserved quality

and higher prices, or areas with increases in multispecialty practice experience other unobserved

changes that would lead to higher prices or quality, then a positive estimated effect of multispecialty

practice on prices would not necessarily be anticompetitive. Even it is implausible to assume that

unobserved differences in quality would be of sufficient magnitude to outweigh observed price

increases, simple hypothesis tests of the partial correlation between multispecialty practice and price

cannot rule them out.


1
    Indeed, the model in Pauly (1979) shows how payments for referrals can erode specialist market power.

                                                         4
        To exclude this possibility, we test for a second effect: a positive interaction effect between the

extent of a physician’s integration with a complementary colleague and the competitiveness of the

complementary colleague’s market, holding constant the competitiveness of the physician’s own market

and all of the factors described above. Such an effect is a possible consequence of all of the models that

predict anticompetitive price increases from multispecialty practice, but would be extremely implausible

to be due to unobserved differences in quality.

        Our analysis begins with models of the form:

                   𝑠𝑠                𝑠𝑠               −𝑠𝑠              −𝑠𝑠               −𝑠𝑠                                 𝑠𝑠
                𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽3 (𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 × 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ) + 𝛾𝛾𝑧𝑧 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡   (1)

where pj,ts is an index of the price of physician services -- standardized for patient characteristics,

procedure mix, and input costs – to physicians in practice j = (1,...,J) of specialty s = (generalist,

specialist) at time t = (1,...T). HHIs and HHI-s denote Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration indices for

physicians of specialty s, and not of specialty s, respectively; and dj,t-s is an indicator taking the value 1

for practices in which specialties other than s are present. HHIs are a standard measure of the

competitiveness of markets, here defined as the sum of the squared market shares of practices serving a

market. The HHI will approach 0 for markets served by a large number of practices, each with a small

market share. HHIs increase as the number of practices serving the market declines, and when the

market share of any one practice increases relative to the others. HHIs presented in this paper are

scaled so they reach a maximum of 1 in a monopoly market. As we explain in detail below, we

computed the HHIs using an approach that we have used in previous work, modified to incorporate the

FTC and DOJ recommendations for measuring the market competitiveness facing Accountable Care

Organizations (Baker et al. 2014; Federal Trade Commission 2011). We allow both the HHI measures

and d to affect prices with a lag of k years to account for the fact that prices at time t will generally be a

function of negotiations with health plans conducted in earlier years; in our basic model we use a three-

year moving average lag structure, but also present results from models that use a simple one-year lag.


                                                                     5
γ captures fixed differences across zip codes of patient residence; δ captures differences across

specialties; and θ captures trends over time. In this model, β1 measures the effect of own-specialty HHI

on prices, β2 the effect of integration with other specialties, and β3 the incremental effect of integration

for physicians in practices in which their complementary colleagues have market power. This model

implicitly assumes that the competitiveness of the market for physicians other than specialty s does not

affect the price of services of physicians of specialty s, except insofar as those physicians work together

in an integrated practice. Indeed, single-specialty practices do not have a defined value for HHI-s. We

examine the validity of this assumption in greater detail below.

         We expand our basic model in two ways. First, we allow the effect of integration to vary with

the competitiveness of a physician’s own market as well as the competitiveness of the market of the

physician’s complementary colleagues:

               𝑠𝑠                𝑠𝑠               −𝑠𝑠              −𝑠𝑠               𝑠𝑠                 −𝑠𝑠               −𝑠𝑠
            𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽3 (𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 × 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 ) + 𝛽𝛽4 (𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 × 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 )

                                                                                     𝑠𝑠
                                                           + 𝛾𝛾𝑧𝑧 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡                                             (2)

Second, we estimate models derived from (1) and (2) based exclusively on specialist physicians. In these

models, instead of specialty s = (generalist, specialist), we define specialty s = (specialist of type s,

specialist of type -s).

         Three recent papers have examined a closely-related question: whether physician/hospital

integration enhances provider market power. Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler (2014) construct county-level

indices of the price of hospital services using claims from the nonelderly privately insured from Truven

Analytics for 2001-07, matched with data on the types of relationships hospitals have with physicians

from the American Hospital Association. They find that increases in the market share of hospitals that

own physician practices are associated with higher hospital prices and spending. Neprash et al. (2015)

construct MSA-level indices of inpatient and outpatient spending using Truven claims for 2008-12,

matched with data on the extent of physician/hospital integration based on Medicare outpatient billing


                                                                      6
patterns. They find that increases in the market share of hospitals that are integrated with physicians

are associated with statistically significantly higher outpatient spending. Capps, Dranove, and Ody

(2015) show that integration of a physician’s practice with a hospital was associated with price increases

for the integrated physician group of 14 percent on average, also holding constant other market

characteristics, with larger effects when the integration was undertaken by a larger hospital. Whether

vertical integration among complementary physicians has similar effects is the question to which we

now turn.



3. Empirical approach

        Ideally, we would estimate equations (1) and (2) with data at the physician practice level on

prices, integration, and market power. However, we were unable to obtain complete data on physician

prices that identified practice group, and so were unable to match to prices information on the extent of

integration across specialties at the practice level. Lacking practice-level data on prices and integration,

we estimate our models instead at the ZIP code level. We construct ZIP code-year level generalist and

specialist physician price indices for 2008-12 using data from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI). HCCI

is an independent, nonprofit research institute that operates with the goal of advancing knowledge on

health care use and spending in the US. The HCCI data include information from Aetna, Humana, and

United HealthCare on approximately 40 million individuals from all 50 states, accounting for 27% of the

nonelderly population covered by private health insurance, and is beginning to be used by other to

study the effects of market structure on prices (Cooper et al. 2015).

        We match to these indices ZIP code-year level measures of the characteristics of physician

practices and physician markets based on Medicare Part B claims filed by physicians for the care of a

20% random sample of traditional Medicare beneficiaries for 2006-12. Medicare claims reflect care

delivered by a very large share of active physicians and we expect the set of physicians who billed


                                                     7
traditional Medicare to substantially overlap with the set of physicians who provided services to

privately insured patients in the HCCI data. 2 Each claim reports the tax ID number (TIN) of the

physician’s practice, the physician’s specialty, and the physician’s and patient’s zip codes, among other

things. We define a physician’s practice as the set of physicians who file claims under a common TIN.

This approach has been used in other work by some of us and others (Federal Trade Commission 2011;

Welch et al. 2013; Baker et al. 2014; Clemens and Gottlieb 2017). Physicians who use the same tax ID

are part of the same financially-integrated organization. Many financially-integrated organizations use

the same tax ID for all physicians in their organization, though it is permissible for the same organization

to use multiple tax IDs.

        Based on this definition, we calculate at the ZIP code-year level the prevalence of

generalist/specialist integration and HHI’s of the competitiveness of generalist and specialist physician

markets. The models we estimate are of the form:

              𝑠𝑠                 𝑠𝑠              −𝑠𝑠                                                                    𝑠𝑠
            𝑝𝑝𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑑𝑑𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽3 (𝑑𝑑−𝑠𝑠 × 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼 −𝑠𝑠 )𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛾𝛾𝑧𝑧 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡      (1’)

and

             𝑠𝑠                 𝑠𝑠              −𝑠𝑠
           𝑝𝑝𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑑𝑑𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽3 (𝑑𝑑−𝑠𝑠 × 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼 −𝑠𝑠 )𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘 + 𝛽𝛽4 (𝑑𝑑−𝑠𝑠 × 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐼𝐼 𝑠𝑠 )𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡−𝑘𝑘

                                                                                 𝑠𝑠
                                                       + 𝛾𝛾𝑧𝑧 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡                                             (2’)

where z = (1,...Z), and p, HHIs, d-s, and (d-s × HHI-s), (d-s × HHIs) are ZIP-code level (weighted) averages

constructed as described below.

        Intuitively, this specification measures at the area level the effect of the competitiveness of a

specialist’s market, the prevalence of integration into multispecialty practice, and the incremental effect

of integration in areas where the integrated physicians practice with complementary specialties who

have market power. If all of the practices serving patients in one ZIP are multispecialty, so d-s = 1,



2
 For example, physicians in large group and staff model HMOs are not included in either HCCI or traditional
Medicare data.

                                                                    8
variations in HHI-s are relevant for all prices in the ZIP. If in another ZIP, half of the practices are

multispecialty, so d-s = 0.5, then the effects of HHI-s only affect half of the prices in the price index.



3.1. Calculating the price index

        We focus on prices paid for office visits with new patients (Current Procedural Terminology

[CPT] codes 99201-99205) and established patients (CPT codes 99211-99215). These 10 codes are the

most commonly-billed in the United States, and unlike other procedures, represent a service that is

common to all specialties. Codes 99201-99205 include all office visits for new patients not previously

seen by the physician. These 5 services are intended to span the range of intensity across office visits

from 99201, a “basic” office visit with minimal patient complexity and short duration, to 99205, an

“advanced” office visit with a high degree of complexity and a long duration. The range 99211-99215

similarly captures the range of office visits for established patients who have been previously seen by

the physician.

        To construct our ZIP-code level price index, we began by extracting from the HCCI database

claims for office visits provided by physicians who reported on the claim that their specialty is family

practice/general practice or internal medicine (for generalist physicians), and neurology,

gastroenterology, hematology/oncology, urology, general surgery, otolaryngology, cardiology,

dermatology, endocrinology, and orthopedics (for specialist physicians). 3 We included only fee-for-

service claims from health plans identified as a commercial PPO, EPO, POS, or HMO plan, where the

claim was for a single service, the place of service was specified as a physician office, the claim was for




3
 These specialties are the ten largest in the HCCI data excluding pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology, since these
two specialties are not well represented in Medicare claims data and therefore without valid measures of market
concentration. We expand our definition of specialties to a larger group of 21 (including psychiatry, cardiology,
dermatology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, neurology, rheumatology, pulmonary disease, nephrology, general
surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, urology, plastic surgery, infectious disease, vascular surgery,
neurosurgery, oncology, allergy/immunology, and radiation oncology) in sensitivity analyses below.

                                                         9
professional (as opposed to facility) fees, the CPT modifier code was either blank or had the value 25, 4

and the claim reported the practice ZIP code of the physician providing the service.

           For each claim, we obtain the allowed amount, which is the amount the plan agreed to pay the

physician for the service after the application of contractual discount provisions and other plan rules.

We refer to this as the “price” for the service. The physician may have received this partly from the

insurer and partly from the patient in the form of applicable copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles.

We retained for analysis claims that had a positive allowed amount. We excluded claims when there

appeared to be a billing error. 5 Separately for each CPT code each year, we dropped as outliers claims

where the allowed amount fell in the top 1% or bottom 1% of claims for the code.

           We matched the claims to HCCI enrollment data to obtain information about the age, gender,

and residence ZIP code of the patient. We retained claims where this information was nonmissing, 6 the

patient was age 0-64, and where the enrollment data indicated that the patient was enrolled in

commercial insurance and not also enrolled in Medicare. We also obtained the Medicare Geographic

Practice Cost Index (GPCI) for work, practice expenses, and malpractice, by ZIP code by year, matched

this to the claims based on physician practice ZIP code, and dropped the small number of cases where

GPCIs could not be matched to the listed physician ZIP. This resulted in a base of approximately 181

million claims for generalist physicians and 94 million claims for specialists, with characteristics shown in

  Modifier code 25 indicates a claim for an identifiable and payable service that is provided on the same day as
another treatment and that, without the modifier, would not be paid.

AGE is a vector of dummy variables for patient age in 6 categories (0-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-

3.2. Calculating market characteristics

         Our analytic approach follows that in Baker et al. (2014), which adapts the approach of Kessler

and McClellan (2000) to the case of physician practices. Using Medicare data as described above, we

calculate ZIP-code level market characteristics in three steps. In the first step, we construct an HHI for

each ZIP code-specialty-year equal to the sum of squared market shares of billed charges C for each

practice serving the ZIP code:

                                                                                                                          2
                                                                                                 𝑠𝑠
                                             𝑠𝑠
                                                                                              𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗,𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡

                                                                                     ∑ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑗𝑗 𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗,𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡
                                                        𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑗𝑗
                                                                                     𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 𝑧𝑧

          These ZIP HHIs do not impose any a priori market size; they are instead based on the set of

physicians who actually provide services to patients in each ZIP code. We exclude from this calculation

claims where the physician is more than 100 miles from the patient ZIP, to reduce the potential for bias

from cases where a patient, perhaps while traveling, sees a distant physician who does not play a

substantial role in competition for patients residing in the ZIP code.




7
 For sensitivity testing, we also estimated an alternative price index using a version of (3) that excludes the PLAN
and PROC×MOD variables.

                                                                        11
        Using this measure of concentration directly would assume that physician practices differentiate

among patients based on the competitiveness of their ZIP code of residence. More realistically,

physician pricing decisions would depend on the total demand for services from the practice’s core

market area. Thus we take a second step to construct practice-level market characteristics with this

feature. In order to do this, we identified for each practice j a market area equal to the nearest set of

patient ZIP codes served by the practice that accounted for 75% of the practice’s billed charges. 8 We

averaged the patient ZIP code HHIs for the ZIP codes in the market area, weighting by the charges

incurred by patients from that ZIP at the practice-specialty-year:

                                                                                           𝑠𝑠

                        𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 =             �                    �                                   𝑠𝑠 �      × 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡
                                                                           ∑     𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧𝑧 𝑧𝑧 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖       𝐶𝐶𝑗𝑗,𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡

                                                                           𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑗𝑗 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎

        This step yields values of HHIs for each practice-year. We define our measure of HHI-s in two

ways: HHIMAX-s is the maximum HHI among other specialties present in the practice and HHIMEAN-s is

the mean HHI across other specialties present in the practice. (HHIMAX and HHIMEAN are missing for

practices in which no other specialties present).

        The third and final step in our analysis is to construct patient-ZIP-code-area market

characteristics equal to the average practice-level HHI across the practices serving the ZIP code,

weighted by the share of office visits V at the practice experienced by patients resident in the ZIP code:

                                                                                               𝑠𝑠

                                                                               ∑ 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑗𝑗 𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑧𝑧,𝑡𝑡

We weighted practice-level HHIs in this calculation by visits rather than billed charges so that the

aggregation of practice HHIs was similar to the aggregation implicit in the computation of the patient


8
  We imposed the 75%-billed-charge limitation (which was not used in Kessler and McClellan (2000)) to account for
the analysis and recommendations in Federal Trade Commission (2011). The limitation was explicitly designed to
increase the weight on patient residential areas from which the practice draws most of its patients and hence are
most influential in determining the practice’s pricing strategy.

                                                                                   12
ZIP-code level price indices from the HCCI data. We calculate d-s – our key measure of integration -- as

the number of office visits by ZIP-code residents to physicians of specialty s in each practice:

        We similarly computed the ZIP-code level weighted average of (d-s × HHI-s) and (d-s × HHIs) over

practices serving patients resident in the ZIP code with non-missing values for HHI-s and HHIs:

3.3. Sample Construction

        To construct our analysis sample, we included ZIP codes for which we could compute both the

price index and the area market and practice characteristics. We excluded ZIP codes with price indices

in the top 1% or bottom 1% of the distribution. To be included in the analysis sample, we required ZIP

codes to have at least 10 HCCI office visit claims underlying the price index and data from at least 20

Medicare beneficiaries underlying the construction of the practice characteristics. We restrict analyses

presented to a balanced panel of ZIP codes that meet these criteria in all 5 study years, though analyses

using an unbalanced panel produce very similar results.

        Tables 2 and 3 report ZIP code level descriptive statistics for the key variables in the generalist

(family practice, general practice, and internal medicine) and specialist samples, respectively, for the

year 2012. Table 2 is based on 32,194 observations (16,705 for family practice/general practice and

15,489 for internal medicine) covering 17,284 ZIP codes with at least one type of generalist; table 3 is

based on 100,836 observations covering 13,552 ZIP codes with at least one type of specialist (with the


                                                                                     13
distribution across the 10 specialties reported in the table). The statistics in the table were calculated by

weighting each ZIP code by the number of HCCI claims underlying the price index. The price indices, by

construction, are very close to zero (they are not identically zero because of the sample trimming

discussed in the paragraph above). The market for generalist physicians is relatively unconcentrated,

with a claim-weighted HHI equal to 0.1396. The overall lack of concentration in the market for

generalist physician services, however, masks differences across areas; in the least concentrated

quartile, the claim-weighted average HHI for generalists is 0.0564, but in the most concentrated

quartile, the HHI is almost five times as large at 0.2639. The market for specialists is, not surprisingly,

more concentrated (claim weighted HHI = 0.3218), ranging from 0.1329 in the least concentrated

quartile to 0.4850 in the most concentrated one.

        Consistent with previous descriptive work, integration is relatively common in our sample. On a

claim-weighted basis, approximately 40 percent of generalists are integrated with a specialist, and 32

percent of specialists are integrated with a generalist. Integration of specialists with one another is

slightly less common (approximately 22 percent on a claim-weighted basis), indicating that

multispecialty practices that include a generalist in many cases do not include a full complement of all of

the 10 types of specialists we examine. Appendix Tables 1 and 2 report the matrix of correlations

among the key independent variables. The tables show that, especially for generalist physicians,

integration is strongly positively correlated with the concentration of ownership of practices in the

physician’s own specialty. For generalist physicians, for example, the correlation between the claim-

weighted integration rate and own-specialty HHI is 0.5307. This highlights the importance of controlling

for both concentration of ownership and integration in order to assess the independent effect of each

on competition and prices.




                                                      14
4. Results

        Table 4 presents estimates from equations (1’) and (2’) for generalist physicians. Table entries

are the effect of moving from the mean of the bottom quartile of the listed variable to the mean of the

top quartile. All models are based on balanced panels for the years 2008-2012; standard errors were

calculated allowing for arbitrary correlation within a ZIP code. Columns (1)-(4) report results from

different variants of equation (1’). Column (1) imposes the constraint β2 = β3 = 0; we report an estimate

from this specification for purposes of comparison to the previous literature. In our data we find that an

increase in the HHI from 0.0564 (mean in the bottom quartile, table 2) to 0.2639 (mean in the top

quartile) led to an increase in the generalist price index of approximately 3.2 percent. This is

comparable to, although slightly smaller than, the effect of generalist physician market concentration on

prices found in Baker et al. (2014). Column (2) relaxes the constraint that β2 = 0, i.e., allows own-

specialty concentration and integration to have separate effects. Integration with a specialist has a large

and statistically significant positive effect on generalist prices. Moving a generalist from a relatively

unintegrated area (claim-weighted integration rate of 0.1371, table 2) to a relatively integrated one

(0.7252) would allow her to increase her prices for a standard office visit by approximately 4.3 percent.

This implies a practice-specific effect of integration on generalist prices of 7.3 percent (0.043 / (0.7252 –

0.1371)). Controlling for integration reduces the estimated effect of own-specialty concentration

significantly to approximately 1.8 percent for a bottom-to-top-quartile change in HHI, suggesting that a

substantial fraction of previous estimates of the effect of own-specialty concentration may have been

due to the competitive effects of integration rather than concentration per se.

        Column (3) estimates the fully-specified version of equation (1’). It shows that the effect on

generalist prices of integration with a specialist increase with a standard measure of specialist market

power. Moving a generalist from a relatively unintegrated area to a relatively integrated one, when the

markets in both areas for the specialists with whom she integrated were highly unconcentrated (HHI =


                                                     15
0), would allow her to increase her prices by approximately 3 percent; allowing the interaction between

integration and specialist market power also to increase from the bottom to the top quartile would

allow an additional 1.8 percent increase. Unless there is unobserved time-varying heterogeneity across

ZIP code-level markets in the determinants of the price of a standard generalist office visit that is

somehow correlated with generalist/specialist integration in concentrated specialist markets, and not

due to anticompetitive behavior, this estimate represents a rejection of the null hypothesis of no

anticompetitive effects of multispecialty practice.

        Using the information in table 2 this coefficient can be rescaled in a number of ways. For

example, moving a generalist from a relatively unintegrated area to a relatively integrated area (change

in integration of 0.5881 = 0.7252 – 0.1371) in a monopolized specialist market (max specialist HHI = 1)

would allow her to increase prices by an additional 3.3 percent = (0.5881 * (0.0175 / (0.3530 – 0.0369)),

relative to the increase that could be obtained in a highly unconcentrated specialist market (max

specialist HHI = 0).

        Column (4) presents estimates from an extension to (1’) that also includes a control for specialist

HHI directly. As we explain above, the model underlying (1’) implicitly assumes that the competitiveness

of the market for specialist physicians does not affect the price of services of generalist physicians,

except insofar as those physicians work together in an integrated practice. Indeed, a generalist

physician working in a practice without specialists does not have a defined value for HHI-s. To

investigate the validity of this assumption, we calculated for each ZIP code the maximum specialist HHI,

not interacted with the integration rate, and included it as a control variable. If the estimated

coefficient on the interaction between specialist HHI and integration represents a true anticompetitive

effect, its magnitude should be invariant to the inclusion of a control for the uninteracted maximum

specialist HHI. The results in column (4) confirm this hypothesis; the estimated effects of integration




                                                      16
and the interaction between integration and specialist HHI are essentially unchanged from those in

column (3), and the uninteracted effect of specialist HHI is small and statistically insignificant.

        Column (5) presents estimates of equation (2’), which allow the effect of integration to vary

both with the generalist’s own HHI and the largest of the HHIs of the specialists in the generalist’s

multispeciality practice. The estimates in column (5) show that the positive effect of integration on

generalist prices falls off as the market power of the generalist increases. A bottom-to-top quartile

change in the interaction between integration and the generalist’s own HHI is of approximately the

same magnitude (3 percent) and of opposite sign to the effect of the interaction between integration

and the largest of the HHIs of the specialists in the generalist’s multispecialty practice. This finding can

be accommodated by each of the four classes of models of anticompetitive effects of integration

discussed above, none of which require the effect of integration to vary in any particular way with the

competitiveness of the integrating party’s market.

        Table 5 presents estimates from equations (1’) and (2’) for specialist physicians, with columns

defined analogously to those in Table 4. Table 5 shows that the standardized effect of own-specialty

HHI for specialists, approximately 7.8 percent (controlling for the extent of integration with generalist

physicians) is around four times larger than the effect of own-specialty HHI for generalists. The relative

magnitude of the effect is due to both a larger unit impact of concentration on specialist prices (0.2201

for specialists versus 0.0841 for generalists, not in any table) and a wider interquartile range of specialist

market concentration (0.3521 = 0.4850 – 0.1329 for specialists versus 0.2075 = 0.2639 – 0.0564 for

generalists, table 2). By contrast, the average effect of integration is very similar between specialists

and generalists (compare column (3), table 5 to column (3), table 4). This is consistent with insurers’

benchmarking multispecialty practice prices off of those for single-specialty practices in the same

market (e.g., Clemens and Gottlieb 2017).




                                                      17
        Analogous to Table 4, column (4) presents estimates from an extension to (1’) that also includes

a control for generalist HHI directly. The results in column (3) are not due to the concentration of the

market for generalists per se or one of its correlates, and generalist concentration has a small and

statistically insignificant effect independent of its interaction with integration. Column (5) presents

estimates of equation (2’) for specialists, showing that as with generalists, the effect of integration

declines with the market power of the specialist’s own practice.

        Table 6 presents estimates of equations (1’) and (2’) based exclusively on specialist physicians.

In these models, instead of specialty s = (generalist, specialist), we define specialty s = (specialist of type

s, specialist of type -s). These models therefore identify the effect on specialist prices of integration

among specialists of different types rather than the effect of integration with a generalist physician.

Columns (1) and (2) show that integration with another specialist leads to higher specialist prices, of

similar magnitude to integration with a generalist (compare to table 5, columns (2) and (3)). Column (3)

of table 6 presents estimates that include a control for other-specialist HHI uninteracted with

integration as well as the interacted effect. In contrast to estimates from models of the effect of

specialist/generalist integration, the magnitude of the estimated coefficient on the interaction between

other-specialist HHI and specialist/other-specialist integration becomes small and statistically

insignificant when the uninteracted other-specialist HHI is included in the model. Thus, for specialists in

aggregate, we do not find strong support for the hypothesis that integration with another specialist has

anticompetitive effects.

        To investigate further the effects of competition and integration on specialist prices, table 7

examines the two specialties with the broadest geographic coverage (table 3): cardiology and

orthopedics. In both cardiology and orthopedics, the price of a standard office visit is responsive to both

the specialty’s own HHI and to integration with a generalist physician (columns (1)-(2)), although the

effect of both own-specialty concentration and integration is much larger for cardiology than for


                                                      18
orthopedics. As in our analysis of all specialists together (table 5), the estimated effects of integration

and the interaction between integration and generalist HHI are invariant to the inclusion of a control for

generalist HHI uninteracted, and generalist concentration has a small and statistically insignificant effect

independent of its interaction with integration on price (table 7, column (3))).

        Columns (4) – (6) of Table 7 replicate the analysis of all specialists together (table 6) for

cardiology and orthopedics individually. Columns (4) – (5) show that integration with another specialist

leads to higher specialist prices for both cardiology and orthopedics, but especially for cardiology. These

results are consistent with those reported for all specialists together in table 6. However, for cardiology

and orthopedics, the estimated effects of integration and the interaction between integration and

other-specialist HHI are invariant to the inclusion of a control for other-specialist HHI uninteracted

(although for cardiologists, other-specialist HHI has a statistically significant negative effect on price).

For cardiology and orthopedics, we therefore do find strong support for the hypothesis that integration

with another specialist has anticompetitive effects.

        Table 8 presents results from variants of equation (1’) that explore the robustness of our results

to four of our key modeling choices. In no case do the results change materially, indicating that our

findings are not sensitive to the particular specifications or variable definitions that we used. Columns

(1) and (2) of table 8 replicate column (2) of tables 4 and 5, respectively, but use as a dependent variable

a price index constructed without controls for plan type, procedure, or modifier codes (i.e., imposing the

constraint β3 = β4 = 0 on equation (3)). Estimates of the effect of concentration and integration based on

this alternative price index are similar to those using our standard price index (although the effect of

own-specialty HHI is higher for generalist physicians). Columns (3) and (4) also replicate column (2) of

tables 4 and 5, but use a simple one-year lag structure for the control variables instead of a 3-year

moving average; the magnitude of our estimated effects decline uniformly by a small amount,

suggesting that the 3-year moving average captures the market conditions affecting price with slightly


                                                       19
greater accuracy. Columns (5) and (6) replicate column (3) of tables 4 and 5, substituting the average

HHI of the complementary physicians instead of the largest of the HHIs of the complementary

physicians. The use of the mean rather than the max HHI leads to small increases in the base effect of

integration and small declines in the magnitude of the interaction between integration and the

complementary physician’s market concentration. Columns (7) and (8) replicate column (2) of tables 4

and 5, but including ZIP-code level controls for inpatient hospital market conditions and the extent of

hospital/physician integration used in Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler (2014); the magnitude and

significance of our estimates remain unchanged.



5. Conclusion

        The consequences of vertical integration for the competitiveness of markets for health services

have been the topic of considerable debate. On one hand, there is almost universal agreement that

fragmentation among providers of complementary health services has negative consequences for

productive efficiency. On the other hand, a wide range of economic models indicate that vertical

integration can be anticompetitive, and recent work has found empirical evidence that supports the

hypothesis that physician/hospital integration enhances provider market power, leading to increased

prices. Yet despite the high and increasing prevalence of multispecialty physician practices – which raise

exactly the same possibilities for pro- and anticompetitive effects in theory – no empirical work has

examined how vertical integration among physicians affect prices.

        In this paper, we estimate the extent to which changes in multispeciality practice from 2008-

2012 in approximately 17,000 urban US ZIP codes affect the price of a standard office visit with a

generalist and specialist physician. We obtain data on prices from the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI)

on approximately 40 million individuals from all 50 states, accounting for 27% of the nonelderly insured

population, making it one of the largest sources of health insurance claims data ever assembled. We


                                                    20
match ZIP-code level price indices from the HCCI data to measures of the characteristics of physician

practices and physician markets based on Medicare Part B claims, grouping together physicians based

on their receipt of payments under a common Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). This approach has

been used extensively in previous work, because physicians who receive payment under a common TIN

are generally part of the same financially-integrated organization. We estimate the effect on generalist

physician prices of integration with a specialist and the effect on specialist physician prices of integration

with a generalist or another specialist of a different type. Our empirical models control for the

competitiveness of the market for generalist and specialist physician services; patient characteristics;

the procedure-code mix of office visits; the cost of medical care; the mix of patient age, gender, and

plan types; and area- and time- fixed effects.

        We report three key findings. First, generalist physicians charge higher prices when integrated

with a specialist, holding constant the factors above. The effect of integration with a specialist on

generalist prices is approximately twice as large as the effect of the generalist’s own market

characteristics. Moving a generalist from a relatively unintegrated area (the average ZIP code in the

bottom quartile of integration) to a relatively integrated one (the average in the top quartile) would

allow her to increase her prices for a standard office visit by approximately 4.3 percent. By comparison,

moving a general from a relatively competitive area (the average ZIP code in the bottom quartile of

concentration, as measured by the generalist’s Hirschman-Herfindahl index) to a relatively

uncompetitive area (the average in the top quartile) would allow her to increase her prices by

approximately 1.8 percent. We find the same thing in the reciprocal setting – specialist prices are higher

when they are integrated with generalists, although the effect on specialist prices of integration with a

generalist is not as large, relative to the magnitude of the effect of the specialist’s own market

characteristics. Because integration and own-market concentration are highly positively correlated, our

result shows that a substantial fraction of previous estimates of the effect of own-specialty


                                                     21
concentration may have been due to the competitive effects of integration rather than concentration

per se.

          Second, the effect on generalist physician prices of integration with a specialist is larger in

uncompetitive specialist markets (and the effect on specialist physician prices of integration with a

generalist is larger in uncompetitive generalist markets). The presence of a positive interaction effect

between integration and the concentration of the market of the complementary physician is important

for two reasons. First, it is a consequence of all of the economic models that predict an anticompetitive

effect of vertical integration. Second, it is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the positive correlation

between integration and price is due to a simple difference in quality between single- and

multispeciality group services. To explain the positive interaction effect, the unobserved quality of a

generalist office visit in a multispecialty practice would have to be increasing in the extent of specialist

market concentration. Of course, as with any observational analysis, we cannot definitively rule out the

possibility of unobservables, but this test – along with other validity checks we discuss above – make

such explanations for our results implausible.

          Third, for specialists in aggregate, we do not find strong support for the hypothesis that

integration with another specialist has anticompetitive effects. Our estimate of the effect on specialist

prices in aggregate of the interaction effect above (i.e., integration with another specialist × the

concentration of the other specialist’s market) is sensitive to specification choices, so we cannot rule out

the possibility that the observed effect on specialist prices due to multispecialty practice is due to

greater unobserved quality. However, we can rule out the possibility that the positive effect of

integration with another specialist on price is due to unobserved quality for the two specialties with the

broadest geographic coverage – cardiology and orthopedics. For these specialties, our estimate of the

interaction effect of interest is robust, similar to the estimates from models of generalist/specialist




                                                       22
integration. Investigation of the difference between cardiology and orthopedics and the others in our

data is a topic for future research.

        Our findings cannot be explained by models in which physicians join multispecialty practices in

order to make or receive hidden payments for referrals. Models of hidden kickbacks can explain why

referring physicians’ unit prices increase in response to integration into a multispecialty practice. Such

models can even explain the positive interaction between integration and specialist market power, if

specialists with market power valued referrals more than specialists without it. But they cannot explain

why multispecialty practice is associated with increases in the prices of both generalists and specialists,

along with positive interaction effects both between integration and specialist market power on

generalist prices and between integration and generalist market power on specialist prices. Nor can our

findings be explained by models in which multispecialty practice enhances productive efficiency, reduces

double marginalization, or facilitates welfare-enhancing price discrimination. Thus, we conclude that

multispecialty practice has anticompetitive effects.

        However, our analysis has several important limitations. First, our measure of competitiveness

(the HHI) is not directly derived from a theoretical model of physician/insurer bargaining, despite the

fact that this is process through which the prices we study are determined. Although it is used

extensively, the limitations of the HHI as a measure of competitiveness or market power are well-known

(Bresnahan 1989). Second, although we used numerous strategies in order to minimize the possibility

that our results were due to unobserved differences across geographic areas – including controls for

area-fixed-effects, patient characteristics, and other related market factors; the choice of a standardized

service (a simple office visit) that is relatively comparable across specialties, areas, and over time; and a

hypothesis test that rules out at least simple differences in unobserved quality between single- and

multispecialty practices – our analysis is fundamentally observational in nature and so cannot

definitively exclude that our findings are due to the endogeneity of the integration decision, other


                                                       23
aspects of physician markets, or unobserved quality more broadly. Third, we do not assess the

consequences of multispecialty practice for social or consumer welfare in aggregate. Our analysis is

limited to standard office visits only (for the reasons discussed above), but physicians provide many

more specialized services that we do not consider. Exploration of the relevance of these limitations is a

topic for future research.
