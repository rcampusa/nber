                                           ABSTRACT

This paper provides an explanation for the run-up of U.S. inflation in the 1960s and 1970s and the

sharp disinflation in the early 1980s, which standard macroeconomic models have difficulties in

addressing. I present a model in which rational policymakers learn about the behavior of the

economy in real time and set stabilization policy optimally, conditional on their current beliefs. The

steady state associated with the self-confirming equilibrium of the model is characterized by low

inflation. However, prolonged episodes of high inflation ending with rapid disinflations can occur

when policymakers underestimate both the natural rate of unemployment and the persistence of

inflation in the Phillips curve. I estimate the model using likelihood methods. The estimation results

show that the model accounts remarkably well for the evolution of policymakers’ beliefs,

stabilization policy and the postwar behavior of inflation and unemployment in the United States.

1    Introduction

This paper aims to explain the behavior of inflation and unemployment in the United States.
Figure 1 presents a plot of the annualized quarterly growth rate of the GDP deflator and the
total civilian unemployment rate over the postwar period. The striking feature of the graph
is the long and pronounced run-up of inflation, which occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. This
episode, known as the Great Inflation, is not just “America’s only peacetime inflation” (DeLong
1997), but has also been called “the greatest failure of American macroeconomic policy in the
postwar period” (Mayer 1999).
    At least four stylized facts characterize the Great Inflation.

    • Dimension. Between 1963 and 1981 the inflation rate in the United States rose by more
      than 9 percentage points. If we exclude the peak in 1974 (which is due to the eﬀect of the
      first oil price shock), the rate of increase was approximately constant.

    • Duration. The episode of high inflation lasted for more than 20 years. Inflation started
      to increase around 1963 and came back under control, at a level of about 2 percent, only
      around 1985.

    • Asymmetry. The episode of high inflation was asymmetric. In the early 1980s, the du-
      ration of the so called “Volcker disinflation” was much shorter than the phase of rising
      inflation.

    • Unemployment lagged inflation. Unemployment lagging behind inflation is a general char-
      acteristic of the business cycle. However, this feature of the data was particularly evident
      in the period of high inflation, with unemployment peaking always a few quarters after
      inflation.

    This paper puts forward a theory of the behavior of inflation and unemployment, which fits
the U.S. data well and, in particular, explains all four of the stylized facts above. This theory
is based on the evolution of policymakers’ beliefs about the structure of the economy.
    Previous attempts to explain the Great Inflation fall apart in three categories, which I label
the “bad luck,” the “lack of commitment” and the “policy mistakes” views. I briefly discuss
each of these branches of literature below.


The “bad luck” view The first type of explanations is based on bad luck, in view of the
fact that it has been well documented that the volatility of the exogenous, non-policy shocks

                                                 2
was higher in the 1960s and 1970s than in the last two decades of the century (see, for instance,
Cogley and Sargent 2003, Kim and Nelson 1999a, McConnell and Perez-Quiros 2000, Sims and
Zha 2004, Stock and Watson 2002). However, although non-policy shocks definitely played an
important role, it is hard to reconcile the existing estimates with the exceptional dimension and
duration of the Great Inflation.


The “lack of commitment” view The second class of explanations is what Christiano
and Fitzgerald (2003) have called the “institution vision of inflation”. According to this view,
inflation was high in the 1960s and 1970s because policymakers did not have any incentive to
keep inflation low. The motivation for this relies on the time-consistency problem of optimal
policy, first emphasized by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983). The
importance of this line of research has been recently emphasized by Chari, Christiano, and
Eichenbaum (1998), Christiano and Gust (2000) and Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003).
    However, the inflation bias generated by the time-consistency problem seems to be quantita-
tively too small to explain the high inflation of the 1960s and 1970s (see, for example, Reis 2003).
Ireland (1999) formally tests the inflation bias hypothesis on U.S. data. While he is not able to
reject it, his estimates suggest the presence of an inflationary bias of small magnitude. Moreover,
it is hard to reconcile the time-consistency view with the rapid Volcker disinflation. In fact, it
is not clear what exactly changed between the pre and post 1980s period from the institutional
point of view.1 The final diﬃculty with the “lack of commitment” approach is the fact that it
would predict unemployment leading, rather than lagging inflation. This is due to the fact that
the advantages of inflationary surprises depend on the level of unemployment. As mentioned
above, this is clearly at odds with the data.


The “policy mistakes” view This approach focuses on policy mistakes and stresses that
in the 1960s and 1970s monetary policymakers were not as good as the ones of the last two
decades. For example, many authors have argued that U.S. monetary policy was less responsive
to inflationary pressures under the Fed chairmanship of Arthur Burns than under Paul Volcker
and Alan Greenspan (among others, see Boivin and Giannoni 2002, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler
   1
     Recent work has made some progress in this direction. Sargent (1999), for example, explains the disinflation
as escape dynamycs from the inflation biased equilibrium. Rogoﬀ (2003) argues that Central Banks’ lower
incentive to inflate is related to globalization and the consequent increase in world competition. Albanesi, Chari,
and Christiano (2003), instead, analyze the lack of commitment problem in an optimizing agents model and show
the existence of multiple equilibria, which can potentially explain the disinflation.

2000, Cogley and Sargent 2001, Judd and Rudebusch 1998, Lubik and Schorfheide 2004).2
       In this respect, the line of research started by Orphanides represents an attempt to ra-
tionalize why the policy authorities behaved so diﬀerently in the pre and post 1980s period.
Orphanides (2000 and 2002) has argued that policymakers in the 1970s overlooked a break in
potential output. They overestimated potential output leading to overexpansionary policies,
which ultimately resulted in high inflation. Among others, this explanation has also been pro-
posed by Cukierman and Lippi (2002), Lansing (2002), Bullard and Eusepi (2003), Reis (2003)
and Tambalotti (2003). While this strand of literature represents a step forward, the dimension
of the high inflation episodes explained by such models is usually much lower than what we
observe in the data, unless the model is augmented with additional propagation mechanisms
like, for instance, private sector learning (as in Orphanides and Williams 2003). Furthermore,
the explanations based on the misperception of potential output fail to address the Volcker dis-
inflation, unless an exogenous shift in policymakers’ preferences is specified (see, for instance,
Bullard and Eusepi 2003).

       While there is clearly some truth in all of these theories, they also seem to have diﬃculties
in addressing at least some of the stylized facts of the hump-shaped behavior of inflation and
unemployment. This paper proposes instead an explanation of the Great Inflation that matches
all these stylized facts.
       I present a model, in which rational policymakers form their beliefs about the behavior of the
economy in real time and set stabilization policy optimally, conditional on the information avail-
able to them. Although the equilibrium of the model is characterized by low inflation, episodes
of high inflation and unemployment can occur when policymakers simultaneously underestimate
both the natural rate of unemployment and the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve. Such
initial conditions result in peculiar dynamics of policymakers’ beliefs, ultimately aﬀecting also
their perception of the slope of the Phillips curve and of the cost of the inflation-unemployment
trade-oﬀ.
       Intuitively, if real-time policymakers underestimate the natural rate of unemployment, this
results in overexpansionary policies and higher inflation. Moreover, if policymakers’ estimate
of the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve is also downward biased, they rationally
choose not to react strongly to inflation, amplifying the initial eﬀect. The reason is that the
   2
     This view is controversial. Other studies have in fact found either little evidence of changes in the systematic
part of monetary policy (for example, Bernanke and Mihov 1998, Hanson 2003, Leeper and Zha 2002, Primiceri
2005) or no evidence of unidirectional drifts in policy toward a more active behavior (Sims 2001b, Sims and Zha
2004).



                                                         4
more stationary inflation is perceived to be, the sooner it is expected to revert to its mean and
the less urgent is the need for anti-inflationary action. This period of “overoptimism” ends
when inflation reaches a level that concerns policymakers. However, when policymakers start
reacting to inflation, pushing unemployment above the perceived natural rate does not seem
to reduce inflation. This is because they still have a downward biased estimate of the natural
rate of unemployment. In this period of “overpessimism”, they temporarily and mistakenly
perceive a very costly inflation-unemployment trade-oﬀ, which explains why anti-inflationary
policy is postponed even further. The disinflation occurs only when the perceived inflation-
unemployment trade-oﬀ becomes favorable, relative to the level of inflation.
   Among others, Orphanides (2000), DeLong (1997) and Romer and Romer (2002) have argued
in favor of the policy misperception of potential output and the natural rate of unemployment in
the 1960s and 1970s. Policymakers’ misperception of the persistence of inflation in the Phillips
curve in the 1960s is also no longer controversial. For example, Blanchard and Fischer (1989)
and Mayer (1999) have noted that, at least until the early 1970s, most of the econometric
studies underestimated inflation persistence. In relation to the overpessimism phase, DeLong
(1997), Romer and Romer (2002) and Cogley and Sargent (2004) have emphasized that policy
was cautious in the 1970s because the cost of lowering inflation seemed too high.
   From a quantitative and statistical standpoint, I show that the evolution of policymakers’
beliefs about the coeﬃcients of the Phillips curve is very important to explain the behavior of
inflation and unemployment. I estimate the model using likelihood methods. The estimated
version of the model accounts remarkably well for the evolution of policymakers’ beliefs, stabi-
lization policy and the postwar behavior of inflation and unemployment in the United States.
   The importance of policymakers’ learning dynamics has been recognized by many authors.
In the context of the “natural rate” literature, policymakers’ learning has been introduced by
Sims (1988). Theoretical advances include Sargent (1999), Cho, Williams, and Sargent (2002)
and Williams (2003). Empirical studies include Chung (1990), Sargent (1999), Cogley and
Sargent (2004) and Sargent, Williams, and Zha (2004). The main insight of this literature
is that policymakers’ learning introduces temporary deviations from the model’s equilibrium,
which is characterized by an inflation bias. These temporary deviations are in the direction of
the optimal, low inflation outcome. Unlike these studies, in this paper the equilibrium outcome
is a low inflation regime. Nevertheless, the model explains the run-up of U.S. inflation in
the 1960s and 1970s and the sharp disinflation in the early 1980s. Although the explanation
roughly belongs to the “policy mistakes” category, in this paper policymakers are assumed to be



                                               5
rational and optimizing. As a consequence, I find that the mismeasurement of the natural rate
of unemployment alone is not suﬃcient to generate fluctuations of the inflation rate comparable
to what we observe in the data. This diﬀers importantly from Orphanides (2000) and other
similar approaches.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical model of the economy
and policymakers’ behavior. Section 3 oﬀers a model-based interpretation of the Great Inflation.
Section 4 focuses instead on statistical evidence, i.e. estimation, fit and quantitative simulation
results. Sections 5 and 6 demonstrate the robustness of the results to two modifications of the
baseline framework. In particular, section 5 introduces private agents’ forward looking behavior
in the model and section 6 allows for stochastic volatility of the exogenous innovations. Section
7 makes an attempt to uncover the deeper reasons of the Great Inflation, i.e. why policymakers
underestimated the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve in the 1960s. Section 8 concludes
with some final remarks.


2     Imperfect Information and Inflation-Unemployment Dynam-
      ics

In this section I present a simple model of inflation-unemployment dynamics when policymakers
have imperfect information. The source of imperfect information is the fact that policymakers
do not know the exact model of the economy. In particular, they are uncertain about the value
of the model’s parameters. Therefore, policymakers update their beliefs about the model’s
unknowns in every period and implement optimal policy, conditional on their current beliefs. In
turn, the policy variable aﬀects the behavior of inflation and unemployment because it enters
the model describing the true evolution of key macroeconomic variables.


2.1    The Model Economy

As a “true” model of the economy, I consider a simple rational expectations model that can be
rewritten as a backward looking one. Even if conceptually similar to modern New-Keynesian
specifications, the benchmark model is more in the spirit of the empirical literature following
along the lines of King, Stock, and Watson (1995) and, more recently, Gordon (1997 and 1998),
Rudebusch and Svensson (1999) and Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997 and 2001).
    This framework, not only is tractable and convenient for estimation, but is also simple and
transparent, providing a clear intuition for the role played by policymakers’ learning dynamics


                                                6
in the behavior of inflation and unemployment. Integrating learning dynamics in a forward
looking specification is instead computationally more expensive and this case in analyzed in
section 5.
    The private sector part of the model is described by the following equations:

                                      π t = π et − θ̃(L)(ut−1 − uN
                                                                 t−1 ) + εt .                                (1)

                             (ut − uN                  N
                                    t ) = ρ(L)(ut−1 − ut−1 ) + Vt−1 + η t ,                                  (2)

                                     uN
                                      t    = (1 − γ)u∗ + γuN
                                                           t−1 + τ t .                                       (3)

Equation (1) represents a standard expectation augmented Phillips curve, where π t is the in-
flation rate, π et is the agents’ expected inflation rate, ut is the unemployment rate and uN
                                                                                            t is

the time varying natural rate of unemployment. θ̃(L) is a lag polynomial and εt is a random
innovation, assumed to be i.i.d. N (0, σ 2ε ).3 I assume that some of the agents are fully rational,
while the rest of them form their expectations adaptively, so that

                                   π et = (1 − α̃(1))Et−1 π t + α̃(L)π t−1 .                                 (4)

α̃(L) is a lag polynomial and the combination of (1) and (4) leads to the following familiar
reduced form Phillips curve:

                                π t = α(L)π t−1 − θ(L)(ut−1 − uN
                                                               t−1 ) + εt ,                                  (5)

where α(L) = α̃(L)/α̃(1) and θ(L) = θ̃(L)/α̃(1). Note that, no matter what the exact fraction
of agents with adaptive expectations is, α(1) = 1, implying the absence of a long run trade-oﬀ
between unemployment and inflation, which is consistent with the natural rate hypothesis. The
interpretation of (5) is straightforward: the inflation rate changes either because of a random
“cost push” term or because unemployment is not in line with the natural rate.
    Equation (2) is a very simple aggregate demand equation, where ρ(L) is a lag polynomial,
η t is an i.i.d. N (0, σ 2η ) random innovation and Vt is a variable controlled by policymakers. In
other words, unemployment deviates from the natural rate either because of a random shock or
because of policymakers’ decisions about stabilization policy.
    Although a natural interpretation of the policy variable Vt is of real rate of interest, more
generally Vt can be thought as capturing the joint eﬀect of monetary and fiscal policy. In
particular, this modeling strategy avoids complications related to the specification of two aspects
   3
     The case of heteroskedastic innovations is particularly interesting in the context of learning models and is
analyzed in section 6.



                                                       7
of the policy process: the relative importance of the monetary and fiscal policy actions on real
activity and the particular channels through which monetary and fiscal policy aﬀect real activity.
This is in the spirit of the recent renovated interest on the eﬀect of fiscal policy (see, among
others, Blanchard and Perotti 2002, Mountford and Uhlig 2002) and the direct role of monetary
aggregates in macro models (Favara and Giordani 2002, Leeper and Roush 2003).
       Equation (3) describes the exogenous stochastic process for the natural rate of unemploy-
ment, which is assumed to evolve as an AR(1), where τ t is i.i.d. N (0, σ 2τ ). u∗ represents the
unconditional expectation of uN                                        N
                              t . This assumption on the evolution of ut is standard in the

literature (see, for instance, Staiger, Stock, and Watson 2001, although they set γ = 1 in their
empirical specification).


2.2      Optimal Policy under Imperfect Information

The value of the policy variable V is chosen in every period by policymakers. They base their
decision on the available information and on current beliefs about the state of the economy.
I assume that policymakers know the structure of the true model of the economy (given by
equations (5) and (2)), but they are uncertain about the value of the unobservable variables
(the natural rate) and the coeﬃcients. Policymakers estimate the model’s parameters in every
period and use these estimates as true values, neglecting both estimates uncertainty and the
possibility of future updates.4
       Policymakers’ beliefs about unobservables and the model’s constant coeﬃcients are denoted
by hats. All these beliefs are formed at time t, but the subscript is omitted for simplicity. In
particular, ûN                N
              t−1 stands for ût−1|t and indicates the estimate at time t of the value of the natural

rate at time t − 1. Policymakers determine the optimal value of the policy variable V by solving
the following optimization problem:
                            ∞
                            X     h                 ¡          ¢2                  i
                   minL = Ê δ t−s (π t − π ∗ )2 + λ ut − kûN
                                                             t    + φ (Vt − Vt−1 )2 ,                     (6)
                   {Vt }
                                  t=s
                s.t.   π t = ĉπ + α̂(L)π t−1 − θ̂(L)(ut−1 − ûN
                                                               t−1 ) + ε̂t ,                              (7)

              (ut − ûN                          N
                      t ) = ĉu + ρ̂(L)(ut−1 − ût−1 ) + Vt−1 + η̂ t .                                    (8)

L represents the familiar quadratic loss function, which depends on deviations of inflation and
unemployment from the respective targets. λ represents the weight on the unemployment
objective. Notice that, like in Barro and Gordon (1983), the target for the unemployment
   4
    These assumptions are standard in the adaptive learning literature, although the resulting policymakers’
behavior is suboptimal. For alternative approaches, see Beck and Wieland (2002) and Wieland (2000a and 2000b).


                                                      8
rate is given by kûN
                    t . When k = 0 the unemployment target is equal to zero and policymakers’

preferences resemble Kydland and Prescott’s (1977). This would be the case in which the policy
time-consistency problem is most pronounced. On the other hand, when k = 1, the target is the
natural rate and the time-consistency and the related inflation bias completely disappear from
the policy problem. Blinder (1998), among others, has argued in favor of these kind of policy
preferences. The loss function has also a “smoothing” component, which penalizes big shifts
of the policy variable. From an empirical perspective, this term is crucial in order to match
the actual policy behavior because it helps to account for the strong autocorrelation shown
by the instruments of economic policy (Dennis 2001, Favero and Rovelli 2003 and Soderstrom,
Soderlind, and Vredin 2003). See also Woodford (2003) for an overview of the theoretical
desirability of the smoothing term in the monetary policy context. Moreover, it is easy to
think to models in which instrument smoothing is desirable also for fiscal policy (for example,
Barro 1979).
       Policymakers minimize their loss function subject to two constraints, (7) and (8). These
constraints are the estimated counterparts of the true Phillips curve and aggregate demand
equations. Observe that in the policymakers’ model α̂(1) is not constrained to be equal to one
and ĉπ in (7) controls their beliefs about the level of average inflation. ĉu in (8) instead controls
their beliefs about the eﬀect of setting V equal to zero. In other words, −ĉu represents the
“natural” level of policy, i.e. the level of V that does not aﬀect unemployment.5 Notice that,
without further assumptions, ĉπ , ĉu and ûN
                                             t would not be separately identified in the policy

econometric model. A discussion about this issue is postponed until the next subsection.
       The optimal rule for fixing Vt is given by

                                                   Vt = g(β̂)St ,                                                (9)

where β̂ represents the vector of values for the model’s parameters that policymakers treat as
certainty-equivalents; g(β̂) is the standard solution of a linear-quadratic problem, obtained solv-
ing the corresponding Riccati equation. St meanwhile denotes the set of relevant state variables
and beliefs about unobservable states of the economy. To be more concrete, assuming that all the
                                                                       h                                            i

       In the true model the “natural” level of policy is normalized to zero.

2.3   Learning

To implement the optimal rule and fix the value of the policy variable Vt , policymakers must
estimate the parameters of interest, which are the unobservables and the coeﬃcients. While I
relax this assumption in Primiceri (2004), here I assume that policymakers form their beliefs
about the natural unemployment rate using univariate methods, i.e. they extract information
about the natural rate, only looking at the behavior of unemployment. Observe that this is
suboptimal as, conditional on the true model of the economy, better estimates could be obtained
by exploiting the information contained not only in the unemployment rate, but also in the
inflation rate. However, there are several reasons motivating this choice.
   First, historical narrative evidence (see, for instance, DeLong 1997, Romer and Romer 2002)
suggests that this is a realistic assumption for the behavior of past policymakers. Even now,
univariate algorithms are commonly used to define the potential of the economy, especially in the
output gap and monetary policy literature (see, for instance, Orphanides and Van Norden 2001,
Lansing 2002, Taylor 1999). Second, Staiger, Stock, and Watson (2001) show that the natural
rate estimated using formally the Phillips curve approach is basically indistinguishable from the
univariate trend in unemployment. The last reason is substantial. In fact, as mentioned above,
ĉπ , ĉu and ûN
                t are clearly not separately identified in equations (7) and (8). Therefore, I assume

that policymakers solve this identification problem by imposing the prior belief that on average,
unemployment is equal to its natural rate. This assumption provides a very natural way of
estimating the natural rate, which is to use univariate algorithms on the series of unemployment,
in order to isolate the low frequency component. Furthermore, observe that this assumption
is not contradictory and respects the coherence of the policymakers’ model because, as will be
shown in section 2.4 and appendix A, it correspond to a self-confirming equilibrium.
   Conditional on their estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, policymakers can esti-
mate the model’s coeﬃcients using standard regression methods. Following a large part of the
most recent literature (see, among others, Sargent 1999, Williams 2003) in the baseline specifica-
tion of the model I assume that policymakers update their beliefs using constant gain algorithms
(CG). These algorithms allow to update beliefs discounting the past and giving more weight to
recent data. Recent data are considered more informative possibly because of the suspicion of
drift in the parameters.
   As mentioned above, the estimation works in two steps. In the first step policymakers obtain




                                                 10
an estimate of the current value of the natural rate using the following updating formula:
                                                               ³               ´
                                                          −1
                                 ûN
                                   t|t = ûN
                                           t−1|t−1 + gN RN,t−1  u t − ûN
                                                                        t−1|t−1 ,                                   (10)
                               RN,t = RN,t−1 + gN (1 − RN,t−1 ) .                                                   (11)

Equation (10) states that the current estimate of the natural rate is obtained by updating the
previous estimate according to the current realization of the unemployment rate. The weight
given to the last observation depends on the gain (gN ) and the inverse of the variance of the
regressor (the constant 1 in this case), which, in turn, is updated in equation (11).
         In the second step, policymakers use their estimate of the natural rate to update their beliefs
about the Phillips curve and aggregate demand coeﬃcients:

                              i      i
                                                      ³              i
                                                                        ´

              π                                                                                                     u
where β̂ t = [ĉπ ; α̂1 ; α̂2 ; θ̂1 ; θ̂2 ]0 ; ytπ = π t ; xπt = [1; π t−1 ; π t−2 ; ut−1 − ûN              N
                                                                                              t|t ; ut−2 − ût|t ]; β̂ t =
[ĉu ; ρ̂1 ; ρ̂2 ]0 ; ytu = ut − ûN             u                N              N
                                   t|t − Vt−1 ; xt = [1; ut−1 − ût|t ; ut−2 − ût|t ]. Notice from the expressions of
the vectors xπt and xut that policymakers approximate ûN           N
                                                        t−1|t and ût−2|t with their last estimate
of the current level of the natural rate, ûN
                                            t|t . Equations (12) and (13) update beliefs with a
mechanism similar to the one illustrated for equations (10) and (11).
         Observe that I allow for the possibility of diﬀerent gain parameters in the algorithms for the
estimation of the natural rate and the coeﬃcients (respectively gN and g). The gain parameters
control the rate at which new information aﬀects beliefs. If g and gN were decreasing and equal
      1
to   t−1 ,   equations (10), (11), (12) and (13) would be recursive representations of ordinary least
squares estimates (if properly initialized).
         As robustness checks, I also consider the cases in which policymakers form estimates of the
natural rate using a moving average and estimates of the coeﬃcients by ordinary least squares
(OLS) or discounted least squares (DLS), a weighted least square method with weight ∆t−s to
time s observation (where t is the time period of the most recent data and ∆ < 1 is a discount
factor).


2.4        Equilibrium and Steady State

As is standard in most of the recent literature on learning, I focus on the concept of self-
confirming equilibria.6 In period t, policymakers form beliefs about the model’s parameters.
     6
         For a formal treatment of the issue, see Sargent (1999), Evans and Honkapohja (2001), Williams (2003).


                                                           11
Their beliefs imply an optimal value for the policy variable Vt , which, in turn, aﬀects the
stochastic data generating process and, ultimately, next periods beliefs. This defines a map from
today’s beliefs to tomorrow’s beliefs. A fixed point of this map is a self-confirming equilibrium.
In other words, a self-confirming equilibrium is a situation in which policymakers’ beliefs are
expected not to change with the new vintage of data. Appendix A gives a formal definition and
derives the model’s self-confirming equilibrium for the baseline case in which beliefs are formed
using the CG algorithm.
   I define the model’s steady state as the unconditional mean of the stationary stochastic
                      £                   ¤
process for the vector π t , ut , Vt , uN
                                        t   in a self-confirming equilibrium. Observe that, in steady
state, (5) implies ut = u∗ . Consequently, Vt = 0 follows from (2). Finally (9) implicitly defines
the steady state inflation as a function of the equilibrium beliefs.
        As an example and for simplicity, consider the intuitive case of a constant natural unem-
ployment rate.7 Notice that, if k = 1, the steady state inflation is just the inflation target π ∗ .
In other words, if policymakers do not wish to push unemployment below the natural rate, the
outcome is the optimal one in which unemployment is at the natural level and inflation at the
target. If 0 ≤ k < 1 instead, the steady state inflation will be higher. As it will be clear later,
the data favor a model with a limited amount of inflation bias, due to the fact that postwar
policymakers did not seem to have an excessively low unemployment target.


3        Interpreting the Great Inflation

In section 2 I have presented the baseline model of the paper and discussed the related technical
issues. I now introduce a simplified version of the model and use it to interpret and explain the
postwar behavior of inflation and unemployment in the United States. Therefore, while the rest
of the paper focuses on estimation and simulations, the objective of this section is to provide
the intuition and the main ideas necessary to interpret the quantitative results.
    7
      In the case of a constant natural rate of unemployment it is easy to check that, in the self-confirming
equilibrium,
       beliefs about the model’s coeﬃcients coincide with the true values. As shown in the appendix, when
V ar uN t  is bigger than zero equilibrium beliefs about the model’s parameters do not necessarily coincide with
the true parameters of the model, but can be arbitrarily close.




                                                      12
3.1     A Special Case

As an illustrative example, consider the special case of the previous model given by the following
simplified Phillips curve and aggregate demand equations:

                                             π t = π t−1 − θ(ut−1 − uN ) + εt                                        (14)

                             (ut − uN ) = Vt ,                                                                       (15)

where policymakers determine V by solving the following problem:
                                                      ∞
                                                      X      h      ¡          ¢2 i
                              minL = Ê                 δ t−s π 2t + ut − kûN      ,
                              {Vt }
                                                      t=s
                           s.t.     π t = ĉπ + α̂π t−1 − θ̂(ut−1 − ûN ) + b
                                                                            εt ,                                     (16)

                         (ut − ûN ) = ĉu + Vt .

Observe that in order to obtain a closed form solution I have modified the timing of V in (15).
The set of estimated parameters is given by β̂ = [ĉπ ; ĉu ; α̂; θ̂; ûN ] and the states of the policy
optimization problem are collected in St = [1; π t ]. The solution of the policy problem is given
by the following linear control rule:

                                  Vt = g(β̂)St = −ĉu + A(β̂) + B(β̂)π t ,                                           (17)

and                                                                      r³

                                                                         2b
                                                                          α
Observe that B(β̂) is always positive (for positive values of α̂). This implies that policy reacts
to inflation by pushing the unemployment rate upwards. Substituting (17) into (15) and the
resulting equation into (14) we obtain the following equation for the inflation rate:
                              ¡        ¢          ³          ´
                       π t = θ uN − ûN − θA(β̂) + 1 − θB(β̂) π t−1 + εt .                                           (18)

This equation can be interpreted as a local approximation of inflation dynamics for given policy-
makers’ beliefs about the state of the economy. Notice that the mismeasurement of the natural
rate of unemployment shifts the mean of the inflation process. Instead, the strength of the
policy reaction to inflation aﬀects the persistence and therefore both the mean and the variance

                                                                    13
of the inflation process. In other words, the stronger policy reacts to inflation in the feedback
rule, the more stationary and less volatile is inflation. In particular, it is easy to show that B(·)
is a positive function of α̂ (the estimated persistence) for all positive values of α̂ and θ̂ (the
estimated slope of the Phillips curve). This implies that the lower the estimated persistence of
inflation in the Phillips curve, the lower the reaction to inflation and, given (18), the higher the
actual persistence of the univariate, reduced form process for inflation.
   Similar perverse dynamics can occur for wrong estimates of θ. In fact, B(·) is a positive
                                 q
function of θ̂ for values of θ̂ < 1δ − α̂2 , which corresponds to estimated set of possible values of
θ̂.8 This means that the lower the estimated slope of the Phillips curve, the lower the reaction
to inflation and, given (18), the higher the actual inflation persistence. That is, if policymakers
perceive a costly inflation-unemployment trade-oﬀ, they will not be willing to accept higher
unemployment for a limited relief from inflation. Therefore, they will react to inflation less
strongly, ultimately leading to a less stationary inflation.
    The extreme case of a unit root in the reduced form, univariate inflation process (18) occurs
if policy does not respond to inflation at all. For example, this can happen if the perceived slope
of the Phillips curve is zero. Figure 2 gives an idea of the shape of the function B(·). Figure
2a shows B as a function of α̂, when θ̂ is fixed to three diﬀerent values. Besides the positive
slope in all cases, notice the pronounced nonlinearity of B as a function of α̂, especially for high
values of α̂. Figure 2b shows instead the opposite case in which α̂ is fixed to three diﬀerent
values and θ̂ is allowed to change. Interestingly, the eﬀect of increasing θ̂ on B, heavily depends
on the value of α̂: the higher the estimate of inflation persistence, the higher the eﬀect of the
estimate of the slope of the Phillips curve on the strength of the reaction to inflation. This will
be crucial to explain the sharpness of the disinflation.
    It is important to realize that the case of weak policy reaction to inflation leads to inflation
close to a unit root process. This is particularly dangerous for the stability of this economy.
The reason is that if inflation is stationary, a mistake in the estimation of the natural rate shifts
the mean of the process. If inflation exhibits a unit root instead, a mistake in the estimate of
the natural rate creates a time trend in the inflation process.
    It is easy to check that for this simple economy, the self-confirming equilibrium corresponds
               £          ¤
to β̂ = β = 0; α; θ; uN . It follows that the associated stationary stochastic process for the
random vector [π t , ut , Vt ] is a simple VAR(1), whose coeﬃcients are omitted for brevity. The
                                  h                     i
                                     (1−k)uN
steady state is [π t , ut , Vt ] = θ+B(β)+1−1/δ ; uN ; 0 . Notice that if k = 1 the steady state inflation
  8
    Overall B(·) is a hump-shaped function of θ̂. See Rudebusch (2001) for an example of parameter values for
which, locally, B(·) is a negative function of θ̂.

is equal to zero. If 0 ≤ k < 1 instead, we have a positive inflation bias. For values of k close to
one, the inflation bias is rather small.


3.2      A Simple Story for the Great Inflation

The Great Inflation refers to the high inflation and unemployment episode of the 1960s, 1970s
and early 1980s (figure 1). The model of the previous section provides a useful and powerful
tool for the interpretation of this long and important episode of U.S. recent economic history.
       I begin the imaginary simulation in 1960. Figure 3 plots real-time estimates of the natural
rate of unemployment, inflation persistence in the Phillips curve and the slope of the Phillips
curve, starting in 1960 and formed using data from 1948. These represent measures of real-
time policymakers’ beliefs aﬀecting the choice of the policy variable V . Inflation persistence is
measured by the sum of coeﬃcients on lagged inflation, i.e. α̂(1) in (7). The slope of the Phillips
curve is measured as the sum of coeﬃcients on unemployment deviations from the natural rate,
i.e. −θ̂(1) in (7). Finally, these estimates are constructed using the baseline, constant gain
learning algorithm of section 2.3, but their qualitative behavior is very robust to the alternative
specifications of the learning algorithm.


3.2.1      The period of overoptimism

To start, notice that in the first part of the sample policymakers’ estimates of the natural rate
of unemployment were between 4 percent and 5 percent. These are low numbers, compared
to our current estimates of the level of the natural rate in the 1960s and the first part of the
1970s.9
       This erroneous belief that the natural rate was so low led to overexpansionary monetary and
fiscal policies. However, while this can explain why inflation started rising in the early 1960s,
it is not suﬃcient to explain why rational policymakers let inflation increase so much and for
such a long period of time. What is key to rationalize policymakers’ behavior in the 1960s and
1970s, is realizing that they were uncertain not only about the value of the natural rate, but
also about the value of all remaining parameters of their model. In particular, observe that the
real-time estimate of inflation persistence (α(1)) in the early 1960s was approximately equal to
0.5 (figure 3b).10
   9
     For example, compare figure 3a to the model-based, smoothed estimates of the natural rate of unemployment
plotted in figure 4.
  10
     Remember that if the sum of coeﬃcients on past inflation in the Phillips curve is less than one, this implies
the existence of a long-run trade-oﬀ between inflation and unemployment.



                                                       15
   According to the model, a low estimate of α̂(1) implies a low reaction to inflation, due to
the wrong belief that inflation is rather stationary around some mean. This explains the passive
behavior of policymakers in the 1960s. I will refer to this period as the overoptimism period,
during which inflation was perceived as stationary, the natural rate of unemployment as low
and the optimal policy was keeping unemployment close to the estimated natural rate, without
much concern for the accelerating inflation.
   By now, it is not controversial that policymakers’ real-time estimates of the natural rate,
inflation persistence and the inflation-unemployment long run trade-oﬀ were too optimistic in
that period (see, for example, Orphanides and Williams 2002, DeLong 1997, Mayer 1999 and
Romer and Romer 2002).


3.2.2     The period of overpessimism

Slowly something changed. In fact, as suggested by the model and confirmed by figure 3b the
estimates of α(1) should be slowly revised upwards, towards the true value of one.
   However, while this would imply a reinforcement of the policy reaction to inflation, policy
reaction remained low because of the following perverse mechanism: policymakers noticed that
pushing unemployment above the underestimated natural rate did not provide any relief from
inflation. As a consequence they revised toward zero their beliefs about the slope of the Phillips
curve (θ̂ decreases in the early 1970s, as shown in figure 3c). As implied by the model, this
reduced the strength of policy reaction to inflation. In other words, even after the overoptimism
period, policymakers kept reacting weakly to inflation, this time because they perceived a very
costly inflation-unemployment trade-oﬀ. Okun (1978) provides clear evidence that this was
actually the case. In fact, he surveys a number of papers written in the 1970s by important
economists and concludes that “the average estimate of the cost of 1 point reduction in the
basic inflation rate is 10 percent of a year’s GNP” (Okun 1978, p. 348). Another example that
the perceived sacrifice ratio was very high is the following statement by the Economic Report
of the President (EROP):

        When inflation failed to respond significantly to macroeconomic policy, a 90-day
        wage and price freeze was announced on August 15, 1971; it was followed by a
        period of mandatory wage and price controls. (EROP 1979, pp. 54-55.)

Commenting on the current economic conditions, the 1972 EROP further referred to a:

        tendency to an unsatisfactorily high rate of inflation which persists over a long

                                               16
        period of time and is impervious to variations in the rate of unemployment, so that
        the tendency cannot be eradicated by any feasible acceptance of unemployment.
        (EROP 1972, p. 113.)

Even in 1979, the EROP wrote:

        We will not try to wring inflation out of our economic system by pursuing policies
        designed to bring about a recession. That course of action ... would be ineﬀective.
        Twice in the past decade inflation has accelerated and a recession has followed, but
        each recession brought only limited relief from inflation. (EROP 1979, p. 7.)

   I will refer to this period as the overpessimism period, during which policy did not fight
inflation because policymakers “did not believe it would work at an acceptable cost” (DeLong
1997, p. 264). The overpessimism period is successive to the overoptimism one and accounts
for the long duration of the hump-shaped episode.


3.2.3     The disinflation

In the meantime, policymakers’ estimate of inflation persistence in the Phillips curve had been
updated toward the true value of one. In this situation, even small changes of the policy variable
are perceived to have long-lasting consequences on the inflation rate. Hence, as shown in figure
2b, the model predicts that small updates of the estimate of the slope of the Phillips curve have
large eﬀects on the strength of the policy reaction. Therefore, the episode of high inflation ended
after a proper revision of the estimate of the slope of the Phillips curve. This happened because
of a sequence of new exogenous shocks, which caused updates of θ̂ toward the self-confirming
equilibrium. When the bias of θ̂ decreased and the perceived inflation-unemployment trade-oﬀ
improved, policymakers reacted strongly to high inflation, because they finally had a model of
the economy that was approximately correct. Consequently, unemployment was pushed quickly
way above the estimated natural rate. The sharp disinflation was the result of this prompt and
strong action. Policy maintained a high unemployment rate until inflation came back under
control. At that point unemployment slowly returned to levels close to the natural rate.
   Notice that the model’s predictions match very well the stylized facts. In fact, not only is the
model able to account for the dimension and the duration of the episode, but it is also able to
explain why the disinflation period was shorter than the run-up period and why unemployment
increased and decreased during the 1970s and early 1980s, lagging behind inflation.



                                                17
   It is important to stress that this paper oﬀers an explanation of the Volcker disinflation,
which is not based on a sudden change of policymakers’ preferences in the late 1970s. Here,
instead, the disinflation occurs when the perceived inflation-unemployment trade-oﬀ becomes
favorable, relative to the level of inflation.


3.2.4   The cost of disinflation

The fact that the disinflation is delayed due to the perceived high sacrifice ratio represents an
important diﬀerence between this paper and Sargent (1999). In Sargent (1999), policymakers
believe that policy is able to aﬀect real activity only by directly controlling inflation. Therefore,
when the correlation between inflation and unemployment approaches zero (like in the early
1970s), for Sargent’s (1999) policymakers this represents a unique opportunity to disinflate,
since it can be done at no cost in terms of real activity. This does not seem to correspond to
what we observe in the data.
   Like this paper, also Cogley and Sargent (2004) interpret the rise and fall of inflation as
the result of a learning process of U.S. policimakers. However, the policymakers in their paper
consider the prescriptions of three policy models and the delayed disinflation is explained by
their concern for robustness. Although I do not deny that this might be an important part of
the story, here I move in another direction. In fact, I show that a perfect explanation of the
behavior of inflation can be obtained when policy is based simply on one model of the economy,
if only one is willing to assume that policymakers in the 1960s and 1970s regarded real activity
and not inflation under their control. Although they do not provide conclusive evidence, the
quotes of section (3.2.2) suggest that this might have actually been the case. Building a model
with this feature constitute one important innovation of this paper.
   Another crucial diﬀerence between this paper and Cogley and Sargent (2004) (as well as
Sargent 1999 or Sargent, Williams, and Zha 2004) is the fact that, as a “true” structure of the
economy, I use a reduced form new-Keynesian model, which allows me to explain the behavior of
unemployment during the Great Inflation. The use of a “true” model of the economy similar to
Lucas (1972) and Sargent (1973) (together with their assumption about the public’s expectations
formation) prevents Cogley and Sargent (2004), Sargent (1999) and Sargent, Williams, and Zha
(2004) from oﬀering any explanation for the hump-shape behavior of unemployment.

4         Empirical Evidence

This section presents empirical evidence supporting the model of section 2 and the dynamics
illustrated in section 3.
         I estimate the model by maximum likelihood methods, over a sample period running from
1960:I to 2002:IV, using quarterly data on inflation and unemployment.11 I let policymakers es-
timate the approximate model and, consequently, choose V in every period. Putting the model
in state space form, the likelihood can be computed using the Kalman filter (see appendix
                                                                £                                          ¤
B). The likelihood is maximized with respect to nine parameters, α1 ; θ1 ; θ2 ; ρ1 ; ρ2 ; k; φ; σ 2ε ; σ 2η ,
while I fix δ = 0.99, π ∗ = 2, λ = 1, u∗ = 6, γ = 0.99, σ 2τ = 0.0199. Fixing δ is standard
practice. I fix π ∗ = 2 because this number is close to the estimates of the inflation target level
for the post-Volcker era (see, for instance, Bullard and Eusepi 2003, Schorfheide 2003, Favero
and Rovelli 2003). However, diﬀerently from these previous studies, there is no exogenous
switch in the level of the inflation target in my model. λ is set to 1 to be consistent with
some previous studies (for example, Sims 1988 and Sargent 1999).12 Finally, for the coef-
ficients of the exogenous process driving the natural rate, u∗ = 6 is chosen to match the
average of unemployment during the sample period. γ is fixed at 0.99 and σ 2τ at 0.0199 to
impose the prior belief that the natural rate is smoother than unemployment itself. Notice
that the value of γ and σ 2τ imply an unconditional variance of one for the natural rate. Fur-
thermore, in the case of the constant gain learning, g is set to 0.015 and gN to 0.03. Ob-
serve that the constant gain for the estimation of the natural rate of unemployment is higher
than the one for the estimation of the parameters. This captures the fact that policymak-
ers expect the natural rate to drift more than the model’s coeﬃcients. I calibrate the initial
beliefs in the most natural way, that is using the actual data from 1948 to 1960.13 This pro-
                                                                h                                                  i

[1.156; 0.330; 0.131; −0.914; 0.885; 0.012; 1.536; −0.717; 4.701].


4.1        Statistical Evidence

The point estimates and the standard errors of the free coeﬃcients are reported in table 1 for
the three specifications of the learning algorithm. Four results stand out. First, the estimates
    11
     As in the rest of the paper, inflation is measured by the annualized quarterly growth rate of the GDP deflator
and unemployment by quarterly averages of the monthly civilian unemployment rate.
  12
     Interestingly, if λ is treated as a free parameter in the estimation procedure, the point estimate is 0.99, with
a standard error of 0.36.
  13
     I used the DLS algorithm with discount rate ∆ = 1 − 1/120.



                                                         19
obtained using diﬀerent assumptions for the policymakers’ learning process are very similar to
each other. Second, the estimate of φ, the smoothing coeﬃcient in the policy loss function,
might appear as too high. However, once movements in the policy variable V are interpreted
in terms of deviations of unemployment from the natural rate, the size of φ is not a puzzle
anymore.14 Third, all the other coeﬃcients have reasonable sign and size. Fourth, the estimate
of k, the parameter that aﬀects the unemployment target in the loss function (6), is close to
unity, casting doubt on the inflationary bias story that I mentioned in the introduction.
    Figure 4 plots the smoothed estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, which resembles
previous estimates in the literature (Staiger, Stock, and Watson, 1997 and 2001, Gordon, 1997).
    Figure 5 plots the evolution over time of the model’s policy variable V . A measure of the
real rate of interest (rescaled)15 is reported for comparison. Notice the similarities between the
two series, especially in the second part of the sample. This is remarkable, if we consider that
the time series for V has been obtained without any information related to the interest rate.


4.2    Model’s fit

In order to evaluate the fit of the model, I compare it to the fit of unrestricted multivariate
linear models, i.e. bivariate vector autoregressions (VAR) with inflation and unemployment,
similar to the ones used in King and Watson (1994). I consider the three alternatives of a
VAR(2), a VAR(3) and a VAR(4), where the number in parenthesis indicates the number of
lags included in the VAR. Table 2 reports three measures of fit for the learning models and the
reference ones. The first column of table 2 reports the value of the log-likelihood, evaluated
at the peak. The log-likelihood is useful, but certainly not very informative in a case in which
the candidate models have such a diﬀerent number of free parameters. A VAR(2) has 13 free
parameters, a VAR(3) has 17 and a VAR(4) has 21, as opposed to the 9 free parameters of
my model. The diﬀerence in the number of free parameters is so large that, even though the
models are non-nested, it is reasonable to expect a lower log-likelihood for the learning models
with respect to the reference ones.
    To solve this problem, the second column of table 2 reports the Bayesian Information Crite-
  14
      For example, consider a permanent unitary increase in the level of Vt . This would create a permanent
deviation of unemployment from the natural rate equal to 1−ρ(1)1
                                                                  . Therefore the term φVt2 in the loss function
                                                                                                       2
could be expressed in terms of deviations of unemployment from the target as φ (1 − ρ(1))2 ut − ûN   t    , where
the weight becomes φ (1 − ρ(1))2 . If unemployment is very persistent, ρ(1) will be close to one and φ (1 − ρ(1))2
will be a small number, despite a very high φ.
  15
     The real rate of interest is computed as federal funds rate minus the quarterly inflation rate averaged over
the last four quarters.




                                                       20
rion (BIC). BIC is an asymptotic approximation of the marginal likelihood and automatically
penalizes models with higher number of parameters.
       The third column of table 2 is in principle the most reliable measure of fit. The last column
in fact reports the logarithm of the marginal likelihood itself, which, is proportional to the
posterior probability of the model, under flat prior on the models’ space.16
       From table 2 it is clear that, as expected, the log-likelihood of the learning models is lower
than the unrestricted alternatives. However, once the diﬀerent number of parameters is taken
into account, it seems that the learning models fit the data better than the reference VARs. In
particular, the marginal likelihood favors the learning models over the alternative ones. Observe
that the results of the model comparison exercise are robust to diﬀerent policymakers’ learning
schemes.


4.3      Simulations

This subsection considers quantitative simulations of the model in the case of the benchmark
(CG) specification. The purpose of these simulations is twofold. First, they show that the
model produces a pronounced, prolonged and asymmetric hump-shaped behavior of inflation
and unemployment. In addition, these simulations highlight that the mismeasurement of the
natural rate of unemployment alone is not suﬃcient to reproduce this kind of hump-shaped
behavior.
       In order to do so, I conduct the following exercise. I start in 1960:I, assuming that data on
inflation and unemployment are the actual data from 1948:I to 1959:IV. In 1960:I, policymakers
optimize their objective function, on the base of the current estimates and fix the value of V
for the current period. Unemployment and inflation in 1960:II are determined through the true
Phillips curve and aggregate demand equations, (5) and (2). In the next period, policymakers
reestimate their approximate model and choose the new value for the policy variable. With this
mechanism I simulate 42 years of quarterly data, up to 2002. In the simulations I assume that
the true value of the model’s parameters are the values estimated in the previous subsection and
reported in the first column of table 1. Also as “true” natural rate of unemployment I use the
smoothed estimate plotted in figure 4. Finally, I perform the simulations generating sequences
  16
     The marginal likelihood is computed using the Laplace method, based on a second order approximation of the
posterior around the peak. For the VAR models instead, it is possible to compute the exact marginal likelihood.
Since the computation of the marginal likelihood requires the use of a proper prior, to remain as agnostic as
possible, for the model comparison I use training sample priors. Therefore, while the original sample starts in
1960, I extend it back to 1953. The (properly rescaled) likelihood of the training sample is then interpreted as a
prior density for the original sample. Further details can be found in Sims (2002) and Sims (2003).



                                                       21
of i.i.d. random innovations with mean zero and variance corresponding to the estimated value
reported in table 1.
       I perform 3, 000 simulations using identical initial conditions for policymakers’ beliefs in
1960 (the ones reported in section 4), but diﬀerent series of exogenous shocks. The main results
are summarized in figure 6. Figures 6a-d graph the empirical distribution of four objects:
the maximum level reached by the inflation rate between 1960 and 2002 (max(π)); the time
period in which inflation reaches its maximum level (t∗π ); the maximum level reached by the
unemployment rate between 1960 and 2002 (max(u)); the diﬀerence (expressed in years) between
the time period in which unemployment peaks and the time period in which inflation peaks
(t∗u −t∗π ). The scatter plots of figures 6e and 6f are meant to illustrate two bivariate relations: the
relation between peak time and the peak level of inflation; the relation between the peak level of
unemployment and inflation. Overall, figure 6 makes clear that the model reproduces remarkably
well the main characteristics of the Great Inflation. In particular, the model fully captures the
dimension, the duration of the high inflation episode and the fact that unemployment peaks
after inflation.
       Showing that, on average, the simulated time paths exhibit a rapid disinflation is less
straightforward, because simply averaging the simulated time paths would not preserve the
typical shape. To solve this problem I compute the average path, but only after rescaling the
horizontal and vertical axis in every simulation, to make them peak at the same time and at the
same level.17 The result is plotted in figure 7, where the peak time of the average inflation path
is normalized to zero and the peak value to the peak level of actual inflation in 1981. Actual
inflation is also reported for comparison. The striking feature of figure 7 is that the average
of the simulated paths captures perfectly the so called Volcker disinflation, that many macro
models have diﬃculties in addressing.
       Figure 8a plots a simulation of the behavior of inflation and unemployment, when the
standard deviation of the shocks to the Phillips curve and the aggregate demand are chosen as
small as possible and are fixed respectively to 0 and 0.005.18 This is clearly improper, since
the model is nonlinear and the size of the shocks might aﬀect the speed of the learning process.
Nevertheless, if we keep this in mind, this simulation shows that the model can capture perfectly
  17
     In order to determine the peak time of inflation in a robust way, I compute a five years moving average for
every simulated path and select the point in time in which the resulting smooth series reaches the maximum.
  18
     Two observations are necessary at this point. First, the standard deviation of the shocks to the aggregate
demand cannot be set to zero because some random variation in the regressors of the Phillips curve is necessary for
a meaningful learning dynamics and the convergence to the self-confirming equilibrium. Second, the simulations
with low or zero variance shocks look all exactly the same except for the time period in which inflation (and, of
course, unemployment) peaks.


                                                        22
well the low frequency behavior of inflation and unemployment, even with small exogenous
shocks. This exercise stresses further the role of initial beliefs, which play a more prominent
role than the exogenous shocks in the generation of these peculiar dynamics. This diﬀers from
Sargent, Williams, and Zha (2004).
   Figure 8a is also very interesting for the behavior of the simulated path of inflation in the
last part of the sample. In the 1990s, the “true” series of the natural rate of unemployment
exhibits a sharp decline (corresponding to the advent of the so called “New Economy”), which
is recognized only gradually by policymakers in the simulation. Nevertheless, since in the 1990s
policymakers have approximately learnt the true values of the long and short run slopes of the
Phillips curve, they are able to prevent inflation from falling to undesirably low levels. This
matches very well the actual behavior of inflation in the last decade.
   To stress even more the importance of the misperception about the coeﬃcients of the Phillips
curve in the 1960s and 1970s, figures 8b and 8c plot the results of counterfactual simulation
exercises. Here I use the same sequence of random shocks used to generate figure 8a, but I
change some of the values of the parameters of the model. In the simulation of figure 8b I
assume that policymakers know the exact value of the slope of the Phillips curve. However
they are uncertain about the natural rate and inflation persistence in the Phillips curve and
they have to estimate them. It is evident that the high inflation episode would have lasted less
long and that the rapid disinflation would have disappeared. In figure 8c instead, I assume that
policymakers have the correct estimate of the parameters of the Phillips curve, except for the
natural rate, which is estimated in the usual way. It is clear that, if this had been the case,
inflation would have increased much less than it did. Indeed, this graph does not exhibit any
sizable low frequency behavior.
   In order to shed some light on the model’s implications for the future path of inflation, I
performed 1,000 simulations for the next 100 years. In these simulations over the period from
2003 to 2102, policymakers’ estimates of inflation persistence never reach the low levels of the
1960s, which means that normal supply and demand shocks do not seem to have a major eﬀect
on policymakers’ estimates of the Phillips curve coeﬃcients when enough data are available for
the estimation. As a consequence of this, in all these forward simulations, if and when inflation
goes up, it remains high only for a short period of time because, diﬀerently from the Great
Inflation, the propagation mechanism through learning is absent.




                                               23
4.4      The fit of alternative explanations

As shown in the previous section, the learning model is able to reproduce remarkably well
the postwar behavior of inflation and unemployment in the United States. The purpose of
this section is to compare the fit of the baseline learning model to the fit of some alternative
explanations of the Great Inflation.
       As I mentioned in the introduction, most of the alternative theories of the Great Inflation
adopt an exogenous shift in the preferences of policymakers to explain the sharp disinflation and
the low level of inflation since the early 1980s. On the other hand, the great advantage of the
approach taken in this paper is the fact that the time variation in the conduct of stabilization
policy is fully endogenized. To address this issue and assess the importance of the exogenous
and unexplainable channels of time variation in policy, I estimate a version of the learning model
where also the parameters of the loss function are allowed to vary over time. In particular, in
this subsection, I will assume the following form for the loss function of policymakers:
                            ∞
                            X      h                   ¡            ¢2                   i
                   L = Ê     δ s−t (π t − π ∗t )2 + λt ut − kt ûN
                                                                  t    + φ (Vt − Vt−1 )2
                                                                                           ,
                            s=t

which diﬀers from (6) because three of the parameters representing the preferences of policy-
makers (k, π ∗ and λ) are allowed to change over time. Following many previous studies (for
example, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler 2000), I model the time variation in k, π ∗ and λ in the
simplest possible way, i.e. allowing them to diﬀer between the pre and post-Volcker period:
                                                 ½ ∗
                                 ∗                [π 1 , k1 , λ1 ] for t < t̄
                              [π t , kt , λt ] =
                                                  [π ∗2 , k2 , λ2 ] for t ≥ t̄,
where t̄ is set to the fourth quarter of 1979.
       The estimates of the model with a break in the preferences of policymakers in addition to
learning are reported in the first column of table 4, together with the value of the log-likelihood
and the BIC.19 Notice that the parameter controlling the size of the inflationary bias (k) does
not change between the pre and post-Volcker periods. Instead, as expected, both the target for
inflation and the weight on the unemployment objective seem to decrease after 1979, although
the estimates are quite imprecise. In particular, the p-values for the tests with null hypothesis
of no change in π ∗ and λ are respectively 0.5 and 0.34, implying a failure to reject the null of no
change in both cases. This is confirmed by the relatively small improvement in the log-likelihood
and the substantial deterioration of the BIC.
  19
      The marginal likelihood for this model is not computed, since a prior for the preference parameters of the
post-Volcker period cannot be obtained using a training sample prior (and, therefore, the results would not be
easily comparable to the last column of table 2).


                                                      24
    As a further check, I consider another alternative, which is a model without learning on the
parameters of the Phillips Curve (except for the natural rate of unemployment), but with shifts
in the policymakers’ preferences. The estimates of this model are reported in the second column
of table 4. Notice that in this case k is estimated to be zero, both in the pre and post-Volcker
periods. On the other hand, both π ∗ and λ, seem to decrease in the second part of the sample.
The changes in the values of π ∗ and λ before and after 1979 are even larger than in the previous
case, but they are also even less precisely estimated. In fact, the p-values for the tests with
null hypothesis of no change in π ∗ and λ are respectively 0.52 and 0.5, implying again a failure
to reject the null of no change in both cases. The log-likelihood and the BIC improve over
the previous specification, but the BIC is still inferior with respect to the BIC of the baseline
learning model.
    The overall impression is that the fit of the baseline model is superior to the alternatives
presented in this subsection. In other words, once policymakers are assumed to learn over time
about the structural relations of the economy, the time variation in the policy preferences seems
redundant.


5    Policymakers’ Learning and Forward Looking Agents

In the model of section 2 I used the Phillips curve (1) that can be rewritten as the backward
looking equation (5), which is similar to the one estimated by policymakers. In other words
I have assumed that policymakers have the correct model of the economy in hand, but are
uncertain about the value of the model’s parameters. This section tests the robustness of the
results to alternative popular assumptions about the price setting equation. In particular, here
I will concentrate on the case in which price setters are forward looking (for example, as in
Calvo 1983). This assumption generates a forward looking Phillips curve, in which today’s
prices and inflation depend on expectations of future prices and inflation. For symmetry and in
the spirit of the recent new-Keynesian literature, I will also assume that the aggregate demand
equation has potentially a forward looking component. To be concrete, in this subsection I will
replace the Phillips curve and the aggregate demand, (5) and (2), with the following forward
looking versions:

                            1            d                   ¡        ¢
                    πt =       π t−1 +     Et−1 π t+1 − θEt−1 ut − uN
                                                                    t   + εt ,              (19)
                          1+d          1+d
                            ¡            ¢          ¡          ¢
              ut − uN
                    t   = ρb ut−1 − uN                      N
                                      t−1 + ρf Et−1 ut+1 − ut+1 + Vt−1 + η t ,              (20)




                                               25
where d is the private sector’s discount factor. The first equation is a forward looking Phillips
curve and, similarly to Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005), can be derived from the firms’
profits maximization problem. As in Calvo (1983), firms are assumed to be able to reoptimize
and set their prices with a certain probability in every period. If they do not reoptimize,
they are assumed to set their prices with an indexation mechanism to past inflation. This
simple indexation rule in the price setters behavior explains the backward looking component
in (19). As pointed out in many studies, this component helps to account for the high degree
of inflation persistence observed in the data (see, for instance, Fuhrer and Moore 1995, Gali
and Gertler 1999, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans 2005). Observe that (19) is a vertical
Phillips curve in the long run, implying absence of long run trade-oﬀ between inflation and
unemployment.
   The second equation is a forward looking aggregate demand equation. This expression can
be derived from the household maximization problem, allowing for external habit formation, as
in Smets and Wouters (2003), when ρb + ρf = 1 and ρb < 0.5. Habit formation explains the
backward looking component, which helps to account for the persistence observed in the data.
In my estimation and simulations I will relax the previous equality and inequality restrictions on
ρb and ρf because those restrictions seem to be at odds with the data. Observe that the value
of V is chosen by the policymakers in every period in the same way of section 2. In other words,
policymakers estimate the backward looking model given by (7) and (8) and fix V solving the
linear quadratic problem based on their current beliefs. Diﬀerently from the benchmark case,
policymakers not only are using estimated parameters instead of true ones, but they are also
using a model structure which is fundamentally diﬀerent from the true model of the economy.
   In order to solve the model and possibly estimate it, we need to make assumptions on the
private sector’s expectation formation process. As in Sargent (1999), I assume that the private
sector knows exactly the way policy is made. In other words, people know that policymakers
estimate (7) and (8) and fix V by solving the linear quadratic problem (6). However, there are
many possible assumptions for the way agents form their expectations on future policy. For
completeness, I analyze two alternative (and completely opposite) cases. As a starting point,
following most of the adaptive learning literature, I assume that the private sector thinks that
policymakers will not revise their estimates of (7) and (8) in the future and will continue to
implement policy based on their latest estimates of (7) and (8). For simplicity, I will denote
this behavior of the private sector as “partially rational”. As an alternative and complication
of the baseline hypothesis, I also analyze the case in which the private sector is “fully rational”



                                                26
and takes into account the fact that policymakers will revise their estimates of (7) and (8) on
the base of future data.


5.1     Partially Rational Private Agents

The solution of this first specification of the model is reasonably standard. In fact, under the
assumptions that the coeﬃcients g(β̂) in (9) remain constant in the infinite future, equations
(19), (20), (9) and (3) form a linear rational expectations system of equations (RESE), which
can be solved using standard methods (like Sims 2001a). In reality the coeﬃcients g(β̂) change,
therefore the RESE must be solved in every period of the sample to find the time varying data
generating process. Given a random sequence of exogenous, non-policy shocks, this method can
be used to construct simulated paths of the variables of interest. Given the actual data, this
method can be used to compute the likelihood and maximize it with respect to the model’s
parameters. I fix the private sector discount factor (d) to 0.99 and maximize the likelihood with
                              £                           ¤
respect to seven parameters θ; ρb ; ρf ; k; φ; σ 2ε ; σ 2η .
      The log-likelihood and BIC for the forward looking model are reported in table 5. Although
the data seem to favor the backward looking specification, it is worth focusing on the estimates
of the forward looking model. The point estimates and the standard errors of the parameters
are reported in table 5.20 First notice that the point estimate of θ has the correct sign, but it is
very small. However this must be expected. The reason is that, if the private sector thinks that
the policy rule parameters will not change in the future, a higher θ would imply an immediate
enormous eﬀect on inflation’s expectations and, consequently on inflation itself. We do not
observe this in the data. The second thing to notice is that the weight on the forward looking
component of the aggregate demand equation is estimated to be zero. The statistical evidence
for this result is very strong. In fact, when I reestimate the model imposing the restriction
ρf > 0.5, the log-likelihood drops dramatically. This makes equation (20) hard to reconcile
with the household optimization behavior and supports the skepticism shown, among others,
by Estrella and Fuhrer (2002) and Fuhrer and Rudebusch (2002).
      As in the previous section, I fix the parameters to their estimated value and perform 3, 000
simulations of the pattern of inflation and unemployment by generating random sequences of
exogenous shocks. The second column of table 3 reports medians, lower and upper quartiles of
max(π), max(u), t∗π and t∗u − t∗π . The median peak level of inflation is even higher than for the
baseline model, unemployment seems to peak a bit later and there is more uncertainty related
 20
      As in the benchmark case, here I assumed that policymakers learn using a constant gain algorithm.



                                                      27
to the peak time of inflation. However, overall, the summary statistics are in line with the
actual behavior of inflation and unemployment during the Great Inflation. The asymmetry of
the high inflation episodes generated by the forward looking model is demonstrated in figures
9a and 9b, which are constructed in the same way as figures 8a and 7.
    Summarizing, the results obtained with the baseline model are very robust to the use of the
forward looking Phillips curve. We observe both inflation increasing and decreasing faster, as
well as unemployment peaking after inflation.


5.2    Fully Rational Private Agents

The solution of the model with the full rationality assumption is non-standard. The reason is
that the system given by (19), (20), (3), (9), (10), (11), (12) and (13) is a nonlinear RESE,
because the coeﬃcients g(β̂) are nonlinear functions of the endogenous variables. To solve the
model I use numerical methods. In particular I apply the method that Fackler and Miranda
(2001) propose for a general nonlinear RESE. It consists in approximating unknown functions
(which, in our case, are the expectations Et−1 π t+1 and Et−1 ut+1 ) with projection techniques. In
other words, the response function is approximated by the function Φst−1 , where Φ is a matrix
of coeﬃcients and st−1 is a collection of basis functions of the state variables. The method
consists of replacing Et−1 π t+1 and Et−1 ut+1 with the approximations and finding the matrix of
coeﬃcients Φ∗ that solve the RESE. The diﬃculty here is the high dimension of the problem
and of the state vector. The details of the solution method are given in appendix C.
    The solution of the model can take hours, therefore estimation, though theoretically easy, is
not practical.21 For this reason I perform only a set of simulations, calibrating the model in the
                                                              £                         ¤
following way: as before, d is fixed to 0.99; the parameters ρb ; ρf ; k; φ; σ 2ε ; σ 2η are fixed to the
point estimates in the model’s specification of section 5.1; θ is fixed to 0.01, which is in the range
of the values that have been used by the literature. Notice that θ is fixed to be higher than
the point estimate in the previous specification. The reason is that, under this new assumption
on the expectation formation, the private sector recognizes that policy mistakes will be slowly
corrected in the future. Consequently, observing policy mistakes today does not cause a huge
eﬀect on expected inflation and inflation itself.
    I perform 3, 000 simulations and report medians, lower and upper quartiles of max(π),
max(u), t∗π and t∗u − t∗π in the last column of table 3. Observe that inflation and unemployment
continue to peak at high levels, which are comparable to what we observe in the data. However,
  21
     Since it would require several likelihood evaluation and, therefore, several model’s solutions for diﬀerent
values of the parameters.


                                                      28
on average, inflation peaks earlier and diﬀerence between the peak time of unemployment and
inflation is higher than in the simulations with the other models. This is confirmed by figure 9c
and 9d.
    Generally, two points stand out from the analysis of table 3 and figures 9c and 9d: first,
the simulations of this model continue to exhibit the pronounced and prolonged hump-shape
behavior of inflation and unemployment; second, the typical simulated path of inflation peaks
earlier and does not show a disinflation as sharp as the one observed in the data and reproduced
by the baseline model and the forward looking model of section 5.1. However, this is not at
all surprising, since the private sector is assumed to be forward looking and to take fully into
account future policy changes. If the private sector knows the way policy is made, it will predict
that policy will become very active against inflation as soon as policymakers’ estimates of the
Phillips curve will be revised. Inflation expectations will be automatically adjusted to take this
into account. Consequently, inflation will reflect these adjustments in expected inflation.
    This section suggests two conclusions. First, that even in the forward looking Phillips curve
case, introducing policymakers’ learning is important to explain the dimension and duration
of high inflation episodes. Second, that the assumption of fully rational agents, who form
their expectations taking into account the future evolution of policymakers’ beliefs about the
economy, is probably too strong and at odds with the data on the disinflation episode of 1981.


6    Stochastic Volatility and the Role of Non-Policy Shocks

In this section I extend the baseline framework to account for stochastic volatility. The fact
that exogenous shocks have exhibited high heteroskedasticity over the last forty years has been
highlighted in many studies (see, for instance, Cogley and Sargent 2003, Primiceri 2005, Sims
and Zha 2004, Stock and Watson 2002, Stock and Watson 2003). Furthermore, many authors
have argued that one of the main causes of the American inflation in the 1970s was exactly
a particularly bad sequence of exogenous, non-policy shocks (see, for instance, Blinder 1979).
On the other hand, this paper has so far provided an explanation of the high inflation episode
based on the policy behavior. Therefore, it seems natural to extend and reestimate the model
of section 2 allowing for heteroskedastic innovations. In this way, I leave it up to the data
to determine whether the channel of the policymakers’ behavior remains important once the
possibility of time varying variances is taken into account.
    There is also another reason why it is potentially very important to take heteroskedasticity
into account. This is because, in a learning model, the size of the exogenous shocks aﬀects

                                               29
the speed of the learning process. In very general terms, higher volatility of an equation’s
disturbances would slow down the learning process. On the other hand, higher volatility of the
regressors would speed up the learning process.
   In order to allow for heteroskedasticity, I make the assumption that the standard deviations
of the exogenous innovations of equations (5) and (2) follow a geometric random walk process:

                                  log σ ε,t = log σ ε,t−1 + ν ε,t ,                          (21)

                                  log σ η,t = log σ η,t−1 + ν η,t .                          (22)

This class of models is known as stochastic volatility models and constitutes an alternative to
ARCH and GARCH models. The crucial diﬀerence is that the variances generated by (21) and
(22) are unobservable components.
   The estimation of the model augmented with stochastic volatility is considerably more in-
volved than the benchmark case. I adopt Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for the
posterior numerical evaluation of the parameters of interest. MCMC deals eﬃciently with the
nonlinearities of the model, allowing to draw from lower dimensional and standard distributions
as opposed to the high dimensional joint posterior of the whole parameters set. Appendix D
gives the details of the estimation algorithm.
   The fourth column of table 1 reports the posterior median and the posterior standard de-
viations of the parameters of interest. They are similar to the benchmark case of the previous
section. Figure 10 plots the posterior median (and the 68 percent error band) of the time
varying standard deviations of the innovations to the Phillips curve and the aggregate demand
equation. Observe that the time path is consistent with the past literature (see, for instance,
Cogley and Sargent 2003, Primiceri 2005, Sims and Zha 2004, Stock and Watson 2002). The
variance of the innovations to the Phillips curve is low in the 1960s, high in the 1970s and early
1980s and low again since 1985 to the end of the sample. The variance of the demand shocks in
the aggregate demand equation follows approximately the same time pattern. Notice the sharp
decrease in the standard deviation of the shocks to the unemployment rate that occurred in the
early 1980s, a phenomenon which is known as the Great Moderation.
   I evaluate the role of the exogenous shocks in the high inflation episode of the 1970s by
performing counterfactual simulation exercises. The methodology I adopt is straightforward. I
fix the model’s coeﬃcients to the estimated posterior medians and reconstruct an estimate of
the sequence of exogenous shocks {εt }Tt=1 and {η t }Tt=1 . Starting from 1960:I, these shocks can
be used to simulate counterfactual data, constructed using diﬀerent values of the parameters.
These new series can be interpreted as the realization of the data that would have been observed,

                                                 30
had the parameters of the model been the ones used to generate the series. In this context,
the interesting experiment consists of replaying history assuming that the standard deviations
of the exogenous shocks were lower that the estimated standard deviations of the 1960s and
1970s. For comparison, figure 11a plots actual inflation and unemployment. Figure 11b plots the
counterfactual paths of inflation and unemployment when the time varying standard deviations
of supply and demand shocks are both replaced by their value in 1995, which is one of the
least volatile periods. It is clear that the diﬀerences from the actual behavior of inflation and
unemployment are minor, except, of course, for the reduced volatility. Figure 11c and 11d
plot the counterfactual paths of inflation and unemployment when the time varying standard
deviations of respectively supply and demand shocks are replaced by their value in 1995. Figure
11d shows that the worst scenario for inflation would have occurred in the case of reduced
volatility of the shocks to unemployment. The reason is that it would have slowed down the
updating process toward the self-confirming value for the beliefs about the slope of the Phillips
curve parameter. For the same reason, the best scenario would have been the one of figure 11c,
i.e. the case of reduced volatility of the supply shocks and the estimated historical volatility
of the demand shocks. Finally notice that, although the behavior of inflation diﬀers across the
four plots, even in the most favorable scenario of figure 11c, inflation would still have peaked at
the high level of about 9 percent.
    Overall, this section suggests two conclusions. First, allowing for heteroskedasticity of the
exogenous shocks does not undermine the results that the low frequency behavior of inflation
and unemployment is largely explained by the evolution of policymakers’ beliefs. Second, in
the context of this model, allowing for time varying variances does not generate important
diﬀerences in the speed of the policymakers’ learning process and the timing of the disinflation.
Instead, the dynamics seem to be mainly driven by the convergence process of policymakers’
beliefs to the self-confirming equilibrium, starting from the initial conditions. This finding also
facilitates the interpretation of figures 8a, 9a and 9c.


7    Why Did Inflation Rise?

In the previous sections I have argued that policymakers’ mistakes in the estimation of the
natural rate of unemployment can only explain why inflation started to increase in the early
1960s. Observe that mistakes in the estimation of the natural rate in real time are, to some
extent, unavoidable (see, for example, Orphanides and Van Norden 2001). This is because the
natural rate is intrinsically a time varying entity, due to a number of factors like demographics,

                                                 31
changes in productivity growth or labor market conditions (for an overview, see Ball and Mankiw
2002).
    On the other hand, the optimistic view about the natural rate is not enough to understand
why rational policymakers let inflation rise for more than fifteen years. In fact, I showed that
in the 1960s policymakers did not fight inflation strongly enough because they underestimated
the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve. This induced the peculiar dynamics described
in section III.
    Of course, a fundamental question is why policymakers started out with such downward
biased beliefs about the degree of inflation persistence in the Phillips curve (α(1)) in the 1960s?
The answer to this question is very simple and natural: because these beliefs were perfectly
consistent with the available data prior to 1960. Observe that this is true not only if we look at
data between 1948 and 1960 (like this paper does to calibrate initial beliefs), but also if we look
further back in the past. For example, Christiano and Fitzgerald (2003) provide unambiguous
evidence that all data between 1900 and 1960 appeared consistent with a stable long run trade-oﬀ
between inflation and unemployment. Similarly, Barsky (1987) uses data from 1890 to formally
show that strong inflation persistence emerged only around 1960. In other words, there was
basically no way for adaptive policymakers learning from the past to anticipate the high degree
of persistence of the last decades.
    There are obviously many possible reasons why the properties of the inflation-unemployment
process might have changed so drastically in the postwar period. One conjecture is that the
diﬀerent nature of the data is related to a change in monetary regimes like, for example, the
movement away from the Gold Standard and Bretton Woods (for an overview, see Bordo 1993).
This does not necessarily imply that inflation rose because policymakers abandoned the com-
mitment technology provided by fixed exchange rate regimes (like, for instance, in Bordo and
Kydland 1995). The interpretation provided in this paper is instead that inflation rose because
policymakers were simply slow to learn how to conduct policy under a new regime.


8    Concluding Remarks

This paper presents a simple model of inflation-unemployment dynamics when policymakers
have imperfect information. The source of imperfect information is the fact that policymakers
do not know the exact model of the economy. Therefore, they update their beliefs about the
model’s unknowns in every period and implement optimal policy, conditional on their current
beliefs.

                                                32
   The model’s self-confirming equilibrium is characterized by low inflation. Nevertheless,
the model can generate prolonged and asymmetric episodes of high inflation, which closely
resemble the run-up of US inflation in the 1960s and 1970s and the sharp disinflation in the early
1980s. In particular, these episodes occur when policymakers simultaneously underestimate
both the natural rate of unemployment and the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve.
Starting from this situation of overoptimistic beliefs, the model endogenously generates periods
in which policy is overpessimistic. During these periods policy mistakenly perceives the inflation-
unemployment trade-oﬀ as too costly. I show that it is not optimal to create a recession to stop
inflation, either if beliefs are overoptimistic or if they are overpessimistic. This is why the policy
action against inflation is delayed until the moment in which the perceived trade-oﬀ improves.
When this happens, inflation is already very high. Therefore, the policy action against inflation
is strong and decisive.
   Unlike most of the existing literature, the model matches many recognized stylized facts of
the American Great Inflation of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. I also formally estimate the model
by likelihood methods and find that it fits the behavior of US inflation and unemployment
remarkably well.
   Given the empirical support, the model can be used to evaluate the possibility that episodes
similar to the Great Inflation could happen again in the future. In this respect, the conclusion
of the paper is more optimistic than alternative theories. In this model, in fact, high inflation
episodes do not occur as the consequence of the mismeasurement of the natural rate of unem-
ployment only (Orphanides 2000) or as a result of policymakers’ lack of commitment to low
inflation (for example, Sargent 1999). High inflation is the consequence of the unlikely combi-
nation of two factors. As mentioned above, one of these two factors is the mismeasurement of
the natural rate, which, to some extent, is unavoidable. However, the serious underestimation
of the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve seems to be much more uncommon and
appears more related to special circumstances, such as structural breaks in the true model of
the economy.

A      Self-confirming equilibrium

Appendix A formally defines a self-confirming equilibrium and derives the self-confirming equi-
librium of the model of section 2, in the case of constant gain learning. Let ytπ , ytu , xπt , xut ,
 π         u
β̂ and β̂ be the same objects defined in section 2.3. I follow Sargent (1999) in defining a
self-confirming equilibrium in this framework:

implied by (5), (2), (3) and (9).

                                                                              π
     It is straightforward to verify that the set of beliefs ûN = u∗ , β̂ = [0; α1 ; α2 ; θ1 ; θ2 ] and
 u
β̂ = [0; ρ1 ; ρ2 ] satisfy (23) and (24) and therefore represents a self-confirming equilibrium, in
the case of σ 2τ = 0. When σ 2τ > 0, finding the self-confirming equilibrium is more involved and
requires a numerical solution of the system of equations given by (23) and (24). The procedure
                                                           π     u
works as follows: any given fixed value of ûN , β̂ and β̂ implies a linear stochastic process

for π t , ut , Vt , uN
                     t   via equations (5), (2), (3) and (9). The linear process can be rewritten as a
first order system of the form zt = C + Azt−1 + Bν t . Thus E(zt ) = (I − A)−1 C and V ar(zt )
can be found by solving the Lyapunov equation V ar(zt ) = AV ar(zt )A0 + BV ar(ν t )B 0 . The

elements of E(zt ) and V ar(zt ) can be used to compute E ut − ûN and E xit (yti − xi0t β̂ ) , for
i = {π, u}, which, in general, will not be equal to zero. A simple equation solver can be used to
                                     π        u
solve for the set of beliefs ûN , β̂ and β̂ , which satisfy (23) and (24). Of course the solution
will depend on the value of the true parameters of the model. As an illustrative example I
consider the case in which the true parameters of the model are the point estimates of the
baseline specification, presented in the first column of table 1. The self-confirming equilibrium
                                             π                                                     u
in this case corresponds to ûN = 6, β̂           = [0.0394; 0.7203; 0.2623; −0.8409; 0.7637] and β̂ =
[0; 1.5703; −0.6269]. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the expressions contained
in (23) and (24), evaluated at the self-confirming equilibrium, have negative real parts. This
guarantees the stability of the equilibrium.

σ 2ε and σ 2η , the model does not admit a self confirming equilibrium anymore. Figure 12 plots
the Euclidean distance between the true parameters ([0; α1 ; α2 ; θ1 ; θ2 ; 0; ρ1 ; ρ2 ; u∗ ]) and the set

self confirming equilibrium cannot be found. All the found self-confirming equilibria are stable.


B     State space form for model’s estimation

Appendix B gives the details of the state space form representation of the model for the esti-
mation with the Kalman filter.
    The canonical state space form is given by:

    The standard Kalman filter recursion formulas can be found in Hamilton (1994). To start the
recursion it is necessary to specify E (X0 |Ω0 ) and V ar (X0 |Ω0 ), where Ω0 represents the infor-
mation set available at time 0. Following a common practice, I set E (X0 |Ω0 ) and V ar (X0 |Ω0 )
to the unconditional values implied by the transition equation. In particular, this results in

                                                      35
E (X0 |Ω0 ) = [6; 6; 6]0 , which corresponds approximately to the estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment of Staiger, Stock, and Watson (2001) in 1960 (which is the initial date of our
sample).


C     The solution method for the forward looking model

Appendix C illustrates in more detail the method used to solve the forward looking model with
fully rational agents. As mentioned in section 5.2, the model is hard to solve because it is a
nonlinear system of rational expectation equations. The source of nonlinearity is the learning
behavior of policymakers. I will rely on numerical methods. The adopted solution method is
based on Fackler and Miranda (2001). A similar method is in Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio
(2002).
    Consider the system of rational expectation equations given by (19) and (20). To simplify
the analysis and only for the purposes of this section I will assume that uN
                                                                           t is a deterministic

function, known by the private sector, but, as usual, unknown by policymakers. I will set uN
                                                                                           t

to be equal to the smoothed estimate of uN
                                         t obtained in the estimation of the forward looking

model with partially rational agents (section 5.1). Thus, let ũt ≡ ut − uN
                                                                          t . Equations (19) and

(20), the only ones involving expectations, can be rearranged and rewritten in the following
compact form:
                                   yt = AEt−1 yt+1 + BXt−1 + vt ,                                 (28)

where yt ≡ [π t , ũt ]0 is the vector of observed endogenous variables; Xt−1 ≡ [π t−1 , ũt−1 , Vt−1 ]
is the vector of observed predetermined variables; vt ≡ [εt , η t ]0 is the vector of unobservable
shocks; A and B are matrices of coeﬃcients, omitted for brevity. (28) is linear, but the complete
system, given by (28), (9), (10), (11), (12) and (13) is nonlinear. The solution of the model
is the unknown response function Et−1 yt+1 = Ψ(Ωt−1 ), where Ωt represents the information
available at time t and Ψ(·) satisfies

                               Ψ(Ωt−1 ) = AEt−1 Ψ(Ωt ) + BEt−1 Xt .

When the model is nonlinear in general there is not a closed form expression for Ψ(·) and it must
be approximated numerically by projection methods. The basic idea of Fackler and Miranda
(2001) is approximating Ψ(Ωt ) with a linear combination of basis functions of the state variables.
This is given by Φst , where st is an m × 1 vector of basis functions and Φ is a 2 × m matrix of
coeﬃcients. In the numerical procedure, also the expectation operator must be approximated


                                                  36
using quadrature methods. Therefore, the expectation of a generic function f (·) of the model’s
source of randomness, vt , is approximated by a discrete version of the integral, given by
                                                                  k
                                                                  X      ³ ´
                                                 Ef (vt ) ≈         ω j f vtj .
                                                                  j=1


For a given value of the innovations vtj ,

                                              ytj = AΦst−1 + BXt−1 + vtj

and
                                              j
                                             yt+1 = AΦsjt + BXt + vt+1 ,

where the superscript j for s indicates that the value of s at time t depends on the realization of
                                                                          Pk    ³              ´
the shocks at time t. Now we can compute Et−1 yt+1 = Et−1 Et yt+1 ≈          ω j AΦsjt + BXt ≡
                                                                                                             j=1
zt−1 . Let S ≡ [s1,t−1 , ..., sn,t−1 ] be a collection of n ≥ m values of st−1 and Z ≡ [z1,t−1 , ..., zn,t−1 ]
the collection of the corresponding n values of zt−1 . The solution consists in the Φ∗ which solves
Φ∗ S = Z, or Φ∗ SS 0 = ZS 0 in the case in which n > m. It can be done using standard equation
solvers.
    In this application, to approximate the integrals and expectation operators, I use a Gauss-
Hermite quadrature with 3 nodes (see Judd 1998). As mentioned above, the dimension of the
state vector is high. Thus, the use of tensor product bases or complete polynomial bases is
unfeasible for any polynomial degree bigger or equal to 2. For this reason I chose the following
ad hoc collection of 21 basis functions of the states, which turned out to work well:
                      h
             st =      1; π t ; ũt ; π t−1 ; ũt−1 ; Vt ; ĉπ,t ; α̂1,t ; α̂2,t ; θ̂1,t ; θ̂2,t ; ĉu,t ; ρ̂1,t ; ρ̂2,t ; ûN
                                                                                                                             t ;
                                                                   ¡           ¢           ¡                       ¢i
                      π 2t ; ũ2t ; α̂1,t π t ; α̂2,t π t−1 ; θ̂1,t ut − ûN t ; θ̂ 1,t ut−1 − ût−1
                                                                                                             N
                                                                                                                       .

Notice that the choice of st includes all linear terms in the state variables of the problem and
some potentially relevant second order terms. The dimension of st is so large that the choice of
S based on standard grid methods is unfeasible, even specifying only two values for any state
variable. To solve this problem I chose a collection of n = 86 st ’s, corresponding to the actual
values of st observed in the data, every 2 quarters, from 1959:IV to 2002:IV. The results are
only marginally aﬀected by a diﬀerent choice of values for S, like for example the observed data,
every 2 quarters, 1960:I to 2002:III.

D     The MCMC algorithm for the stochastic volatility model

Appendix D illustrates the details of the MCMC algorithm used in section 6 for the estimation
of the model with stochastic volatility. The parameters of interest are the coeﬃcients Ψ1 ≡
                                            h               i                                © ªT
[α1 ; θ1 ; θ2 ; ρ1 ; ρ2 ], Ψ2 ≡ [k; φ], Ψ3 ≡ σ 2ν ε ; σ 2ν η and the unobservable states uN ≡ uN
                                                                                               t t=1 ,

σ ε ≡ {σ ε,t }Tt=1 and σ η ≡ {σ η,t }Tt=1 . The estimation consists of the simulation of the posterior of
the parameters of interest, conditional on the observed data. MCMC allows to simulate lower
dimensional conditional posteriors instead of the high dimensional unconditional one.
    Notice that the model can be rewritten like in (25), (26) and (27), with the diﬀerence that
now the elements of R are time varying and follow the processes (21) and (22). The algorithm
works in 5 steps.


D.1    Step 1: drawing uN

Conditional on σ ε , σ η , Ψ1 and Ψ2 , the observation equation (25) is linear and has Gaussian
innovations with known variance. Therefore, the vector uN can be drawn using standard simu-
lation smoothers, like, for instance, Carter and Kohn (1994). Details of this procedure can be
also found in Kim and Nelson (1999b).


D.2    Step 2: drawing σ ε and σ η

Consider now the system of equations

                                    yt − AZt − BXt = yt∗ = Rt et                                    (29)

where, taking uN , Ψ1 and Ψ2 as given, yt∗ is observable. This is a system of nonlinear measure-
ment equations, but can be easily converted in a linear one, by squaring and taking logarithms
of every element of (29), which leads to the following approximating state space form:

                                         yt∗∗ = 2ht + e∗∗
                                                       t                                            (30)

                                           ht = ht−1 + ω t .                                        (31)

 ∗∗ = log[(y ∗ )2 + c̄]; c̄ is an oﬀset constant (set to 0.001); e∗∗ = log(e2 ); h = log(diag(R )).
yit         it                                                    it        it    t            t

Observe that the e∗∗ ’s and the ω’s are not correlated. The system in this form has a linear,
but non-Gaussian state space form, because the innovations in the measurement equations are
distributed as a log χ2 (1). In order to further transform the system in a Gaussian one, a mixture
of normals approximation of the log χ2 distribution is used, as described in Kim, Shephard,


                                                   38
and Chib (1998). Observe that the variance covariance matrix of the e’s is the identity matrix.
This implies that the variance covariance matrix of the e∗∗ ’s is also diagonal, allowing to use the
same (independent) mixture of normals approximation for any element of e∗∗ . Kim, Shephard
and Chib (1998) select a mixture of 7 normal densities with component probabilities qi , means
mi , and variances vi2 , i = 1, ..., 7. The constants {qi , mi , vi2 } are chosen to match a number
of moments of the log χ2 (1) distribution. The constants {qi , mi , vi2 } can be found in Kim,
Shephard, and Chib (1998).
    For the innovation to the variable yjt , define as sTj = [sj1 , ..., sjT ]0 the vector of indicator
variables selecting at every point in time which member of the mixture of normal approximation
has to be used. Conditional on uN , Ψ and sT (which denotes the collection of sTj ), the system
has an approximate linear and Gaussian state space form. Again, exactly like in the previous
step of the sampler, this procedure allows to draw every ht using a simulation smoother.
    Conditional on the data and the new series of ht ’s, it is possible to sample the new sTj vectors,
to be used in the next iteration. This is easily done (separately for every j) by sampling from
the discrete densities defined by

                                ∗∗
                  Pr(sjt = i | yjt , hjt ) ∝ qi fN (yjt
                                                     ∗∗
                                                        | 2hjt + mi , vi2 ),   i = 1, ..., 7.

Further details can be found in Kim, Shephard, and Chib (1998) or Primiceri (2005).


D.3     Step 3: drawing Ψ1

Conditional on Ψ2 , σ ε , σ η and uN , the objects Zt , Xt and Rt are observable. Therefore, the
elements of Ψ1 (which correspond to the elements of A and B) can be easily drawn from the
posterior of the coeﬃcients of a regression with known variance. This posterior is normally
distributed with mean equal to the OLS coeﬃcients and variance equal to the variance of the
OLS coeﬃcients.


D.4     Step 4: drawing Ψ2

Ψ2 enters the model non-linearly. Therefore, in order to draw from the conditional posterior
of Ψ2 , I use a Metropolis step, nested in the Gibbs sampler. The procedure works as follows:
                                                            ¡         ¢
I draw a candidate value Ψ∗2 from a proposal distribution ϕ Ψ∗2 |Ψi−1
                                                                  2     , where Ψi−1
                                                                                 2   is the pre-
vious draw of the chain. At this point I compute the value of the posterior associated to the
        ³                                   ´
draw, p Ψ∗2 |Ψ1 , σ ε , σ η , uN , {yt }Tt=1 , which, under flat prior, is proportional to the value of the



                                                      39
likelihood. The new draw is accepted with probability
                                     (                       )
                                          p (Ψ∗2 ) /ϕ (Ψ∗2 )
                             a = min     ¡      ¢ ¡ i−1 ¢ , 1 .
                                       p Ψi−12     /ϕ Ψ2

If the proposal value is rejected, the next element of the chain is set to be Ψi−1
                                                                               2 . In order to
satisfy the constraints φ ≥ 0 and m, 0 ≤ k ≤ 1, I chose the proposal distribution to be normal
                             h           ³    ´i
                                           b
in f (Ψ∗2 ), where f (a, b) = log(a), log 1−b   . The mean is chosen to be f (Ψi−1
                                                                               2 ), while I fix
the variance to a diagonal matrix with elements 0.001 and 0.005 on the main diagonal.


D.5     Step 5: drawing Ψ3

Conditional on σ ε , σ η , each element of Ψ3 has an inverse-Gamma posterior distribution, indepen-
dent of the other element. Conditional on σ ε , σ η , it is easy to draw from these inverse-Gamma
posteriors because the innovations are observable.22
