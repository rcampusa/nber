                                               ABSTRACT

This paper considers asset pricing in a general equilibrium model in which some, but not all, agents
suffer from inflation illusion. Illusionary investors mistake changes in nominal interest rates for changes
in real rates, while smart investors understand the Fisher equation. The presence of smart investors
ensures that the equilibrium nominal interest rate moves with expected inflation. The model also predicts
a nonmonotonic relationship between the price-to-rent ratio on housing and nominal interest rates
-- housing booms occur both when the nominal rate is especially low and when it is especially high.
In either situation, disagreement about real interest rates between smart and illusionary investors stimulates
borrowing and lending and drives up the price of collateral. The resulting housing boom is stronger
if credit markets are more developed. We document that many countries experienced a housing boom
in the high-inflation 1970s and a second, stronger, boom in the low-inflation 2000s.

I        Introduction

Modigliani and Cohn (1979) argue that investors who suﬀer from inﬂation illusion price assets as

if real payoﬀs are discounted at the nominal interest rate. They use this idea to rationalize the

stock market slump of the 1970s, which coincided with high inﬂation and high nominal interest

rates. More recently, inﬂation illusion has again become a prominent theme in the ﬁnancial

press, because the 2000s housing boom coincides with low inﬂation and low nominal interest

rates.1 However, an early critique of the inﬂation illusion hypothesis (Summers 1983) points

out that the 1970s saw a housing boom coincide with high nominal interest rates. International

evidence presented below points to a more general stylized fact: in many countries, house price

booms occurred in the high-inﬂation 1970s and further–typically stronger–booms occurred in

the more recent low-inﬂation environment.

        In this paper, we consider the eﬀect of inﬂation illusion on asset prices in a general equilibrium

model with heterogeneous agents. The key assumptions are that (i) agents who suﬀer from

inﬂation illusion interact with “smart” agents in markets for nominal credit instruments and

(ii) borrowing must be backed by real estate. We show under these assumptions that nominal

interest rates move with smart agents’ inﬂation expectations, and housing booms occur whenever

these expectations are either especially high or low. Moreover, the housing boom is stronger

when credit markets are more developed, which suggests that recent ﬁnancial development may

have increased the potential for inﬂation illusion to drive house prices.

        We are led to consider investor heterogeneity because we want our model to account for

movements in nominal interest rates. In the data, nominal rates comove with measures of

expected inﬂation, which suggests that at least some investors are aware of the distinction

between real and nominal rates. For example, even if stock prices were low in the high inﬂation

1970s because illusionary investors were discounting at high nominal rates, someone must have

also priced high inﬂation expectations into nominal rates. In our model, there are smart investors

who understand the Fisher equation: bond returns are given by the nominal interest rate minus
    1
     For example, see Pam Woodall’s survey on world property markets in the Economist on March 29, 2003. The
article “Castles in Hot Air” in this report and an earlier article, “Going through the Roof” in the Economist on
March 28, 2002, argue that inﬂation illusion fuels the recent house price boom.

expected inﬂation. At the same time, there are illusion investors who believe that all changes in

nominal rates reﬂect changes in real interest rates. The equilibrium nominal interest rate then

moves–typically less than one for one–with changes in smart investors’ inﬂation expectations.

   The key eﬀect in the model is that illusionary and smart investors disagree about real interest

rates when smart investors’ inﬂation expectations are either especially high or low. In either

case, disagreement generates increased borrowing and lending among households as well as a

house price boom. To see how disagreement about real rates obtains, assume ﬁrst that smart

investors’ inﬂation expectations rise above the historical mean and thus drive up nominal interest

rates. Illusionary investors attribute any increase in nominal rates to an increase in real rates.

As a result, they end up perceiving higher real rates than smart investors. In contrast, if smart

investors have unusually low inﬂation expectations and drive down nominal rates, illusionary

investors perceive lower real rates than smart investors.

   Disagreement about real interest rates generates house price booms if borrowing must be

backed by real estate. Indeed, increased credit market activity raises the demand for collateral,

which in turn drives up house prices. More speciﬁcally, our model generates two scenarios for


                                                3
a housing boom, illustrated in Figure 1. The scenarios diﬀer in which group of households

perceives lower real rates and thus drives up house prices. In a low inﬂation environment, such

as the 2000s, the increased demand for housing and mortgages is due to illusionary agents, who

mistake low nominal rates for low real rates, while smart investors are happy to invest in bonds.

In times of high expected inﬂation, such as the 1970s, the roles of the two groups are reversed:

smart investors borrow and shift their portfolio toward real estate, while illusion agents are

deterred from mortgages, and housing, by high nominal rates.

   The mechanism we emphasize works only if housing serves as collateral. If borrowing was

not possible, disagreement about real interest rates would lead some agents to rebalance their

portfolios from housing toward bonds and other agents to shift funds in the opposite direction.

It is then not obvious why house prices should increase; indeed, in our model, they remain

unchanged. However, if agents who perceive low real rates can build leveraged portfolios, thus

investing more than their own wealth in housing, disagreement raises the demand for housing

suﬃciently to generate a boom. Moreover, the eﬀect is stronger the more borrowers can leverage

their portfolios: in the model, the equilibrium house price is increasing in the maximal loan-to-

value ratio. More generally, broader access to credit and lower transaction costs in the credit

market can be expected to work in the same direction.

   While our model is motivated by disagreement about real interest rates that emerges because

some investors suﬀer from inﬂation illusion, our formal analysis only assumes that investors

disagree about the real payoﬀ on nominal bonds. The theoretical eﬀect we highlight is thus

more general and could apply in situations where disagreement derives from other sources of

heterogeneity. One example is diﬀerences in tax rates: investors in high tax brackets perceive

a lower real return on bonds–and, if interest is tax deductible, a lower cost of borrowing–than

investors in lower brackets. Another source of disagreement about real rates is diﬀerences in

inﬂation expectations. This is considered in Piazzesi and Schneider (2006), where we use inﬂation

surveys to document diﬀerences in expected inﬂation rates across age cohorts in the 1970s and

quantify the eﬀect of such diﬀerences for house and stock price movements at that time.




                                               4
       We have described illusionary investors as investors who mistake changes in nominal inter-

est rates for changes in real rates. This mistake does not require investors to be unaware of

inﬂation or to be wrong about the inﬂation rate. All that matters is that investors confuse real

and nominal returns when making portfolio choice decisions. For example, consider an illusion-

ary investor who compares the utility he obtains from buying a home to the nominal cost of

borrowing. This investor agrees with his smart neighbor about expected inﬂation. However,

the diﬀerence between the two neighbors is that the smart neighbor actually uses the expected

inﬂation rate to compute the real cost of his mortgage. Indeed, disagreement about real interest

rates does not require disagreement about inﬂation–diﬀerences in agents’ understanding of the

impact of inﬂation on returns is enough.2

       Recently, there has been renewed interest in the empirical implications of inﬂation illusion

in equity and real estate markets. Campbell and Vuolteenaho (2004) decompose the dividend

yield on stocks into three components: expected dividend growth, a subjective risk premium

(identiﬁed from a cross-sectional regression), and a “mispricing term.”They show that positive

correlation of dividend yields with inﬂation is mostly due to the mispricing term. This indicates

that stocks are undervalued by conventional measures when inﬂation is high.3 Brunnermeier

and Julliard (2006) examine the relationship between house prices and inﬂation. They derive a

decomposition for the price-rent ratio, that is, the price-dividend ratio on housing. Using data

from the U.K. housing market, they construct a mispricing component of the price-rent ratio

that is negatively related to inﬂation. By their measure, houses thus appear overvalued when

inﬂation is low.

       There are few formal models of inﬂation illusion. The so-called Fed model, widely used by

practitioners, is sometimes used to motivate a monotonic relationship between asset prices and

inﬂation. According to the Fed model, inﬂation illusion leads investors to apply a modiﬁed
   2
      This observation implies that we cannot derive evidence about illusion or the fraction of illusionary agents
in the population from inﬂation surveys. In particular, many investors may suﬀer from inﬂation illusion today,
even though the Michigan inﬂation survey does not indicate much inﬂation disagreement during the 2000s. It
is an open and interesting question how we can design surveys (e.g., about mortgage planning) that are able to
distinguish between illusion and disagreement.
    3
      Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2005) study the cross section of stock returns and show that CAPM betas
decrease with the inﬂation rate. This ﬁnding is also consistent with inﬂation illusion; when inﬂation is high, the
compensation for each unit of market beta is lower than what the overall diﬀerence in stock returns and riskless
securities would suggest.

Gordon growth formula to determine the price-dividend ratio on long-lived assets: instead of

using the real interest rate to discount future (real) cash ﬂows as in the usual formula, investors

discount at the nominal rate. The modiﬁed formula is useful for thinking about stocks that

appear undervalued in the 1970s and overvalued in the 1990s.4 Its application to the housing

market, however, runs into Summers’ critique–house prices should be low together with stock

prices in the 1970s.

       The Fed model does not deliver a complete account of asset prices under inﬂation illusion

because it takes the nominal interest rate as exogenous. It therefore sidesteps the question

why nominal rates comove with expected inﬂation. In contrast, our general equilibrium model

of inﬂation illusion determines the nominal rate endogenously and links it to smart investors’

inﬂation expectations. In addition, our model is not subject to the Summers critique. Indeed,

inﬂation illusion matters in our model when inﬂation is far from its historical mean in either

direction, and it induces a nonmonotonic relationship between mispricing in the housing market

and inﬂation. The inﬂation illusion hypothesis is thus consistent with housing booms not only

in the low-interest 2000s but also in the high-interest 1970s.

       Basak and Yan (2005) also consider a general equilibrium model in which preferences of

illusion investors are deﬁned over nominal consumption. With power utility, investors who expect

high inﬂation thus eﬀectively discount the future at a lower (higher) rate if the intertemporal

elasticity of substitution is larger (smaller) than one and interest rates reﬂect these preferences.

Our approach diﬀers in its emphasis on heterogeneity and housing as collateral (as in Kiyotaki

and Moore 1997). Moreover, the preferences of illusion investors in our model do not depend on

expected inﬂation.

       The purpose of this paper is to isolate the eﬀects of inﬂation illusion on house prices and

interest rates in general equilibrium; we thus abstract from many other factors that matter for

asset prices. In particular, we do not consider other possible links between inﬂation and house

price booms. Feldstein (1980) has shown that the tax treatment of houses and mortgages makes

housing a more attractive asset when expected inﬂation is high. On the one hand, inﬂation
   4
    Ritter and Warr (2002), Sharpe (2002), and Asness (2003) document that dividend yields on stocks are indeed
highly correlated with nominal interest rates.




                                                      6
increases taxable nominal capital gains, which are more easily sheltered from tax for housing

than for, say, equity. On the other hand, the inﬂation increases tax-deductible nominal mortgage

interest and thus lowers the eﬀective cost of borrowing.5

       The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents cross-country evidence on price-rent

ratios, using various house-price measures. Section III presents our heterogeneous agent model

with inﬂation illusion. Section IV describes equilibrium housing booms in high and low inﬂation

environments. Section V explains how these equilibria capture the historical experience of the

1970s and 2000s. Section VI concludes and discusses future research. Proofs are collected in the

appendix.



II       Cross-Country Evidence

We construct an annual cross-country dataset for the period 1970 - 2004. This sample period

is dictated by the availability of house price data. The dataset covers 12 countries: Australia,

Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom,

and United States.

Price-Dividend Ratios for Stocks

       To measure the price-dividend ratio for stocks, we rely on Morgan-Stanley Country In-

dices available from the website www.msci.com. For each country, we obtain two annual se-

ries, labeled “price index” (PI) and “gross index” (GI), and compute the dividend yield as

(GIt/Gt−1 ) / (P It /P It−1 ) − 1. This procedure recovers a price-dividend ratio with interpretable

units. For example, the average pd-ratios in the United States and the United Kingdom were

35.9 and 26, respectively, over the 1970 - 2004 period.




   5
     There is an interesting connection between this second eﬀect and our analysis. When smart investors are in
diﬀerent tax brackets, an increase in expected inﬂation will make the eﬀective costs of borrowing computed by
Feldstein more diﬀerent across households. Agents thus disagree more about (after-tax) real rates when inﬂation
is high. Through the mechanism described above, this should generate further upward pressure on house prices:
agents in high tax brackets would ﬁnd it cheaper to take out a mortgage and drive up house prices, while agents
in low tax brackets would be happy to lend.


                                                      7
Price-Rent Ratios for Houses

    The measurement of price-dividend ratios for housing, or price-rent ratios, is more diﬃcult,

because houses do not trade on exchanges like stocks. We have two options–data from national

accounts or data on price indices constructed by the national central banks available through the

Bank of International Settlements (BIS). For the national accounts, we follow the methodology

in Piazzesi, Schneider, and Tuzel (Forthcoming). We measure the numerator as the value of the

aggregate residential housing stock and the denominator as aggregate expenditures on housing

services, including owner-estimated rents. We have data from national accounts for the United

States and the United Kingdom. Based on price indices constructed by the national central

banks, we measure the national residential price index divided by the consumer price index for

each country. These data are available from the BIS. To measure real rents, we use the rent

component of each country’s consumer price index available from Datastream and divide by the

consumer price index.6

    National account data have several advantages. First, the resulting price-rent ratios have

meaningful units, because the numerator and denominator are measured in dollars. For example,

the average price-rent ratios in the United States and the United Kingdom over the 1970-2004

period were 17.6 and 26.5, respectively. In contrast, the units of pd-ratios based on house price

and rent indices are not meaningful; the ratios are normalized to 1 in some base year (which is

1985 in Figure 2.) The ratios are only useful for looking at percentage changes over time.

    Second, the price-rent ratios from national accounts do not involve any quality judgements.

Again, the reason is that they are measured in dollars. In contrast, an index construction tracks

the evolution of the purchase or rental value of an appropriately deﬁned “unit of housing.” The

deﬁnition of “one unit” of housing does not only involve the square footage of living space but also

quality changes of that space over time. The quality judgements are especially problematic for

price-rent ratios, because the numerator and denominator are constructed by diﬀerent agencies

which may use diﬀerent deﬁnitions.
   6
     There are two missing observations in the BIS dataset. First, we interpolate the 2004 observation for Ireland
using data from the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin published by the Irish Department of the Environment,
Heritage, and Local Government. Second, we interpolate the 1970 observation for Spain assuming that real house
price growth is equal to real rent growth for that year.




                                                        8
   We can correct for quality changes at low frequencies by taking out linear time trends from

real rents in the denominator. We will plot the resulting corrected ratios as dotted lines in

our ﬁgures. Examples of such low-frequency changes in quality are modern amenities–such as

air conditioning, central heating, and electricity–which were absent from homes a century ago.

Today’s homes also beneﬁt from infrastructure in cities–such as roads, sidewalks, and public

transportation–which has improved slowly over time. However, correcting linear time trends

do not take into account high-frequency changes in quality such as quality variations of homes

traded over the business cycle or shifting neighborhood eﬀects.

   Finally, price-rent ratios from national accounts are available for a long time period, while

most house price indices start in the 1970s. In this paper, we do not exploit this advantage of

the national accounts data, because we focus on stock and house price movements around the

high-inﬂation episode in the 1970s and the recent low-inﬂation episode.

Inflation and Real Interest Rates

   For each country, we obtain annual consumer-price inﬂation and the three-month nominal

interest rate on government bonds from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics database.

We construct the ex post real rate as the diﬀerence between the nominal rate and the inﬂation

rate.

Cross-Country Empirical Facts

   Figures 2 and 3 show the price-dividend ratios of houses and stocks together with inﬂation

and the real rate for each country. The pd-ratios of houses in Figure 2 are measured with BIS

data, while those in Figure 3 are from national accounts. We focus on two episodes. During the

inﬂation episode of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pd-ratio of housing was relatively high,

while the pd-ratio of stocks was relatively low. During the disinﬂation episode of the 2000s, the

same situation emerges. Moreover, ex post real rates were low, or even negative, during both

episodes.

III      The Model

Our model describes heterogeneous households, some of whom may suﬀer from inﬂation illusion.

Households trade real estate and nominal assets (“bonds”) with each other as well as a “rest

of the economy” sector. Real estate is an asset that cannot be sold short but that can be used

as collateral. Bonds are special because they promise nominal payoﬀs and because they can be

held in negative quantities.

Setup

    There are two dates, 0 and 1, and one consumption good. There is a unit mass of risk-neutral

households who discount date 1 consumption by the factor β. Households can invest in nominal

bonds and real estate. A unit of real estate (or “houses”) trades at the price p at date 0 and

is expected to pay oﬀ p at date 1. This payoﬀ equals the resale price of the house plus any

dividend from housing (which may include utility from ownership etc.) Real estate cannot be

sold short. Households can buy or sell one-period nominal bonds. If they choose to borrow by

issuing bonds, they must respect a collateral constraint: the value of the bonds issued must be

less than φ times the value of their house. The parameter φ is the maximal loan-to-value (LTV)

ratio.

    Nominal bonds trade at a price 1/R at date 0, where R is the (gross) nominal interest rate

from date 0 to date 1. Households expect the nominal bond to pay oﬀ x goods at date 1.

The expected payoﬀ x is subjective and may be diﬀerent for smart investors and illusionary

households. For smart households who understand the Fisher equation and expect inﬂation π,

the expected payoﬀ of a nominal bond is x = 1/π.7 Households who suﬀer from inﬂation illusion

do not necessarily associate x with their expected inﬂation rate.

    Every household enters the period with an endowment of goods y, an endowment of houses

h̄0 , and an amount of goods b̄0 from past bond market activity. For given market prices p and

1/R, as well as expected payoﬀs p and x, a household chooses consumption c and c , the quantity
   7
     To see why, consider a nominal bond that costs 1/R dollars today and pays $1 tomorrow, or 1/q units of
consumption, where q is the price of consumption tomorrow. Now consider a portfolio of q nominal bonds. The
price of the portfolio is 1/R units of numeraire and its payoﬀ is q/q = 1/π units of consumption tomorrow. The
model thus determines the price 1/R of a nominal bond in $.



                                                      10
of houses h, and the amount of goods invested in bonds b to solve


(1)                                        max c + βc

                                c + b + ph = w (p) := b0 + ph0 + y

                                        c = (Rx)b + p h,

                                           c, c, h ≥ 0,

                                            −b ≤ φph.



      This simple setup does not make explicit the utility agents obtain from housing. One way

to interpret it is that housing services and other consumption are perfect substitutes, that the

dividend from houses owned prior to trading at date 0 is contained in y, and that the date 1

dividend per unit of house is contained in p . Our analysis holds ﬁxed the dividend from housing,

so that changes in the house price p represent changes in the price-rent ratio. We normalize the

aggregate quantity of houses to 1. The initial endowment of housing units h̄0 thus represents

the share of the total housing stock that is not acquired by households at date 0. We assume

that households must own all houses after trading at date 0. In particular, the household sector

cannot, on aggregate, sell houses to the rest of the economy. We thus assume h0 < 1.

      The “rest of the economy” (ROE) sector consolidates the government, foreign, and business

sectors. It may also contain “old” households who do not plan for the future, because date 0 is

the last period of their life. The ROE sells 1 − h̄0 > 0 units of real estate in the housing market

and b̄ ≥ 0 worth of bonds in the credit market. It also redeems all bonds that households enter

date 0 with (worth b̄0 ). It consumes the proceeds from these trades:

                                                   
                                   C ROE = p 1 − h̄0 + b̄ − b0 .

                                       
The value of new housing units p 1 − h̄0 corresponds to gross residential investment plus the

value of houses sold by “old” households to households planning for the future at date 0. This

interpretation justiﬁes our assumption that h̄0 < 1.

      The bond endowment b̄0 consists of all payments households receive from past credit market


                                                11
activity, including interest on bonds held in the previous period. Household income y comprises

labor income and dividends on real estate the household owns before trading at date 0. We

assume throughout that the sum of this initial non-housing wealth is large enough that the

household sector can aﬀord to buy all bonds supplied by the rest of the economy:


(2)                                            b̄ < b̄0 + y.


We view this assumption as mild since changes in aggregate household sector asset positions

tend to be small relative to aggregate income, as documented in Piazzesi and Schneider (2006).

      We assume that expectations about payoﬀs on bonds and houses at date 1 are given exoge-

nously. Households agree on the expected payoﬀ from houses p . However, the perceived payoﬀ x

of a nominal bond depends on households’ understanding of real interest rates. To accommodate

these diﬀerences in perceived bond payoﬀs, we work with a ﬁnite number of household types,
                                                     
indexed by i. There are αi households of type i, with i αi = 1. The market prices of bonds

and houses at date 0 are determined endogenously: 1/R and p, respectively. When choosing

portfolios, households thus agree on the expected real housing return p /p, but they disagree on

the expected real bond return Rxi , the ex ante real rate.

      We consider temporary equilibria in which date 0 prices are endogenous but expectations

about future payoﬀs are exogenously given (as in Grandmont 1977). A temporary equilibrium

consists of a house price p and an interest rate R together with date 0 consumption and asset

choices for the various types ci , bi, hi such that (i) households optimize given their (subjective)
                        
expected payoﬀs p , xi and (ii) markets for goods and assets clear at date 0:

                                                     
                                              1=             αi hi ,

ations of household consumption from household income.

Modeling Inflation Illusion

      Diﬀerences in the subjective bond payoﬀs xi capture how illusionary and smart investors

diﬀer in their perceptions of real rates. We always assume that smart agents expect nominal

bonds to pay oﬀ x = 1/π. In other words, smart agents understand the Fisher equation which

says that the (ex ante) real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate–quoted in the market–

minus the expected inﬂation rate:


(3)                                  real rate = log R − log π.



      In contrast, agents who suﬀer from inﬂation illusion believe that the payoﬀ of nominal bonds

x is constant. As a result, they view real interest rates as equal to nominal interest rates up to

a constant:


(4)                                real rate = log R − constant.


In particular, they interpret positive deviations of the nominal interest rates from its long-run

average as an instance of high real rates, and they interpret unusually low nominal rates as

unusually low real rates.

      To generate time series predictions, we perform comparative statics exercises with respect

to the distribution of nominal bond payoﬀs xi . In particular, we compute equilibria for three

versions of the model. Our benchmark exercise assumes that all agents agree on the same,

moderate, expected bond payoﬀ. Intuitively, it captures a time period where expected inﬂation

and the nominal rate are at their long-run averages. While agents in the model act as if they

agree, they do think about interest rates in very diﬀerent terms. Smart agents observe the

nominal rate and believe that it reﬂects moderate inﬂation because of the Fisher equation (3).

In contrast, illusion investors believe that it reﬂects a normal level of the real rate because of

equation (4).

      While this diﬀerence in thinking about interest rates does not matter in normal times, it

matters when expected inﬂation and nominal rates deviate from their long-run average. We


                                                 13
consider two scenarios, where expected bond payoﬀs diﬀer across agents. Under the 1970s

scenario, smart investors expect high inﬂation and thus believe that bond payoﬀs are lower than

average. However, illusion investors continue to believe that real interest rates are equal to

nominal rates up to a constant. Formally, illusion investors thus behave as if bond payoﬀs are

unchanged from the benchmark. Under the 2000s scenarios, smart investors expect low inﬂation

and thus believe that bond payoﬀs are higher than average. As before, illusion investors act as if

bond payoﬀs have not moved. In both cases, what matters in terms of the model is disagreement

about ex ante real rates. It is thus helpful to ﬁrst analyze a generic case, where some agents

expect high bond payoﬀs and others expect low bond payoﬀs. This is what we do below. We

then use the formal results to discuss the 1970s and 2000s scenarios.



IV     Equilibrium House Prices and Interest Rates

In this section, we characterize equilibrium prices, ﬁrst for a benchmark case with identical

subjective real rates, and then for the case of heterogeneous subjective real rates. The latter

case is used below to argue that inﬂation illusion induces house price booms when smart investors

have subjective real rates that are either very high or very low.

Solution to the Household Problem

   The collateral constraint implies that households cannot borrow against future income. In-

stead, borrowing is useful only to set up leveraged portfolio strategies that increase the return

on wealth. To solve problem (1), a household must therefore ﬁrst determine the best portfolio

strategy. If the return on the optimal portfolio is higher than the discount rate β −1 , then it is

optimal to invest all date 0 wealth w. If the best portfolio return is lower than the discount

rate, it is instead optimal to save nothing and simply consume w at date 0.

   Two polar portfolio strategies are available. If the subjective expected return on bonds, Rxi ,

is higher than the return on housing, p /p, then the optimal portfolio is 100% invested in bonds.

If the expected bond return, or equivalently, the expected cost of borrowing, is lower than the

housing return, the best portfolio strategy is to borrow up to the collateral constraint, and invest



                                                14
in housing. For every unit invested in housing, only 1 − φ units must come out of initial wealth,

because φ units can be borrowed. Therefore, the expected return on wealth invested in the

leveraged portfolio–equivalently, the expected return on housing equity–is

                                                          
                                        1        p      i
                                                    − φRx .
                                       1−φ       p


      Below, we focus on equilibria in which the return on housing is less than or equal to the

discount rate: p /p ≤ β −1 . For this case, the optimal consumption-savings and portfolio decisions

can be summarized as follows, using two cutoﬀ points for the real rate Rxi . If Rxi > β −1 , the

household invests all wealth in bonds; he consumes nothing at date 0 and buys no houses. If
                             
Rxi < φ−1 p /p − (1 − φ) β −1 , the household borrows up to the collateral constraint, invests

his own wealth plus all borrowed funds in housing, and again consumes nothing. Finally, if

Rxi is in between the two cutoﬀs (this is possible whenever p /p < β −1 ), then the household

consumes all wealth at date 0 and does not invest. Finally, at the cutoﬀ points themselves, the

household is indiﬀerent between neighboring strategies.


Identical Subjective Real Rates

      As a benchmark, we consider an equilibrium in which all households agree on the same ex

ante real rate Rx∗ . In this case, the expected bond payoﬀ x∗ = 1/π ∗ is determined by the

inﬂation expectations of smart agents π ∗ . Since both houses and bonds are in positive net

supply, the expected returns on the two assets must be equal and also greater than or equal to

the discount rate. We consider an equilibrium in which there is some consumption at date t.

To make households indiﬀerent between consumption and saving, both returns must equal the

discount rate:

                                                        p
(5)                                      Rx∗ = β −1 =      .
                                                        p

Here the ﬁrst equality is again the Fisher equation: the nominal interest rate equals the ex ante

real rate–here the discount rate–multiplied by the expected rate of inﬂation π ∗ . The second

equality says that the house price is the present discounted value of future payoﬀs, discounted


                                                 15
at the real interest rate. In the benchmark equilibrium, the house price is independent of

expected inﬂation.

      We assume that initial endowments and asset supplies are such that markets can clear at

these prices. In particular, the supply of assets, with houses evaluated at the prices p = βp

implied by (5), must be smaller than the initial wealth of the household sector:


(6)                                  b̄ + βp < b̄0 + βp h̄0 + y.


Similarly to (2), this assumption is also satisﬁed if changes in aggregate household asset positions

are small relative to income.


Heterogeneous Subjective Real Rates

      We assume that a fraction α of households expects nominal bonds to have low payoﬀs x,

while a fraction 1 − α of households expects high payoﬀs x̄ > x. We refer to these two groups

as “low interest” and “high interest” households, respectively. To again ensure the existence of

equilibria in which some consumption takes place at date 0, we modify condition (6) to

                                              x             x
(7)                                b̄ + βp      < b̄0 + βp h̄0 + y.
                                              x̄            x̄

If some new housing units are bought by households planning for the future at date 0 (h̄0 < 1),

this condition is stronger than (6). In the equilibria below, βp x̄x is an upper bound for the

house price. The condition is thus still satisﬁed provided changes in asset positions–including

investment on housing–are small relative to income.

      Proposition 1 characterizes equilibrium prices as a function of the share α of low-interest

households. We know from the benchmark equilibrium that when households agree on their

subjective real rates (that is, α = 0 or α = 1), the Fisher equation holds and the house price is

at its benchmark level p = βp . When households disagree, the nominal rate reﬂects a weighted

average of their payoﬀ expectations. Moreover, suﬃcient disagreement in the population gen-

erates a house price boom (p > βp ). The proposition formally states this result for the case

where the maximal loan-to-value ratio φ is suﬃciently large relative to the supply of bonds from

                                                    16
the rest of the economy b̄. For low φ or high b̄, the same type of equilibrium continues to exist,

but it need not be unique. We relegate the analysis of the latter case to the appendix.

Proposition 1 (Prices and the distribution of views on ex ante real rates)
                  
   Suppose φ b0 + y > h̄0 b̄. There is a unique equilibrium in which


(a) the nominal interest rate is continuous and nondecreasing in the fraction α of low-interest

      agents; there exist cutoﬀs ᾱR and αR such that 1 > ᾱR ≥ αR > 0 and


                                R = β −1 /x                   if α ≥ ᾱR ,

                                R = β −1 /x̄                  if α ≤ αR ,

                                R ∈ [β −1 /x̄, β −1 /x]       otherwise.



(b) the house price is hump-shaped in α; there exists αp ∈ (0, αR ) such that


                           p = βp                            if α ∈
                                                                   / (αp , ᾱR ],

                           p > βp                            otherwise.



Proof: See the appendix.

   The pattern of interest rates and house prices is shown in Figure 4. To obtain some intuition,

consider ﬁrst an economy where all agents agree on real interest rates (α = 0). This economy is

in a benchmark equilibrium, where households are indiﬀerent between consumption and savings

as well as between diﬀerent portfolios. Consider now what happens when some high-interest

agents are replaced by low-interest agents, that is, α rises. At the original prices, the subjective

real interest rate of low-interest agents is below the discount rate, and also below the return on

housing. Consumption and bonds become unattractive for the low-interest agents: they prefer

to invest in housing and also take on mortgages to exploit the low (subjective) cost of borrowing.

For small α, this makes little diﬀerence in the credit market: the high-interest agents, who are

indiﬀerent between consumption and bonds, are happy to fund a few more mortgages at the

original interest rate. Similarly, the house price need not change as long as there are enough


                                                17
high-interest agents who are willing to sell houses.


                                       FIGURE 4 HERE


   The situation changes once there is a critical mass of low-interest agents. As these agents

become more numerous, their total wealth–which they invest in housing equity–goes up. Their

demand for houses at the original benchmark price βp eventually outpaces the available supply.

For markets to clear, building leveraged portfolios must become less attractive. There are two

ways in which this can happen: the cost of borrowing can rise or the return on housing can

fall. Part (a) of the proposition shows that the former occurs: the nominal interest rate rises

to reﬂect, at least in part, the low expected bond payoﬀ. Part (b) shows that the house price

also reacts: it goes up in order to lower the expected return on housing. Put diﬀerently, with

suﬃcient disagreement about ex ante real rates, higher housing demand due to cheap mortgages

drives up house prices. This occurs even though everyone agrees that the expected future payoﬀ

from houses has not changed.

   To see what happens for high α, consider an economy where all agents agree on low bond

payoﬀs. This economy is again in a benchmark equilibrium, but now with a high nominal

interest rate reﬂecting the low payoﬀ expectations. Assume next that some low-interest agents

are replaced by high-interest agents, that is, α falls. At the original benchmark prices, the

subjective real bond return of the high-interest agents now rises above the discount rate and

the housing return. High-interest agents thus prefer to invest all wealth in bonds. As long as

there are not too many of them, this does not aﬀect prices: they can easily sell houses and buy

bonds at the benchmark prices. However, once the high-interest agents reach a critical mass,

the nominal interest rate must fall. A lower nominal interest rate not only reduces the bond

demand of the high-interest agents, but it also encourages the low-interest agents to take on

mortgages, which increases the supply of bonds. The availability of cheap borrowing in turn

increases the demand for houses from the low-interest agents: we are back in the region where

disagreement increases house prices.

   Our ﬁnding that disagreement about ex ante real rates leads to house price booms is related

to the classic result that, in a market with short sale constraints and heterogeneous beliefs,

                                                18
assets are valued by the most optimistic investor (Miller 1977).8 The key diﬀerence between our

setup and Miller’s is that we do not assume disagreement about payoﬀs to the booming asset–in

our case, housing–itself. Instead, there is disagreement about subjective real interest rates. The

similarity arises because mortgages and housing together can be used to form the composite

asset housing equity, deﬁned as housing net of mortgage debt. The collateral constraint implies

that housing equity cannot be sold short. Moreover, there is disagreement about its expected

payoﬀ p − bRx. In equilibrium, the value of housing equity is driven by investors who are most

optimistic about its payoﬀ, that is, the investors who believe in low real bond payoﬀs and hence

a low cost of borrowing.


The Role of Collateral

    Proposition 2 shows that the possibility of borrowing is critical for our results and that house

price booms driven by disagreement are stronger the higher is the leverage ratio.

Proposition 2 (The role of collateral)
                   

(a) If φ = 0, the unique equilibrium has p = βp .

(b) If φ > φ∗ , the house price achieves a maximum at

                                                                 
                                                               x̄ −1
                                             p̂ := βp 1 − φ + φ       ;
                                                                x


(c) If φ > φ∗ , the cutoﬀs αp ᾱp , ᾱR , and αR that govern house price and interest rate behavior

      are decreasing in the maximal LTV value φ. In particular, we have

                                                                 
                                       αp (φ) = (1 − φ) βp /w̄ βp ,
                                                                  
                                       ᾱp (φ) = 1 − b̄ + φβp /w̄ βp .
    8
      In the simplest version of Miller’s argument, risk-neutral investors disagree about stock payoﬀs. If borrowing
is allowed, the stock price must make the most optimistic investor indiﬀerent between holding stocks and bonds–if
this were not true, the most optimistic investor would run a leveraged strategy, creating excess demand for stocks.
All other investors, who are prevented from shorting the stock–remain on the sidelines.




                                                          19
Proof: See the appendix.


   Part (a) of the proposition says that if the maximal LTV ratio φ is equal to zero–in other

words, bond holdings are constrained to be nonnegative–then the house price is constant regard-

less of the extent of disagreement. In an economy without borrowing, disagreement about real

rates will only be reﬂected in the portfolio positions: low-interest agents perceive a low return

on bonds and hold only houses, while high-interest agents perceive a high return on bonds and

hold only bonds. The possibility of leverage is thus necessary for disagreement to generate house

price booms. Part (b) says that when there is suﬃcient leverage–here we focus again on the case

φ > φ∗ that is also considered in Proposition 1–the maximal price p̂ that can occur in a house

price boom is increasing in the loan-to-value ratio φ. The comparative static of increasing φ is

represented by the dotted lines in Figure 4.

   Part (c) characterizes the cutoﬀ levels for the fraction of low-interest agents in terms of the

maximal LTV ratio φ. It says that the cutoﬀs αp and ᾱp for the house price are decreasing in

the maximal leverage ratio φ that borrowers can achieve. At values of α in the interval [αp , ᾱp],

there is suﬃcient disagreement such that a house price boom must occur in any equilibrium.

Higher φ means that an individual borrower can issue more bonds relative to his own wealth

and can thus invest a larger multiple of his own wealth in housing. The eﬀect on prices is best

seen by starting from an equilibrium with agreement. Suppose ﬁrst that everyone agrees on

high real rates and replace a few agents with low-interest agents, who now become leveragers.

Higher demand for houses per individual borrower means that it takes fewer leveragers to upset

the original equilibrium and force an increase in the house price. This explains why the lower

bound αp is decreasing in φ.

   For the converse thought experiment, suppose that initially everyone agrees on low real rates

and then replace a few agents with high-interest types. At the original equilibrium prices, the

high-interest agents invest exclusively in bonds. With higher φ, it takes more bond investors

to upset the original equilibrium, because low-interest investors can absorb more bond demand

simply by issuing more mortgages, even without an increase in the house price. Therefore, it

takes more bond investors to force a drop in interest rates that ﬁnally leads to an increase in the


                                                20
house price. This explains why the upper bound ᾱp is also decreasing in φ. The upper bound

is also decreasing in the supply of bonds from the rest of the economy. The more such bonds

are outstanding, the less important it is for low-interest investors to supply additional bonds. It

thus again takes more high-interest types to force a drop in the interest rate.



V      House Price Booms and Inflation

To compare the behavior of house prices across decades, consider now three distinct environ-

ments. Let x∗ denote bond payoﬀ expectations in a normal environment with average inﬂation

and nominal rates. As discussed above, illusion agents always expect a bond payoﬀ x∗ and do

not relate it to their expected inﬂation rate. Let xlo < x∗ denote a low payoﬀ that was expected

by smart investors during the 1970s when they expected inﬂation to be high, xlo = 1/π hi. Let

xhi = 1/π lo > x∗ denote a high bond payoﬀ that was expected by smart investors in the 2000s

when they expected low inﬂation, π lo < π hi . In a normal year, smart investors also expect a

payoﬀ equal (or close) to x∗ = 1/π ∗. If the two investor types happen to agree, the economy is

simply in a benchmark equilibrium, where the Fisher equation (for the smart investors) implies

a nominal interest rate of β −1 π ∗ and the house price is βp .9

    Now consider the 1970s scenario, where smart investors’ inﬂation expectations jump to π hi >

π ∗ . The price reaction follows from Propositions 1 and 2, setting x = xlo = 1/π hi and x̄ =

x∗ . Suppose that at the relevant parameters (α, φ) , the economy is in the region described in

Proposition 2 where the nominal interest rate rises above β −1 π ∗ but not all the way to β −1 π hi ,

while the house price rises above βp . We then obtain an equilibrium in which a house price

boom coincides with a high nominal interest rate. When smart investors see the nominal rate,

they consider borrowing a good deal since the nominal rate does not fully reﬂect their high

inﬂation expectations. Their demand for collateral drives up house prices. In contrast, illusion

agents see the nominal rate and believe times are great for investing in bonds.

    Under the 2000s scenario, smart investors’ inﬂation expectations are below the long-run
   9
     Even if the agreement is not perfect and the two payoﬀs are simply close, part (b) of Proposition 1 says that
the house price will be close to its benchmark value.




                                                       21
average at π lo < π ∗ . We again read oﬀ prices from Propositions 1 and 2, now setting x̄ = xhi =

1/π lo and x = x∗ . If the economy is in the region where interest rates partially adjust, we obtain

a house price boom that goes along with low nominal interest rates. Moreover, the role of the

two investor types is now reversed: under the 2000s scenario it is illusion investors who are eager

to borrow, since they perceive low real rates. Illusion investors’ demand for houses thus drives

up house prices. In contrast, smart investors prefer to invest in bonds.

Structural Change and the Size of House Price Booms

    Changes in the maximal LTV ratio φ can be interpreted as the result of ﬁnancial innovation–

for example, in the screening technology available to intermediaries who originate mortgages.

Proposition 2 suggests two ways in which ﬁnancial development is conducive to housing booms

in a low-inﬂation environment, as under the 2000s scenario. First, part (a) of the proposition

says that higher leverage directly leads to higher house prices. Second, part (b) says that,

with more opportunities for leverage, it takes fewer inﬂation illusion agents to generate enough

disagreement for a house price boom.10 Taken together, these observations suggest that ﬁnancial

development may explain why the house price booms of the 2000s were typically stronger than

those of the 1970s.

    Another consequence of ﬁnancial development is that the fraction of households who partici-

pate in mortgage markets has increased recently, especially among lower income households (see,

for example, Doepke and Schneider 2006). The model shows that an extreme increase in the

participation rate is conducive to housing booms (φ = 0 and φ > 0 correspond to a zero and a

100% participation rate, respectively). More generally, one would expect that a smaller increase

has similar eﬀects. Moreover, an inﬂow of poor unsophisticated investors might generate more

disagreement about real rates.

    Another structural change that occurred between the 1970s and the 2000s is the increased

opening of U.S. credit markets to foreigners. Doepke and Schneider (2006) show that the net

nominal asset position of the U.S. household sector has reached historical lows in recent years,
  10
     Interestingly, the same argument does not apply to illusion-induced booms in high-inﬂation environments.
The discussion after Proposition 2 implies that, in high-inﬂation environments, higher leverage implies that it
takes more illusion investors to generate a boom.




                                                      22
while foreigners have become important net nominal lenders. In our model, this change is

captured by a reduction in the supply of bonds b̄ provided to the household sector by the rest of

the economy. Proposition 2 shows that higher b̄ increases the parameter region where housing

booms can occur by keeping nominal interest rates low even if a lot of investors believe that real

rates are low. Strong foreign demand for bonds thus facilitates housing booms due to illusion

in both high- and low-inﬂation environments.

The Relationship between Inflation and Real Estate “Mispricing”

   Consider an econometrician whose goal is to decompose house prices into a “fundamental”

and a (residual) “mispricing” component. In the typical application, the fundamental component

is taken to be a risk-adjusted present discounted value of proﬁts to be made from the housing

stock. If the data were generated by our (risk-neutral) model, correct measurement of rents and

real interest rates would thus lead the econometrician to recover the benchmark price βp as the

fundamental component. The mispricing is then simply p − βp , a series with two peaks that

occur during the 1970s and 2000s. It follows that the relationship between inﬂation and real

estate mispricing is nonlinear: housing booms that push prices beyond fundamentals occur both

at high inﬂation rates (during the 1970s) and at low inﬂation rates (during the 2000s).

   If data were generated simply by repeatedly running our model with diﬀerent inﬂation ex-

pectations, an econometrician who regresses his measure of mispricing on inﬂation should not

detect a signiﬁcant relationship. However, the coeﬃcients in a linear regression could turn out to

be (misleadingly) signiﬁcant if there is another factor that changes over time. As one example,

suppose that there is structural change in the credit market, so that φ increases over time, as

discussed above. In this case, the ﬁrst peak of the real estate mispricing series during the high

1970s inﬂation is smaller than its second peak during the low 2000s inﬂation. Thus, a linear

regression of mispricing on inﬂation might uncover a signiﬁcantly negative linear relationship

between real estate mispricing and inﬂation. In this example, the omitted variable “credit mar-

ket development” will be responsible for the ﬁnding, although the true relationship between

inﬂation and mispricing is nonlinear.

   The relationship between real estate mispricing and inﬂation is also sensitive to how the



                                               23
fundamental component is measured in the face of structural change. For example, suppose

that deregulation of rental markets induces a trend in βp – and hence house prices – that has

nothing to do with inﬂation. Consider now an econometrician who determines the fundamental

value of housing by estimating a stationary process with the same mean as the observed house

price over his sample. Since he ignores the trend in fundamentals, this econometrician will tend

to ﬁnd negative mispricing early in his sample period and positive mispricing later in the sample

period. If inﬂation also happened to decrease over the sample period, there will be a spurious

negative relationship between mispricing and inﬂation that has nothing to do with inﬂation

illusion.



VI      Conclusion

This paper has considered a stylized economy with heterogeneous agents, some of whom suﬀer

from inﬂation illusion. Our model predicts a nonmonotonic relationship between house price-

rent ratios and inﬂation: house prices are high whenever inﬂation is far away from its historical

average. According to the model, a high-inﬂation environment–such as the 1970s–is a time when

smart households drive up house prices because they are able to borrow cheaply from illusionary

households. The latter do not realize that nominal rates are high only because expected inﬂation

is high and thus perceive higher real rates than smart households. In contrast, in a low-inﬂation

environment–such as the 2000s–the role of the two groups is reversed: illusionary households

drive up house prices because they think they are borrowing cheaply from smart households.

They do not realize that nominal interest rates are low only because of low expected inﬂation

and thus perceive lower real rates than smart households. Recent ﬁnancial market development

has made borrowing easier, which might explain why the housing boom of the 2000s is more

pronounced than the 1970s boom.

    We emphasize that general equilibrium eﬀects matter for thinking about the eﬀect of inﬂation

illusion on asset prices. While the “Fed model” consists of a relationship between endogenous

variables, our model jointly determines both the nominal interest rate and house prices. We have

shown that investor heterogeneity is one way to reconcile the comovement of nominal rates and


                                               24
inﬂation with real eﬀects of inﬂation illusion, and also to avoid Summers’ critique. An important

task for future research is to quantify the implications of inﬂation illusion and to compare the

eﬀect we have derived here to other candidate explanations for house-price booms.

   Another interesting issue is the eﬀect of inﬂation illusion on stock prices. The cross-country

evidence in this paper shows that the price-dividend ratios of housing and stocks often move in

opposite directions. The mechanism we emphasize can help produce such negative comovement.

Indeed, disagreement about real interest rates makes bonds more attractive to investors who

perceive high real rates, while it makes real estate more attractive to investors who perceive

low real rates. In relative terms, stocks thus become less attractive to both investor types.

The resulting shift in portfolio demand away from stocks should thus lower stock prices while

increasing house prices.

A       Appendix

This appendix characterizes the equilibria of our model. We begin with three lemmas. Lemma

1 shows that, in any equilibrium, we must have β −1 /x̄ ≤ R ≤ β −1 /x and p ≥ βp . Lemma 2

derives conditions for the existence of equilibria with p = βp , while Lemma 3 does the same for

the case p > βp . Propositions 1∗ and 2∗ then provide a full description of the equilibria that can
                                                                      
occur. In particular, these propositions do not assume that φ b̄0 + y > h̄0 b̄, an assumption that

was made in the text to ensure uniqueness. We provide a brief discussion of why multiplicity

can occur–and why it is not particularly interesting from an economic perspective here–after

Proposition 2∗ . Finally, we derive Propositions 1 and 2 stated in the text.


Lemma 1. In any equilibrium, β −1 /x̄ ≤ R ≤ β −1 /x and p ≥ βp .


Proof. If R < β −1 /x̄, then no household invests in bonds, which cannot be an equilibrium since

bonds are in positive net supply.

    If p < βp , then it is optimal for both household types to save all initial wealth, since the

real return on housing p /p is higher than the discount rate. Summing up the market clearing

conditions for bonds and houses, the house price must satisfy

(A-1)                                  p + b̄ = b̄0 + ph̄0 + y.

Because h̄0 < 1 and condition (2) holds, the solution for p is positive. But now condition (6)

implies that
                                                    
                                     p   p 1 − h̄0
(A-2)                                   =              < β −1 ,
                                     p    y + b̄0 − b̄

a contradiction.

    Finally, if R > β −1 /x, the real rate on bonds perceived by both types is strictly higher than

the discount rate, and, since p ≥ βp (by the argument in the previous paragraph), the real bond

return is also strictly higher than the return on housing. It follows that no agent wants to hold

housing, which cannot be an equilibrium since houses are in positive net supply.

Lemma 2. Deﬁne the cutoﬀs

                                                            
                                  ᾱp = 1 − (b̄ + φβp )/w̄ βp ,
                                                         
                                  αp = (1 − φ) βp /w̄ βp .

An equilibrium with p = βp exists if and only if either


(a) α ≥ ᾱp , in which case Rx = β −1 , or

(b) α ≤ αp, in which case Rx̄ = β −1 .



Proof. We assume ﬁrst that Rx̄ > β −1 , which leads to case (a) and below consider Rx̄ = β −1 ,

which leads to case (b). If Rx̄ > β −1 = p /p, then high-interest agents hold only bonds. We

must have Rx ≤ β −1 , since otherwise nobody holds houses. We cannot have Rx < β −1 . If this

were true, low-interest agents would want to invest all wealth in a leveraged portfolio strategy.

All agents would then invest all wealth, so that the value of the total asset supply would equal

the total value of wealth, and the house price would be determined by (A-1). As argued in

the proof of Lemma 1, condition (6) would then imply p /p < β −1 (cf. Equation (A-2)), which

contradicts our assumption that p = βp .

   We conclude that equilibria with p = βp and Rx̄ > β −1 must have Rx = β −1 . Low-interest

agents are thus indiﬀerent between bonds, houses, and consumption, while high-interest agents

hold only bonds. Markets can clear at these prices as long as there are suﬃciently many bonds

available to satisfy the demand of the high-interest agents. Bond supply can come either from

the ROE sector or because low-interest agents issue mortgages. We obtain the cutoﬀ for case

(a):

                                                                    
(A-3)                           b̄ + φβp ≥ (1 − α) βp h̄0 + b̄0 + y .

As long as this inequality holds, condition (6) guarantees that the remaining wealth (owned by

the low-interest agents) is high enough such that the latter agents can aﬀord to purchase the

whole housing stock, that is,

                                                                 
                                 (1 − φ) βp < α βp h̄0 + b̄0 + y .

                                                  29
Since low-interest agents are indiﬀerent between all portfolio strategies, a suitable number of

them can be assigned to both markets to ensure market clearing. It follows that equilibria with

p = βp and Rx̄ > β −1 exist if and only if condition (A-3) holds.

   Suppose now that Rx̄ = β −1 . Since Rx < β −1 = p /p, low-interest agents will use the

leveraged strategy and hold no bonds. For an equilibrium of this type to exist, we need the

value of the housing stock to be large enough to satisfy the demand of the low-interest agents,

which deﬁnes the cutoﬀ for case (b):

                                                                   
(A-4)                              (1 − φ) βp ≥ α βp h̄0 + b̄0 + y .

If this inequality is satisﬁed, condition (6) again ensures that the remaining wealth (owned by

the high-interest agents) is large enough that the high-interest agents can absorb all bonds issued

by the ROE and the low-interest agents, that is

                                                                   
                               b̄ + φβp < (1 − α) βp h̄0 + b̄0 + y .

It follows that equilibria with p = βp and Rx̄ = β −1 exist if and only if condition (A-4) holds.

Lemma 3. An equilibrium with p > βp exists only if φ > 0 and at least one of four sets of

conditions holds:

                      
(a) φ > h̄0 b̄/ b̄0 + y := φ∗ and

                                                            
                                       ᾱp > α > 1 − b̄ + φp̂ /w̄ (p̂) ,


(b) φ < φ∗ and
                                                            
                                       ᾱp < α < 1 − b̄ + φp̂ /w̄ (p̂) ,

(c) αp < α < (1 − φ) p̂/w (p̂) ,

                                                  
(d) φ > 0 and (1 − φ) p̂/w̄ (p̂) ≤ α ≤ 1 − b̄ + φp̂ /w̄ (p̂) .


For all cases, there exist values of α that satisfy the conditions.

Conversely, assume φ > 0. If cases (a) or (b) apply, the equilibrium house price and interest

                                         
                           (1 − α) b̄0 + y − b̄
(A-5)                  p =                      ,
                              φ − (1 − α) h̄0
                                                       
                             −1  1   βp φ − h̄0 (1 − α)

                                φx (1 − α) y + b̄0 − b̄

In case (a), p is decreasing in α and R is increasing in α.

   If case (c) applies, then Rx̄ = β −1 and
                                                      
                                             α b̄0 + y
(A-7)                                    p=              ,
                                            1 − φ − αh̄0

and the price p is increasing in α.

   If case (d) applies, p = p̂ and Rx̄ = β −1 .


Proof. If p /p < β −1 , high-interest agents do not own houses in equilibrium. Indeed, we know

from Lemma 1 that we must have Rx̄ ≥ β −1 . Since p /p < β −1 ≤ Rx̄, owning houses without

leverage is worse than owning bonds for high-interest agents. More generally, even the return on

a maximally leveraged strategy is strictly worse than the return on bonds for the high-interest

agents:
                                                      
                      1        p           1  p       −1
                                  − φRx̄ ≤        − φβ      < β −1 ≤ Rx̄.
                     1−φ       p           1−φ p
Since high-interest agents do not own houses, low-interest agents must be willing to do so, which

requires
                                                          
                                       1        p
(A-8)                                              − φRx       ≥ β −1 .
                                      1−φ       p

It follows that we cannot have φ = 0, since otherwise p /p = β −1 . To derive the other conditions,

we ﬁrst consider Rx̄ > β −1 , which corresponds to cases (a) and (b). We then consider Rx̄ = β −1 ,

which corresponds to case (c) and (d).


Cases (a) and (b). We ﬁrst show that if there is an equilibrium with p > βp and Rx̄ > β −1 ,

either case (a) or case (b) applies. If Rx̄ > β −1 , high-interest agents invest all their wealth in

bonds and hold no houses. We must then have (A-8) hold with equality. Indeed, if (A-8) were to

hold strictly, then low-interest agents would invest all wealth in leveraged portfolios, so that all


                                                   31
agents would save all wealth and the house price would be pinned down by (A-1). Substituting

this price formula back into (A-8), we obtain

(A-9)                                      b̄ + p̃ > p̃h̄0 + y + b̄0 ,

where p̃ = βp (1 − φ + φβRx)−1 . The last inequality contradicts our assumption (7). To see

this, deﬁne the function
                                                          b̄ + p
                                           h (p) :=                  ,
                                                      ph̄0 + y + b̄0
which is strictly increasing since h̄0 < 1 and b̄ < b̄0 + y. We can write (A-9) as h (p̃) > 1

and (7) as h(βp x̄/x) < 1, so that we would need p̃ > βp x̄/x. However, Rx̄ > β −1 implies

p̃ < p̂ < βp x̄/x, a contradiction.

   Since (A-8) holds with equality, low-interest agents must be indiﬀerent between consumption

and holding leveraged portfolios. There must be a subset of low-interest agents that holds all

houses and issues φp mortgages. These mortgages, together with the debt issued by the ROE,

must in turn be held by high-interest agents. Since high-interest agents invest all wealth in

bonds, the total outstanding debt must be equal to high-interest agents’ wealth. For the bond

market to clear, the equilibrium house price must satisfy

(A-10)                            b̄ + φp = (1 − α) ph̄0 + b̄0 + y .

The solution for the house price is (A-5). The interest rate R is then pinned down by (A-8),

which we have assumed to hold with equality. The solution for the interest rate is (A-6).

   The solutions (p, R) in (A-5) - (A-6) must satisfy p > βp and Rx̄ > β −1 . Since they are

equilibrium prices, they must also be positive, which gives rise to two possibilities. Assume ﬁrst

that

                                                                   
(A-11)                                 φ/h̄0 > (1 − α) > b̄/ b̄0 + y .

The conditions p > βp and Rx̄ > β −1 can now be written as

                                                                    
(A-12)                        b̄ + φβp < (1 − α) βp h̄0 + b̄0 + y ,
                                                                  
(A-13)                           b̄ + p̂φ > (1 − α) p̂h̄0 + b̄0 + y ,



                                                       32
which deﬁnes the cutoﬀs for α in case (a).

   A second set of parameters that leads to positive prices is

                                            
(A-14)                            b̄/ b̄0 + y > (1 − α) > φ/h̄0 .

The conditions p > βp and Rx̄ > β −1 now deﬁne the cutoﬀs for α in case (b):

                                                                   
(A-15)                       b̄ + φβp > (1 − α) βp h̄0 + b̄0 + y ,
                                                                 
(A-16)                          b̄ + p̂φ < (1 − α) p̂h̄0 + b̄0 + y .


   It remains to deﬁne
                                                          b̄
                                           φ∗ = h̄0           .
                                                      b̄0 + y
We have thus shown that existence of an equilibrium with p > βp and Rx̄ > β −1 implies either

(a) or (b).

   We now show that there exist values of α that satisfy these conditions. Begin with case (a)

and consider the function
                                                      b̄ + φp
                                       f (p) :=                  ,
                                                  ph̄0 + b̄0 + y
which is continuously diﬀerentiable with
                                                       
                                            φ b̄0 + y − b̄h̄0
                                     f (p) =                 2 ,
                                               ph̄0 + b̄0 + y

and is therefore strictly increasing if and only if φ > φ∗ . Conditions (A-12) and (A-13) can be

written as f (p̂) > 1 − α > f (βp). If follows that, if φ > φ∗ , there exist values of α that satisfy

both conditions simultaneously. Any such value of α will also satisfy (A-11), because

                                                                             b̄
                  lim f (p) = φ/h̄0 > f (p̂) > 1 − α > f βp > f (0) =             .
                 p→∞                                                       b̄0 + y

A similar argument applies to case (b). Indeed, (A-15) and (A-16) can be written as f (p̂) <

1 − α < f (βp). If φ < φ∗ , then f is strictly decreasing, which implies that there are values of α

that satisfy (A-14) – (A-16).

   Suppose now that we have a pair (φ, α) that satisﬁes the conditions of case (a) or (b) and

suppose prices are given by (A-5) – (A-6). The bond market clears by construction of the house


                                                   33
price. For the housing market to clear, the wealth of the low-interest agents evaluated at p must

be high enough that these agents can aﬀord to hold all houses:

                                                              
(A-17)                             (1 − φ) p ≤ α ph̄0 + b̄0 + y .

Since (A-10) is assumed to hold, (A-17) is equivalent to

                                       b̄ + p ≤ ph̄0 + b̄0 + y.

But this inequality is implied by (7) since Rx̄ > β −1 guarantees p < p̂. If we are in case (a),

(A-11) holds and implies that the price (A-5) decreasing in α, while the interest rate (A-6) is

increasing in α.

   To sum up, we have shown that an equilibrium with p > βp exists if either φ > φ∗ and

conditions (A-12) – (A-13) hold or φ < φ∗ and conditions (A-15) – (A-16) hold. For either case,

there are values of α that satisfy the conditions. Finally, if either pair of conditions holds, there

is an equilibrium with prices (A-5) – (A-6) that satisﬁes p > βp .

Case (c). We show that if there is an equilibrium such that p > βp , Rx̄ = β −1 and (A-8) holds

with strict inequality, then case (c) applies. Under these conditions, low-interest agents invest

all their wealth in a leveraged portfolio strategy. Since high-interest agents do not hold houses,

housing equity in the entire housing stock must equal the wealth of low-interest agents:

                                                              
(A-18)                             (1 − φ) p = α ph̄0 + b̄0 + y .

The solution for the house price is (A-7).

   The solution for p must be positive, so that α ≤ (1 − φ) /h̄0 . In addition, it must satisfy

p > βp as well as (A-8) with strict inequality. This implies the cutoﬀs for case (c):

                                                                
(A-19)                         (1 − φ) βp < α βp h̄0 + b̄0 + y ,
                                                              
(A-20)                           (1 − φ) p̂ > α p̂h̄0 + b̄0 + y .

We now show that there exist values of α that satisfy the conditions of case (c). The function

                                                    (1 − φ) p
                                       g (p) :=
                                                  ph̄0 + b̄0 + y


                                                  34
is strictly increasing and continuous in p, with limp→∞ g (p) = (1 − φ) /h̄0 . It follows that there

exist values of α that satisfy g (βp ) < α < g (p̂), which is equivalent to (A-19) – (A-20).

   Finally, suppose that there is an α such that (A-19) – (A-20) hold and that the house price

is given by (A-7). This price is positive since g is strictly increasing so that (A-21) implies

                               α < g (p̂) < lim g (p) = (1 − φ) /h̄0 .
                                            p→∞


The house market clears by construction. For the bond market to clear, the wealth of the

high-interest agents must be high enough at p to absorb all bonds, that is,

                                                                
(A-21)                           b̄ + φp < (1 − α) ph̄0 + b̄0 + y .

Since (A-18) holds, (A-21) is equivalent to

                                       b̄ + p < ph̄0 + b̄0 + y.

This inequality is implied by (7) since (A-8) guarantees p < p̂. We have thus shown that an

equilibrium with p > βp and Rx̄ = β −1 exists only if (A-19) – (A-20) hold. There are values

of α that satisfy these conditions. Given the conditions, there is an equilibrium with Rx̄ = β −1

and house price (A-7). The house price is also increasing in α.

Case (d). We show that if there is an equilibrium such that p > βp , Rx̄ = β −1 and (A-8) holds

with equality, then case (d) applies. Substituting Rx̄ = β −1 into (A-8) and solving for the house

price, we obtain p = p̂. Since Rx̄ = β −1 > p /p, high-interest agents do not hold houses. Since

Rx < β −1 , low-interest agents do not hold bonds. For the house market to clear, the wealth of

the low-interest agents–evaluated at the price p̂–must be high enough so that these agents can

aﬀord the housing equity required to purchase the entire housing stock:

                                                               
(A-22)                            (1 − φ) p̂ ≤ α p̂h̄0 + b̄0 + y .

At the same time, bond market clearing requires that the wealth of the high-interest agents is

high enough so that they can absorb all bonds:

                                                                  
(A-23)                           b̄ + φp̂ ≤ (1 − α) p̂h̄0 + b̄0 + y .




                                                  35
We have thus derived the conditions for case (d). Condition (7) implies that there exist values

of α that satisfy both inequalities. Finally, if there is an α that falls under case (d), then (A-22)

says that we can pick a subset of the low-interest agents that holds all houses as part of leveraged

portfolios, while (A-23) says that we can pick a subset of the high-interest agents who hold all

bonds.


Proposition 1 ∗ .


(a) For every maximal LTV ratio φ < 1, there exist cutoﬀs ᾱR and αR such that 1 > ᾱR ≥

      αR > 0 and the equilibrium nominal interest rate satisﬁes

                                R = β −1 /x                    if α ≥ ᾱR ,

                                R = β −1 /x̄                   if α ≤ αR ,

                                R ∈ [β −1 /x̄, β −1 /x]        otherwise.


(b) For every maximal LTV ratio φ ∈ (0, 1), there exist cutoﬀs ᾱp and αp such that ᾱR ≥ ᾱp >

      αp > 0 and the equilibrium house price satisﬁes

                           p = βp                             if α ∈
                                                                    / (αp , ᾱR ],

                           p > βp                             if α ∈ (αp , ᾱp),

                           p ∈ [βp , p̂]                      otherwise.

      Moreover, there exists α ∈ (αp, ᾱR ) such that there is an equilibrium with p = p̂.


Proof. We ﬁrst deﬁne the cutoﬀs
                          ⎧
                          ⎪            
                          ⎨ 1 − b̄ + φp̂ /w̄ (p̂)                   if φ < φ∗ ,
                  ᾱR =

                          ⎩ ᾱp                                     if φ ≥ φ∗ .

                          ⎪
                          ⎨ ᾱp                                      if φ < φ∗ ,
                  αR =                 
                          ⎪
                          ⎩ 1 − b̄ + φp̂ /w̄ (p̂)                    if φ ≥ φ∗ .


Part (a). If φ ≥ φ∗ , then there is an equilibrium with Rx = β −1 , by case (a) of Lemma 2.

Lemmas 2 and 3 imply also that there cannot be any other type of equilibrium. If φ < φ∗ , then

                                                 36
case (b) of Lemma 3 says that

                                                                      
                       ᾱR = 1 − b̄ + φp̂ /w̄ (p̂) > 1 − (b + φβp )/w̄ βp .

This means that for every α ≥ ᾱR , there is an equilibrium with Rx = β −1 , again by case (a)

of Lemma 2. Inspection of the other case in Lemmas 2 and 3 again shows that this is the only

equilibrium. Any α ≤ αR must satisfy the conditions of either case (b) of Lemma 2, or case (c)

or case (d) of Lemma 3. It cannot satisfy the conditions of any other case. In all the relevant

cases, the equilibrium interest rate is Rx̄ = β −1 .

Part (b). For α > ᾱR , the only equilibrium is that of case (a) of Lemma 2, which has p = βp . If

α ≤ αp , the only type of equilibrium is case (b) of Lemma 2, which has p = βp . If αp ≤ α ≤ ᾱp ,

then Lemma 2 does not apply. Comparing the cutoﬀs, one of the cases in Lemma 3 always

applies, so that p > βp . Finally, for every φ > 0, there exist values of α such that part (d) of

Lemma 3 applies. In the latter equilibrium, p = p̂.


Proposition 2 ∗ .


(a) If borrowing is not possible (φ = 0), then p = βp for all α.

(b) The cutoﬀs αp ᾱp , ᾱR , and αR that govern house price and interest rate behavior are

      decreasing in the maximal LTV value φ. In particular, we have

                                                            
                                  αp (φ) = (1 − φ) βp /w̄ βp ,

                                  ᾱp (φ) = 1 − b̄ + φβp /w̄ βp .

                                                                      
(c) There is a threshold for the maximal LTV ratio φ∗ := h̄0 b̄/ b0 + y ∈ (0, 1) such that


      (i) if φ ∈ (φ∗ , 1), equilibrium is unique for all α and

                                      ᾱp (φ) = ᾱR (φ) > αR (φ) > αp (φ) .

           The interest rate is continuous and nondecreasing in the fraction α, whereas the house

           price is continuous and hump-shaped in α, with a maximum of p = p̂.



                                                  37
       (ii) if φ ∈ (0, φ∗ ), then

                                        ᾱR (φ) > ᾱp (φ) = αR (φ) > αp (φ) .

             For α ≤ ᾱp (φ), the interest rate and house price are continuous and nondecreasing

             in the fraction α. If α ≥ ᾱR (φ), then Rx = β −1 and p = βp . If α ∈ [ᾱp (φ) , ᾱR (φ)],

             there can be up to three equilibria with R ∈ [β −1 /x̄, β −1 /x] and p ∈ [βp , p̂].


Proof. Part (a). If φ = 0, then Lemma 3 does not apply. The result follows directly from

Lemma 2.

Part (b). The formulas for ᾱp and αp follow directly from the proof of Proposition 1. These

cutoﬀs are decreasing in φ, since w̄ is positive and does not depend on φ. To show that ᾱp and

αp are also decreasing in φ, it is suﬃcient to show that (b + φp̂)/w̄ (p̂) is increasing in φ. The

derivative                                                        x            
                       d ((b + φp̂)/w̄ (p̂))      p̂ w̄ (p̂) − 1 − x̄ h̄0 b̄ + p̂φ
                                             =
                               dφ              w̄ (p̂)2       1 − φ + φ x̄x
is positive since (7) guarantees w̄ (p̂) > b̄ + p̂ and h0 , φ and x/x̄ are all smaller than one.

Part (c). Our assumption (2) can be written as

                                             
                                          w̄ βp > b̄ + βp φ,

and therefore implies that ᾱp > αp for all φ. Case (c) of Lemma 3 implies that αR > αp for all

φ.

     If φ > φ∗ , the conditions of Lemmas 2 and 3 are mutually exclusive, and exactly one case of

Lemma 3 can be relevant for a given value of α. Equilibrium is thus unique. Moreover, Lemma

3 implies that the price is increasing in α in case (c) and decreasing in case (a). Comparing the

price formulas shows that the price is continuous and hump-shaped. Similarly, case (a) of Lemma

3 says that the interest rate is increasing, while it is constant in all other cases. Comparison of

the formulas shows that the interest rate is also continuous.

     If φ < φ∗ , ᾱR > ᾱp follows from case (b) of Lemma 3. Unless α ∈ [ᾱp , ᾱR ], exactly one of

the cases in Lemma 3 applies, so that equilibrium is unique. If α ∈ [ᾱp, ᾱR ], then case (a) of

Lemma 2 as well as cases (b) and (c) of Lemma 3 can in principle all apply. Therefore, there


                                                    38
can be up to three equilibria.


Remarks. If φ is low, multiple equilibria can obtain for some intermediate values of α (case (ii)).

This happens because, with risk neutrality, portfolio choice reacts to prices only through discrete

jumps, while the eﬀect of prices on wealth is continuous. Consider again the thought experiment

where initially all agents agree on real rates and then some are replaced by high-interest types.

For high α, bond demand is due to high-interest agents, whose wealth is increasing in the house

price. At the same time, the supply of bonds comes in part from borrowing by low-interest

agents. Locally, the latter also increases with the house price, as the borrowing constraint is

relaxed. Both supply and demand are locally not sensitive to the interest rate. Markets can

then clear both at a high house price, which give rises to high supply and demand, and at a

low house price, which gives rise to low supply and demand.11 Since this multiplicity is due

to auxiliary assumptions and does not aﬀect the main eﬀect we emphasize–house price booms

occur for intermediate values of α–we do not use it in our interpretation of the model below.


    Proof of Proposition 1. Proposition 1 establishes the existence of cutoﬀs for price and
                                                                                         
interest rates in any equilibrium. Under the additional assumption φ > φ∗ = h̄0 b̄/ b0 + y ,

part (c,i) of Proposition 2∗ shows uniqueness, the special form of the cutoﬀs, as well as the

monotonicity of the interest rate and the hump shape of the house price.


       Proof of Proposition 2. Part (a) is the same as part (a) of Proposition 2∗ . Part (b)

follows from part (a) of Proposition 1∗ .

       Part (c) follows from part (c,i) of Proposition 2∗ .




  11
     If φ is higher, bond supply becomes more sensitive to the interest rate and equilibrium is unique. The same
is true if the exogenous bond supply b̄ is smaller; in fact, φ∗ = 0 if b̄ = 0. In addition, equilibrium is unique if
bond demand becomes less sensitive to the house price as h̄0 falls; we have φ∗ = 0 also if h̄0 = 0.
