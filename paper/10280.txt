                                           ABSTRACT

The relationship between interest rates and exchange rates is puzzling and poorly understood. But

under some standard assumptions, interest rates can be adjusted to smooth real exchange rate

movements at the possible price of increased volatility in other variables. In New Zealand, estimates

made under some generous suppositions about what monetary policy is able to accomplish suggest

that decreasing real exchange rate volatility by about 25% would require increasing output volatility

by about 10-15%, inflation volatility by about 0-15% and interest rate volatility by about 15-40%.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

        The primary goal of monetary policy in New Zealand is price stability. But that is not the

sole mandate of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Recent Policy Targets Agreements have

also called on the Bank to “avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates and the

exchange rate.”

        Thus the Bank is directed to make output, interest rates and the exchange rate variables of

interest beyond the usefulness of these variables for understanding and forecasting inflation,

perhaps interpretable as a direction to trade off price stability with stability in these other

variables. This paper considers the possibility of using interest rate policy to trade exchange rate

stability against stability in other variables. It makes two points. Section 2 of the paper reminds

the reader that the relationship between interest rate policy and exchange rates is quite uncertain.

Specifically, I remind the reader of the empirical failure of “uncovered interest parity.” In light

of such a failure, it will likely be difficult in practice to use interest rate adjustments to stabilize

exchange rates with any precision.

        The rest of the paper follows a considerable literature that ignores the reminder just

noted. It embeds a standard interest parity relationship between interest rates and exchange rates

in a linear macro model. It uses counterfactual calculations to supply rough quantitative

estimates of that tradeoff, focusing on stability of real exchange rates on the one hand vs.

stability of output, inflation and interest rates on the other. The point estimates suggest that

decreasing real exchange rate volatility by about 25% would require increasing output and

inflation volatility by roughly 10% and interest rate volatility by roughly 20%.

        The estimates are derived from a simple linear model that is broadly consistent with both


                                                    1
textbook and New Keynesian models. The mechanism the Bank is assumed to use to stabilize

real exchange rates is to adjust interest rates in response to transitory movements in exchange

rates, with interest rate hikes (cuts) coming in response to transitory depreciations

(appreciations) of the New Zealand dollar.

        Three cautionary notes. First, these estimates are likely to be optimistic ones. This is not

only because the model assumes that interest rate adjustments affect exchange rates in a reliable

and well understood way. As well, and at a more prosaic level, the computations assume away a

host of other practical problems: they assume that the Bank knows the steady state level of the

real exchange rate, that the Bank can react to exchange rate movements as quickly as exchange

rates react to interest rate movements, that excellent data on output and inflation are available

contemporaneously, and so on. So in practice a 25% reduction in real exchange rate volatility is

likely to be associated with greater increases in volatility of other variables than stated above.

        Second, this paper does not consider the desirability of explicitly targeting real exchange

rate movements. As indicated above, statements in recent Policy Targets Agreements serve as

my motivation to estimate a tradeoff. I will refer to estimates of changes in volatility as the

“price” paid for targeting real exchange rate movements. Of course, the appropriate measure of

any tradeoff is one of utility and not volatility. The utility function to interpret the estimates is to

be supplied by the reader. See among others Benigno and Benigno (2000), Clarida et al. (2001),

and Kollman (2002) for formal analyses of the welfare properties of monetary rules in open

economies.

        Third, the fact that the focus of this paper is on real exchange rate stabilization should not

be interpreted as an assertion that such stabilization is the only or even most important way


                                                   2
exchange rates might affect monetary policy. In a small open economy like New Zealand’s,

exchange rates, both real and nominal, are central to understanding and forecasting the evolution

of inflation and output. I take this point as given, and consider the separate question of the cost

of real exchange rate stabilization.

       Section 2 of the paper notes the uncertainty of the link between interest rates and

exchange rates. Section 3 presents the model. Section 4 presents empirical results. Section 5

concludes. An Appendix includes some algebraic details.



                              2. UNCERTAIN INTEREST PARITY

       For countries with roughly similar inflation rates, exchange rate changes are hard to

predict. In my view, they are even harder to predict than are stock price changes, which are

notoriously difficult to predict. Indeed, a vast literature studying exchange rate prediction has

concluded that the best single predictor of the exchange rate next period–tomorrow, next week,

next month, maybe even next year–is the exchange rate this period. One generally cannot do

better than a “no change” forecast for exchange rates. The seminal reference is Meese and

Rogoff (1983); a recent update is Cheung et al. (2002).

       Those unfamiliar with the exchange rate models may think this “random walk” result is

precisely what is predicted by classic efficient markets theory as exposited by Samuelson (1965).

But in fact this is not the case. Explaining why not will take us to the “uncovered interest

parity” relationship that is the central link between interest rates and exchange rates in

macroeconomic models such as the one developed and estimated in this paper.

       Recall that the essence of Samuelson’s (1965) model is not that asset prices changes are


                                                  3
unpredictable but that asset returns are unpredictable. Samuelson explicitly noted that if an asset

pays a dividend in a given time period, the asset’s return (sum of dividend and price change) will

be unpredictable only if there is, on average, an offsetting movement in the asset price. For

equity returns, for example, this means that the day a stock goes ex-dividend, its price should

fall, on average, by the amount of the dividend. And indeed this implication has been found to

be more or less consistent with the behavior of U.S. stock price data (an early reference is Elton

and Gruber (1970)), at least once one takes into account complications induced by taxes and

transactions costs.

        The reader may wonder what a discussion about dividends has to do with exchange rates.

It is of course true that holding foreign currency does not automatically entitle one to earn money

labeled “dividends.” But from the point of view of Samuelson’s (1965) efficient markets theory,

interest payments on nominally riskless government debt play precisely the role of dividends.

To see why, let us define the following notation:



(2.1)   it: interest rate in New Zealand,

        i*t : interest rate in foreign country,

        st: log nominal exchange rate, measured as $NZ/foreign currency,

        Et: mathematical expectations conditional on a period t information set.



I follow the convention that a higher value of st denote a weaker (depreciated) currency.

        In the notation of (2.1), uncovered interest parity may be written:




                                                  4
(2.2)   it = i*t + Etst+1 - st.



The left hand side is the return from investing in domestic (New Zealand) bonds. The right hand

side is the expected return from the following investment: convert from New Zealand dollars to

foreign currency, buy the foreign bond that pays i*t , convert the proceeds back to New Zealand

dollars. If investors are risk neutral, as assumed by Samuelson (1965), equality of expected

returns should hold, and equation (2.2) follows. (For example, if the New Zealand interest rate

it is (say) 4 percent higher than the foreign interest rate i*t , then our hypothetical investor must

expect that by investing abroad he will earn 4 percent via depreciation of the New Zealand dollar

[Etst+1-st =.04] .) Alternatively, investors cannot expect to make money by borrowing at rate it

and investing abroad. In (2.2), the expected asset price change is Etst+1-st, while the net

“dividend” is i*t -it: Samuelson’s (1965) model says that the total return i*t -it+Etst+1-st is

unpredictable.

        Observe that uncovered interest parity (2.2) states that exchange rate changes are

predictably related to interest rate differentials; according to uncovered interest parity, exchange

rates do not follow a random walk. I began this section by noting that exchange rate changes are

unpredictable, which means in particular that they are not well predicted by interest rate

differentials. This is illustrated by Figures 1(a)-1(c), which present scatterplots of begin of

quarter 90 day interest rate differentials (horizontal axis) with subsequent quarterly percentage

changes in nominal exchange rates (vertical axis), for the New Zealand dollar versus the

currencies of Australia (Figure 1a), Japan (1b) and the U.S. (1c). The sample period is 1986:2-

2003:1. The interest rate differentials are expressed at quarterly rates. Were uncovered interest


                                                     5
parity to hold, the dots would be scattered around a forty five degree line. No such pattern is

evident. Indeed, the point estimate of correlation between the two series is negative for the U.S.

and Japan, and the estimated positive correlation for Australia is insignificantly different from

zero. A vast literature finds similar results. See Lewis (1995) for a general survey and Razzak

and Margaritis (2002) for recent New Zealand evidence.

        So fitting the historical data requires the addition of variables to (2.2). In the empirical

work presented below, I take the tack of appending a serially correlated shock, call it urt; the “r”

stands for “risk premium:”



(2.3)   it - i*t = Etst+1 - st + urt.



In this empirical work, I use historical data and regression residuals to construct a series for urt

(and other unobserved shocks, though such shocks are not important at the moment). When I

trace out the effects of alternative interest rate policies, I assume that the time series for urt is

invariant to such policies. That is, ceteris paribus, movements in it lead one-to-one to

movements in expected exchange rate depreciation, where one of the cetera held fixed is urt.

This may not be a good assumption, but it arguably is as good as any. A good assumption about

how urt will change as monetary policy changes requires a good model for the shock urt. We do

not have such a model. Possible explanations for urt include a risk premium generated as the

usual covariance with the market portfolio (e.g. Backus et al. (2001)) or misperceptions about

determinants of exchange rates (e.g., Gourinchas and Tornell (2002)). Each explanation has

substantial empirical or theoretical difficulties.


                                                     6
        The lesson to be drawn is that the results about to be developed and presented need to be

interpreted with an unusual amount of caution.



                                            3. THE MODEL

A. Specification

        The model is broadly consistent with recent New Keynesian work on monetary policy in

small open economies, such as Galí and Monacelli (2002). An IS curve, a Phillips curve, a

monetary policy rule and an interest parity equation are specified for New Zealand. These are

forward looking, with all dynamics and persistence due to serial correlation in exogenous

shocks. As well, exogenous processes are posited for foreign (rest of world) output, inflation

and interest rates.

        For convenience, I refer to a foreign “country”, although the empirical work defines the

foreign country as a trade weighted average of several foreign countries. Define the following

notation in addition to that defined in (2.1):



(3.1)   yt = output gap in New Zealand, y*t = output gap in foreign country;

        pt, p*t : log price levels (CPI);

        Bt, B*t : inflation (first difference of log consumer price level);

        qt=st-(pt-p*t ): log real exchange rate;



I repeat that I follow the convention in which an increase in the exchange rate (real or nominal)

corresponds to a depreciation rather than appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.


                                                    7
        The IS and Phillips curve equations are:



(3.2)   yt = "y*y*t + "qqt - "r(it-EtBt+1) + uyt

(3.3)   Bt = $BEtBt+1 + $yyt + uBt




In (3.2) and (3.3), uyt and uBt are exogenous shocks, which in the empirical work will be serially

correlated. Here and throughout I suppress constant terms.

        The IS curve (3.2) can be justified in either of two related ways. The first is as a

textbook open economy aggregate demand curve. In this case, "y and "q are positive and reflect

the responsiveness of net exports to movements in foreign output y*t and the real exchange rate

qt; "r is negative. A second is from New Keynesian models with certain assumptions about,

preferences, risk sharing and purchasing power parity. For example, in Galí and Monacelli

(2002), which assumes that uncovered interest parity and instantaneous purchasing power parity,

(3.2) holds with "y* and "q functions of preference parameters and "r=0; in the particularly

simple case of logarithmic preferences, "y*=1, "q>0 is increasing in the share of foreign

produced goods in New Zealand consumption, and uyt depends on the level of productivity in

New Zealand relative to the foreign country.

        Equation (3.3) again is consistent with both textbook and New Keynesian models. In

textbooks, $B=1; in the Calvo sticky price model, $B is a little less than 1. In either, $y is

positive. In both textbook and New Keynesian models, the measure of inflation that appears in

the Phillips curve is domestic rather than overall inflation Bt. The use of overall inflation is a

shortcut that allows me to avoid modeling the pass through of exchange rates to prices. Explicit


                                                   8
modeling of pass through is an important task for future research.

        I assume that monetary policy is New Zealand is adequately captured by a Taylor rule

with a serially correlated shock umt:



(3.4)   it = (BBt + (yyt + (qqt + umt



In (3.4), (B>1, (y$0 and (q$0. The use of actual inflation is for consistency with work at the

Reserve Bank (see Drew and Plantier (2000) and Plantier and Scrimgeour (2002)). From a

technical point of view, I could proceed if expected inflation were in the monetary policy rule

(3.4) as suggested by Huang et al. (2001); whether use of expected inflation generates

substantively different results remains to be seen. A similar statement applies to the output gap.

        The term in the real exchange rate (q is key to this study. To interpret this term, begin by

noting that I sidestep altogether any questions about levels of variables, to focus on variability.

Let me temporarily restore the levels, by rewriting (3.4) as follows:



(3.4)N it - EtBt+1 = natural real interest rate + ((B-1)(EtBt+1 - inflation target) +

                        (y(log GDP - log potential output) + (q(qt - equilibrium value of qt) + umt.




We see in (3.4)N that this reaction function, which was also used in Clarida et al. (1998) and

Engel and West (2002), allows the monetary authority to lean against the transitory movements

in the real exchange rate. The larger is (q, then, the more does monetary policy attempt to lean

against such transitory movements. (Whether it is reasonable to allow reaction to


                                                   9
contemporaneous real exchange rates is discussed briefly below.) The empirical work proceeds

essentially by tracing out how variations in (q affect volatility of output, inflation, interest rates

and the real exchange rate.

         In this empirical work, I abstract altogether from thorny questions about the determinants

of the quantities present in (3.4)N but not (3.4) (i.e., the natural real interest rate, inflation target,

potential output and equilibrium value of the real exchange rate).        The empirical work relies on

the Bank’s staff to construct potential output and the equilibrium real exchange rate, and

assumes the other quantities are constants, set equal to the mean value in the sample. It is

technically feasible to use other deterministic models (trends, or step functions, for example)

rather than constants, but I did not do so.

         The next equation is interest parity (2.3), but written in real form, and with an exogenous

risk premium shock urt:



(3.5)    it - i*t - (EtBt+1-EtB*t+1) = Etqt+1 - qt + urt.



Equation (3.5) is obtained by subtracting EtBt+1-EtB*t+1 / Etpt+1-pt - (Etp*t+1-p*t ) from both sides of

(2.3).

         Note that the current values of it and qt appear in the monetary rule (3.4) and in interest

parity (3.5). The model will be solved under the assumption that the quarterly interest rate can

be set to react to the contemporaneous real exchange rate, even while the exchange rate is

reacting to interest rate movements. There are at least two reasons why one might find it

objectionable to allow the current value of the exchange rate in the monetary policy rule. The


                                                            10
first is one familiar from recent literature on Taylor rules, namely, that data on price levels,

which are required to compute a real exchange rate, are not available contemporaneously.

        The second reason, which is probably more important for the present study, is that it is

questionable that the monetary authority can react to the exchange rate (equation (3.4)) as

rapidly as the exchange rate reacts to monetary policy (one interpretation of equation (3.5)).

Specifically, with a monetary rule in the form (3.4), it is possible for the monetary authority to

achieve very low variability in the real exchange rate by setting (q very high relative to (B and

(y. Of course, the same applies to inflation when (B is set very high relative to (y and (q, or to

output when (y is set very high relative to (B and (q. But the implication may be tolerable for

variables like inflation and output, in that these variables move relatively sluggishly in the

intervals between monetary policy decisions. But it is difficult to argue that exchange rates move

sluggishly between interest rate decisions. This suggests a bound on the Bank’s ability to lower

variability in exchange rates, a bound that may not be well captured in a model that (as just

stated) allows interest rates to react to exchange rates as rapidly as exchange rates react to

interest rates. So for this reason as well the results presented here likely understate the cost of

achieving a given reduction in exchange rate volatility.

        To return to the model: equations (3.2) -(3.5) are four equations in seven variables: the

four New Zealand variables yt, Bt, it and qt and the three foreign variables y*t , B*t , and i*t . To close

the model requires three more equations. I do not attempt to model the three foreign variables,

but instead assume simply that they follow exogenous processes:



(3.6)   y*t = u*yt,


                                                    11
(3.7)   B*t = uB* t,

(3.8)   i*t = u*it.



B. The monetary policy rule and volatility trade-offs

        Is there indeed a cost to stabilizing the real exchange rate? Might it be that setting (q>0

leads to greater stability in not only the real exchange rate but also in output, inflation and

interest rates? These questions are prompted by the observation that optimal control typically

requires a response to all state variables. So even if the Reserve Bank were interested only in

inflation stability, it could in principle achieve greater inflation stability with an interest rate rule

that responds not only to output and inflation but also to the real exchange rate. If the inflation

stabilizing choice involves a positive (q, as assumed above, then the additional term in qt will be

beneficial rather than costly in terms of inflation volatility.

        The aim of this paper is to use the data to supply an answer to the questions at the

beginning of the preceding paragraph. But in simplified versions of the model, it is possible to

answer the question analytically. And even in simplified versions, the answer is: it depends.

Whether a monetary rule expanded to include a term (qt lessens or exacerbates volatility in other

variables depends on variances of shocks and parameter values. Rather than catalog the

dependence exhaustively, let me illustrate with two examples. I worked through both examples

in a simplified setting in which all shocks are i.i.d. (not plausible empirically, but tractable

analytically). The aim is to distinguish the implications for volatility of the real exchange rate q,

output y, inflation B and the interest rate i of (q>0 vs. (q=0.

        Consider first the response to a positive shock to the risk premium urt. For both (q=0 and


                                                   12
for (q>0, the impact effect of this shock is for qt, yt, Bt and it to rise. This is intuitive: an

increase in exchange rate risk causes the currency to depreciate, which in turn is associated with

a rise in output and inflation. For both (q=0 and (q>0, the monetary rule (3.4) causes interest

rates to rise in response. But for (q>0, interest rates respond more strongly. The stronger

interest response means that, in equilibrium, the responses of qt, yt and Bt are less for (q>0 than

for (q=0. Thus the rule with (q>0 lessens volatility of y and B (and of course q) but increases

volatility of i.

        As a second example, consider instead the effect of positive IS shock uyt, interpreted in

Galí and Moncaelli (2002) as an increase in productivity in the home country (New Zealand, in

the present application) relative to abroad. For both (q=0 and for (q>0, qt falls (appreciation),

yt, Bt and it rise. The effects on qt, yt and Bt are intuitively expected; the rise in it is necessary to

maintain interest parity. The equilibrium increase in it is less for (q>0 than for (q=0 (because qt

falls). So volatility of it is lower for (q>0. Consequently, volatility of yt and Bt increases.

        These two examples illustrate that one cannot tell a priori whether the addition of the

term (qt to the monetary policy rule will lessen or increase volatility of other variables. For the

effect on volatility of output, inflation and interest rates is directly opposite for the two shocks:

                           Volatility more (+) or less (-) for (q>0 than for (q=0?
                                   i      y       B        q
        Risk premium shock         +      -       -        -
        IS shock                   -      +       +        -


The volatility of q is unambiguously lessened by including (qt in the monetary rule. The

previous analysis illustrates that whether inclusion of the term lessens or increases volatility of

other variables depends on the variances of the shocks and on model parameters. Even in an


                                                    13
i.i.d. world, one would have to turn to data to decide the sign of the change in volatility of

output, inflation and interest rates. (N.B.: the point of this subsection is illustration, and not

development of a complete set of comparative statics results that could be used to interpret the

empirical results. In presentation of results, I will have occasion to refer to this subsection only

to remind the reader that real exchange rate smoothing may result in either increases or decreases

of volatility of other variables.)

C. Model solution and identification

        Define the (7×1) vectors Xt and Ut as



(3.9)   Xt / (yt, Bt, it, qt, y*t , B*t , i*t )N, Ut /(uyt, uBt, uit, urt, u*yt, uB* t, u*it)N.



With suitable definitions of (7×7) matrices A1 and A0, the system (3.2)-(3.8) may be written as



(3.10) A1EtXt+1 + A0Xt = Ut.



        The form of the solution to (3.10) depends on the nature of the shock process Ut. It is

easily seen from (3.10), for example, that if Ut is i.i.d., then one solution is Xt i.i.d., with Xt =

A0- 1Ut and EtXt+1=0. Clearly if this model is to pick up serial correlation that is manifest in

aggregate data, the shock Ut will have to be serially correlated. An assumption that is

technically manageable, and leads to serial correlation in Xt that is roughly what we see in the

data, is that Ut follows a vector autoregression of order 1:




                                                                 14
(3.11) Ut = MUt-1 + Wt.



Here, M is the (7×7) matrix of autoregressive coefficients M and Wt is the serially uncorrelated

(7×1) vector of innovations in Ut.

       It may be shown that (3.10) and (3.11) imply that Xt also follows a vector AR(1), say



(3.12) Xt = FXt-1 + Vt.



Here, F depends on both the parameters of the model embedded in A0 and A1 (that is, on "y*, "q,

$B, $y, (B, (y, (q) and the serial correlation parameters M; the serially uncorrelated shock Vt is a

linear transformation of the shock vector Wt, with the parameters of the transformation again

dependent on both the model parameters and M. See the Appendix.

       Clearly one can estimate F and the variance-covariance matrix of Vt by least squares. The

strategy I take to identify the model is to assume values for the model parameters "y*, "q, $B, $y,

(B, (y, (q, and let the data tell me what values of the serial correlation matrix M and the

variance-covariance matrix of Wt are consistent with the estimates of F and EVtVtN. The values I

impose on the model parameters are ones that are presumed to apply during the period of

estimation. For example, I set the monetary policy parameter (q to zero on the thought that

exchange rate smoothing has not played a detectable role in New Zealand monetary policy

during my sample. At any rate, given the assumed values, one can map the estimates of F and of

the variance-covariance matrix of Vt into estimates of M and of the variance-covariance matrix of

Wt. I allow M to be unrestricted–that is, I do not attempt restrictions conventional in calibration


                                                 15
work, such as univariate AR(1) processes for all shocks. My aim is to well-capture the dynamic

behavior of the data, recognizing since all the dynamics are in the shocks I provide an

accounting but not an economic explanation of the persistence in the data.

       I also do not attempt to test for or impose unit roots or cointegrating relations (though this

setup in principle allows M to have eigenvalues with unit modulus). Rather, I take it as a priori

reasonable that the variables here are stationary, though mean reversion might be quite slow.

       To trace out the effects of alternative policies to smooth exchange rates, I vary (q in

(3.4), holding fixed other model parameters and the serial correlation matrix M. This allows me

to solve for how F and Vt would have varied, had the Reserve Bank of New Zealand followed a

policy with alternative parameters. (Formulas are in the Appendix.) To summarize variation in

F and Vt, I report implied standard deviations around steady state of New Zealand interest rates,

output, inflation and the real exchange rate. My presumption is that if the variations in policy

are suitably modest, serial correlation parameters and steady state values can reasonably be held

fixed while policy parameters are varied. And similarly for the model parameters in the IS and

Phillips curves. By construction, variations in (q will not affect standard deviations of foreign

variables, since y*t , B*t and i*t by assumption evolve exogenously (equations (3.6)-(3.8)).



                                     4. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

A. Data

       The data are quarterly, 1992:1-2002:3. Specific variables (names from the Bank’s model

or data series given in quotes when applicable) are:




                                                  16
       y (NZ output gap: “gap”): the output gap

       B (NZ inflation): headline CPI inflation

       i (NZ interest rate: “r90d”): 90 day bank bill rate

       q (real exchange rate: “z”): five country trade weighted index, constructed with GDP

       deflators

       y* (foreign output gap: “gaprow”): fourteen country trade weighted output gap

       B* (foreign inflation: “cpirow”): five country trade weighted CPI

       i* (foreign interest rate): five country trade weighted 90 day interest rates



In q, B* and i*, the five countries are: Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Germany/Euro

area and Japan. In y*, the fourteen countries are: United States, Japan, Germany, France, United

Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and

Taiwan.

       Figure 2 plots the data from 1986-2002, with a vertical line denoting the start of the 1992

sample that I use. Note that the scale in the graphs is different; interest rates i and inflation B

generally are higher in New Zealand than in the foreign country (i* and B*). Note as well that

the exchange rate series is plotted in levels, but appears in logs in the regressions.

       The figure suggests that the data are generally slowly mean reverting. Indeed, one reason

for beginning the sample in 1992 rather than 1986 was to avoid having to model the downward

trend in New Zealand inflation B and interest rates i. But even in the post-1992 sample, the

figures suggest that mean reversion has been more honored in the breach than in the observance

for some variables, including in particular the foreign interest rate i* and the New Zealand output


                                                  17
gap y. The empirical work implicitly interprets the seeming trend in these variables as a

reflection of a small sample, since this work assumes the data are stationary around a constant

mean. Alternative treatments of trends would be desirable, but are not considered in this paper.

B. VAR Results

        The estimates of the first order vector autoregression in (yt, Bt, it, qt, y*t , B*t , i*t )N is reported

in Table 1. Predictably, lagged dependent variables typically earn coefficients that are

numerically large and statistically significant, with the peculiar exceptions of inflation Bt and

foreign inflation B*t . As one would expect, there is more evidence that foreign variables Granger

cause New Zealand variables than vice versa: B*t Granger causes Bt (t-value of 0.37/0.11 . 3.4)

and i*t Granger causes it (t-value of 0.32/.12 . 2.7). The New Zealand output gap yt does Granger

cause the foreign output gap(t-value of .09/.04 .2.3), perhaps a manifestation of what Bank

economists have described to me as a tendency for the New Zealand output gap to have led the

foreign output gap in recent years. The real exchange rate is statistically significant in the

inflation and interest rate equations with numerically small coefficients of 0.05 and -0.02.

        Most other coefficients are numerically small and statistically insignificant, suggesting a

population value of zero or thereabouts; such zeroes would be rationalized in the model

described in section 2 by a particular pattern of zeroes in the matrix M (defined in 3.11).

        (We do see some nonzero coefficients on variables other than own lags in the equations

for the foreign variables y*t , B*t and i*t . To clarify, such nonzero coefficients in the equations for

foreign variables are rationalized by multivariate linkages between the various shocks. For

example, let us use the estimates in Table 1 and the formulas in the Appendix to construct the

equation for the exogenous process for foreign inflation B*t (defined in (3.7)). Then the result


                                                      18
happens to be



(4.1)   uB* t = 0.06uyt-1 - 0.43uBt-1 - 0.14umt-1 + 0.04urt-1 + 0.94u*yt-1 - 0.50uB* t-1 + 0.62u*it-1 + wB* t.



[Standard errors not available.] Unsurprisingly, the large coefficients on u*yt-1 and u*it-1 are

associated with large coefficients on y*t-1 and i*t-1 in the B*t equation reported in Table 1.)

C. Effects of alternative monetary policy rules

        Alternative values for the parameters "y*, "q, "r, $B, $y, (B, (y, and (q are presented in

Table 2. My aim is to choose values more or less consistent with the structural models used at

the RBNZ. My understanding is that one or more RBNZ models use a within-quarter elasticity

of the New Zealand output gap with respect to world output of 1.5, with respect to the real

exchange rate of about 0.15–hence the values for "y* and "q. These models find it difficult to

find a within-quarter effect of the interest rate, but there is some evidence that the elasticity may

be as high as 0.5, so I set "r=0 or "r=0.5. (Of course, even with "r=0 monetary policy affects

output: given time series for foreign variables y*t , B*t and i*t , equations (3.2)-(3.5) determine the

values of yt, Bt, it and qt simultaneously.) Setting $B=0.99 is consistent with quarterly calibration

of the Calvo model, and, more generally, with a more or less long run vertical Phillips curve.

The value $y=0.1-0.2 is consistent with my understanding of estimates of the short run slope of

the Phillips curve in New Zealand. The monetary policy parameters ((B=1.5, (y=0.5 and (q=0)

seem, I am told, to do as good a job as any if New Zealand monetary policy is to be described via

a Taylor rule (Drew and Plantier (2000) and Plantier and Scrimgeour (2002)).

        Panel A of Table 3 reports actual standard deviations of the data. The other panels of


                                                      19
Table 3 report the results of varying (q, the reaction coefficient on the real exchange rate in the

monetary policy rule (3.4). Panel B reports detailed results for parameter set A. As (q increases,

the volatility of q of course falls. According to the estimates, if (q had been set to 0.07–a value

consistent with some of the estimates for G7 countries in Clarida et al. (1998)–the volatility of q

would have fallen by 24%, from 10.94 to 8.34. The price paid for a smoother exchange rate is an

11% increase in output volatility (from 1.55 to 1.72), a 2% increase in inflation volatility (from

1.13 to 1.16) and a 18% increase in interest rate volatility (from 1.58 to 1.98). (These are

standard deviations centered around steady state values–around long run equilibrium real

exchange rate, potential output, target inflation, and average interest rate. And–to repeat an

important point already made in the introduction–it is the welfare effects of exchange rate

targeting, and not volatility per se, that is the appropriate metric to measure the desirability of

targeting.)

       To facilitate interpretation, I present results for other specifications when (q has been set

at a value that decreases volatility of q by about 25%. Results for all three parameter sets are

given in Table 3C; the results for parameter set A repeat what is in panel B. The results are

broadly consistent across parameter sets.

       The results may be contrasted with those of Brook and Stephens (2002) and Lam (2003).

Brook and Stephens (2002) use the Reserve Bank’s FPS model to consider the effect of adding

to that model’s reaction function a term that smooths real exchange rates. Brook and Stephens

do not present standard deviations. But they interpret some impulse responses as suggesting that

such smoothing would induce “significantly” greater volatility in inflation, while yielding less

volatility in not only real exchange rates but perhaps interest rates as well.


                                                  20
        Lam (2003) builds on Hunter (2001) in using a calibrated version of Svensson’s (2000)

open economy model. His estimates vary widely across specifications. In one set of results (top

panel of Table 3 on p10 of Lam (2003)), reducing real exchange rate variability by 15% causes

the variability of other variables to skyrocket: the standard deviation of inflation more than

triples, that of output increases by 50%, that of the nominal interest rate doubles. (This panel

only present results for a reductions in real exchange rate variability of 15% or less.) In two

other sets of results (middle and bottom panels of Table 3 on p10 of Lam 2003), reducing real

exchange rate variability by 25% causes the standard deviations of inflation and output to

increase by perhaps 5-20%, while that of the interest rate falls by about 15-20%. (Recall from

the discussion in section 3 that even in this paper’s model, an attempt to smooth exchange rates

can lessen interest rate volatility as well, depending on the source of shocks.)

        These results seem broadly consistent with those presented here, in the sense of

suggesting a substantial volatility cost would be paid for smoothing real exchange rates. There

is, however, an uncomfortably wide range of results (would interest rates be more or less

variable if exchange rates were smoothed?). This underscores the imprecision of our

understanding of the terms of the tradeoff between real exchange rate stability and stability of

other variables.



                                         5. CONCLUSIONS

        The simple model used in this paper delivers rough estimates of the cost of using interest

rate policy to smooth real exchange rate movements. The cost is measured in terms of increased

volatility of inflation, output and interest rates. Specifically, it is estimated that a 25% fall in the


                                                   21
standard deviation of the real exchange rate can be accomplished at the price of increases in the

standard deviations of output of about 10-15%, of inflation volatility by about 0-15% and of

interest rate volatility by about 15-40%.

       The empirical work abstracts from well-known difficulties with uncovered interest parity,

assuming that whatever shocks to interest parity occurred during the sample would have also

occurred had the Bank been following an alternative interest rate policy. As well, the model is

highly simplified and stylized, for example not distinguishing between domestic and overall

inflation. Finally, the model makes assumptions that quite likely lead to an understatement of

the cost to the RBNZ of exchange rate stabilization. Specifically, the model assumes that the

RBNZ knows the equilibrium value of the real exchange rate, and can react to exchange rate

movements as quickly as the exchange rate reacts to interest rate movements. A priority for

future research is relaxation of such assumptions. This would lead to higher costs associated

with any given level of real exchange rate smoothing.

                                           APPENDIX

         This appendix presents formulas linking the reduced form and structural equations.

Those equations are repeated here for convenience:

(A.1) Structural equations: A1EtXt+1 + A0Xt = Ut, Ut = MUt-1 + Wt, EWtWtN=SW,

(A.2) Reduced form equations: Xt = FXt-1 + Vt, EVtVtN/SV.

         To solve for reduced form parameter matrix F and shock Vt given the structural

parameters A1, A0, M and SW, guess a solution of the form

(A.3) Xt=DUt,

where D is a matrix to be determined. Upon using (A.3) and (A.3) led one period in (A.1), we

obtain

(A.4) A1DM + A0 = I,

which can be used to solve for D. Upon combining (A.2) and (A.3), we see that

(A.5) F = DMD-1, Vt=DWt.

         To work from the reduced form to the structure: given A1 and A0, whose values are

imposed a priori, and least squares estimates F^ and S
                                                     ^                      ^     ^
                                                       V, the solutions for M and SW are:

(A.6) D^ = (A1F+A
              ^    -1 ^   ^ -1 ^ ^ ^ ^ -1 ^ ^ -1
                 0) , M = D FD, SW = D SVD N.

Notes:

1. Variable definitions are given in Table 1.

2. (q is the coefficient on the real exchange rate in the monetary rule (2.4), it = (BBt + (yyt + (qqt
+ umt. The standard deviations in the (q=0 line of panel B match those in panel A by
construction, because it is assumed that during the estimation period, the rule was followed with
(q=0.

3. The negative sign in the q column in panel 3C means that the volatility of q has fallen.
