                                            ABSTRACT

       By reducing risk of large out-of-pocket medical expenses, comprehensive social health
insurance may reduce households’ motivation to engage in precautionary behaviors such as
saving, procurement of private insurance, and spousal labor-force participation. We use the
natural experiment provided by the 1995 introduction of National Health Insurance in Taiwan to
examine these effects, using pre-existing differences in access to health insurance (tied to the
household head’s and spouse’s joint employment status) to identify the effects of increasing
insurance coverage. We find that comprehensive health insurance has a statistically significant
and large effect on household savings and purchase of private accident insurance, but no
significant effect on spousal employment.

I. Introduction

       Over the last century, both developed and developing countries have implemented
a wide range of social insurance programs.1 The introduction, expansion and reform of
these programs raise important questions about the effects of the programs on the
behavior of economic agents. One important question is the extent to which these
programs crowd out private precautionary behaviors, such as saving, purchasing private
insurance, or sending other household members to work.
       Understanding the motivations for household precautionary behaviors and the
relationship with insurance has important policy implications. If precautionary motives
are significant, economic models that ignore them, such as simple life-cycle models, will
tend to miscalculate the optimal size of government policy. Hubbard et al. (1995)
demonstrated the importance of accounting for precautionary savings to explain the
effects of asset-based, means-tested social insurance on patterns in wealth accumulation.
In the presence of precautionary motives, government policy may have unintended
effects on individuals’ welfare. For example, it may increase efficiency by pooling health
risks through insurance rather than relying on individuals’ precautionary saving, since
those who reduce consumption today may not necessarily be ill in the future.2
       While using theoretical models incorporating precautionary motives to explain
economic behaviors when social insurance programs are introduced is appealing, the
limited empirical work that is available provides mixed evidence about the strength of
precautionary motives.3 The difficulty that researchers typically face is that the variation
of insurance programs owned by individuals is inevitably correlated with the individuals’
unobserved preferences. For example, those who are highly risk-averse are more likely to

1
  U.S. examples include social security, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, and
Medicare.
2
  For example, Gruber (1997) found strong evidence that unemployment insurance
smooths individual consumption. Gertler and Gruber (2001) found that households in
developing countries are not able to fully insure their consumption; their results suggest
larger welfare gains in terms of consumption smoothing from public subsidies for
medical care.

have better health insurance and engage in various precautionary behaviors. Instrumental
variables based on arbitrary exclusion restrictions (such as occupation or education) may
provide no solution since these variables are likely to be correlated with personal
preferences. This paper contributes to this emerging literature by providing empirical
evidence on the impact of a significant change in social health insurance on households’
precautionary behaviors in Taiwan. Specifically, we will examine the effects of health
insurance on households’ saving, purchase of accident insurance, and spousal labor
supply.
          We exploit a unique natural experiment. In March 1995, the Taiwan government
inaugurated National Health Insurance to cover health expenses for the entire population.
Prior to implementation, there were three major health insurance programs—Government
Employee’s Insurance, Labor Insurance, and Farmer Health Insurance, which were tied to
employment status. Only Government Employee’s Insurance provided coverage to the
insured’s spouse, children and parents. The introduction of the comprehensive NHI
coverage had a smaller impact on households where at least one spouse worked in the
government sector and could obtain insurance coverage for the entire household before
NHI. By comparing changes in behavior between households with no government
employees and households with at least one government employee, we are able to
identify the impact of NHI. This is a difference-in-differences strategy.4 Moreover, we
employ a unique data set to exploit the underlying variation in benefits across households
within treatment and control groups. Unlike the difference-in-differences method, this
strategy allows us to take full advantage of the variation of insurance benefits within
households at a point in time and to calculate the elasticity of response to the change in
insurance benefits.




3
  For example, Guiso et al. (1992) and Dynan (1993) found no support for the
precautionary motive, while Skinner (1988), Carroll and Samwick (1998) and Kazarosian
(1997) found more support for the precautionary view.
4
  Chou, Liu and Hammitt (forthcoming) use the difference-in-differences method to
estimate the impacts of NHI on saving behavior in Taiwan. Their results suggest that the
precautionary motive is an important determinant of household saving and consumption
behaviors, and that NHI causes a considerable reduction in private saving.

                                                 4
       Since insurance benefits could vary because of underlying tastes, the natural
experiment described above allows us to use the husband-wife joint employment status as
an instrument for insurance benefits and thus to identify the causal relationship between
insurance and household’s precautionary behaviors. Two factors suggest these
instruments are likely to be valid. First, the dramatic expansion of National Health
Insurance significantly increased the insurance benefits for households with no
government employees. Second, the expansion of NHI is very likely uncorrelated with
households’ behaviors. As detailed below, although the development of NHI was
predicated on concerns about rising health-care costs and access to care, the timing of
implementation was determined by political factors unrelated to changes in health-care
markets.
       Our analyses are based on the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE)
from 1993 to 1999. This survey contains individuals’ labor market status together with
detailed information on consumption and saving. The survey also contains information on
insurance benefits received by each household.
       Our results suggest that households have strong precautionary motives. Therefore,
the introduction of comprehensive health insurance significantly reduces households’
saving and crowds out private purchase of accident insurance. However, sending other
family members to work is not found to be related to the precautionary motives.
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides
background on health insurance programs in Taiwan and a brief review of the theoretical
background and the related empirical literature. Section 3 describes our identification
strategy and data. Section 4 discusses the empirical strategy. Section 5 reports the
estimation results and Section 6 concludes.

II. Background

A. Social Insurance Programs in Taiwan

       National Health Insurance (NHI) was inaugurated in Taiwan in March 1995. NHI
dramatically expanded the insured fraction of the population, from 57 percent in 1994 to
92 percent in 1995 and 96 percent in 2000. The timing of the reform was heavily
influenced by political factors. In 1984, the Council for Economic Planning and

                                                 5
Development recommended a national health insurance scheme to be phased-in by the
year 2000. In 1986, the Premier declared the objective of “health insurance for all by the
year 2000” in his statement to the Legislative Yuan (Congress). However, with the rapid
growth of political participation and the growth of the opposing Democratic Progressive
Party in the 1980s, in February 1989 the Premier strategically announced the new target
year for implementing a national health insurance scheme to be 1995. Foreseeing an
election of Legislative Yuan representatives in December 1995 and the first Presidential
election in March 1996, the ruling party (Kuomingtung) mobilized its legislators to pass
the NHI Law in July 1994. NHI was fully implemented by March 1, 1995, so that the
chaos resulting from implementation might vanish prior to the elections.5 Thus, although
the initiation of universal health insurance was motivated by concerns about health-care
expenses, the timing of the policy was driven by politics. Therefore, the implementation
of NHI was likely to be uncorrelated with households’ economic behaviors.
       Prior to implementation of NHI, health insurance was available through three
government-sponsored programs – Labor Insurance (LI), Government Employees’
Insurance (GEI), and Farmer Health Insurance (FHI). There was virtually no private
health insurance, with the exception of supplementary coverage for selected conditions
such as cancer or accident. With the exception of GEI, these programs provided very
little coverage for family members of the employed individual. As a result, the majority
of the uninsured were children under 14 years of age and adults over 65.6
       The first social insurance program, Labor Insurance (LI), was promulgated in
1950 and initially provided only cash benefits, payable for maternity, injury or sickness,
disability, old age, and death. Compensation for inpatient and outpatient medical
expenses were added in 1956 and 1970, respectively.7 LI was compulsory for five
categories of workers between the ages of 15 and 60.8 The premium was 6 – 8 percent of

  Peabody et al. (1995) and Cheng and Chiang (1997) provide detailed descriptions of the
health insurance programs.

  Unemployment benefits were added in 1999.
8
  Those workers included (1) workers employed by mine, a company or firm, a
journalistic, cultural, or non-profit cooperative enterprise with more than five employees;
(2) employees of government offices or public or private schools who are not legally

                                                 6
monthly salary, 80 percent of which was paid by the employer and 20 percent by the
worker. Since 1995, medical care benefits for ordinary injury or sickness are covered by
the National Health Insurance program, while medical costs from occupational injuries
are still paid by the Labor Insurance program. Labor Insurance did not offer any benefits
to the insured’s spouse or other dependents. Self-employed workers (who account for a
large share of the Taiwan labor force9) could obtain Labor Insurance only if they were
members of an occupational union.
       Government Employees’ Insurance (GEI) was implemented in 1958 and provided
benefits including maternity, injury or sickness, disability, old age and death as well as
dependents’ funeral allowance. Spouses, parents, and children of government employees
gained coverage for injury and sickness under Health Insurance for Government
Employees’ Dependents Insurance in 1982, 1989 and 1992, respectively. Retired
government employees and their dependents became eligible for injury and sickness
benefits in 1985. The premium rate was 3 – 5 percent of the salary, of which 35 percent
was paid by the employee and 65 percent by the government.
       Farmers’ Health Insurance (FHI) was established in 1985 and implemented in
1989. Under this program, mandatory coverage was provided to members of farmers’
associations. Farmers who were above 15 year of age could participate in the program.
Insurance benefits included maternity, injury or sickness, disability and death benefits
and burial subsidy. Insured members paid 30 percent of the cost, while the government
paid 70 percent. The labor insurance and farmer insurance participants received
physicians’ services through hospitals or clinics that contracted with the programs.
       Beginning in 1990, the government also provided health insurance, including
maternity benefits and injury and sickness benefits, to low-income households.10



entitled to join civil servants’ insurance or the insurance of teachers and employees of
private schools; (3) workers employed in fishing production; (4) persons receiving
vocational training in vocational training institutes registered with the government and
(5) members of an occupational union and Fishermen who have no definite employer or
who are self-employed.
9
  For example, in 1999, 16 percent of employed persons were self-employed.
10
   The government sets the “monthly minimum expenses” adjusted by the consumer price
index and regional variation in income each fiscal year to determine eligibility for low-
income households. For fiscal year 2001, for example, the monthly minimum expenses

                                                 7
Insurance premiums were paid by the government in full. In 1991, 50.3 percent of the
population was covered by health insurance, of which 34.2 percent was covered under
Labor Insurance, 5.3 percent under Government Employees’ Insurance (with 0.6 percent
under Retired Government Employees’ Insurance), 7.9 percent under Farmer Health
Insurance, and 0.5 percent under Low-Income Households’ Health Insurance.11
         Beginning March 1, 1995, all social insurance-contracted facilities were
transferred automatically to hospitals and clinics contracted with the NHI program. By
1996, the Bureau of National Health Insurance contracted with 97 percent of the hospitals
and 90 percent of the clinics. The NHI provides uniform comprehensive benefits, and is
financed by payroll taxes and general revenues. By law, all citizens are required to
participate in NHI. Insurance coverage is similar to the original social programs with
some expansion for severe illnesses and home health care.
         The principal source of finance is a payroll tax. The government share of the
premium varies among the insured groups. For government employees and their
dependents, the insurer and the government pay 40 percent and 60 percent of the
premium, respectively. For private employees and their dependents, the insured and the
employer pay 30 percent and 60 percent of the premium, and the government covers the
remaining 10 percent. For the self-employed and their dependents, and for persons who
do not fit into any working group, the insured pays 60 percent and the government pays
40 percent. For farmers and dependents, the insured pays 30 percent and the government
70 percent. For low income families, the government pays the entire premium (Chiang,
1997).

B. Theoretical Background and Previous Studies

         Households can insure against or adapt to future economic downturns in a variety
of ways, including precautionary saving, purchasing commercial life and accident
insurance, sending children or spouses to work, or moving in with extended family when


are US$337 in Taipei City, US$265 in Kaohsiung City, and US$220 in Taiwan Province.
Families whose average monthly income is below this amount are classified as low-
income. In 2000, only 0.6 percent of the population was considered members of low-
income families (http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/yearbook).



                                                 8
adversity occurs. With the availability of comprehensive health insurance to reduce
unexpected medical expenditures, households may face less financial risk and may
respond by reducing their precautionary behaviors.
        Implementation of National Health Insurance might affect households’ saving
decisions through two pathways: a precautionary motive and an income (or
redistribution) effect. By reducing uncertainty about the magnitude of future out-of-
pocket health expenditures, comprehensive health insurance can substantially reduce the
demand for precautionary saving. If it reduces a household’s expected medical expenses
(net of premiums and taxes to cover the program), NHI may also increase disposable
income, and thus increase household saving.
        Several studies provide evidence of a negative correlation between social health
insurance and saving or wealth holdings. Using simulation, Kotlikoff (1989) showed that
saving is smallest when public health insurance is available and largest when individuals
have to self-insure against unexpected health expenditures. Kantor and Fishback (1996)
found that the introduction of workers’ compensation reduces private saving by
approximately 25 percent. Engen and Gruber (2001) also showed that unemployment
insurance leads to a significant reduction in asset accumulation. Only Starr-McCluer
(1996) found a positive effect of health-insurance coverage on wealth holdings, even
after controlling for the potential selection effect.
        Intuitively, households without access to comprehensive health insurance have a
stronger incentive to purchase other forms of insurance that will reduce their exposure to
financial risk, such as accident insurance.12 Thus, the implementation of NHI, by
reducing the risk of future medical expenditures, may crowd out private purchase of
accident insurance. In other contexts, Kantor and Fishback (1996) found that the presence
of workers’ compensation at least partially crowds out private accident insurance, and
Cutler and Gruber (1996) suggested that the increase in Medicaid coverage was
associated with a reduction in private insurance coverage. Alternatively, the introduction

National Defense hospitals.




                                                   9
of NHI may increase the private purchase of supplemental insurance by promoting health
knowledge in the general public or by improving information flow in the market.13
       Another potential response to the absence of health insurance is to increase labor
supply by other family members.14 As the labor supply of secondary earners is usually
more elastic to household income, the introduction of NHI, by increasing the insurance
benefits which are independent of employment status, may affect spousal labor supply.
Chou and Staiger (2000) found that the availability of social health insurance reduced
spousal labor force participation in Taiwan, and other studies have found that the
availability of spousal health insurance leads married women to work fewer hours
(Olson, 1998; Buchmueller and Valletta, 1999). Similarly, Cullen and Gruber (2000)
found that unemployment insurance reduces spousal labor supply.

III. Identification Strategy and Data

A. Identification Strategy

       Our estimation strategy compares the changes in household precautionary
behaviors associated with the introduction of NHI between two types of households:
those covered by GEI, who experienced virtually no difference in insurance coverage
before and after NHI, and those covered by other programs, who experienced an
expansion of coverage for household members. Before NHI, if at least one spouse
worked in the government sector, the other spouse, children, and parents could be
covered under the extended insurance program. We use households with at least one
government-employed spouse as our control group (Group G).
       Based on the variations in insurance benefits available to households before NHI,
we divide households with no government employees (“non-government employed




12
   The effects of the magnitude of one financial risk on an individual’s willingness to
incur other risks are complex, and have been investigated by Pratt and Zeckhauser
(1987), Kimball (1993), and Gollier and Pratt (1996), among others.
13
   For example, Gertler et. al. (1994) found that information limitations reduce the
demand for supplement Medical insurance.
14
   Gruber and Madrian (2002) surveyed the literature and found that health insurance
appears to be an important factor in the labor supply decision of married women.

                                                10
households”) into five treatment groups according to their current employment status.15
Households in the treatment groups received less generous benefits before NHI, and so
the introduction of NHI should have had more significant impacts on these households’
precautionary behaviors. Group PP consists of households where both household head
and spouse work in the private sector. These households could obtain Labor Insurance for
the head and spouse, but not for dependents. Group PN includes households where only
the head works in the private sector and the spouse is either not in the labor force or
unemployed. Similar to Group PP, the household head was covered under Labor
Insurance, but benefits were not extended to other family members. Group F is
agricultural households. These households were covered under Farmer’s Health
Insurance, which provides benefits only to household members who farm (e.g., children
under age 14 were not covered). Group NN consists of non-employed households. This
group is a mixture including retired, low-income households, and other non-employed
households. Retired government employees could obtain health insurance for themselves
and their spouse, but not for other dependents. Low-income households were also
covered by insurance. Other non-employed households would not have access to health
insurance, unless their children or parents had Government Employees’ Insurance.
Finally, Group PS includes households where both the head and spouse are self-
employed, or one is self-employed and another does not work. Self-employed workers
could obtain Labor Insurance only if they are members of an occupational union. Table 1
summarizes our control and treatment groups and their insurance coverage before NHI.

B. Data and Sample

       Our data are from the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE),
conducted each year since 1976 by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, Taiwan. These data have been used by other researchers (e.g. Deaton and
Paxson, 1994a; 1994b; Chou and Staiger, 2001). New samples are drawn each year, so
we cannot track households longitudinally. About 13,000 to 16,000 households are
surveyed and approximately 52,000 to 68,000 civilians aged 15 and above are


15
  As described below, households are sampled independently each year and we are
unable to track households over time.

                                                 11
interviewed each year from 1993 to 1999. The survey contains information on
demographic characteristics, economic status, and industrial sector of employment of
each member of the sampled households. It also includes information on household
income and consumption. Household income includes salaries, entrepreneurial, property,
and transfer income for all household members. Total consumption expenditures include
both durable and nondurable goods. For the household head and spouse, the survey
provides information on individual wage rates and incomes.
       Our observation unit is the household, since the consumption expenditures and
some income measures are collected only at the household level. Our sample is restricted
to households headed by a 20 to 65 year old married person. The final sample consists of
64,967 households, of which 6,662 (10.3 percent) are in the control group (Group G),
11,819 (18.2 percent) are in Group PP, 24,193 (37.2 percent) are in Group PN, 7,068
(10.9 percent) are in Group F, 6,223 (9.6 percent) are in Group NN, and 9,002 (13.9
percent) are in Group PS.
       When estimating spousal labor supply, we restrict attention to households where
the head is employed. The analysis sample contains 50,423 households, of which 6,507
household heads work in the government sector and 43,916 household heads work in
private sector.
       Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2. The control group (G) has the
highest average household income (NT$1,023,000), followed by groups PP, PN, PS, NN
and F. Half of the NN households are headed by a female, while the proportion for the
other groups is less than one quarter. Households in groups F and NN have older heads,
fewer children younger than 18 years old, and more children older than 18. Reflecting the
distribution of population and agriculture in Taiwan, 77 percent of group F resides in the
middle or south of the island, while more than 45 percent of the other groups reside in the
north. Education levels are significantly higher in the control group.

C. Insurance Benefits for Medical Care

       A key feature of the SFIE is the inclusion of insurance benefits under various
social insurance programs. Insurance payments are available in the survey from 1993 to
1999. To distinguish the type of social insurance program available to the households, we
rely on the household head’s and spouse’s employment status. As described in the

                                                12
previous section, after 1995, medical care benefits are offered by NHI but GEI, LI and
FHI continue to provide other non-medical care benefits. The SFIE includes information
on payments from all four insurance programs. Since our interest is the impact of medical
care insurance on precautionary behaviors, only the medical-care insurance benefits are
used in the analysis.
       Each year, the survey imputes injury and sickness benefits for households based
on the household’s age composition and unreleased information on number of physician
visits and number of hospitalizations.16 Average health care insurance benefits covered
under GEI, LI, and FHI were NT$19,870 and NT$24,039 in 1993 and 1994, respectively,
and under NHI were NT$37,969, NT$39,495, NT$42,736, and NT$45,242 in 1996, 1997,
1998 and 1999, respectively.
       Table 3 presents time trends and statistics of health insurance benefits across
control and treatment groups. Agricultural families (Group F) (who are much older on
average) received the highest health insurance benefits (NT$26,890) before NHI,
followed by Groups G and PP. Self-employed households (Group PS) received the
smallest benefits (NT$14,194) and Group NN received the second smallest (NT$19,745).
Roughly 23 percent of households in Groups NN and PS received no benefits. After NHI,
health insurance benefits increased for all households. The largest increases were to non-
employed households (NN) (NT$25,091), followed by Group PS (NT$18,199) and
Group F (NT$17,409). Insurance benefits increased by only NT$2,999 for the control
group G.

IV. Empirical Strategy

A. Difference-in-Differences Estimation

       The 1995 introduction of NHI allows us to exploit the variation with respect to
prior health insurance programs to identify the impact of NHI on households’
precautionary behaviors. The most straightforward approach is to use the difference-in-


16
  Medical care utilization information is available in the data only after NHI. The
information on medical care insurance benefits for each respondent before NHI were
obtained through personal communications with staff at the Directorate-General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan in November 2001.

                                                13
differences (DD) framework. The behavior changes of the control group are assumed to
capture any systematic factors, while the changes in the treatment groups reflect both the
same systematic factors and the impact of the policy intervention. By comparing the
changes of treatment and control groups, we seek to identify the effect of NHI. We omit
the transition year 1995 and pool the control and treatment groups for 1993 – 1994 and
1996 – 1999 to estimate the probit equation:
                               5                           5
                                                                                                              
P(Yijt ) = Φ β 0 + β1 X ijt + ∑ β 2k Tijtk + β 3 NHIijt + ∑ β 4k (Tijtk × NHIijt ) + β 5δ j + β 6τ t + ε ijt  (1)
                              k =1                        k =1                                               

where i indexes household, j indexes geographic region and t indexes year. Y is the
dependent variable, detailed below. X is a vector of observable characteristics, δ is a fixed
regional effect and τ is a fixed year effect. NHI is an indicator for whether the year is
after the policy change (1995), and Tk is a dummy indicating whether the household
belongs to treatment group k. Each coefficient β4k can be interpreted as an estimate of the
impact of the program on a given treatment group.
         We consider three binary dependent variables indicating whether the household
(1) had positive savings, (2) purchased accident insurance, and (3) included an employed
spouse. We also evaluate the effect of NHI on the magnitude of household savings, using
an analogous OLS regression (including households with zero savings). Household
savings is defined as the difference between total household disposable income and
household consumption expenditures. The all-item Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to
convert all money figures to 1991 NT dollars.17 As shown in Table 4, before NHI, 91.0
percent of the control group had positive savings, in contrast to only 78.5 percent of the
NN group. After NHI, the fraction having positive savings remained almost the same in
the control group, but decreased for all the treatment groups. The control group (G) and
group PP increased savings after NHI, possibly due to economic growth during the
period. In contrast, groups F, NN and PS decreased their savings after the policy change.
         The survey asked households the amount paid for accident insurance premiums.
We used this information to create a dummy variable with value one if the household
purchased accident insurance and zero otherwise. In the control group, 64.2 percent

     The average exchange rate was US$1=25.75 New Taiwan dollars (NT$) in 1991.

                                                            14
purchased accident insurance before NHI, while the fraction of treatment group
households purchasing accident insurance ranged between 49.7 percent (Group F) and
76.5 percent (Group PP) (see Table 4). After NHI, the percentage of households
purchasing accident insurance increased for all groups. The increase was much larger for
the control group (18.7 percent) than for the treatment groups (1.7 percent to 4.3 percent).
          Spousal labor force participation is defined as a binary variable which is equal to
one if the spouse works as an employer, employee or self-employed worker in the public
or private sector.18 As show in Table 5, the spousal labor force participation rate of
government households remained the same (63.1 percent) after the NHI reform, while the
rate increased from 42.8 percent to 44.9 percent for the non-government households.
          The variable X in Eq. (1) is a vector of demographic and economic characteristics
of the household to control for any observable differences between households that might
confound the analysis: household disposal income, household head’s education, gender,
age and age squared, spousal education, number of children under age 18, number of
children over age 18, and number of elderly parents or grandparents. Education is
measured by five dummy variables for completion of middle school (9 years of
education), high school (12 years of education), community college (15 years of
education), university (16 years of education), and graduate school (18 years of
education).
          The difference-in-differences approach requires several identifying assumptions.
First, there should be no contemporaneous shocks (other than the NHI program) that
might differentially affect precautionary behaviors of the treatment and control groups.
Second, there should be no differences in the underlying trends in savings, private
purchase of accident insurance, or spousal labor supply between the control and treatment
groups. We discuss the extent to which violations of these assumptions may affect our
results in more detail below.
          One disadvantage of a difference-in-differences strategy is that it does not fully
account for the variation in insurance benefits within the group. In the next subsection,
we describe an improvement to the difference-in-differences approach that exploits the

                                                   15
variations in insurance benefits. This approach is similar to the method used by Gruber
(2000).

B. Parameterized Model and Two-Stage Least Squares Estimation

          Since the survey reports insurance benefits before and after NHI, we are able to

estimate the following regression:

                                 5
                                                                                                  
P (Yijt ) = Φ β 0 + β 1 X ijt + ∑ β 2 k Tijtk + β 3 NHI ijt + β 4 Bijt + β 5δ j + β 6τ t + ε ijt    (2)
                                k =1                                                             

where B represents insurance benefits for medical care and the other variables are as
defined in equation (1). The coefficient β4 estimates the impact of an additional dollar of
insurance benefits on household precautionary behaviors. Although the amount of
benefits are not known to the household ex ante, the amount of benefits may serve as an
indicator of expected benefits, since households have much more information about their
likely medical expenses than is available through the survey.
          The estimated coefficient β4 could be biased and inconsistent if there are omitted
variables which are correlated with both insurance benefits and precautionary behaviors.
For example, we do not have good measures for health. Households with poor health may
receive higher insurance benefits because of more frequent or intensive treatment, and
could also take more precautions to prevent future adverse events. In this case, we may
underestimate the impact of insurance benefits. On the other hand, if households with
poor health (who receive larger insurance benefits) are less able to self-insure against
future economic downturns, then we may overestimate the impact of insurance benefits.
          To resolve the problem of omitted variables, we estimate equation (2) using two-
stage least squares. The natural experiment provides a source of instrumental variables.
After controlling for fixed effects for the five treatment groups (Tk), policy change (NHI),
region (δ) and time (τ), the model can be identified by the variations in insurance
coverage changes after NHI in the treatment groups relative to the control group (Tk
×NHI, k=1,2,3,4,5).
          The first stage results show that the NHI program significantly increased the
insurance benefits received by households in the treatment groups. These results are of


                                                             16
intrinsic interest because they suggest a redistributive effect of NHI toward lower income
groups. The increases in benefits were the largest for group NN (NT$23,064), followed
by groups PS (NT$16,143), F (NT$14,837), PN (NT$10,468) and PP (NT$2,165). These
coefficients are statistically significant at the 1 percent level (except that for PP at 10
percent level). The F-test of joint significance of the five interaction terms is 107.39,
which is significant at the 1 percent level. The partial R2 of the excluded instruments from
the first-stage regression is 0.043, which compares favorably with those reported by
Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995). Weak instruments can cause an IV estimator to have a
large asymptotic bias, but these results suggest that our instrumental variables have
substantial explanatory power regarding insurance benefits.

V. Empirical Results

A. Results on Savings

        The effects of NHI on the probability and magnitude of household savings are
reported in Table 6. We find a negative and highly significant effect of NHI on both
outcomes. The probit estimates imply that NHI reduced the odds of having positive
savings by 7.0 percent for group PS, and by 4.0 percent, 3.4 percent, 2.6 percent and 1.3
percent for groups NN, PN, PP and F, respectively. The OLS estimates imply that NHI
reduced average savings by roughly NT$25,100 for group PS, and by NT$24,100,
NT$22,800, NT$20,400, and NT$15,500 for groups F, NN, PN, and PP, respectively.
These findings suggest that the NHI program has a sizable effect on savings behavior,
which is consistent with a precautionary savings response to reductions in the risk of
medical-care expenditures.
        We also evaluate the marginal effect of the change in insurance benefits on
household savings. As discussed above, insurance benefits could be endogenous due to
omitted health variables. We report both probit/OLS and probit IV/ 2SLS results in Table
7. The results are similar to those of the difference-in-differences approach: household
saving is significantly and negatively related to insurance benefits. The probit estimates
suggest that the probability of positive savings falls 7.2 percent for each NT$100,000 of
insurance benefits. The OLS estimates suggest that savings fall by NT$0.41 for each
NT$1 increase in insurance benefits. The estimated average elasticity is –0.055.

                                                  17
       The two-stage least square estimates suggest stronger effects of insurance
benefits. Using the probit IV estimates, we find that the probability of positive savings
decreases by 13.7 percent for each NT$100,000 of insurance benefits, and that savings
fall by NT$0.84 for each NT$1 increase in insurance benefits (an average elasticity of –
0.113). Kantor and Fishback (1996) used a U.S. household survey for 1917-1919 and
found the introduction of workers’ compensation in the 1910s significantly reduced
workers’ saving. Each dollar increase in expected benefits was associated with a
reduction in saving of $0.56 to $2.24. Gruber and Yelowitz (1999) found that the
Medicaid program lowers asset holdings by 38 to 43 cents for each dollar of Medicaid
eligibility. Over the 1984 –1993 period, the Medicaid expansion lowered wealth holding
by an estimated 18 percent.
       We test the validity of our exclusion restrictions using the test statistics NR2 from
regressing the IV regression residuals on the instruments (treatment group dummies and
NHI dummy interactions) and exogenous variables, where N is the sample size and R2 is
the goodness-of-fit statistic (Staiger and Stock, 1997). The test statistics (χ2=7.59) does
not suggest violation of the overidentification restrictions. This test, together with the
results from the first stage regression, suggests that our instruments are legitimate.
       We can use OLS and 2SLS estimates to measure the net effect of the National
Health Insurance program. The average increases in insurance benefits after NHI are
reported in Table 3. Using the probit estimates, the estimated reductions in the odds of
having positive savings are 1.8 percent, 1.3 percent, 1.3 percent, 0.9 percent and 0.3
percent for groups NN, PS, F, PN, and PP, respectively. Results based on the IV probit
estimates are larger, 3.4 percent, 2.4 percent, 2.4 percent, 1.7 percent and 0.6 percent for
groups NN, PS, F, PN, and PP, respectively. We also find that NHI reduces savings by
between NT$1,776 (PP) and NT$10,161 (NN) based on the OLS estimates, and between
NT$3,671 (PP) and NT$21,001 (NN) based on the 2SLS estimates.

B. Results on Private Purchase of Accident Insurance

       Table 8 reports the estimated effect of NHI on private purchase of accident
insurance. The difference-in-differences estimates suggest that NHI significantly reduces
the purchase of supplementary accident insurance. The estimated decreases are 26.7



                                                 18
percent, 20.8 percent, 20.7 percent, 19.4 percent and 17.6 percent for groups NN, F, PS,
PN, and PP, respectively.
       When considering insurance benefits directly, probit estimates suggest that the
probability of purchasing private accident insurance decreases by 4.2 percent for each
NT$100,000 increase in insurance benefits. The IV probit estimates suggest a
significantly larger effect: the estimated probability of purchasing private accident
insurance falls by 63 percent for each NT$100,000 increase in insurance benefits.
       We can estimate the total effect of NHI on purchase of private accident insurance.
Following the same procedure as for savings above, the OLS estimates imply that NHI
reduced private purchase of accident insurance by 1.1 percent, 0.73 percent, 0.76 percent,
0.53 percent and 0.18 percent for groups NN, F, PS, PN and PP, respectively. The IV
probit estimates imply the reductions were 15.8 percent, 10.9 percent, 11.4 percent, 7.9
percent, and 2.8 percent for groups NN, F, PS, PN and PP, respectively. These results are
consistent with the Kantor and Fishback (1996) study of workplace-accident
compensation in the 1910s and the Cutler and Gruber (1995) study of the Medicaid
program, which also found that social insurance programs crowd out the purchase of
private insurance.

C. Results on Spousal Labor Supply

       The introduction of NHI could also reduce spousal labor supply as one kind of
self-insurance. In contrast to Chou and Staiger (2001), our results reported in Table 9 do
not suggest any significant impact of NHI on spousal labor force participation. One
significant difference between the two studies is that we examine effects over a longer
time period. The Chou and Staiger result may represent a short-run effect, while we
estimate a longer run effect which is not statistically significant. Our results suggest that
the precautionary motive for secondary earners’ to work is very weak. Gruber and
Madrian (2002) concluded from a review of the literature that health insurance is
important for the labor supply decisions of married women. However, all the studies they
review assume that the husband’s health insurance is exogenous to the wife’s labor force
participation, a debatable identification strategy.




                                                  19
D. Comparisons between Estimates from DD, OLS and 2SLS

       Compared with OLS, the two-stage least squares estimates suggest a larger effect
of NHI on households’ behaviors (see Tables 7 and 8). One explanation is that our
instrumental variables provide an estimate for specific groups (PP, PS, F and NN)
affected by the policies. If these non-government-employed households have higher-than-
average marginal responses to insurance benefits, then two-stage least squares estimates
based on the husband-wife joint employment status might yield larger estimates of the
response of increased insurance benefits than the corresponding OLS estimates.19 The
underlying heterogeneous responses to policy point to the weakness of difference-in-
differences and two-stage least squares estimates in that their results may not be
generalized beyond the treatment groups in the study (Meyer, 1995).

E. Alternative Explanations

       The identification strategy used above requires several assumptions. In this
subsection, we consider possible alternative explanations for our findings. If we fail to
find strong evidence for the other possibilities, we will be more confident of our
conclusion that NHI has a significant impact on households’ precautionary behaviors.
       If long-run trends in households’ precautionary behaviors differ between control
and treatment groups, then we may risk interpreting preexisting trends as treatment
effects. We test for this underlying trend by re-estimating the models on data from 1991
to 1994. We construct a new sample of households headed by a 20 to 65 year old married
person with the data from 1991 and 1992 as the “before” period and 1993 and 1994 as the
“after.” Most of the major reforms in government health insurance policies were
implemented before 1990, and there were no major changes around 1993. We estimate
the difference-in-differences model on those data. Negative and significant coefficient
estimates imply that there was a preexisting trend.



19
  A similar argument has been made by Card (1999) to explain the large gap between
2SLS and OLS estimates on returns to education. The fact that the instrumental variables,
and thus the 2SLS estimates, are affected by the underlying heterogeneity in response to
the policy is discussed by Imbens and Angrist (1994) and emphasized by Angrist and
Krueger (2001).

                                                20
          The estimated effects on savings (not reported in the table) of this new exercise
are smaller than the corresponding estimates in Table 6, and not significantly different
from zero.20 They are NT$-9,579 for group PP, and NT$8,755, NT$8,065, NT$21,701,
and NT$11,321 for groups PS, PN, NN and F, respectively. None are statistically
significant. These results suggest that there was no between-group difference in savings
trends before the NHI reform; the differential between the control and treatment groups
arises after the 1995 reform.
          Another alternative explanation for our findings is that some change in the
economic environment other than NHI occurred and affected households in the control
and treatment groups differently. One potential candidate is the business cycle. Between
1994 and 1996 the economic growth rate in Taiwan fell by 1 percent, from 7.1 to 6.1
percent. Since economic downturns will affect households’ saving and labor supply
decisions, our treatment effects may be contaminated by economic fluctuations.
          To control for possible business-cycle effects, we include county unemployment
rates in the models. Some of the coefficients on insurance benefits become slightly
smaller but are all still significant. For example, IV estimates imply that the probability of
positive savings falls by 12.9 percent for each NT$100,000 increase in insurance benefits
and that savings fall by NT$0.75 for each NT$1 increase in insurance benefits. These
results suggest that control and treatment groups did not respond to economic fluctuations
differently and that our estimates of treatment effects may be attributed to the NHI
reform.

VI. Conclusion

          Using the dramatic expansion of health insurance programs for various groups in
Taiwan as instruments for changes in insurance benefits, we estimate the effect of social
health insurance on households’ precautionary behaviors. Using coefficients from
difference-in-differences, OLS and 2SLS model specifications, we estimate that the
introduction of National Health Insurance decreased households’ savings by 5−15 percent


20
  We also estimated the difference-in-differences model on spousal labor supply. Again,
the coefficient (0.01) is not significant (t=0.82). We do not have data on purchase of
accident insurance before 1993.

                                                  21
using difference-in-differences coefficients, 0.6−7.0 percent using OLS coefficients, and
1.3−13.8 percent using 2SLS coefficients. These results are consistent with recent studies
that have found that coverage by other social programs, such as disability insurance
(Kantor and Fishback, 1996), unemployment insurance (Engen and Gruber, 2001) and
Medicaid (Gruber and Yelowitz, 2000), are negatively associated with savings. While
there are a number of potential explanations for our results, we find the impact of the
introduction of National Health Insurance to be the most compelling explanation.
       Social health insurance may also have an impact on other precautionary
behaviors. Our evidence suggests that the introduction of National Health Insurance
significantly reduced households’ purchase of private accident insurance. The estimated
effects are sizeable: 17.6−26.7 percent (DD) and 2.8−15.8 percent (2SLS).
       Applying similar empirical specification to spousal labor supply yields no
evidence that the expansion of the NHI decreased labor force participation of secondary
earners. These results suggest that precautionary motives are not among the most
important reasons for sending other household members to work in Taiwan.
       Our study offers empirical support for the proposition that, by reducing
uncertainty about future medical expenses, the introduction of large-scale social health
insurance can substantially reduce households’ precautionary behaviors. However, the
welfare implication of the behavioral change is not clear. On one hand, the reduction of
household savings could improve welfare by increasing current consumption. If the
household increases educational expenditures, for example, the long run impact could be
beneficial to society. If the labor force participation of the secondary earners decreased,
and therefore increased the time invested in child development, the consequences could
also be favorable. However, high national saving, as well as high labor force
participation, are important contributors to a nation’s economic growth. How to balance
these conflicting objectives and how social health insurance affects welfare over time
remain unanswered. While this study provides useful data, more research is required to
assess the welfare implications and to provide more accurate guidance for policy reform.
